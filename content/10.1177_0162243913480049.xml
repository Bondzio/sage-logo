<abstract>
<p>This article looks at some common assumptions and associated work practices within a military intelligence community. There intelligence practitioners use the term “raw data” as a common sense category, as a word that describes information they want or have gained access to. The practical and organizational processes that inform the construction of the term raw data are unpacked here. Examples presented are based on interviews, field observations, and document reviews. Theoretical descriptions and models of work, for example, the intelligence cycle, construction, and the use of computer databases, assume that work in this community starts with raw data. However, this data has already been (prior) processed by the work practices, political, practical, and other decisions even before data collection occurs. The technology and attendant categories and practices instrumentalize a certain world view. The model used frames not just the collection and organization of the institution’s knowledge but those categories that inform how this institution organizes, legitimizes, and enacts its work, data, and knowledge. Given the kinds of opponents nations have to face today, intelligence practitioners and those who study their work have to understand practice, action, and contexts often quite different from ones own.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This research focuses on some common assumptions and work practices within one particular Swedish Armed Forces intelligence community. By doing so, we hope to contribute to an area, category, and practice within the intelligence community that so far has been little studied and/or researched within the science and technology studies (STS), community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243913480049">1</xref>
</sup> Dealing with different types of information in a variety of contexts and for various purposes is a central part of intelligence work. We will present a case study that seems at first glance counterintuitive. This is when intelligence practitioners use the term “raw data” as a common sense category, a word that describes information they want to or have gained access to. As an everyday term raw data is to a certain extent “invisible” and used without reflection. These practitioners seem to operate on the premise that the data they collect and receive from a variety of sources (from individuals, signals, and sensors among them) are “raw” both in origin and in essence. In effect, these practitioners assume that it is through their own interpretive labor that data become something other than raw.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162243913480049">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Whether we use the term value added or interpretive regarding what practitioners add to data is not important at this point. In fact, practitioners tend to use these two terms interchangeably. What we want to trace out is how raw data is “cooked” within the intelligence community. We discuss here the social construction of raw data and the consequences this analytical confusion between the raw and the cooked has in respect to data these practitioners use and the work they perform. In particular, some questions will be raised here about how the technology in the intelligence community facilitates (or not) the work practices that emerge from this “category confusion.” This issue, we believe, also raises a number of design and implementation issues for other work domains.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section3-0162243913480049">
<title>Intelligence Community—Challenges</title>
<p>The Military Intelligence and Security Service (MUST, Swedish acronym) within the Swedish Armed Forces is described as a knowledge organization that on behalf of Swedish government and the military’s supreme commander collects information that is then processed, analysed, and subsequently disseminated as military intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243913480049">MUST n.d.</xref>). As the Swedish intelligence document, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243913480049">Grundsyn Und08 (2008)</xref>, states, military intelligence supports military decision making on strategic, operational, and tactical levels. In addition, they work on assignments that further the country’s foreign affairs, defense, and security politics (Grundsyn Und08). Security service has a preventive approach. It works not only with assessing security threats toward Swedish Armed Forces both in Sweden and abroad but also to design and implement proactive security measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243913480049">MUST n.d.</xref>). The military intelligence community cooperates with other Swedish agencies such as the Swedish Defence Research Agency and the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, the National Defence Radio Centre. It also operates in a variety of international contexts, for example, through Swedish membership in European Union and with the United Nations (UN), in various international missions.</p>
<p>The geopolitical landscape has shifted dramatically since the Cold War and diplomatic and military activities increasingly take place in parts of the world distant from Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162243913480049">Treverton 2009</xref>). The military’s current framework suggests that Sweden’s unified armed forces need to adapt to what is commonly described as irregular warfare and unconventional operations in non-Western contexts. The main target today is believed to be an asymmetrical, stateless organizations and/or networks. This has influenced the context monitored by Sweden’s intelligence today. Events occurring in distant parts of the world, without apparent consequence for one’s own country, can now have direct effects on one’s own nation (Grundsyn Und08). This is believed to bring new challenges to the intelligence community. In addition, the military’s policy framework suggests that the military phenomena of importance are no longer of sole importance and that there now is a need to understand complex, dynamic processes and systems that have political, economic, social, and cultural dimensions in order for future operations to succeed (Grundsyn Und08). For the military community, there is, in particular, a need to obtain, understand, and employ local knowledge so as to understand the situation and context outside its own borders. The task here is to map what is “normal” and what is not in order to understand, explain, and prevent certain actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243913480049">Baisini and Nyce 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article focuses on the various practices related to the analytical work of intelligence practitioners. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243913480049">Hammond (2007)</xref> described how a structural organizational redesign of US intelligence community toward a purpose-based organization (e.g., focusing on counterterrorism) can ensure the integration and analysis of certain information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243913480049">Cooper (2005)</xref>, on the other hand, looks at behaviors and practices within the individual agencies and argues we need to rebuild the intelligence analysis from the ground up. This would include such processes as recruiting and training of analysts; a more empirical process to validate analytic products; and an institutionalized lessons-learned process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243913480049">Johnston (2005)</xref> has described the analytic work the US civilian intelligence community routinely carries out. There is no baseline standard for these analytic methods, Johnston reports. Further, he points to the accumulative impact previous analysis has on the work carried out in this community. Johnston calls this analytic work tradecraft and describes it largely as “a mysterious process learned only by the initiated and acquired only through the elaborate rituals of professional indoctrination. It also implies that the methods and techniques or analysis are informal, idiosyncratic, unverifiable, and perhaps even unexplainable” (2005, 18). Accepting this view of intelligence work leads almost inevitably to advocacy for particular kinds of workplace innovations or technological/resource redesign—some more valuable than others. If, for example, intelligence analysis is not a science, but rather an art or craft, then the intelligence community organizations and practices can be improved, this argument goes, if they turn to formal structured methods that mirror those used in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243913480049">Johnston 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162243913480049">3</xref>
</sup> This line of reasoning also assumes professionalization in the intelligence community has to follow the same “evolutionary” path as it has in science and medicine. These arguments tend to underestimate the differences in organizational structure, intellectual resources, and the end points between what goes on in science, medicine, and intelligence work. Still, some parallels exist between Johnston’s findings and what we observed. There are also some significant differences, too, because the Central Intelligence Agency is a US civil intelligence organization and the one we looked at is a Swedish military institution.<sup>

<title>Data is More than Knowledge</title>
<p>Within STS, human–computer interaction, and computer-supported cooperative work, attention has been paid to how we organize and categorize data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162243913480049">5</xref>
</sup> Data, information, and knowledge are often used concepts within system design and related areas like knowledge management (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243913480049">Davenport and Prusak 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243913480049">Knox 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243913480049">Tuomi 1999</xref>). There is, however, no definitive, accepted definition of these terms. Still, within information system disciplines, data are often seen as factual information—the basis for reasoning and discussion. Data are seen as raw materials for information. Data become information when it is structured and arranged in a particular context or relations set. Information is talked about as though it has a meaning, but no (appended) judgments. It is commonly thought that knowledge contains meaning and judgment and beliefs and commitment regarding a particular action (for an overview, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243913480049">Knox 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243913480049">Tuomi 1999</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243913480049">Knox (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243913480049">Tuomi (1999)</xref> point out, in information science it is “natural” to assume and to establish a hierarchy where data are less “loaded” than information and information less so than knowledge. In short, data are the starting point and a prerequisite for creating information while information is a prerequisite for knowledge.</p>
<p>However, this hierarchy has its problems: they are a number of prior operations that with this hierarchy tend to disappear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243913480049">Tuomi (1999)</xref>, for example, proposes a reversed hierarchy where data are created from information we have, and information emerges after we have knowledge. Data here do not exist in isolation but are created by social actors given their understanding and context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243913480049">Davenport and Prusak (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243913480049">Knox (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243913480049">Stephens (2004)</xref> emphasize that it is necessary to examine information not only as concept but also as practice. It is necessary then to pay attention to how information is defined, created, managed, and used in particular contexts.</p>
<p>Raw data are defined by the analytic model one uses, which establishes a version of the kind of world we live in. Models, in turn, reproduce and shape a particular reality (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243913480049">Geertz 1973/1993</xref>). In short, no appeal regarding the nature of the world or its categories can be made today on claims like essentialism or naturalism. Further, the concepts and meanings that legitimatize what is “real” can represent different orders and kinds of evidence and the manners in which these are reaffirmed through artifacts, everyday activities, events, properties, and social relations. The ideas, concepts, and symbols that inform everyday life are the focus of interpretive social science research. Accordingly, data are not something a priori but emerge from various social concerns and practices. It is informed by history, culture, and society, and these help define, reproduce, and shape the use of this data. What interest us here are the social and organizational conventions, values, and structures that provide the “infrastructure” through which concepts like data and information are constructed and gain legitimacy and power.</p>
<p>Practitioners themselves can seldom arrive at anything more than first-order, ad hoc approximation of an analytic perspective on these infrastructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913480049">Giddens 1979</xref>). This is because for most practitioners work does not necessarily mean having to take these categories or rationales apart. In fact, work for the intelligence practitioner, as for many other practitioners, rests on reconfirming and legitimatizing these very categories. Our task is to inventory and, where necessarily, challenge these practical understandings of central categories like the raw and the cooked, and the role they play in the work of these intelligence practitioners.</p>

<title>Research Context and Method</title>
<p>For some years, attempts have been made to provide the Swedish Armed Forces intelligence function with a clearer organizational identity and structure. This has meant bringing order to the policy documents that coordinate intelligence studies and development as well as agreeing upon a single model for production management. This, together with a number of other workplace issues and organizational concerns, has led to changes in work practices. The organizational and work redesign, including practitioners’ perceived needs, has been in process for a number of years. This effort can be studied from a number of perspectives: this research examines the dilemmas practitioners face in their organizations.</p>
<p>This three-year study of the redesign of the military intelligence function was initiated by the development section of the MUST, which initiates and coordinates research and other development initiatives for the intelligence as a function and an organization. The research was placed at Swedish National Defence College for its expertise on organizational research. While the others already worked at the College, the first author of this article was contracted for the particular study. For security reasons, her background was checked against authorities’ various registers, and she assigned a privacy and confidentiality agreement before joining the team.</p>
<p>The study used an approach borrowed from multidisciplinary and applied research approaches—ones that have much in common with issue-driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243913480049">Robinson 2008</xref>) and action research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243913480049">Checkland and Holwell 2004</xref>). They both are, in overall terms, change-oriented approaches where the researcher is involved in addressing practical issues or in solving problems in cooperation with the participating organization’s representatives. The research team worked with Swedish Armed Forces representatives to define the study’s objectives—objectives researchers and organization staff believed would have practical and scientific benefits. Such an issue-driven approach can draw attention to certain everyday practices and lead to the revision of them “on the fly.” What distinguished this project from many other action-oriented research projects are the attempts made to reduce the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. The project’s focus on common sense enacted within an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913480049">Giddens 1979</xref>) led us concentrate on implicitly held categories, beliefs, and norms and how and why they came to be accepted as “socially constructed truth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243913480049">Astley 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Researcher and practitioner brought different forms of knowledge to the project and both were actively involved in its research activities. This linkage between practice and research was achieved largely through project learning and change activities. The mutual learning that occurred between researchers and practitioner has been substantial. The co-participation of staff and researchers has meant that research results have been critiqued as the study evolved. One result was that practitioners could use these insights to spur change directly in ongoing, everyday work. This also meant that the object of study was changing as we studied it.</p>
<p>As researchers we have carried out here what may be called polymorphous engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243913480049">Gusterson 1997</xref>, 116), which means interacting with informants in diverse ways, locations, and occasions as well as collecting information eclectically from different sources, using a mix of research techniques. We conducted interviews, field observations, and document reviews. There were also several meetings, experiments, workshops, field exercises, and courses we observed and collected data from.</p>
<p>The references to interviews and data collected here however refer mainly to seven semistructured interviews conducted in spring 2009. Respondents were selected by the intelligence organization and were then contacted by the researchers to schedule the interviews. Respondents were officers (one female) within the intelligence community with various experiences of service abroad. A prestructured interview instrument was the basis for the interviews. Five were conducted in a university setting, and two took place at the intelligence organization. Each interview lasted approximately an hour. Audio recording and notes were used to document the interviews. The transcribed interview notes were corrected, completed, and approved by the interviewees. A content analysis of these interviews focused on how interviewees described their work activities. We identified several recurring categories and themes such as goal and purpose (of intelligence), structural and organizational issues, human resources, and technology (its worth and value). These interview results were cross-checked against other project data obtained from observations, documentation, and the literature.</p>
<p>Various documents and terminology are produced as part of the everyday practices within an organization and are, therefore, important elements to study. Completed just as this project began, Grundsyn Und08 is one such document. This is a policy document that introduces fundamental principles of present and future military intelligence work (Grundsyn Und08). In this article, we focus on one of the principles, that is, “Intelligence analysis at the center (of attention).” A study of this intelligence policy document reveals a number of the community’s central themes and concepts.</p>
<p>As in much anthropological work, here too data analysis and collection take place continuously over the project’s duration. Therefore, the reader should keep in mind that at least part of what is presented here as raw has been already cooked. What gave this enterprise focus was our interest in everyday life in one military intelligence community. While all “ethnography is an interpretation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243913480049">van Maanen 2001</xref>, 238), what is reported also reflects standard academic practice of “cooking” data for one’s readers. The results presented further cover only certain elements of daily life in this intelligence community (for more on the study and its results, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913480049">Persson and Nyce 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243913480049">2007b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162243913480049">
<title>Unpacking the Raw</title>
<p>The social construction of raw data is not a straightforward practice in this military intelligence community. It does not occur the same way every time. Still this article attempts to unpack the practical and organizational processes that inform (and lead to) the construction of raw data. What we want to understand is how data, especially raw data, emerge from everyday practices in this military intelligence community. In particular, we are interested in those activities that contribute to, not just hinder (which is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243913480049">Johnston (2005)</xref> focuses on) the analytic work practitioners carry out in this community.</p>
<sec id="section7-0162243913480049">
<title>Intelligence Cycle—Visualizing Work and Organization</title>
<p>But first, one has to describe how intelligence practitioners perceive their own work, work products, and the work processes that characterize the institution they belong to. Within the intelligence community, there is a theoretical model of how intelligence products are created. The intelligence cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162243913480049">Figure 1</xref>) depicts how data, information, and knowledge are processed into intelligence. This cyclical process consists of direction (planning), collection, processing, and dissemination (Grundsyn Und08).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0162243913480049-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>According to this model, intelligence work is a series of discrete steps that ultimately lead to the production and dissemination of intelligence. Each of the steps includes various activities—ones not shown in this particular illustration. All these processes of collecting, analysis, and dissemination have an impact on each other and therefore need to be coordinated. The planning phase includes, for example, design of the future work as well as directions/instructions required for collection, analysis, and dissemination. During the collection phase, information required for the subsequent analysis to answer intelligence needs is collected. Analysis is a generic term for a variety of activities involved during the processing step. These activities are intended to answer the needs of the intelligence community’s audience. Built into the intelligence cycle also is the need to communicate data. The end result of the intelligence cycle is often the production of structured reports whose value a variety of different customers can readily access and assess by their structure, content, and organization (format). Within the intelligence cycle, there is also room for customer feedback, that is, how well these reports address their requirements and needs. In short, an activity like dissemination can influence other parts of the intelligence cycle.</p>
<p>We have seen several variations on the intelligence cycle; some are more polished than others, often created with presentation software. The aspects highlighted and the level of detail vary, depending on the presenter’s intentions and the audience addressed. This model is taught to novices, and the place given to the model not just in instruction but also in daily practice helps to validate both the concept and the experts who are familiar with it. It also communicates the value of the intelligence community and its products to its clients and customers and is the model intelligence practitioners themselves use to think about their work and themselves. It also orders their work because on the “factory floor” this model is used to collaborate and coordinate work and information/product flow.</p>
<p>The intelligence cycle then models thought, practice, and dissemination within this community. However, this model, like all models, is not a neutral representation, but one that favors certain data and data acquisition processes above others. In this model, some elements of intelligence work and practice do not appear, some are overvalued, and others neglected. Also, the model’s premises are taken for granted, seldom challenged, or questioned by practitioners. In fact, what criticisms we have heard of this model tend to be with one or another element of the model, not with the model itself (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243913480049">Hulnick 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The intelligence cycle also assumes that this cycle and intelligence work itself both start with raw data. This model ignores the fact that even before this cycle begins, its data have already been processed. This model has no place for the variety of decisions and work practices that target which data (kind, target, and locale, for example) are to be collected. Acknowledged or not, all these factors inform and cook both the manner and the kind of data collected. In fact, the intelligence cycle, as often taught and perceived by practitioners, is seen as a kind of abstract, universal operation in which the particular target itself is largely irrelevant. Or the question of target quickly becomes instrumental—one about how to allocate often scarce resources so as to carry out the operations necessary to acquire certain data. The result is that in the intelligence cycle model context per se is edited out or its significance reduced to a set of operational values. Nevertheless, all these factors, whether practitioners acknowledge them or not, do inform how practitioners work, and the kinds of products they disseminate.</p>
<p>Also, the work is not performed sequentially as portrayed in the intelligence cycle. Rather all or some of its parts often “run in parallel,” that is, as simultaneous activities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913480049">Lowenthal 2011</xref>). It is easy to miss the paradox inherent in this model; that it is a cycle. A cycle by definition has neither a beginning nor an end. Still this cycle is thought to guide collection, determine its results and product, and how this is disseminated. The results then guide direction, policy, strategy, and so on. The intelligence cycle explicitly states that decisions, based on prior disseminated results, determine future collection practices. In other words, the model makes it quite clear that raw data are (always) cooked but not always the same way. But this is seldom acknowledged by practitioners.</p>

<title>Informing the Categories</title>
<p>According to the intelligence cycle, intelligence work is carried out in series of discrete steps that ultimately lead to the production and dissemination of intelligence. The results are an intelligence product, that is, various types and kinds of written and oral reports. According to the policy document Grundsyn Und08, these products both add to and make use of common knowledge base, that is, a variety of databases, experts, and knowledge centers within the intelligence organization. However, as interviewees told us, there is no institution-wide knowledge base, by this one means a single knowledge base that stores all the collected data, in all its forms, processed or not. There are also differences between national systems and those used in international contexts.</p>
<p>Interviewees reported that different technical systems exist for storing information. One, for example, includes a database in which both quantitative and qualitative data can be stored. Rather than continue with the technical characteristics of these computer systems, here we address some general issues interviewees brought up about handling qualitative data (text) and storing this data. Qualitative data are that which cannot (easily) be quantified. Examples of this include descriptions of actions and behavior, which intelligence practitioners collect a number of ways such as through interviews and/or observations.</p>
<p>Interviewees told us that qualitative data are stored mainly as free text which is tagged (categorized). These categories are visualized by the common tree and folder structure familiar to most computer users. This makes this kind of data easier to locate, retrieve, and collate. This content is both transparent and genealogical in that you can track not only the content but also the information on this content’s origin. Further, the categories and the tree structure used reflect and help specify which intelligence is of interest at one particular time, given a specific task. Also, both the categories and therefore the tree structure of the database are “optional.” They have to be applied by the user.</p>
<p>Based on interviews, there are a number of different ways to categorize and index incoming reports. Indexing and traceability are for the intelligence function important classification strategies. Interviewees told us that the categories have been taken, to some extent at least, from the document templates used to disseminate field intelligence. Therefore, this report structure also directs and aids intelligence collection since only some data, not others, some categories, and concepts, not others, can easily be entered in these templates. In this way, these data are cooked. Also, collection and collation can reflect an order from a customer, so everything else can be left out. The templates leave little or no room for other kinds of content or information. Further, certain kinds of content can be difficult to retrieve. All this limits, almost without the practitioners being aware of it, what constitutes relevant “data.” This can hamper information exchange within the organization and information sharing with other organizations and actors. In short, the use of a fixed and static report template can arbitrarily limit what is collected and how it is interpreted. As a result, one’s analysis can to a large extent be determined by what the document defines as target and the terms used there to define that target.</p>
<p>Categorizing and indexing are not always done by the person who writes up reports. This may occur because of unclear reporting objectives, the wide range and number of reports received, staff turn over, the organization’s highly rationalized structure with weak administrative capacity (little or no support staff), the lack of appropriate automated tools, flexible file structures, and little or no input or access to the organization’s databases. This suggests that the organization’s work, and information and communication practices, and division of labor, while well established, may not sufficiently reflect or enable the organization’s assignments. This raises the question whether the traditional division of work in intelligence organizations between analysts and other staff still makes sense. This also may reflect the degree of experience some staff members have in practical intelligence work. One thing interviewees stressed was the lack of continuity within the organization. They noted this can negatively influence intelligence production and assessment. This in part was because the organization’s infrastructure (its intelligence architecture) is not as consistent or task oriented as it could be. This they said had much to do with short rotation cycle of personnel which, while typical for many military/UN missions is less common in civilian enterprises.</p>
<p>Both categories and database structures used can vary within and between operations and mission areas. Interviewees reported that at times they have had to structure data and create categories for this data. They also told us that they or others have restructured existing data, that is, reformatted, resorted, or relabeled (even all three at the same time) when they have taken over from someone else an assigned task. With the current rotation system, this can mean that material potentially could be restructured in whole or in part every six months. Neither is there one standard vocabulary nor the thesaurus used to tag qualitative data (free text). For this reason, among others, interviewees said that previously collected material tends not to be reused. This material is archived or discarded to make way for new material when new staff takes over. For all these reasons, it can be difficult for the organization to compile any long-term, in-depth document corpus that staff has without additional labor and investing further time convenient access to and can regard as reliable.</p>
<p>Any database or database structure is a cultural product that reflects the classification system (explicit and implicit) of those who developed and maintain it. However, the intelligence community often has to try to understand the action and practices of those outside one’s organization, sometimes those outside one’s own country and contexts/cultures often quite different than their own. So far, though, the question to what extent can the categories and principles that apply to one’s own work and organization, derived from one’s own culture, can capture other points of views has received little attention (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243913480049">Nyce and Dekker 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Data processing (and analysis) reflects and embodies a particular <italic>weltanschauung</italic> (world view). Further, one’s technology, and its attendant categories and practices, instrumentalizes this world view. The result is that data, how they are organized and processed, reflect an ideological commitment to certain technological solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243913480049">Graves 1995</xref>). Further, while the intelligence organization’s information needs scale-up every year, the technical and practical solutions available to the organization seem outdated and do not always match the tasks at hand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162243913480049">Svensson (2008)</xref> does argue that it can be difficult to determine how a military intelligence database should be constructed: this does not mean that different kinds of alternatives should not be considered and validated in relation to the organization’s work practices and its organizational/operational rationale. What needs to be kept in mind here is that “[…] technology is physically constructed by actors working in a given social context, and technology is socially constructed by actors through the different meanings they attach to it and the various features they emphasize and use” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243913480049">Orlikowski 2001</xref>, 66).</p>

<title>Informing the Analysis</title>
<p>The policy document Grundsyn Und08 describes the fundamental principles of the intelligence function. One of these is Intelligence analysis at the center (of attention). This principle informs activity and organizational end points, that is, what is given preference for analysis, requires certain technologies (and defines their capabilities) and structures intelligence work itself by favoring certain methods over others.</p>
<p>Intelligence analysis at the center is not just an ideological principle. It defines which elements of intelligence work are the most important, and interviewees stressed the role that analysis played in their work. This may, in part, reflect a recent shift in the priorities of the organization we studied. We often heard during the study that previously data collection and processing activities were stressed more than data analysis. This was not to say that collection matters less now, but rather there has been a shift of focus within the service toward more distinct collection and, for example, analysis combining multiple sources. This institutional shift has changed what is taken to be knowledge, how its validity is assessed as well as how the kinds of interaction objects (“things” created in intelligence work and things staff interact with) are valued and produced daily.</p>
<p>The principle Intelligence analysis at the center suggests the relevant staff have access to the organization’s knowledge base and that this knowledge should be accessible and traceable (Grundsyn Und08), which could increase intelligence analysis quality. What is meant by the necessary knowledge (and access) depends on context, rank, and task. It is important to keep in mind that this is a military organization and rank and expertise are assumed “to go together.” This assumption, however, has had some unanticipated and potentially negatives effects when it comes to intelligence work. Interviewees told us that data access today is regulated by affiliation and hierarchy. The higher up one is in the military hierarchy, the more data and data domains he or she will be able to access, and some data may only be available through one’s superiors. More open access could increase the value of the kinds of analysis staff carry out. If this were the case, this would add value to both the analysis and the data itself, one interviewee argued. However, sharing the same access point and the same material may not necessarily lead, nor should it lead (for obvious reasons), to a common (tactical/operational) <italic>picture of situation</italic>. However, open access to the same material could lead an analyst in more nuanced directions as each analyst makes his or her interpretations of data depending on his or her experience, knowledge, situation, and intelligence requirements.</p>
<p>Interviewees pointed out that the staff who collect data do not always know its intended use. Often the link between individual retrieval needs and the “bigger picture” especially, the political context, is lacking. While security can be a reason for this, still among interviewees there is a sense that if the staff had a more complete situation picture, this could direct the work practices and therefore increase the value of what the organization produces. Being politically or ideologically correct, staff said, has also influenced, even at times biased the concepts, categories, and structures analysts have to use. Because the intelligence community, like most state institutions in Sweden, reflects a certain political (based on social democracy) agenda, some vocabularies and rhetorics are more possible and acceptable than others. This is particularly true when referring to minorities, less developed nations, and cultures further away from Northern countries. The terms and categories we use are not plain words but reflect the values and norms of the world we live and participate in. All these factors can diminish both the data and the subsequent analytic work. The tools and resources, we are also told, have to make it easier for staff to handle higher-order issues like context and cause effect.</p>
<p>The social construction of raw data in an intelligence organization is not straightforward. It reflects current administrative and political concerns and is also informed by the organization’s history and traditions. What structures everyday practices here cannot be reduced to the acts of any one individual. Rather, how data are defined and used reflect an institutional context—one that extends outside the organization itself to national and even international factors or variables.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article attempts to unpack the practical and organizational processes that inform (and lead to) the construction of raw data in the Swedish military intelligence community. Visualizing work and organization through the intelligence cycle, categorizing and indexing practices while dealing with qualitative data processing and the aspects that inform the analysis are described as examples on how data are created by social actors, given their understanding and circumstances (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243913480049">Davenport and Prusak 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243913480049">Knox 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243913480049">Stephens 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis follows the idea that at the heart of work, interpretation and analysis within any organization are a set of models and structures (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243913480049">Geertz 1973/1993</xref>). Further, because these models represent the world as it is, should be, or both, these are often self-evident or logical. They are seldom challenged by those who work within that organization. Intelligence practitioners rely on these models and structures and the vocabularies and rhetorics that stem from them to get work done. In turn, the use of these structures not only replicates but also reconfirms the validity of their own practices and those of the organization they belong to. While all this helps us to organize and carry out the work that gives an institution its “raison d’être,” this means that we can, without even being aware of it, use our own categories to make sense of somebody else’s world. However, to collect information and analyze it with the aim to understand action and practices outside one’s own organization and one’s country and culture, as the intelligence practitioners often do, it is necessary to take into account not only one’s own terms of references but those of others. Given how intelligence practitioners regard evidence and how this is reinforced by the tools and resources they produce knowledge with, the result is that practitioners tend to treat the artifacts and actions of culture and society both as a variety (and collection) of facts.</p>
<p>However, once pointed out to them, practitioners can help us critique these models and the assumptions that inform them. It is difficult, however, for practitioners to acknowledge that these models “go down” all the way, that is, help constitute institutional/organizational reality throughout the organization. This is because these models frame not just an organization’s work practices but also the categories that inform how an institution structures and legitimizes its work and its products. As the intelligence community continues to modernize to meet new challenges, resistance to innovation and change can emerge from unexpected places. For this reason, for an intelligence organization to continue to be relevant and to perform the tasks assigned to it, researchers need to focus more on how an organization like this thinks about itself, its clients, and the world in which it operates in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243913480049">Douglas 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, within the intelligence community, little attention so far has been given to how to “institutionalize” problems related to culture and society. In fact, what has been employed to address issues of cultural differences ironically tends to reinforce our own biases and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243913480049">Nyce and Dekker 2010</xref>). To learn to treat “soft factors” as legitimate variables, intelligence practitioners may have to do several things. To start, it would be useful for them to reconsider the epistemological and organization value raw data have in their work practices and products. To do this, practitioners will have to add to their analytic toolbox the means to link data or evidence to issues like agency and structure. This could help practitioners to bridge the gap between the habitus of the intelligence world and best practice in the social sciences. Until this is done, it will be difficult for intelligence practitioners to understand and assess those elements and relationships that characterize other societies and to assess their strategic, operational, and tactical value. As for designers and developers, so far this community’s vendors and suppliers have shown little interest in what makes technological and organizational resources seem attractive to end users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162243913480049">Räsänen and Nyce 2008</xref>). For this community, we need to ask to what extent are these resources congruent with the institution’s priorities and the work carried out there.</p>
<p>The various visualizations of work and organization, such as the intelligence cycle, raise other issues to be addressed in future research. If the intelligence cycle is a valid model of work and knowledge processes in the intelligence community, should we reduce or increase the kinds and numbers of resources practitioners have on hand to carry out their work? A related question is whether this model gives certain data more epistemological value than others. If it does, can this undercut analytic work these practitioners perform? Things that are taken for granted in the organizational and staff practice make it difficult for both practitioners and researchers to track issues like these. Further, if designers take this model together with the practitioners’ words at face value, what gets built for the intelligence community can be informed by nothing more than ad hoc, often retrospective generalizations. As such, these are at least several removes from any kind of analytically informed understanding of one’s informant’s work practices. This raises a more general research question: to what extent do the workplace beliefs or assumptions need to be challenged?</p>
<p>Also topics related to organizational inscription and culture cannot be reduced to some ideological commitment that researchers and practitioners need to work together ostensibly as equals. Such “blind” commitments can finesse rather than enable the analysis of matters important in any organization. Issue-driven interdisciplinarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243913480049">Robinson 2008</xref>) and action research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243913480049">Andersen and Gamdrup 1994</xref>) can through mutual cooperation increase the reliable knowledge available to the institutions that wish to change. In such activities, the mutual learning that occurs between researchers and practitioners can be substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243913480049">Andersen and Gamdrup 1994</xref>), especially when research issues are defined collaboratively by clients and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243913480049">Patel and Tibelius 1987</xref>). The challenge is to balance action research’s emphasis on creating change with the kinds of theoretical and empirical advance typically associated with science.</p>

<p>Data collection, visualization, and analysis are common activities in many work situations and organizations (e.g., physicians, pilots, and intelligence analysts). These activities today are often supported by information and communication technology. Irrespective of how central these practices and technologies have become in the modern workplace, we as practitioners or researchers seldom reflect upon or question categories like data that inform this work or the values attributed to the categories (like “raw”). Not that we have studied very closely the work performed on these categories. Nor have we thought much about the epistemological or ontological status of these categories or the operations informed or defined by them. This can change once we acknowledge the extent to which information and communication technologies can shape everyday practices for individuals and societies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243913480049">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243913480049">Bratteteig 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243913480049">Löwgren and Stolterman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162243913480049">Stolterman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243913480049">Wajcman 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The reader should keep in mind that the arguments and conclusions are interpreted in the light of the present research and the specific circumstances within the Swedish military intelligence community.

<p>Much of this emerges from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243913480049">Nardi and Millers’ (1991)</xref> initial research on spreadsheets. The result is that while this research looks at workplace-specific practices related to categorization, little time is spent looking at the epistemological or ontological status granted to these categories or how these are achieved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243913480049">Bowker and Starr (1999)</xref> have added to the literature on categorization by pointing out that classification schemes are ordinarily invisible, organized, and embedded into objects that shape workplace categories and practice. However, this research has tended to be pragmatic and little attention has been paid to the higher-order issues discussed here. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243913480049">Berg (1997)</xref> criticizes the literature on just this point, research and design activities intended to support workplace practice have for the most part continued to take workplace practices and categories at face value. This is to say the necessary archaeology, characteristic of strong ethnography, has seldom been performed on them. However, the emerging feminist technoscience is attempting to go beyond calling for an examination of how various categories are constructed. This tradition is looking at how these categories come into being and the consequences this has for the actors concerned (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243913480049">Barad 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913480049">Suchman 2007</xref>).</p>
