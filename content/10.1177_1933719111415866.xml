<abstract>
<p>Although an association exists between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and spontaneous miscarriage, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. In this study, PCBs content in plasma was detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and decidua tissues were examined for the expression of globular heads of C1q receptor (gC1qR) using Western blot in patients who underwent induced abortion and spontaneous abortion. Results showed increased PCBs content and gC1qR expression in patients who experienced spontaneous abortion. In vitro, Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly higher caspase 3 expression and apoptotic cell counts in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-gC1qR vector group. Additionally, gC1qR and caspase 3 showed decreased expression following PCBs plus gC1qR small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased in cells treated with PCBs alone or PCB plus negative siRNA. These data suggest that maternal exposure to PCBs is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and that upregulation of gC1qR is important for PCBs-mediated trophoblast cell apoptosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At present in our environment, there has been growing concern about the adverse effect of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on reproductive health in human and wild life. Various endocrine disruptors, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD), methoxychlor, bisphenol A (BPA), and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs), released into the environment show estrogenic properties and exert effects by mimicking endogenous mechanism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111415866">1</xref>
</sup> 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin, a ubiquitous environmental contaminants, is associated with increased fetal loss and reduced birth weight in animal studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111415866">2</xref>
</sup>; methoxychlor reduces fertility in male rats by reducing the weight of seminal vesicle, serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone,<sup>

</sup> and ovarian atrophy and decreases the ability of ovarian cells to synthesize and secrete hormones in female rats.<sup>

</sup>Bisphenol A is a potential endocrine disruptor, which causes a reversible damage on testicular development and spermatogenesis in rats and mice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111415866">6</xref>
</sup> Among them, Co-PCBs are among the most widespread and persistent pollutants in the global environment; additionally, they have been demonstrated to cause endocrine disruption in animals and humans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111415866">7</xref>
</sup> Polychlorinated biphenyls can be estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, or antiandrogenic and have been associated with decreased litter size and increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or foetal resorption in mice, rats, rhesus monkeys, mink, and cattle experimentally exposed to PCBs. In human, maternal exposure to PCBs has been associated with increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111415866">8</xref>
</sup> Further, higher proportions of spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery were reported in women who were exposed to PCBs and dioxin from a chemical plant in Chapayevsk, Russia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111415866">9</xref>
</sup> Investigators have reported that 3,3,4-tetrachlorobipherryl (IUPAC number PCB-77), 3,3,4,4,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), and 3,3,4,4,5,5-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-169) produce the following toxic and biological effects in some species of animals: body weight loss, dermal disorder, reproductive toxicity, and immunotoxicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111415866">10</xref>
</sup> The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate the mechanisms behind PCBs exposure and spontaneous abortion.</p>
<p>The complement system has been characterized extensively, both biochemically and functionally. The primary role of C1q is that of recognition and activation signal that triggers the classical pathway of complement; however, it can itself function as a potent extracellular signal for a wide range of cells resulting in the induction of ligand-specific biologic responses. These responses are, by large, mediated by at least 2 expressed cell surface adaptor molecules, collagen tail receptor of C1q (cC1qR) and globular heads receptor of C1q (gC1qR). Globular heads receptor of C1q is a ubiquitous and highly anionic 33-kDa cellular protein, which was initially identified as a protein of the mitochondrial matrix.<sup>

</sup> The C1q-gC1qR complex mediates a number of biologic responses including inflammation, infection, and immune regulation<sup>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1933719111415866">
<title>Reagents</title>
<p>Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California). Phototope-HRP Western Blot Detection System, which included anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), HRP-linked antibody, biotinylated protein ladder, 20X LumiGLO Reagent, and 20X peroxide was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, Massachusetts). Propidium iodide flow cytometry assay kit was purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-human gC1qR, caspase 3, and procaspase-3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California) and Cell Signaling Technology. Cell culture supplies were purchased from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, Maryland). Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were of analytical grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719111415866">
<title>Participants and Sampling</title>
<p>Between October 2005 and January 2009, we recruited women who underwent induced abortion and spontaneous abortion at Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital. All women were asked about the number of previous miscarriages, the number of stillbirths, and the total number of previous pregnancies and had decidual tissue and blood sample drawn. The same questionnaire was translated to the native languages and used for participants from Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital. The study included the participants born in the same country as well as those aged above 18 years.</p>
<p>Ethical approval was granted by Ethical Committee of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital in Nanjing. All patients had given informed consent for the collection of tissues and blood samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719111415866">
<title>Tissue and Plasma Procurement and Preparation</title>
<p>Human decidual tissue specimens were obtained from women (n = 30) without abnormal gynecologic history at 6 to 8 weeks of gestation, who wanted to have an induced abortion (control group). Their average age was 27.8 years and average gestational age was 56.6 days. Live pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound scan. Women (n = 30) with unexplained vaginal bleeding at 6 to 8 weeks of gestation, who confirmed pregnancy loss by ultrasound scan were considered spontaneous abortion group. Their average age was 28.8 years and average gestational age was 56.4 days. All of the women had a regular menstrual cycle and gestational age, based on the last menstrual period, and confirmed by ultrasound scan.</p>
<p>Decidual tissues were collected from healthy women undergoing suction termination of pregnancy (6-8 weeks) for nonmedical reason; all materials from the suction curettage procedure were collected. The decidual tissue from first-trimester pregnancies was carefully dissected free of attached placental or myometrial tissue as well as visible blood clots and then washed twice in 0.9% NaCl, as soon as the deciduas were removed from uterus. Samples were stored at −80°C and later processed for the extraction of tissue protein.</p>
<p>Blood samples from the pregnant women were drawn from a cubital vein into 10-mL vacuum tubes for serum collection without additives. After cooling to room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged at 4000<italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes. Sera were frozen at −80°C for later analysis of Co-PCBs.</p>

<sec id="section6-1933719111415866">
<title>Determination of Co-PCBs</title>
<p>Coplanar PCBs were analyzed according to a modified method of Croley et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111415866">16</xref>
</sup> Dioxin-containing lipid was separated from blood by combining it with saturated ammonium sulfate, followed by ethanol, after which the lipid was extracted with hexane twice. The pooled hexane fraction was then washed twice with a 2% NaCl solution. Following this, the hexane layer was dehydrated with Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated. The extracted lipid was weighed.</p>
<p>The lipid fraction and the hexane fraction treatment with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were dissolved in 3 mL hexane and subjected to a cleanup process. Sample dissolved in nonane were subjected to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analytical conditions were as follows: analysis of PCBs was performed using high-resolution GC/MS with a HP-6890 (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California) spectrometer with a DB-5MS fused silica capillary column (0.32-mm internal diameter × 60 m, J and W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) coupled to a JMS-700 (JEOL, Japan) mass spectrometer employing the EI (Electron Impact)-SIM (selected ion monitoring) method at 10 000 resolutions. To determine the recovery rate of PCBs, 1 mL of serum was added with 50 μL internal standard methanol solution containing 20 ng of <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111415866">13</xref>
</sup>C<sub>12</sub>-labeled PCB congener and that external standard was performed by the addition of unlabeled PCB congener to blank serum. The standard curve was corrected for the original content of PCB congener in the blank serum. After the addition of the standards, the serum was stored at 4°C overnight.</p>
<p>The concentration of PCB congeners was shown on a fat basis, after which toxic equivalency quantity (TEQ) was calculated using WHO toxic equivalency factor (TEF) value; TEFs have been developed for the various congeners of PCBs. In this study, value under the detection limits is reported as zero. The samples were analyzed in duplicate and the samples were reanalyzed a third time if the difference between the 2 determinations was higher than 30%. However, at concentrations below 0.2 ng/mL an absolute deviation of 0.1 ng/mL between the duplicate samples was allowed. After the third analysis, the 2 determinations fulfilling the above criteria were chosen. If none of the determinations fulfilled the criteria, the sample was analyzed a fourth time.</p>

<title>HTR-8/SVneo Trophoblast Cell Line Culture and DNA Transfection</title>
<p>HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco-Modified Eagle Medium/Ham F-12 medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5 μg/mL insulin in a incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells used in this study were from passages between 5 and 7. Globular heads of C1q receptor complementary DNA (cDNA) was constructed in frame in the <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Eco</italic>RI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Next, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-gC1qR vector was transfected into trophoblast cells following the vendor’s protocol. First, 500 pmol of GFP-gC1qR vector and Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μL) were diluted separately in 750 μL of OptiMEM (Life Technologies). After a 45-minute preincubation at 37°C, the solutions were mixed and incubated for an additional 15 minutes at room temperature. The Lipofectamine 2000/GFP-gC1qR vector mixture was subsequently overlaid onto trophoblast cells and incubated for 2 hours. Finally, 1 mL of growth media supplemented with 20%, fetal calf serum (FCS) was added to each well. All transfection experiments were performed 3 times.</p>

<sec id="section8-1933719111415866">
<title>Construction of gC1qR Small Interfering RNA–Expressing Plasmid Vector</title>
<p>We designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target the 408 to 426 portion of human gC1qR messenger RNA (mRNA); the forward sequence was 5′-AAC AAC AGC AUC CCA CCA ACA UU-3′. Using pGenesil 1 as the vector backbone, gC1qR siRNA-expressing plasmids were constructed using <italic>GFP</italic> as the reporter gene. Near the 5′ end of the 2 oligonucleotides, a <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII restriction site overhangs; a 6 nucleotide poly(T) tract recognized as a RNA pol III termination signal is located at the 3′ end of the siRNA template. The siRNA was synthesized, annealed, and ligated into the <italic>Bam</italic>H I and <italic>Hin</italic>d III restriction sites of the pGenesil 1 expression vector. A vector containing siRNA for an unrelated gene was used as a negative control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1933719111415866">
<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Following treatments, HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells were collected with sample buffer and incubated in lysis buffer containing NaCl 150 mmol/L, Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> 1 mmol/L, NaF 50 mmol/L, 1% Triton X-100, EDTA 1 mmol/L, PMSF 1 mmol/L, 10% glycerol, Tris-HCl 20 mmol/L (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitor mixtures for 30 minutes on ice. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 13 000<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 15 minutes. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg per lane) were separated using 10% to 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were then blocked for 1 hour in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline Tween ([PBST] PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western Detection System.</p>
<p>Bandleader software was used for gray-scale scanning of Western blot bands. The relative protein level was calculated according to the following formula: relative content of protein = (gray scale of the target protein band − background gray scale)/(gray scale of the actin protein band-background gray scale).</p>

<sec id="section10-1933719111415866">
<title>Detection of Apoptotic Cells</title>
<p>Propidium iodide staining was utilized to detect apoptotic HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells. After specified treatments, HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 400 μL of binding buffer (CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5 mmol/L, HEPES 10 mmol/L, pH 7.4, NaCl 140 mmol/L). Then staining with 5 μg/mL propidium iodide (5 μL) and incubating for 10 minutes at room temperature, the DNA content of the cells was analyzed by a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. Apoptotic cells were quantitated using the percentage of cells with subG1 DNA content. The samples were analyzed 3 times and displayed from a representative experiment.</p>

<title>Coplanar PCBs Content in Human Plasma and gC1qR Expression in Decidua Tissues From Induced and Spontaneous Abortion Patients</title>
<p>In this experiment, we detected the content of the PCB congeners PCB-77, PCB-126, and PCB-169 in plasma samples taken from patients who underwent either induced abortion or spontaneous abortion; Co-PCBs content was determined by GC-MS. Higher Co-PCBs levels were found in plasma samples from spontaneous abortion patients as compared to plasma samples from induced abortion patients. Further, the highest concentration of PCB-126 was detected in plasma samples from spontaneous abortion patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111415866">Table 1</xref>). Concurrently, we also assessed gC1qR protein levels in decidua tissues from patients who underwent induced or spontaneous abortion. Western blot analysis found gC1qR expression in induced abortion patients and spontaneous abortion patients to be 0.45 ± 0.02 and 0.77 ± 0.03, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111415866">Figure 1</xref>). The increased gC1qR expression in decidua tissues taken from instances of spontaneous abortion was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) compared to tissues taken from cases of induced abortion. These present findings suggest that plasma Co-PCBs content and decidua gC1qR expression may be associated with spontaneous abortion.</p>

<title>Differing Concentrations of PCBs Induce gC1q1R Protein Expression in HTR-8/SVneo Trophoblast Cells</title>
<p>To explore the effect of PCBs on gC1qR protein expression, HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells were exposed to varied concentrations of PCBs congeners in vitro. The gC1qR protein levels in response to PCBs1 (40 μmol/L), PCBs2 (60 μmol/L), PCBs3 (80 μmol/L), PCBs4 (100 μmol/L), and PCBs5 (120 μmol/L) were 0.21 ± 0.02, 0.42 ± 0.01, 0.61 ± 0.03, 0.84 ± 0.03, and 0.94 ± 0.04, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111415866">Figure 2</xref>). We noted a tendency toward higher gC1qR expression in accordance with increasing concentrations of PCBs. Although treatment with 120 μmol/L PCBs induced the highest gC1qR expression, the lower concentration of 60 μmol/L PCBs was used in subsequent experiments.</p>

<title>Forced Expression of gC1qR Induces Apoptosis in Trophoblast Cells</title>
<p>To investigate whether cellular gC1qR expression could induce apoptosis, the apoptotic death of HTR-8/SVneo cells was assessed. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with plain medium, empty vector, GFP-gC1qR vector, gC1qR siRNA, or negative siRNA; cells were then lysed and examined for both the active and the inactive forms of caspase 3 using Western blots. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111415866">Figure 3A</xref>, procaspase 3 expression decreased, while expression of the active form of caspase 3 significantly increased in GFP-gC1qR vector group as compared to empty vector group. However, in the gC1qR siRNA group, procaspase 3 expression and the active form of caspase 3 has not change when compared to the negative siRNA group. For further analysis, the HTR-8/SVneo cells were subjected to flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111415866">Figure 3B</xref> shows that forced expression of gC1qR increased the number of subG1 HTR-8/SVneo cells in GFP-gC1qR group. However, the number of subG1 cells in the gC1qR siRNA-transfected group slightly decreased in comparison to HTR-8/SVneo cells transformed with negative siRNA (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Taken together, these findings indicate that gC1qR overexpression may induce trophoblast cell apoptosis.</p>

<title>Globular Heads of C1q Receptor siRNA Reverses PCB-Induced Trophoblast Cell Apoptosis</title>
<p>For these studies, we used siRNA to evaluate whether the knockdown of gC1qR could reverse PCB-induced apoptosis in HTR-8/SVneo cells. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with PCBs, PCBs + negative siRNA, and PCBs + siRNA gC1qR for the indicated periods of time. Western blot analysis showed that siRNA knocked down gC1qR expression by 72.7%, when compared to the PCBs + negative siRNA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111415866">Figure 4A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111415866">Figure 4B</xref>, Western blot analysis demonstrated decreased expression of procaspase 3 and significantly increased the expression of caspase 3 in PCBs alone and in PCBs + negative siRNA when compared to PCBs + siRNA gC1qR. Significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) were noted in the PCBs alone group and in the PCBs + negative siRNA group; the PCB plus siRNA-gC1qR group significantly decreased the production of active caspase 3 compared with the PCB alone group and in the PCBs + negative siRNA group. Flow cytometric analysis of treated HTR-8/SVneo cells showed higher levels of apoptosis in the PCBs and PCBs + negative siRNA groups; whereas the number of apoptotic cells markedly decreased in the PCBs + siRNA gC1qR group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111415866">Figure 4C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is controversial whether maternal exposure to PCBs and dioxins is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans. A number of studies do not support an association between PCBs exposure and risk of spontaneous abortion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111415866">17</xref>
</sup> Instead, these findings support an association between the risk of spontaneous abortion and both maternal age at conception and age at menarche. However, as many as 30% of pregnancies end in miscarriage,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111415866">18</xref>
</sup> and 30% to 50% of miscarriages are considered idiopathic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111415866">19</xref>
</sup> Despite the controversy, our findings support that exposure to chemical substances is an important factor in spontaneous abortions in women. Although production of PCBs has ceased, PCBs have been widely dispersed throughout the environment. Polychlorinated biphenyls are very stable, bioaccumulate in the food chain and are occurring in relatively high concentrations in fatty fish and sea mammals, and exhibit long half-lives in the body.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111415866">20</xref>
</sup> Polychlorinated biphenyls or similar chemicals can interfere with any number of reproduction functions; for example, our results demonstrate higher rates of abortion with higher maternal Co-PCBs content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111415866">Figure 1</xref>). There is an association between exposure to Co-PCBs and spontaneous abortion, which is in agreement with other studies, showing an association between PCBs exposure and fetal loss.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111415866">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that PCB-associated spontaneous miscarriage is related to the ability of PCBs to induce gC1qR expression in trophoblasts, which in turn mediates trophoblast cell apoptosis. Globular heads of C1q receptor is a multicompartmental and multifunctional cellular protein that is expressed on a wide range of tissues and cell types including lymphocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and platelets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111415866">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111415866">23</xref>
</sup> In addition to being involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111415866">24</xref>
</sup> cC1qR may also be involved in apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111415866">25</xref>
</sup> In the present study, we report that PCBs-induced gC1qR was associated with apoptosis in trophoblast cells. Results showed that gC1qR protein increased in response to treatment with PCB concentrations ranging from 40 to 120 μmol/L, and gC1qR expression increased in a dose-dependant manner. Globular heads of C1q receptor protein expression reached a maximum level in response to the highest concentration of PCBs (120 μmol/L); however, we chose a lower concentration of PCBs (60 μmol/L) in subsequent experiments to mimic low-level environmental maternal exposure. In the present study, we report that PCB-induced gC1qR was associated with apoptosis in trophoblast cells.</p>
<p>The list of biologic responses mediated by gC1qR is extensive, and gC1qR functions play major roles in inflammation, infection, and immune regulation (see Supplement Figures 2).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111415866">26</xref>
</sup> For example, gC1qR is involved in phagocytosis and the uptake of apoptotic macrophage cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111415866">27</xref>
</sup> When constitutively expressed in a normal murine fibroblast cell line, gC1qR induces growth perturbation, morphological abnormalities, and initiates apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111415866">28</xref>
</sup> Our studies found that when gC1qR is overexpressed in trophoblast cells, increased rates of apoptosis were observed. However, recent cohort studies have shown that in certain cancer cells, the expression of gC1qR can be targeted with gC1qR-binding peptides, which makes gC1qR a potential target for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111415866">29</xref>
</sup> Further, our results revealed that gC1qR overexpressing trophoblast cells induce caspase 3 expression and undergo apoptosis; and the formation of apoptotic body of trophoblast cell was also observed in our study (see Supplement Figures 1 and Supplement Figures 3).</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that gC1qR plays an important role in PCB-induced trophoblast cell apoptosis depending on its level of expression and that upregulation of gC1qR is importance for PCB-mediated trophoblast cell apoptosis. And if validated approaches for the prevention of the pathologic processes mediated by gC1qR are to be attempted, then the veracity of the in vitro studies described in present data would have to be validated in the future, using suitable animal models in which either the gene is completely deleted or the gene-specific silence is realized.</p>
