<abstract>
<p>Although previous authors have offered persuasive arguments about the salience of race in the scholastic enterprise, colorism remains a relatively underexplored concept. This article augments considerations of social forces by exploring how color classifications within racial arrangements frame pathways for communities of color and, therefore, must inform educational inquiries. Consistent with the rich tradition of ethnic studies, I draw on sources in the humanities, legal profession, and social sciences to demonstrate how colorism surfaces in lived experiences. The African American community is used as an exemplar for illustrating historical foundations of color bias, discussing implications of complexion difference, and offering suggestions for scholarship that advances educational research agendas.</p>

<p>Race doggedly frames educational outcomes and experiences, such as the achievement gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013189X12469998">Ferguson, 2007</xref>), disciplinary disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X12469998">Civil Rights Project, 2000</xref>), special education placements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X12469998">Harry &amp; Klingner, 2006</xref>), and dropout rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0013189X12469998">National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2011</xref>). Yet, despite the influence of skin tone on life outcomes, particularly in communities of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X12469998">Hall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0013189X12469998">Russell, Wilson, Hall, 1992</xref>), educational researchers generally do not conceptualize or construct inquiries to attend to nuances within the same racial group. As educators labor to promote equity, studies that tackle intersectionality across multiple forms of difference offer the greatest promise for uncovering fresh insights and identifying practical steps to remedy old challenges.</p>
<p>The current article offers a case for increasing the prominence of colorism in educational investigations because, as I will demonstrate, fixing a traditional racial lens on social problems is grossly limited and prevents researchers from substantially advancing the research frontier. Long-standing methodologies generally fail to capture the implications of skin color variation among African Americans with meaningful precision. As a consequence, existing conclusions tend to rest on a light-dark binary—a crude distinction that may foreground propositions that are specific to individuals whose coloring resides at the extreme ends of the pigmentation continuum. Educational researchers know relatively little about how prior conclusions may shift if sound gradations were infused (e.g., descriptions of very light, light, medium, dark, very dark complexions). Interrupting traditional binary approaches, in fact, has uncovered valuable insights in colorist studies of Blacks from other disciplines (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013189X12469998">Goldsmith, Hamilton, &amp; Darity, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0013189X12469998">Wilder &amp; Cain, 2011</xref>) and with other communities of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0013189X12469998">Rondilla &amp; Spickard, 2007</xref>). Educational researchers would be wise to use such models as a guide for their own work.</p>
<p>Situating educational phenomena within the interlocking frameworks of racial constructions, racism, and color bias will place theories, policies, and data-based patterns in the appropriate sociohistorical context, help unravel the complexity of enduring problems, and disrupt simplistic perceptions that diminish the influence of the color complex. Certainly, findings on gender issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013189X12469998">Griffin &amp; Reddick, 2011</xref>), globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0013189X12469998">Waters, 1999</xref>), workplace dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013189X12469998">Brockenbrough, 2012</xref>), queer identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013189X12469998">Brockenbrough, 2011</xref>), and interracial marriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0013189X12469998">Pew Research Center, 2012</xref>), among other areas, support the need to further investigate the richness of Black experiences and generate empirical findings that speak to race-related operatives. For instance, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0013189X12469998">Lareau’s (2003)</xref> study on Black and White families demonstrates, child-rearing practices for middle-class Black children may harmonize with experiences among middle-class White youth to a greater degree than they mirror the upbringing of low-income Black children. Examples include trends in language development, structured versus unstructured recreation time, and responses to adult authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013189X12469998">Lareau, 2002</xref>). While studies, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013189X12469998">Lareau’s (2002)</xref> work, illustrate connections between race and social class, they spark additional questions about correlations between race, socioeconomic status, and skin color, as light-complexioned African Americans often benefit from discriminatory practices that position them to become “middle class” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X12469998">Allen, Telles, &amp; Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013189X12469998">Hill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X12469998">M. Hunter, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013189X12469998">2007</xref>) especially as related to hiring and promotion decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013189X12469998">Harrison &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013189X12469998">Keith and Herring (1991)</xref> documented that personal incomes among “very light” Blacks were nearly 65% higher than those among “very dark” Blacks in their study of intraracial stratification. Elevated incomes also corresponded with more prestigious occupations and advanced levels of education among light-complected participants. Because such outcomes proceed from African Americans’ social history (Frazier, 1957/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X12469998">1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X12469998">Hoschild, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0013189X12469998">Seltzer &amp; Smith, 1991</xref>), excising studies from colorist analyses detaches scholarship from its proper (and necessary) context.</p>
<p>The present article addresses several concerns. First, I operationalize colorism and discuss the construct’s iterations among African Americans in the United States. While the concept is hardly confined to African Americans or U.S. borders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X12469998">Fergus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X12469998">Gomez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0013189X12469998">Perry, 2006</xref>), African Americans in the United States are a useful prototype for elucidating conscious and unconscious bias between and within racial categories. Second, I synthesize historical and contemporary research to provide a foundational understanding of how colorism surfaces and becomes consequential in African American life. Illustrations are drawn from a wide range of disciplines to illuminate the far-reaching effects of color-struck proclivities and to support the call for subsequent recommendations in educational research. Third, I outline the interest convergence principle, an element of critical race theory (CRT). Although CRT is an invaluable means of understanding African Americans’ experiences in the United States, the framework should be revisited to include additional clarity on how racial nuances operate. Next, I present several specific areas for research that will enhance knowledge about Black populations. The concluding remarks include additional suggestions for applying the article’s propositions.</p>
<p>In selecting African Americans as a model, it is not my intention to target communal perceptions or practices for special reproach; in fact, fallacious claims that light skin is “better” than dark skin exist globally. Skin whitening and bleaching products, for instance, are a lucrative segment of the beauty industry domestically and abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0013189X12469998">Puri, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0013189X12469998">Rondilla &amp; Spickard, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013189X12469998">1</xref></sup> The longevity of color as a legal and social mediator for African Americans, however, positions the community as an ideal archetype for grasping how color representations shape critical issues in research.</p>

<title>Operationalizing Colorism</title>
<p>Colorism existed for decades as a well-known but unnamed—at least in “scholarly” terms—phenomenon in the African American community. From a social science standpoint, colorism is a system of prejudice that is generally mediated by skin tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0013189X12469998">Maddox &amp; Gray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0013189X12469998">Russell et al., 1992</xref>), although the construct may also encompass characteristics such as hair texture, hair color, nose shape, eye color, lip width, body type, and vocal expression (e.g., voice tone, language, cadence). Additionally, color-based leanings may be uni- or multidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X12469998">Hoschild, 2006</xref>), although scholars generally note that colorism typically privileges light-complexioned people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013189X12469998">M. Hunter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0013189X12469998">Wilder &amp; Cain, 2011</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013189X12469998">Jones (2000)</xref> writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>intraracial colorism occurs when a member of one racial group makes a distinction based upon skin color between members of her own race. Thus, when elite Black social clubs denied membership to applicants who were too dark in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they were practicing intraracial colorism. Interracial colorism occurs when a member of one racial group makes a distinction based upon skin color between members of another racial group. For example, a White Hollywood producer might make casting choices between Whoopi Goldberg and Halle Berry on the basis of skin color. (pp. 1498-1499)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The color complex differs from other exhibitions of discrimination, such as racism, because prejudiced conduct and partiality exists between, as well as within, racial and ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013189X12469998">2</xref></sup> (For a succinct overview of skin color discrimination in America, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X12469998">Hall, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Artistic representations frequently serve as the vehicle for capturing colorist activity, as movies (e.g., <italic>Pinky</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0013189X12469998">Zanuck, 1949</xref>], <italic>School Daze</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013189X12469998">Lee &amp; Blake, Jones, Lee, &amp; Ross, 1988</xref>]), documentaries (e.g., <italic>Dark Girls</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X12469998">Berry &amp; Berry &amp; Duke, 2011</xref>], <italic>Street Fight</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X12469998">Curry, 2005</xref>]), literary works (e.g., <italic>Tar Baby</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0013189X12469998">Morrison, 1981</xref>; <italic>Their Eyes Were Watching God</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013189X12469998">Hurston, 1937</xref>), sitcoms (e.g., <italic>A Different World</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X12469998">Berenbeim &amp; Allen, 1991</xref>; <italic>The Game</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X12469998">Akil, 2011</xref>), comedy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0013189X12469998">Robinson, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0013189X12469998">Savali, 2012</xref>), memoirs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013189X12469998">Graham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X12469998">Haizlip, 1995</xref>), and popular music (e.g., “Free Your Mind,” performed by En Vogue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013189X12469998">Foster &amp; McElroy, 1992</xref>; “Redbone Girl,” performed by Eric Benet featuring Lil’ Wayne; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X12469998">Carter et al., 2012</xref>) offer a sampling of how the Black skin color taxonomy is represented in the public mind. Sarah Jane Johnson in the movie <italic>Imitation of Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013189X12469998">R. Hunter, 1959</xref>) and Pecola Breedlove in Toni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0013189X12469998">Morrison’s (1970)</xref> <italic>The Bluest Eye</italic> exemplify how colorist activity confronts African American females specifically. Sarah Jane, an extremely fair-skinned Black female, spends years battling the ways in which her outward appearance as a “White person” intersects with restrictive options for African Americans during legalized segregation, her brown-complexioned mother’s determination for her daughter to embrace her Black heritage, and White Americans’ rejection and hostility after her true racial identity is unmasked. A striking example unfolds when a teenage Sarah Jane, who is subversively “passing” for White, sneaks out of her home to meet a young White male whom she is dating. Having heard speculation that she is, in fact, Black, the young man resentfully questions her about the rumors and cruelly beats her, demanding that Sarah Jane admit the truth.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0013189X12469998">Morrison (1970)</xref> develops the Pecola character as a tormented figure whom readers initially meet as a young girl who longs to have blue eyes, as beauty and being loved are synonymous with Whiteness in the child’s mind. Throughout Pecola’s challenging life, classmates ridicule her dark skin, men—including her own father—sexually abuse her, and the anguish of losing a child pushes her toward mental instability. Dynamics of colorism are captured in provocations launched by Maureen, one of Pecola’s light-skinned peers, as an afternoon of socializing intensifies into an argument:</p>

<speaker>MAUREEN:</speaker>
<p>I am cute. And you are ugly. All of you are ugly ugly black—eee-mos. I <italic>am</italic> cute. (p. 45)</p>
</speech>
<p>Maureen’s decision to racialize the dialogue by deliberately commenting on Pecola’s “old <italic>black</italic> daddy” [italics added] signals the strength of colorist markers among African Americans and establishes Blackness as a paradoxical insult given that Maureen is also Black. Because Maureen is a light-skinned African American character, readers may conclude that the girls in Morrison’s novel are cognizant of how value-based distinctions are traditionally ascribed to dark and light pigmentation levels. Evidence for this assertion comes not only from the insinuation that dark-complexioned Black people are pejoratively demarcated but also Claudia’s accusation that Maureen must simultaneously believe she is “cute”—ostensibly because of her light appearance, given the color-charged theme of the dialogue. The escalation to a physical confrontation, as well as Pecola’s emotional response, highlights how skin color variations may tap deep-seated feelings and rankle interpersonal relationships among Black females.</p>
<p>Despite battling dissimilar trials, the Sarah Jane and Pecola characters accent several cardinal truths. First, the country’s anti-Black legacy forces all African Americans to grapple with White racism and its bitter reprisals regardless of skin tone. Fair complexions do not steer light-complected African Americans from marginalization; rather, Whites’ racialization of Blacks as the Other imposes a certain universal identity for African Americans, at least historically. Second, racial identity has the potential to be situational in the Black community as some African Americans may believably “pass” as members of White society, opt to reveal (or conceal) their Black heritage at will, or present themselves as racially ambiguous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X12469998">Anthony’s (1995)</xref> study of passing among Black Creoles, for example, reveals that Blacks who participated in racial crossovers often lived dual lives where they masqueraded as White for employment or religious purposes but otherwise resumed their original identity. Finally, notions stemming from White racism continually inform Black experiences in a way that preserves White advantage. A telling contemporary example resides with the nation’s first president of color, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In their 2010 book <italic>Game Change</italic>, John Heilemann and Mark Halperin discuss senator Harry Reid’s motives for encouraging then–Senator Obama to pursue the presidency. Reid, according to Halperin and Heilemann, believed the markers of White preference that Obama embodied, such as his lack of “Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one” and light complexion, would appeal to voters and help Democrats claim victory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X12469998">Heilemann &amp; Halperin, 2010</xref>, p. 36). Coupled with Obama’s other symbolic forms of Whiteness (e.g., Ivy League education, faculty position at the University of Chicago), Reid’s remarks appear to corroborate the general truism that White Americans favor African Americans who are presumably most like them, that is, who seem “less Black” and “more White.” Since his first inauguration, President Obama’s initiatives have, in some respects, upheld the existing racial order as his initiatives harmonize with the nation’s movement toward new racism, or seemingly nonracial practices and policies that actually maintain the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0013189X12469998">Ray &amp; Bonilla-Silva, 2009</xref>). For instance, his emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education may do little to redress racial inequities in those fields because Whites are statistically more likely to receive STEM degrees than people of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0013189X12469998">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>). Disaggregating the 385,842 STEM awards that were conferred by Title IV institutions for the 2000-2001 academic year, for example, reveals that Whites were the overwhelming majority of recipients (2,457 American Indian or Alaska Native; 35,753 Asian, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander; 31,341 Black; 23,891 Hispanic or Latino; 236,169 White; 15,460 no race specified; 40,771 nonresident alien). Unfortunately, empirical studies generally do not include skin color as a key demographic variable, thus leaving unanswered questions about Black pathways in education.</p>

<title>Colorism: Historical Foundations and Contemporary Practices</title>
<p>Limited attention to colorism in contemporary educational studies involving African Americans is striking, and modern omissions prompt historical perspectives and evidence from other disciplines to fashion the prevailing narrative. The subsections that follow provide a short synopsis of findings that capture general implications of phenotypic variation among African Americans in educational and social domains. Although academics have established that socially constructed racial hierarchies usually benefit light-skinned African Americans and disenfranchise dark-skinned African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013189X12469998">M. Hunter, 2007</xref>), sparse, yet compelling, work punctuates social story lines with important caveats that should not be overlooked.</p>
<sec id="section3-0013189X12469998">
<title>Historical Perspectives</title>
<p>The interplay of skin color and race has governed African American positionality throughout the nation’s labor, legal, educational, and civic histories. Indeed, roots of colorism were seeded during the colonial period as skin tone became entwined with a prejudicial hierarchy that was stimulated by White racism. Thus from the slave era through legal segregation, the historical record chronicles relative advantages for light-complected Blacks as compared to dark-complected Blacks (Frazier, 1957/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X12469998">1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X12469998">Hall, 2010</xref>). Within the slave system, light-skinned Blacks often worked as house servants, foreman, or were trained as artisans rather than forced to endure grueling field labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X12469998">Bodenhorn &amp; Ruebeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013189X12469998">Lacy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0013189X12469998">Patillo-McCoy, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013189X12469998">3</xref></sup> Slave narratives also suggest that house slaves had more desirable clothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X12469998">Brown, 1847</xref>), were given a rudimentary education as children (Douglass, 1845/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X12469998">1988</xref>), and were periodically promised their freedom, although manumission was inconsistently granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X12469998"><italic>African American Lives</italic>, 2006</xref>) and frequently mediated by parentage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X12469998">Bodenhorn, 2002b</xref>). Social scientists speculate that slave masters’ actions may have sprung from a variety of motives, such as racist beliefs that light-skinned slaves were “closer” to being White and therefore “more intelligent” and “less threatening” than dark-skinned individuals. Archival evidence further indicates that “White slaves” may have garnered special sympathy from wealthy Northerners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X12469998">Cadet, 2012</xref>) and privileges from slave owners who acknowledged their offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013189X12469998">M. Harris, Bell, &amp; Lennon, 2003</xref>). Mulattoes also appear to have received better nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013189X12469998">Bodenhorn, 2002a</xref>) and steadily accumulated wealth faster than their Black counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X12469998">Bodenhorn &amp; Ruebeck, 2007</xref>) among the free population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013189X12469998">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Basic prejudices notwithstanding, working in “the big house” placed many light-skinned Blacks in close and regular proximity with Whites, thereby enabling house slaves to learn “White ways” and become fluent in some forms of White cultural capital, such as slaveholders’ speech patterns, while field slaves often retained remnants of their African dialect (Frazier, 1957/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X12469998">1962</xref>). The totality of former house slaves’ experiences, coupled with ongoing biases favoring Whiteness and lightness, likely helped such individuals gain some forms of social mobility during Reconstruction. For example, Bennett (1961/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X12469998">1993</xref>), Frazier (1957/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X12469998">1962</xref>), and others note that Blacks who entered Negro colleges as well as those who became proprietors, landowners, politicians, and community leaders were overwhelmingly from mixed racial backgrounds and relatively light-complexioned (e.g., Frances Harper). Historical advantages accrued to light-complected Blacks surely had a long reach, as African Americans who built some degree of wealth through land purchases, home ownership, and the accumulation of other assets likely set the course for family well-being generationally. Moreover, because light-skinned Blacks often married Blacks who mirrored their racial aesthetics and/or social standing, economic growth likely multiplied within a set range of the Black population. A notable exception is when light-skinned Blacks married high-status dark spouses. As African Americans carved post-Emancipation lives, colorist discrimination was maintained through Greek letter organizations, “blue vein societies,” Negro fraternal orders, and societies that restricted membership, such as through brown-bag and pencil tests. Fair-skinned African Americans further had the flexibility of “passing” into White society to circumvent employment, housing, travel, and other restrictions erected against Blacks (Drake &amp; Cayton, 1945/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013189X12469998">1962</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X12469998">Anthony’s (1995)</xref> study of passing among Black Creoles demonstrates, participation in racial masquerades was often economically motivated and, thus, contributed to intragroup economic stratification, as fair-skinned Blacks used their outwardly “White” appearance to secure better-paying and higher-status occupations than what was available to most Blacks.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013189X12469998">Hochschild and Weaver’s (2007)</xref> review of census data since 1890 also documents how race mixing created a foundational basis for alternate legal recognition. According to their work, with the exception of the 1900 census, the government distinguished between Negroes, mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons into the early 20th century, thereby setting the stage for alternative standings, as the court case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0013189X12469998"><italic>State v.

Within the colorist domain, the historical record clearly illustrates how African American lives were affected by “privilege” and impingement based on racial codes and widely accepted assumptions.</p>

<title>Contemporary Perspectives</title>
<p>Although “official” racial classifications steadily moved toward global categories during the early 20th century, the effects of skin color discrimination have persisted into the current century. Marginalization surfaces as a general theme when colorism is narrowed to experiences among dark-complected African Americans. In mainstream society, people with dark pigmentation tend to encounter exclusion and particularly harsh treatment if they are “more African looking,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X12469998">Blair, Judd, and Chapleau’s (2004)</xref> research makes visible. After collecting a random sample of data on 216 male inmates from the Florida Department of Corrections, they explored whether sentences varied on the basis of how “African looking” the defendant was. After comparing Black and White inmates with equivalent criminal histories, Blair and her colleagues concluded that sentences did not reflect systematic racial bias; that is, Black defendants did not receive harsher punishments than White defendants with similar backgrounds. When turning attention to in-group differences, however, Blair et al. found that being more “African looking” was correlated with longer prison sentences. In real time, having Afrocentric features amounted to a prison sentence that was approximately 7 to 8 months longer than the average for other Black or White inmates, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X12469998">Burch (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0013189X12469998">Viglione, Hannon, and DeFina (2011)</xref>; and others have reached similar conclusions.</p>
<p>In education-related areas, social scientists regularly unmask gendered dimensions of colorism. Using data from the National Survey of Black Americans, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0013189X12469998">Thompson and Keith (2001)</xref> found, in part, that skin hue predicted perceived self-efficacy among Black men, as dark men ranked lower on indicators of self-efficacy than light men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0013189X12469998">6</xref></sup> Careful consideration of related research suggests that color prejudice may inform such results. Certainly in the workplace, a traditional source for male effort and accomplishments, employers have been shown to favor light applicants as documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013189X12469998">Harrison and Thomas (2009)</xref>. They write,
<disp-quote>
<p>The mean ratings (both for recommendation and hiring) given to applicants in this study seem to suggest that darker skinned Blacks (particularly males) can have more educational background, prior work experience, and perceived competence and still not be as highly recommended or more likely to be hired over someone with lighter skin and noticeably less skill.</p>
<p>This finding is possibly a result of the common belief that fair-skinned Blacks probably have more similarities with Whites than do dark-skinned Blacks, which, in turn, makes Whites feel more comfortable around them (Williams, 2002). (p. 155)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result, dark Black men’s rankings on self-efficacy may be motivated by the unfortunate reality that color bias may frustrate their goals. Likewise, the social sciences and humanities are replete with examples of how dark-skinned women are excluded from depictions of beauty, attractiveness, and femininity in mainstream society and heterosexual relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X12469998">Bond &amp; Cash, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0013189X12469998">Ross, 1997</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X12469998">M. Hunter (2008)</xref> notes the value of light skin on the marriage market particularly among women, a theme poignantly reverberated in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013189X12469998">Hill, 2002b</xref>) as well as popular media (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013189X12469998">Spike Lee’s (1991)</xref> <italic>Jungle Fever</italic>).</p>
<p>Despite the real ways in which skin hue intrudes on Black life, conversations about race largely obscure colorism and mute scholarly engagement with the construction’s implications for research access, data collection, interpretive analyses, and data-based applications. Yet if educational researchers are to conduct and relate authentic Black stories, they must interrogate how colorist propositions shade investigations, particularly, qualitative inquiries in which participants articulate their own insights. Such a body of research would accelerate calls to improve research experiences and evade unanticipated and underexplored dangers of scholastic investigation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0013189X12469998">Milner, 2007</xref>, for an analysis of cultural processes related to researching African American communities). Moving beyond racial classifications to the colorist realm is an empirical challenge but one that must, nevertheless, be confronted methodologically. Because skin tone difference is a relative concept and likely to provoke disagreement based on individual backgrounds and spheres of exposure,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013189X12469998">7</xref></sup> researchers must be wary of extrapolating findings across racial taxonomies and create spaces in which participants enunciate their own interpretations.</p>

<title>Summary and Caveats</title>
<p>Colorism mobilizes both inter- and intraracial skin tone bias for Blacks. White racism seeded initial color consciousness as racist notions that light-complexioned African Americans were “closer” to being White and, therefore, more intelligent, trustworthy, and desirable than their dark brethren became popular. The historical narrative unveils an undeniable legacy of light-skin preference by Whites from slavery onward. As previously established, light-complected Blacks were more likely to work as maids, cooks, butlers, artisans, and coachmen rather than as field hands. House servants’ physical positioning also gave them more ready access to literacy and work training. The disproportionately large share of the free Black population that light-skinned Blacks composed also enabled them to acquire wealth and carve successful lives by several measures (e.g., educational attainment, property ownership).</p>
<p>As the nation lumbered into the modern era, antebellum biases continued to cast a long shadow on widely held perceptions and corresponding action. The result for Black America has been a dual system of racial stratification. On one level, African Americans, regardless of their skin tone, grapple with the implications of discrimination, such as segregation and redlining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X12469998">Darling-Hammond, 2012</xref>). On a second level, skin-tone privilege has helped light-skinned Blacks to power ahead of their peers in areas such as wealth accumulation and occupational status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013189X12469998">Keith &amp; Herring, 1991</xref>). As previously articulated, both realities preserve White advantage in society at large because (a) Black advancement tends to be mediated by White decision makers’ preferences and (b) ramifications of skin-tone difference within the Black community do not disrupt overarching Black-White disparities.</p>
<p>Although the previous sections outline broad understandings that encircle inter- and intraracial color lines, researchers should receive the information with several caveats in mind. First, despite skin color variations, individuals with Black ancestry were (and are) generally faithful to an overarching Black identity. Even during legalized segregation, individuals who stood to benefit from colorism pushed for democratic inclusion among African Americans. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0013189X12469998"><italic>Plessy v. Ferguson</italic> (1896)</xref> Supreme Court case is an iconic example, as Homer Plessy, who was one eighth Black and seven eighths White, was not permitted to sit in the White-only section of a train traveling through Louisiana. Incensed by the requirement that he be seated in the train’s colored section, Plessy sued the railway company. Given his attempt to dismantle a segregated system, Plessy’s actions were plausibly an act of racial solidarity with other Black Americans and perhaps indicative of a desire to better accommodations for people with African ancestry. Other examples include Walter White’s and Ben Jealous’s activism through the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Adam Clayton Powell’s and Cory Booker’s accomplishments as elected officials. While historians correctly criticize the regrettable role that light-skinned African Americans played in upholding color prejudice, the Plessy, White, Booker, Jealous, and Powell cases are high-profile models of individual exceptionalism that force researchers to temper unyielding portraits of light-skinned Blacks as an exclusionary bloc that stubbornly upholds self-interest over racial justice.</p>
<p>Second, some work stresses racial aggressions that light-complected Blacks face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0013189X12469998">Piper, 1992</xref>). Examples include chronic challenges to their racial identity, particularly denouncements that they are not “authentically Black” and expressions of resentment from other Blacks regarding real or perceived advantages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X12469998">M. Hunter’s (2008)</xref> synthesis poignantly captures such sentiments and is worth quoting at length. She writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>The task of “proving” oneself to be a legitimate or authentic member of an ethnic community is a significant burden for the light-skinned in Latino, African American, and Asian American communities. For many people of color, authenticity is the vehicle through which darker-skinned people take back their power from lighter-skinned people. . . . One common way they regain their sense of power and pride is to accuse light-skinned Blacks of not being “Black enough.” . . . Not being Black enough, or authentically ethnic enough, in any ethnic community, is a serious insult to many. It implies that they do not identify with their fellow co-ethnics, that they do not care about them, that they think they are better than their co-ethnics, or in extreme cases, that they wish they were White. . . . Light-skinned men and women are typically not regarded as legitimate members of the African American or Mexican American communities. They may be excluded from or made to feel unwelcome in community events and organizations. (pp. 70-72)</p>

<title>The Interest Convergence Principle: Theoretical Considerations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013189X12469998">Ladson-Billings and Tate (1995)</xref> are credited with introducing critical race theory (CRT) to the field of education, and numerous social scientists have clarified the theory’s application to educational research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013189X12469998">Donnor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013189X12469998">Duncan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013189X12469998">Howard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0013189X12469998">Solórzano, Ceja, &amp; Yosso, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0013189X12469998">Stefancic &amp; Delgado, 2001</xref>). Although CRT is anchored by several propositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0013189X12469998">Ladson-Billings, 1998</xref>), this article focuses on one tenet: the interest convergence principle.

<title>The Interest Convergence Principle</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X12469998">Bell (1992)</xref>, actions that enhance African Americans’ social standing and/or move racial progress forward are catalyzed by contextual factors that ultimately serve White interests as well. Because the abiding effect that racial justice strategies and battles have on Whites ultimately mediates outcomes, long-term success or failure is foreseeable and predicted by the degree to which African American goals harmonize with the aims of White America. Across time and location, the principle’s hardiness is reinforced by two conditions: (a) Promoting “Black aims” does not require Whites to abandon their own interests, and (b) existing power relationships remain intact.</p>
<p>Once celebrated as a decisive victory for Black democratic inclusion, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X12469998"><italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> (1954)</xref> decision has been recast by many as a clear illustration of the interest convergence principle. Writings by the late civil rights attorney Derrick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12469998">Bell (2005)</xref> capture the asceticism of this stark truth. Relying heavily on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013189X12469998">C. Harris’s (2003)</xref> scholarship, Bell argues that the <italic>Brown</italic> verdict aided state and national interests, such as by reinforcing the tradition of state’s rights. Most plainly, state and local segregationist governments were allowed to determine how integration efforts would be handled. As a consequence, high-quality Black institutions were closed, Black educators were dismissed and demoted, and schools were simply resegregated en mass. Simultaneously, the United States’ international image and ostensible dedication to equality were bolstered, thereby countering global criticism and pressure to uphold birthrights for all citizens. Ultimately, such motives, among other causes, led Bell to conclude that
<disp-quote>
<p>Brown was not a revolutionary decision. Rather, it is the definitive example that the interest of blacks in achieving racial justice is accommodated only when and for so long as policymakers find that the interest of blacks converges with the political and economic interests of whites.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>When considering how colorism meshes with the interest convergence principle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0013189X12469998">Palmer’s (2010)</xref> study of a dual-language program in a racially integrated setting highlights the need to mature CRT’s analysis of race. Based on interview and observational data from a yearlong study in California, the author found that two-way immersion (TWI) classes were largely populated by Latino and White children despite the fact that the student body was fairly evenly distributed among Blacks, Whites, and Latinos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0013189X12469998">8</xref></sup> Given that the program was “designed to promote equity and help children bridge cultural and linguistic differences,” the author questioned why Black youngsters were generally excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0013189X12469998">Palmer, 2010</xref>, p. 95). She ultimately faulted deficit orientations toward Black students, middle-class Whites’ power to exclude others, and seemingly color-blind admissions processes as primary reasons for low African American participation rates.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0013189X12469998">Palmer’s (2010)</xref> study sheds insight into why most Black students were <italic>obstructed</italic> from entering the program, unanswered questions are raised about the small percentage of Black students who were <italic>selected</italic> for admission. Given current knowledge about light-skin privilege in the Black community, querying the backgrounds of Black TWI students would help unravel how colorism operates in school settings. What impressions did teachers hold of Black TWI pupils? Did the instructors’ perceptions resonate with prevailing color biases? When researchers adhere strictly to race, they miss opportunities to disaggregate nuanced content of Black racialization, such as skin-tone bias.</p>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013189X12469998">Ladson-Billings and Tate (1995)</xref> published their seminal article, researchers have steadily built on the call to enhance racial conceptualizations and expose educational constraints in the lives of students of color. Yet within this rich body of work, few voices acknowledge that colorism nurtures asymmetries within racial groups. As a result, there remains a great deal to learn about how African Americans negotiate and are affected by tenets of CRT within their own race as well as in society at large.</p>

This section presents a sampling of recommendations for future empirical and conceptual work.</p>
<sec id="section9-0013189X12469998">
<title>Mentoring</title>
<p>Given that Whites compose the top tier of U.S. racial stratification, social stereotypes place individuals with dark coloring at a disadvantage because they are (a) the most distant from desirable characteristics associated with Whiteness and (b) the closest to disparaging traits that are linked to Blackness. Such impulses are translated into the academic terrain, as racist beliefs and practices wrongly position African Americans as being “less intelligent” than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013189X12469998">Jensen, 1969</xref>) and incrementally “smarter” than other Blacks on the basis of the percentage of “White genes” in their biological makeup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0013189X12469998">Lynn, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0013189X12469998">9</xref></sup> Because light-complexioned Blacks tend to have higher levels of educational attainment than dark-skinned Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X12469998">Allen et al., 2000</xref>), learning more about how colorism informs steps associated with educational completion rates is worthwhile.</p>
<p>The critical role that educators’ expectations play for K-12 students is particularly important, as Black students exhibit strong academic performance when professionals adhere to high expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0013189X12469998">Lewis, James, Hancock, &amp; Hill-Jackson, 2008</xref>) and provide quality instructional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013189X12469998">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>). Additionally the relationships that teachers and other individuals forge with Black youths are especially meaningful in helping youngsters “develop educational goals and make the transition from high school to postsecondary education and future careers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0013189X12469998">Wimberly, 2002</xref>, p. 9). To date, however, relatively little is known about the mentoring relationships that exist between educators and phenotypically different Black students. Similarly, there is a dearth of research that systematically narrows attention to Black educators who represent a range of Black visual images.</p>
<p>Scholars are encouraged to systematically investigate professional mentoring activity among teachers, administrators, counselors, paraprofessionals, and other stakeholders (e.g., academic coaches) to shed insight into whether and why interactions vary along colorist boundaries. For example, what types of classes and academic tracks are Black students encouraged to pursue? Are educators equally receptive to Black students’ presence and contributions in their classes? How does skin tone relate to Black students’ perceptions of the educational figures in their lives? Unfortunately, minimal scholarship on colorism in PreK-12 settings suffocates insights to these questions.</p>

<sec id="section10-0013189X12469998">
<title>Professional Experiences</title>
<p>In addition to examining educator-student relationships, colorism may also surface in professional experiences. While not a study of colorism, the teacher’s comments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0013189X12469998">Milner’s (2005)</xref> study of Dr. Wilson, a Black educator in a predominately White suburban setting, illustrates how African American teachers negotiate both race and color in the workplace. Reflecting on student learning through the implicit curriculum, the study participant remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>I keep my hair cut short because I want my kids to see a dark skinned Black woman with short hair. For many of them, Rich, they have never seen this. And yes, there are lessons in that. And, yes, I plan this. I am aware of what I’m doing. I want them to see a Black woman with Black features and how yes, I am OK, and I am smart, a reader, successful, you see? I tell them how I’ve traveled the world, and they look at me in awe. . . . Their interactions with me and their acceptance of me will help them to take the time to be accepting of other people who may not look like them or have the same kinds of experiences. (p. 411)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As enunciated in the excerpted quote, perceptions of Black educators are inherently catalyzed by their race and color. As a consequence, Black educators may grapple with stereotypes that are color specific and “live out” Blackness differently on the basis of their physical appearance and the school social composition. As alluded to by Dr. Wilson, dark-complected Black teachers may be particularly motivated to challenge assumptions about Black intellect, while light-complected Black teachers may be moved to dismantle preconceived ideas about who is “authentically” Black. While the overarching narrative of Black educators documents a common commitment to excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013189X12469998">Foster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0013189X12469998">Mitchell, 1998</xref>), researchers’ slow movement to chronicle Black phenotypes in contemporary studies relegates a critical dimension of Black teachers’ professional lives to the realm of conjecture.</p>
<p>Other professional experiences that should be investigated include employment practices, such as hiring, promotion, and evaluation decisions; mentoring relationships; interactions with students’ families; and exchanges with colleagues. While evidence exists that light-skinned Blacks benefit from preferential hiring decisions in the general marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013189X12469998">Harrison &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>), relatively few researchers have investigated whether such tendencies hold true in educational contexts specifically. In a related vein, the degree to which skin tone influences career advancement, job-based recommendations, and professional evaluations is unclear. Given the steady increase in Black-on-Black grievances that are filed through the legal system and administrative agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0013189X12469998">Valbrun, 2003</xref>), questioning the role of skin tone in perceptions and claims of unfair treatment is a ripe area of study. Investigating such matters through a CRT lens would also stimulate new questions about the degree to which segments of the Black community benefit from progressive hiring practices as compared to other historically underrepresented groups such as White women.</p>

The regularity with which males are menaced in school settings has focused attention on gendering patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0013189X12469998">Monroe, 2005</xref>); however, insights about color bias are severely wanting. Interrogating colorism as related to behavioral perceptions and disciplinary moments will help clarify connections between race, gender, and discipline, as researchers will acquire a firmer understanding of differential perceptions that frame inequities. Determining whether Black students have qualitatively different interactions with teachers, administrators, campus resource officers, or other school officials on the basis of complexion will be a major step toward refining conceptual understanding of culturally grounded classroom management frameworks and formulating reform plans. If dark-skinned Black males do, in fact, have the most troublesome encounters, as tends to be the case in the criminal justice system, theorists will have a fuller understanding of how discipline intersects with overarching sociopolitical forces in the nation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0013189X12469998">Weinstein, Tomlinson-Clarke, &amp; Curran, 2004</xref>, for an articulation of a culturally focused classroom management model). More importantly, the field can depart from mundane portrayals of Black students that fail to acknowledge color lines from an intraracial standpoint.</p>

<title>CRT</title>
<p>More than 20 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X12469998">Bell (1990)</xref> urged the nation to “‘Get Real’ about race and the persistence of racism in America” (p. 393). His compelling body of scholarship became a foremast that demonstrably moved social analysts to apply the pillars of CRT to the field of education and amplify the role of racism in structural challenges. While African Americans historically express concerns about tackling prejudice, the ferocity and effects of racial bias do not affect all segments of the community the same way. Critical race theorists should revisit the framework and interrogate how colorism intersects with racism in both structural and personal opportunities for bias in educational settings. While extant research suggests that the consequences of racism may fall particularly heavily on dark-complexioned African Americans, empirical insights are constrained. On one level, educational researchers do not tend to explicitly foreground colorism in empirical endeavors—at least in contemporary studies. Rather, racial descriptions for study participants, settings, and researchers largely rest with global categories, such as “Black” or “African American.” On a second level, scholars who do comment on skin color tend to limit descriptions to binary labels that crudely denote individuals as “light” or “dark.” As a consequence, knowledge about colorism frequently proceeds from fields such as sociology and psychology and does not always deliberately address educational factors. Substantial benefits would emerge from critical race theorists’ decision to make colorism a basic component of their interpretive framework. By the same token, scholars should abandon monotheme or dualistic approaches to data collection and analysis. Educational research, rather, needs studies that attend to the continuum of skin tones that exist in the African American community, as colorist asymmetry admits varied and relative forms of discrimination to the lived experience.</p>
<p>Moving color analysis from the margins of academic discourse to the center of educational research may further elucidate how basic tenets of White advantage mediate the comparatively better standing that light-complexioned African Americans hold in society at large in relation to dark-complexioned African Americans—at least by several traditional measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X12469998">Allen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X12469998">M. Hunter, 2005</xref>). Thus, critical race theorists stand to learn a great deal about the tenacity of colorism as well as racism and how color bias sustains the interest convergence principle. For instance, does the tendency to hire and promote light-complexioned African Americans, as documented in other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013189X12469998">Harrison &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>), also hold true in education? How do teachers perceive Black students as related to youngsters’ academic and social identities? And how do Black students interpret popular ideas, such as “acting White” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X12469998">Fordham &amp; Ogbu, 1986</xref>), racelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013189X12469998">Fordham, 1988</xref>), and oppositional identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0013189X12469998">Ogbu, 2003</xref>)? Foregrounding physical appearance as related to race, especially via a broad color continuum, will help liberate findings that are stifled by generalized labels.</p>

<title>Applications to Additional Communities</title>
<p>Researchers are encouraged to grow educators’ understanding by investigating how the construct operates in other communities particularly as related to intersectionality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0013189X12469998">Telles and Ortiz’s (2008)</xref> study of Mexican incorporation into U.S. society provides a foundation for how colorism may be examined among Mexican Americans. Their study traces Mexican Americans’ experiences across four to five generations, and they conclude that such families slowly enter the working and lower-middle classes with a large share of the community living in or near the poverty line. The authors proceed to challenge assimilation theory on the grounds that their evidence is a marked departure from findings among European Americans, who tend to become middle class by the third generation.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0013189X12469998">Telles and Ortiz’s (2008)</xref> study was not designed to query colorism, questions that arise from their work resonate with the call of the present article. In light of current knowledge about colorism as a social barrier, educators would benefit from sustained efforts to expand understanding of intragroup experiences. Namely, did racialized barriers that Telles and Ortiz cite, such as stereotyping, mediate intragroup socioeconomic stratification? As evidenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X12469998">Fergus’s (2004)</xref> study of Mexican and Puerto Rican youth, skin color may be linked with important responses to discrimination. Among the participants in his work, Fergus found that so-called “Mexican or Hispanic-looking” students and “Black or biracial-looking” students tended to acknowledge race, ethnicity, gender, skin color, and language as factors that influence success or failure. “White-looking” males, however, did not attribute inequities to race or skin color. These types of basic differences in student perceptions may spur trajectories that partially explain core beliefs that guide individuals’ future pathways. Unfortunately, as reiterated throughout the current article, too few researchers recognize how skin complexion defines difference within racial groups, thus resulting in a body of educational research that generally overlooks a powerful operative in communities of color. Fergus’s findings, alongside Telles and Ortiz’s thorough research, further highlight the need to investigate how colorism complicates race. Completing studies with Latino, Asian, and indigenous communities also allows educators to engage questions related to immigration, citizenship, colonization, and language—arenas that will facilitate valuable comparisons and contrasts to the African American narrative.</p>

<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>Previous researchers have demonstrated that colorism plays a critical role in mediating the educational, economic, political, and social opportunities available to African Americans. Although educators routinely investigate racial concerns, few contemporary investigators probe how skin color informs studies, thus leaving colorism as a common blind spot. Scholars, study participants, and research consumers bring ideas about colorism to investigative inquiries, thus making it essential to filter through colorist notions, such as by questioning whether and how Black study participants are affected by racial impulses, and evaluating whether an authentic study has transpired. In the drive to refine scholarship and sharpen analytical insights, colorism—specifically enlisting ways to account for its organic presence—should be at the vanguard of education research. Additionally, hair texture, eye color, the prominence of Black African or White European facial features, hair color, and stylistic choices (e.g., clothing, hairstyle) are demarcations that have implications for latent assumptions, the degree of comfort participants have with researchers, and their subsequent willingness to be fully invested during a study.</p>
<p>In practice, social scientists are encouraged to use frameworks provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X12469998">Alridge (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0013189X12469998">Milner (2007)</xref> as starting points for building self-awareness about researcher positionality. In addition to analyzing race, social class, sexual orientation, and gender, researchers should sift through “complexion questions” that are embedded in racial classifications. How successfully possible barriers are removed, minimized, or at least addressed from a methodological standpoint, of course, is an empirical question that requires data-driven answers. Contemporary researchers who complete investigations with Black populations are encouraged to document how they disclose their orientation(s) about colorist impulses and personal racial identity (or identities) as well as study participants’ responses. Continuously reflecting on and analyzing this type of data will shed insight into how nuances of race may propel studies in certain directions with regard to data collection and analytical conclusions. More importantly, these steps will challenge monolithic portrayals of Blackness and honor the realities, contradictions, nuances, and shades of distinction that define African American life and educational research.</p>
