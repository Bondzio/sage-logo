<p>After the demise of communist rule the relationship between media and politics in Eastern European countries has to adjust to the conditions of democratic politics and a competitive communication environment. This study explores how journalists and politicians understand their relationship past and present and what orientations govern their day-to-day interactions. The political communication cultures in Bulgaria and Poland are investigated on the basis of semi-structured interviews with journalists and politicians. The findings suggest that in Bulgaria closed-knitted networks between the two sets of actors continue to shape political communication breeding ‘deals’ and even corruption that seriously undermine the independence of political journalism. In contrast, political communication roles in Poland appear more differentiated making it more difficult for political actors to exercise control over the public agenda.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two decades after the transition to democratic rule in Central Eastern Europe, the role of the media in the political process remains one of the key issues of posttransition politics. Conflicts over the control of the media agenda and the rules and norms that guide the relationship between political power holders and the media flare up frequently and have created an atmosphere of mutual distrust, suspicion, and even hostility. In fact, democratizing the media has proven to be more complex than the transformation of most of the other institutions of a democratic polity that are on their way toward consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212449084">Milton 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212449084">Zielonka 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the research on the media in postcommunist Central Eastern Europe so far has focused on media policy and the regulatory framework concerning issues such as ownership, public service broadcasting, and mechanisms of media accountability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212449084">Gross 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212449084">Jakubowicz and Sükösd 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212449084">Paletz and Jakubowicz 2003</xref>). Studies have also tackled with new forms of journalism across the region (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212449084">Aumente et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212449084">Lauk and Hoyer 2008</xref>). Much less attention has been paid to informal processes of public communication and the emerging political communication cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212449084">Pfetsch 2004</xref>) of these countries.</p>
<p>Our study aims to fill this gap. It focuses on the relationship between journalists and politicians and the orientations that guide their interaction. Based on thirty-eight semistructured interviews with politicians and journalists in two postcommunist countries, Bulgaria and Poland, our research explores the normative underpinnings of the interaction between these two sets of actors in the daily routines of political communication. The interviews that were conducted in 2008 and early 2009 focus on the norms and unwritten rules of political communication actors and capture their reasoning as well as their perceptions of the dilemmas and conflicts that arise in their day-to-day interactions.</p>
<p>We begin by outlining our theoretical framework that derives from the comparative study of political communication systems and cultures. In the following section we provide a brief sketch of the situation of politics and the media in Bulgaria and Poland to shed light on the national contexts and constraints of political communication in the two countries under study. After a brief description of our study design, we present some of the crucial findings that may help us to learn more about the political communication cultures of two transformation countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1940161212449084">
<title>Theoretical Considerations: Emerging Political Communication Cultures</title>
<p>Our study is based on the notion of political communication as a system of interaction between politicians and journalists, both of whom aiming to maximize their influence on citizens/audiences by controlling the public agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212449084">Blumler and Gurevitch 1995</xref>). This relationship is governed by a specific set of values and role expectations, which are shaped by the political and cultural settings of the society of which a given political communication system is a part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212449084">Esser and Pfetsch 2004</xref>). In their model of press–politics relationships, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212449084">Blumler and Gurevitch (1995)</xref> emphasize the interdependency between the two sets of actors who each need the resources of the other side to achieve their objectives. In fact, the news can be regarded as a joint product that emerges from the exchange relationship between the media and their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212449084">Manning 2001</xref>). As a result, evidence from established democracies suggests that for most of the time the relationship between politicians and journalists is governed by a high degree of cooperation. Similar sociocultural backgrounds and frequent personal contacts often lead to an intimate knowledge of, and sympathies for, each other where influences run in both directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212449084">Davis 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While cooperation is necessary, the relationship is not without tensions and conflicts, particularly when journalists become active investigators. On one hand, these manifestations of their role reaffirm journalists’ professional self-perception, strengthen their credibility in the eye of their audience, and remind political officials of the media’s power and independence. On the other hand, there is a considerable risk of disrupting the routine working relationship with politicians that might interrupt the flow of information from their key news sources. Conversely, political actors will try to expand their influence on the media agenda by pressurizing journalists and by interfering in editorial decision making.</p>
<p>Blumler and Gurevitch’s approach of political communication as a system of mutually interdependent actors suggests to ask what attitudes underlie the relationship between politicians and journalists. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212449084">Pfetsch (2004)</xref>, these orientations can be considered as the cultural dimension of political communication that complements the structural conditions and constraints in which political communication actors operate. The political communication culture involves “the empirically observable orientations of actors in the system of production of political messages toward specific objects of political communication, which determine the manner in which political actors and media actors communicate in relation to their common political public” (ibid., p. 348).</p>
<p>If we understand political communication culture as the orientations and mutual expectations of politicians and journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212449084">Pfetsch 2004</xref>), we need to consider the specific political and media context against which these perceptions are played out. Over the past decades or so, political communication has been undergoing dramatic changes that are driven by increased commercialization of media markets, the erosion of voter loyalty, and a growing sense of political disillusionment among citizens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212449084">Mazzoleni and Schulz (1999)</xref> argue that political communication has moved from mediated politics, which relied on the media for the transmission of political messages, to mediatized politics “where political institutions [are] increasingly . . . dependent and shaped by mass media” (p. 247). While much of the research has tried to establish whether politics is losing out to the media, or is actually dominating public communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212449084">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>), it is more likely that these contradicting processes are going on at the same time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212449084">Brants and Voltmer 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While these developments seem to be universal, it can be assumed that the particular nature of mediatization of politics and instrumentalization of the media by political actors differ between old and new democracies. One crucial variable here is the historical legacy of the relationship between politics and the media. It can be assumed that even after the institutional transformation of the media, traces of the media’s role under the old regime continue to shape the interactions and mutual expectations of politicians and journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212449084">Milton 2000</xref>). This peculiar juxtaposition of old and new, communist and democratic, elements can be expected to result in hybrid forms of political communication cultures that, to varying degrees, differ from those in established Western democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212449084">Voltmer 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212449084">Kitschelt et al. (1999)</xref> distinguish between three types of postcommunist legacies that have emerged from the characteristics of the previous regime and its political culture: “Patrimonial communism” was characterized by extensive personal networks of personal dependency and clientelism accompanied by low levels of formal organization. Bulgaria but also Romania, Russia, and the successor states of the Soviet Union fall into this category. “Bureaucratic–authoritarian communism” denotes the most totalitarian form of communism, whereas “national–accommodative communism” represents a more moderate form of bureaucratic communist rule. Poland is classified as a mixture of the latter two types. While personal patronage was a general feature of communist societies, countries emerging from bureaucratic–authoritarian and national–accommodative pathways are more inclined to implement radical market reforms, thus being more successful in eliminating clientelistic patterns of mutual dependencies. The existence of a professional bureaucracy also fosters the implementation of the rule of law and the separation of powers that are a precondition for an effective system of checks and balances. In contrast, in political contexts that are dominated by clientelistic relationships of mutual dependency, it is much more difficult for the media to develop into independent institutions that are able to monitor political power holders. Instead, governments—and other powerful political and economic patrons—are able to pressurize the media by selectively distributing favors, for example, resources, licences, or access to information, in exchange for supportive coverage or, sometimes even more important, smear campaigns against opponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212449084">Hallin and Papathanassopoulos 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A crucial difference in the political communication context that emerges between Eastern and Western democracies refers to the party system. With the exception of some postsocialist parties, most of the newly established political parties found themselves in a situation where they had to win electoral majorities without the support of efficient party organizations and under conditions of extreme electoral volatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212449084">Rose and Munro 2003</xref>). In the absence of operational strength and sustained mass support, the media are often the only channel through which political parties and governments can communicate to citizens. As a consequence, virtually all governing parties in postcommunist countries have tried to exploit their power position to maximize their control over the media in the hope of securing their political survival, often using methods that contradict democratic norms of an independent press.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market reforms and privatization helped the media gain independence from their former political masters. However, the end of government subsidies and plummeting circulation rates and viewing ratings posed new threats, and many outlets did not survive the new competitive environment. In addition, since many news media do not have the resources and the know-how to engage in effective reporting a “journalism of opinion” and speculative accusations prevail over thorough research and informed critique.</p>
<p>It can be argued that both sides of the emerging political communication systems in postcommunist countries have to renegotiate their relationship from a position of weakness, which further intensifies the potential for destructive conflicts and reduces the chances of establishing a professional working relationship. Only few of the conflicts that arise between the participants involved in political communication can be resolved by formal regulation because for the most part, the interaction between political actors and the media is governed by informal rules that emerge from their ongoing struggles over who controls the public agenda and with what means. While in established democracies the mutual orientations and conduct of journalists and politicians follow a fairly predictable pattern, the situation is entirely different after political regime changes. Here, the rules of political communication, for example, the degree of collaboration and autonomy, publicity and secrecy, or advocacy and detachment, have to be constantly renegotiated, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty and conflict. It therefore remains an open question how politicians and media in the new democracies in Central Eastern Europe position themselves in the new competitive environment of multiparty politics and commercialized media markets and how they interpret their roles.</p>
<p>Taken together the constraints of political communication in Eastern European countries, we expect the political communication culture to be an expression of an uncertain and vulnerable relationship. Because of the absence of a long practice of exchange relations between journalists and politicians within a democratic setting, we may find that the relationship is overshadowed by the specific national legacy of the communist past and the dynamics of the transformation period which plays out also in the orientations of political communication actors. Against this background, our study aims to assess the attitudinal underpinnings of political communication by exploring the orientations and perception of professional rules that govern the relationship between politicians and journalists in two postcommunist countries: Bulgaria and Poland. We expect the specific political cultures and trajectories of system transformation to become visible in the political communication cultures of the two countries. To this end, we explore how politicians and journalists perceive the balance between confrontation and cooperation, how they interpret their own role and that of their counterpart, what they regard as the factors that trigger conflicts, and what they see as possible ways of achieving a more sustainable relationship that avoids undue transgressions.</p>

<title>Politics and the Media before and after the Fall of Communism: The Cases of Bulgaria and Poland</title>
<p>Even though Poland and Bulgaria share the experience of four decades of communist rule, there are also important differences that can be assumed to affect the way in which politicians and journalists negotiate their relationship.</p>
<p>In Poland<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212449084">1</xref></sup> a vibrant civil society and a relatively high level of pluralism developed already within the old regime. The trade union movement Solidarność was just the most visible and most powerful organization among a plethora of oppositional groups that fought for an open and democratic society. A broad range of <italic>samizdat</italic> literature helped to articulate and circulate the oppositional ideas. Even though martial law imposed in 1981 weakened the Solidarność movement, it also fundamentally undermined the legitimacy of the regime up to a point where the communist elites saw no alternative but to negotiate change with the leaders of the opposition. Poland is a typical example for a pacted transition that is facilitated by an agreement between old and oppositional elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212449084">Karl and Schmitter 1991</xref>). The first free elections in 1990 (presidential) and 1991 (parliamentary) brought the candidates of the former opposition into the key power positions of the country. However, over the past twenty years, Poland’s young democracy has gone through turbulent times with extreme shifts of power in each election. The recent 2011 parliamentary elections marked a historic moment, as it was for the first time that an incumbent government was reelected. Further, the political culture in Poland is characterized by two deep cleavages: the first division is over the basic values of society, especially the role of the Catholic Church in public life, and the second division is the argument about the true events at the Round Table which refers to questions of the alleged involvement of the dissident movement in the old regime.</p>
<p>The transformation of the media has benefitted from the experience of the opposition under communism. The <italic>samizdat</italic> literature has bred a generation of journalists who were committed to free speech and pluralism and who are now in key positions of the media system. In fact, Poland’s leading quality newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, has its roots in the Solidarność movement. At the same time, Polish broadcasting has been struggling to defend its political independence. Each incoming government irrespective of its ideological orientation has interfered into the supervisory and management structures of public service broadcasting as well as its editorial independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212449084">Glowacki 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212449084">Krajewski 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212449084">Szynol 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s democratization has taken a very different course than the Polish transition. The opposition movement started organizing itself only in the late 1980s, and there were hardly any <italic>samizdat</italic> publications that provided an intellectual focus for the various activities. When the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) was founded in December 1989 as an umbrella for the fragmented pro-democracy groups, it lacked a shared vision of the future political course of the country and the leadership necessary to exert pressure on the ruling elites. Instead, the communist regime was brought down by an internal putsch from within the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore the Socialist Party, the successor organization of the Communist Party, was able to cling to power until 1997, when the UDF managed to win an absolute majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212449084">Dobreva et al. 2011</xref>). As a consequence, it was only from late 1990 onwards that serious market reforms were initiated, including privatization of the media.</p>
<p>Today, Bulgaria’s media seem to be divided between a highly politicized and a highly commercialized segment. On one hand, the public service broadcaster remains almost entirely dependent on state subsidies, leaving it highly vulnerable to continuous government interference. On the other hand, commercial media are used by their owners to promote their interests and those of the business community at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212449084">Kavrakova 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212449084">Raycheva and Petev 2003</xref>). Delayed market reforms, the long survival of the old elites in power positions and the inheritance of highly clientelistic relationships have led to pervasive corruption that permeates all sectors of society, including the media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161212449084">2</xref></sup> Rivaling business interests often use the media as a weapon to defend spheres of influence and to damage competitors. The media’s capture by both political and economic interests makes it difficult for journalists to secure their professional autonomy.</p>
<p>The conditions after the fall of communism imply that Poland had a head start in the transformation of political communication. Building on a diverse dissident movement and the commitment of political leaders to establish democracy, the emerging political communication culture can be expected to be more congruent with democratic norms than the one in Bulgaria. Here, because of the prolonged hegemony of the old elites, clientelism, and corruption, it can be assumed that the media remain more entrenched in the existing power structures. However, frequent instances of political interference into the media in both countries are an indicator of the general reluctance of political power holders to give up their control over the public agenda.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1940161212449084">
<title>The Study</title>
<p>This article stems from a comparative study exploring the emerging political communication cultures in new democracies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212449084">3</xref></sup> The research is based on semi-structured interviews conducted with high-ranking politicians and journalists as well as political spokespersons. The interview guide covers various aspects of political communication cultures: orientations toward the political system, in particular, achievements and shortcomings of the new democracy; the understanding of professional media roles; the relationship between politicians and journalists; and the rules and norms that guide the day-to-day interaction between these actors. The analysis of the present paper focuses on the perceived patterns of the media–politics relationships and how the rules and norms underlying them are interpreted by the two sets of actors.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we use sixteen interviews in Bulgaria (eight journalists, eight politicians) and twenty-two interviews in Poland (twelve journalists, ten politicians).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212449084">3</xref></sup> Our sampling followed a positional approach; that is, we targeted individuals in high decision-making positions on matters of public communication in their political, governmental, or media organization. The interviews with politicians included members of the government, leading party politicians, and MPs from all political camps. The media sample comprised editors and top journalists from national television channels, national newspapers, and opinion-leading weeklies. The length of the recorded interviews varied between twenty and eighty minutes. The recorded interviews were transcribed and, since they were conducted in the respective native languages, translated into English.</p>

<title>Mutual Images: Evaluations of Competence and Integrity</title>
<sec id="section7-1940161212449084">
<title>Bulgaria: Mistrust and contempt</title>
<p>Since the relationship between journalists and politicians entails both conflict and cooperation, a certain level of respect for the other side is important to maintain a working relationship. However, given the difficult transition of political communication in Bulgaria, contempt seems to dominate the journalists’ perception of politicians. The following quote captures the general attitude very well:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know any politicians in Bulgaria who actually wants to achieve something good for the country; it is just a lucrative job for making good money and good connections. I am not trying to be negative, but I cannot think of even one politician whom I respect. (J3, news anchor at private TV)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Compared to this view, politicians acknowledge the high level of competence and professionalism of journalists. Nevertheless, for the most part, they also hold critical views about them. The reasons for lack of mutual esteem can be grouped into two main categories: an evaluation of the way in which the respective counterparts perform their role (professionalism) and an evaluation of their personality, morale, and motives.</p>
<p>Professionalism is an issue of high concern for all interviewees. Journalists criticize politicians for being mere administrators rather than leaders with a vision. They are perceived to lack communicative skills. Conversely, the reasons why politicians don’t have a high opinion of journalists refer to the low quality of political reporting, the focus on sensational and trivial news, and the lack of understanding and background knowledge.</p>
<p>When it comes to judgments about personality and motives, both groups question each other’s trustworthiness. Equally, both suspect each other of being compromised by the past. In many cases, this refers to assumed links to the secret police. Journalists look down on politicians’ lack of consistency and the readiness with which they change their opinions. They also believe that politicians do their job only for selfish reasons rather than out of a desire to serve the country. Cynicism and materialism are the motives politicians see in journalists. Even though many interviewees question the motives of their counterparts, most of them see the main cause of the problem in Bulgaria’s short democratic history. The period after the transition is regarded as too short a time for acquiring sufficient professional experience to manage the demands of public communication in a media-saturated environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1940161212449084">
<title>Poland: Powerful media and mutual accusations of incompetence</title>
<p>The Polish politicians in our study share a strong belief that the media are tremendously powerful in politics. Most respondents are convinced that the media “create reality,” “influence public opinion,” are of major importance during election campaigns, and even decide about the success or failure of a party or individual politicians.</p>
<p>Against this background, we find a significant division of our respondents with regard to the perception of their relationship with the media: One group of politicians perceives the media as partners and shows willingness to adjust to the professional requirements and the modes of operation of the media. These respondents display an instrumental attitude. They are interested in learning about possible strategies of influencing the media through professional PR and cooperation. The second group of politicians perceives the media as antagonistic, even hostile players. They are reluctant to take the specific modes of operation of the media into account and see little chances of influencing them. These respondents do not perceive their relationship with the media as an integral part of their own role but seem to be rather paralyzed by “the power of the media.”</p>
<p>Polish politicians show little respect when they speak about the professional conduct and competences of journalists. At least half of our respondents complain about the incompetence and lack of analytical skills and professional capabilities of journalists. They complain about journalists not understanding political issues and not reporting about the “deeper problems” of a policy debate.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The average Polish journalist is incredibly incompetent and unprofessional. . . . I know journalists and I know politicians and I can say that the average journalist is many times more stupid than the average politician or MP. (P7, MP of PiS)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Journalists equally accuse politicians of being incompetent and lacking political experience. They often refer to the transition to explain the existing problems.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Poland, we have the same problem like in the rest of Eastern and Central Europe where there weren’t any politically educated elites and they were co-opted from everywhere. This lack of education manifests itself in bad laws . . . and an amateur way of making politics. (J2, senior journalist of high-quality weekly)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another reason that was given for the mistrust toward politicians refers to the accusation that each government since 1989 tried to dominate public media by controlling the appointment of the management of the broadcaster or supervisory bodies, or by pressurizing editors and journalists.</p>

<title>How Close—How Distant?</title>
<sec id="section10-1940161212449084">
<title>Bulgaria: Increasingly symbiotic relationship</title>
<p>The mutual perceptions of journalists and politicians in Bulgaria seem to imply an adversarial, even hostile relationship. However, the situation is more ambiguous. Journalists are acutely aware of the close relationship that has developed between themselves and their news sources and the implications this might have for their own professional integrity. Several respondents express concern about the relationship becoming too close, thereby undermining the autonomy of journalism:
<disp-quote>
<p>In Bulgaria, the journalists who work on political matters have become . . . part of the larger political elite of the country. This gradually makes them a part of the status quo, and together with the politicians, with the business and corporate bosses and the entertainment stars they are in the spotlight of public attention. . . . The politicians and the journalists have developed what I would call intimate relationships: they have dinners together, they go to parties and social events together, they travel abroad together . . ., which influences the way the journalists do their job. (J7, senior journalist of high-quality weekly)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While a symbiotic relationship between journalists and politicians has been observed in established democracies as well, the pattern in Bulgaria seems to be special since the power elite is relatively small and concentrated in the capital Sofia. Many of those who are in top positions today know each other from early childhood. They have either developed close networks as part of the old communist power elite, or have started their career in politics or the media after the transition as part of the same anticommunist movement. As a result, a close-knit network of, often collusive, relationships has emerged that has been referred to as “yellow brick road” journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212449084">Dobreva et al. 2011</xref>). The yellow brick road is a description of the area around the Parliament. It is a reference to the way journalists and politicians live in a world detached from “normal life” which is governed by political and personal infighting.</p>
<p>The interviews imply that Bulgarian journalists are struggling to maintain the independence that is necessary for critical journalism without losing access to their news sources. Individual journalists, but also politicians, are confronted with the decision about how close they allow personal relationships to grow and where to draw the line between professional and potentially corrupting contacts. Asking about the risks and benefits of this decision, it seems nevertheless that the personal ties are seen as an essential part of the job and as opportunity to develop mutual trust.</p>
<p>Some journalists have developed their own rules that help them to “keep the contacts, but avoid dependency” (J4, news anchor on private TV). These rules include the following: never meet outside official territory, that is, the office or parliamentary lobby, and always pay for one’s own bills when having drinks or meals together, etc. While some journalists strictly avoid becoming friendly with politicians, others feel quite confident that their friendships with high-ranking politicians do not compromise their independence. In particular, established journalists rely—rightly or wrongly—on their own authority as a protective shield that demands respect on the side of their counterpart, but believe that younger and overambitious journalists are an easy prey for political influence and, as one puts it, turn into the “mail boxes” of politicians (J1, senior journalist of high-quality weekly).</p>
<p>It seems that the problem of managing personal contacts is not only one of finding adequate rules and norms for individual behavior. Rather, the issue is rooted in deeper processes of cultural change that are causing uncertainty and ambiguity. On one hand, more than most Western European societies, Bulgarian society is based on extensive networks of personal relationships where knowing the right people is as essential for professional success as having the right educational or professional background. As a cultural norm, communication on all levels is personal rather than formal. It is not unusual that journalists contact politicians on their personal mobile phones, which indicates how important personal relationships are as a professional tool. The obvious downside of these close personal relationships is that they can be easily turned into dependency, blackmailing, and corruption.</p>

<title>Poland: Struggling for a professional distance</title>
<p>In Poland, the majority of respondents from both sets of actors are aware of the give-and-take between journalists and politicians. The journalists in particular reflect on the closeness of their relationship to politicians and whether these might be a breach of professional norms. Most of the journalists say that they try to avoid informal meetings with politicians.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have such rule not to meet with politicians informally. I have a rule that media shouldn’t familiarize with the world of politics because it creates a very ambiguous situation. Although we have similar interests, the most important thing should be the public interest. (J5, senior journalist of high-quality daily)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, several journalists admit that informal meetings between both groups happen quite often to acquire background information that otherwise would not be accessible.</p>
<p>Another argument that was mentioned in Poland for close relationships between journalists and politicians refers to the common past in the dissident movement. The involvement in underground media established close ties between activists, which are still alive even though former dissidents find themselves in opposing positions of the political communication divide, as they pursued careers as either politicians or journalists. However, with the passing of time these “historical alliances” seem to become less important, as one senior journalist points out:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning of the 90s many politicians and journalists knew each other from the underground, for example. Often these relations were reflected in the contacts afterwards—which is natural because people simply continued to know each other. However, now those connections become less relevant, people are getting older and younger generations of journalists enter the scene. So even though these connections still exist, they are not misused. (J3, senior journalist of high-quality daily)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The perceptions of politicians parallel those of the journalists. Our respondents indicated that they wish to keep their distance to journalists. Informal meetings with journalists are regarded problematic and there is also an awareness of the ambiguity of these contacts and their potential to undermine professional standards.</p>

<title>Violating the Rules</title>
<sec id="section13-1940161212449084">
<title>Bulgaria: The integrity of journalism in question</title>
<p>Even though journalists and politicians in Bulgaria seem to have found ways to navigate through the new communication environment, they are frequently confronted with situations where their approaches fail. To overcome the reluctance of our interviewees to admit their own failure to stick to the rules, we asked them whether they know of cases when other people—both journalists and politicians—behaved in an unacceptable manner toward their respective counterparts. Journalists were surprisingly open and critical when talking about unacceptable behavior within their own profession, which suggests self-reflection and awareness of the problems facing professional journalism in their immediate environment. In contrast, only few politicians produced examples of unacceptable behavior of their colleagues and instead focused mainly on the wrongdoings of journalists. The impression was that politicians are uncertain and insecure about the consequences of using their power and position to exert direct pressure.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many politicians mention biased and manipulative news coverage as examples for unacceptable journalistic practice. They complain about the use of misleading headlines and instances where the wording of an interview has been altered or even distorted. While these complaints might—at least to some extent—be due to the desire of politicians to see themselves portrayed in the most positive way possible, other reported instances clearly violate accepted journalistic norms, for example, the release of off-the-record information. In turn, journalists complain about politicians who provide information only to supportive journalists while boycotting others.</p>
<p>Live programs often become the battleground where both participants fight for their own public image—politicians as strong and effective leaders, journalists as critical monitors of political power. Sometimes, keeping control over the floor can take on dramatic forms:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember during an electoral debate on television he [a politician] said that he would leave the TV studio if they didn’t stop the direct line with representatives of other political parties who were commenting on the election results. He said that he didn’t have time to listen to their stupid comments, which showed his immense arrogance and disrespect for his opponents and for the journalists. Shockingly for me, the journalists did interrupt the direct line with the other politicians! (J3, news anchor at private TV)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This incidence was cited by a journalist as an example of unacceptable behavior of a politician. And indeed the threat of the politician to leave the show severely challenges the authority of the journalist as the host of the program. However, the event can also be taken as an example for the failure of journalists to resist undue pressure from politicians. While these dramatic situations do not happen very often, they can be regarded as a breakdown of communication and might indicate that journalists and politicians have not yet developed effective strategies of conflict management.</p>
<p>Another area of perceived misconduct is concerned with deals and arrangements behind the scene. Apparently, the close personal relationships between journalists and politicians that have been discussed above are frequent causes of the violation of unwritten rules. Both journalists and politicians regard it unacceptable when politicians use their power and personal connections with editors or owners to demand for an (over)critical journalist to be sacked. According to our interviews, not all editors who have been exposed to pressure were able, or willing, to stand behind their staff. As a consequence, some journalists had to leave their posts after the intervention of a powerful politician.</p>
<p>Another widespread problem is the exploitation of intimate relationships. In Eastern Europe, journalism is largely the professional domain of women while politics remains mainly in the hands of male politicians. This constellation provides plenty of opportunities to convert a professional, adversarial relationship into an intimate one. Even though strategic considerations might not be the primary motivation—as most of our interviewees believe—these relationships are certainly too close to ensure critical reporting.</p>
<p>Even more worrying for the integrity of journalism in Bulgaria are records of commissioned coverage with the aim to target a particular politician with attacks and slander. This kind of mudslinging campaigns have become notorious in many postcommunist countries in Eastern Europe and have been dubbed “kompromat,” a Russian word that indicates fabricated news coverage which aims to destroy political—frequently also economic—competitors. In our interviews, several journalists and politicians talk about instances of paid negative coverage. Here are two examples:
<disp-quote>
<p>For example, when a political party is closely connected to the owner of a newspaper and they use certain journalists to damage the career of an inconvenient politician through commissioned negative campaigning. (J1, journalist of high-quality weekly)</p>
<p>There is the example of [a TV channel], which is a party channel and does not act in a responsible manner. . . . Companies can also make payments to this channel and their competitors get negative coverage. (P5, politician of BSP)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Across our interviews, it becomes apparent that paid news coverage is endemic in Bulgarian political communication. Many politicians mention financial pressure as a means to obtain favorable or—more importantly—suppress unfavorable news coverage. But the weapon can be turned against them, as some feel blackmailed to offer money in order to control a negative campaign launched against them by a certain media outlet. Moreover, as it emerges from various remarks slipped in occasionally and mostly off the record, many journalists even expect being offered financial favors for their services. Eventually paid coverage seems to have been developed into a system with informal rules and even price lists differentiated according to placement, reputation, election/nonelection time, etc. In this context, PR agencies are mentioned to have become the main intermediaries who negotiate the exchange of money, thus establishing corruption in journalism as a two-way process that serves both the interests of politicians and journalists.</p>

<sec id="section14-1940161212449084">
<title>Poland: Uneasiness about unethical behavior</title>
<p>The statements of Polish journalists and politicians about the violation of rules point into a similar direction. Both groups express uneasiness about the transgression of boundaries that mark unethical behavior and all interviewees can give examples of such cases. Asking for examples of professional wrongdoing, journalists and politicians mention “leaks” of politicians as well as civil servants as a widespread informal way of transferring information to journalists. Obviously, leaking takes place among politicians and journalists from the same political camp in order to harm a rival or hide another issue. According to the observation of the journalists in our study, politicians would choose younger, inexperienced journalists as transmitters of leaked information. Almost all journalists interviewed complain about leaking as an inappropriate and manipulative practice of politicians.</p>
<p>Polish journalists, like their Bulgarian counterparts, are open and self-critical when it comes to the wrongdoing of the press. They report of unethical and hostile behavior, provocations and rhetorical attacks against politicians as well as cases of invasion of privacy, the spreading of false information, and the exploitation of political sources.</p>
<p>The violation of ethical codes of professional conduct seems to be common practice in Poland: politicians report about lies, hidden cameras, broken agreements etc. as inappropriate behavior of journalists. However, it remains unclear how frequently these actions actually occur: some politicians consider such patterns as rare events; others insinuate that they have become regular practice, especially after the introduction of tabloid newspapers and investigative programs of commercial TV channels. However, while all our interviewees oppose these methods of investigation in principle, several journalists regard them as important means in the fight against corruption and unaccountability.</p>
<p>The majority of our interviewees mention close political ties between journalists and politicians of the same political camp—divided between a liberal and a conservative milieu—as compromising behavior. Most journalists complain that politicians tend to give information privileges to reporters of the same camp while sidelining others, while politicians blame journalists of inviting politicians for interviews according to their political (dis)liking and attack or promote them in front of the cameras.</p>
<p>All in all, the interviews in Poland point at an ideologically divided sphere of political communication that is reinforced by the behaviors of both groups: politicians seem to cooperate only with those media that they perceive as belonging to the own camp. One journalist explains that the causes of this division are not just strategic but lie deeper in rather power driven interpretations of the political mandate:
<disp-quote>
<p>Many—maybe even the majority—of Polish politicians believe in a doctrine that since they have been elected they can govern over everything because society wants them to rule. Accordingly, when society mandated them to write bills, they are also entitled to determine the program of the television, both public and private, content of the newspapers, and so on. It is deeply rooted in the posttotalitarian consciousness. (J1, senior journalist of high-quality daily)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this situation, the reasons for cutting off information to journalists for political reasons are perceived differently. Politicians consider it as a strategy to “punish” media that “insulted” politicians of the own camp. Journalists assess the behavior as inappropriate, rather dysfunctional, and as a sign for an immature democracy. They refer to the commercialized and pluralized media landscape in which it does not pay off for politicians “to go to war with the media.”</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study aimed to come to a more empirically grounded understanding of the emerging political communication cultures of two postcommunist countries in Eastern Europe. In our study, we wanted to draw the focus from formal aspects of media regulation to the cultural and informal dimension of the transformation of public communication. Our in-depth interviews with Bulgarian and Polish journalists and politicians provided insights into the norms of interaction between journalists and politicians in their daily routines of news production, their understanding of professional conduct in political communication under the new democratic circumstances, and the dilemmas that arise from balancing cooperation with news sources and the conflicts that come with critical journalism.</p>
<p>While Bulgarian journalists and politicians hold rather hostile and dismissive views of each other, they are also involved in a close—often too close—network of relationships that at times threatens the integrity of journalistic independence. The most worrying aspect of this interdependence is the apparently widespread practice of paid news coverage that involves both politicians exerting pressure through bribes and journalists expecting favors for their services, that is, positive coverage of the commissioning politician or damaging attacks on his or her opponent. These patterns of interlocking relationships correspond with Bulgaria’s broader political culture that emerged from a legacy of “patrimonial communism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212449084">Kitschelt et al. 1999</xref>). However, journalists seem to be much more aware than their political counterparts of the dangers involved in the closed-shop, clientelistic culture of Bulgarian political communication. Their statements demonstrate a rather high level of self-reflection and the desire to adopt what they regard as more professional Western standards of journalism. In contrast, politicians seem to continue to rely on strategies of crude political pressure, such as interference into media organizations, threats, and punishment of what they regard as misbehavior of journalists, rather than the tools of modern news management.</p>
<p>In Poland, the media–politics relationships have emerged from a less personalized, more rational–bureaucratic form of communism (“bureaucratic–authoritarian/national–accommodative communism”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212449084">Kitschelt et al. 1999</xref>). More than in Bulgaria, far-reaching elite exchange and economic reforms have enabled the media to keep clear from collusive relationships with political power. Equally important is the experience of a broad and enduring dissident movement, which still determines the way in which journalists and politicians understand their role in the new democratic order. In 2008–2009, when the fieldwork for this study took place, Poland’s political communication culture was characterized by a pattern of cross-cutting cleavages: On one hand there is a milieu of pragmatic relationships between politicians and journalists, which is guided by efforts to professionalize the conduct of each group. This group actively engages in the motives and requirements of a fast-growing commercial media system that in spite of its perceived downsides, also opens up opportunities for liberation from political coercion. In this segment of political communication, actors try to overcome political entanglements and keep professional distance between media and politics. On the other hand, there is a milieu of rather old-fashioned politicized relations between media and politics. Here especially politicians are driven by the idea that the media are a powerful and hostile force that is determined to work against them. This group perceives the divide in political communication, not between the professional roles of politicians and journalists but between the network of left-wing politicians and journalists versus the right-wing camp of politicians and journalists. This pattern can partly be attributed to the highly polarized political climate during and immediately following the dual leadership of the Kaczynski brothers. But it also reflects a generational shift where the old ideological passions are fading and democracy and public communication are becoming the business of professionals.</p>
<p>Overall, many problems mentioned by our interviewees resemble the antagonistic, but symbiotic relationship between journalists and politicians that has evolved in established democracies over the last couple of decades. Nevertheless, even though some of the malfunctions, deficits, and tensions of interaction that we find in our study also appear in long-standing Western European democracies, they seem to imply the emergence of a different political communication culture. The context of the political culture at large in new democracies, a relatively short period of democratic practice together with a high degree of ambiguity regarding the democratic role of the media, sets political communication culture in Eastern Europe apart from Western European countries. As our interviews reveal, politicians and journalists have not yet been able to agree on a set of rules and problem-solving mechanisms that would guarantee stable working relations in the daily routines of news production. The ambivalence of norms and expectations that we found in our study suggests the emergence of specific hybrid forms of political communication cultures that are characterized by both the persisting legacies of the past and the professional communication strategies adopted from the West. At the same time, the differences between Bulgaria and Poland indicate a high degree of diversification within Eastern Europe that defies the notion of a unified pattern of politics–media relationships in the region. Future research should therefore aim to better understand both processes of divergence and convergence between the political communication cultures of established Western European and the new democracies in Eastern Europe.</p>
