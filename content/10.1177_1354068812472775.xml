<p>These two volumes share the merit of de-mystifying enduring clichés about two boundaries of the same phenomenon of parliamentary party unity: dissent and switching. First, in Westminster systems the unity of parliamentary groups is taken for granted uncritically: ‘MPs’ deviations from the party line being so infrequent and inconsequential that they can safely be ignored’ (Kam, p. 2). Second, party-switching is relegated to the unpredictable domain of ‘anomalous, undesirable behaviour’ (Heller and Mershon, p. 4) affecting only under-institutionalized systems (p. 29). Both books move beyond the mediocre state of the art, advancing compelling theories of individual dissent and party-switching.</p>
<p>Kam proposes a unified theory of legislative politics synthesizing elements from the preference-driven institutional and sociological models of parliamentary behaviour. His primary aim is explaining voting dissent, while referring occasionally to media dissent and party-hopping. Electoral pressures and diverging policy preferences are identified as the main causes of disunity, while loyalty is elicited by leaders through advancement, discipline and socialization. The latter should prevent MPs from dissenting, especially after their career-advancing prospects have disappeared. The initial game theoretical model predicts that dissent becomes visible only when electoral returns for it pass a significant threshold; advancement and discipline are not perfect substitutes for one another and leaders prefer to foster unity through advancement and discipline rather than policy compromise.</p>
<p>A major finding in Kam’s book is that de-alignment explains virtually all cross-national variation in dissent in the four Westminster democracies: ‘(a) 1% decline in the percentage of very strong identifiers in the electorate increasing the extent of dissent by 0.5%’ (p. 71). Confidence conventions have a significant but minor effect. Conversely, the policy preference model explains very little: MPs’ dissent is not really driven by ideological closeness to other parties.</p>
<p>Apparently, dissent provides MPs from Britain and New Zealand with increased name recognition and higher approval ratings. Their success is largely due to non-partisan voters who appreciate shows of independence. Kam also demonstrates that constituency service and dissenting are not opposite strategies, as the compartmentalization thesis maintains, but complementary vote-winning strategies that co-vary.</p>
<p>Another key result is that dissent on salient issues damages the party electorally. Core supporters are the most affected, facing increasingly high information barriers in recognizing their party’s position (e.g. British Labour MPs’ disunity around Blair’s Iraq policy). Next, Kam illustrates through the example of the Canadian Liberals under the premiership of Jean Chretién how demotion increases voting dissent significantly.</p>
<p>Kam’s two chapters discuss leaders’ strategies for managing dissent. Informal discipline seems preferable to public punishment, which brings image costs. The former is shown to have prevented media dissent from turning into voting dissent in the case of the Australian Coalition. Then, the analysis of several British MP cohorts indicates that dissent co-varies with poor career prospects, while even in such conditions more socialized representatives tend to dissent less.</p>
<p>In contrast to Kam’s eclectic approach, the contributions in the Heller and Mershon volume share a faith in ‘the centrality of legislators’ ambition in changes of party affiliation’ (p. 12). Thus, strategic calculations should generate patterns of behaviour comparable even across very diverse institutional settings. This rational choice approach ignores socialization, being only partially sensitive to institutional constraints.</p>
<p>In the editors’ formal model of switching, party leaders move first imposing a discipline level and then representatives switch or not. This reveals the importance of equilibria – between the collective desire for unity, bringing policy bargaining leverage and higher party label electoral value, and the MP’s wish to be able to dissent sometimes for personal or constituency-related benefits.</p>
<p>Schofield’s first theorem posits that in a first-past-the post (FPTP) context MPs will switch when they cannot find a compromise between voters’ centrism and activists’ extreme positions (e.g. U.S. Republican moderates are forced to switch by the social conservative activists’ domination of primaries). Nokken shows that U.S. Congress switchers act to satisfy both their constituents (voting in line with their previous affiliation on final votes) and their new party patrons (at procedural and amendments votes). However, increased polarization brings higher convergence with the new party on all votes.</p>
<p>Desposato analyses the Brazilian Congress’s massive switching brilliantly. Brazil had all the elements favouring switching: uncontrolled party membership benefits, low transaction costs and no legal restrictions on defection. Desposato’s choice model mitigates the impression of ‘chaotic’ behaviour: switchers seek ideological compatibility, ‘pork’ and electoral advantage. Moreover, in most cases defectors do not move very far on the policy space.</p>
<p>McElroy and Benoit’s findings illustrate that switching in the European Parliament (EP) is a function of the members’ perceived gains in ideological proximity and policy influence. Similarly, in the Italian Parliament (Heller and Mershon) out-switching makes parties more cohesive, while leaders accept primarily ideologically compatible switchers. For Mershon and Shvetsova, defecting prior to formation of parliamentary party groups (A) and committees (B) suggests office-seeking. Switching before the term end or after sub-national elections (E) implies vote-seeking. In an intermediary stage (C), MPs switch to influence policy and benefit from agenda control. Indeed, most switching in the USA happens in stages A and B, while in the least institutionalized parliaments it happens in phase E. A fundamental flaw is the impossibility to distinguish between policy-oriented and office-seeking motivations in stages B and C.</p>
<p>Kato and Yamamoto show how switching is crucial in achieving or blocking the formation of a ‘decisive majority’ (a majority also controlling committees) in the Japanese first chamber. Finally, Kreuzer and Pettai argue that switching in over-institutionalized party systems undermines the ruling party’s hegemonic position, while helping re-orient policy in institutionalized systems.</p>
<p>The Heller and Mershon volume remains at the anecdotal level of perceiving switching as detrimental for re-election. Additionally, voters’ perceptions of switching are not analysed. Even if findings demonstrate that changing affiliation is good for ideological compatibility, voters’ alienation from their allegedly ‘opportunistic’ representatives could, in the long run, have a stronger negative impact for democracy. Kam shows that defections translate into vote losses for parties, even after controlling for declines in popularity. More telling is that in many flawed democracies, especially in the post-Soviet space, switching was a key mechanism in creating the ‘parties of power’.</p>
<p>Beyond the conclusion that unity is more frail and conditional than assumed, Kam’s most important finding is the connection between dissent and the decline of partisanship. But, then, are new democracies condemned to low unity given their citizens’ extremely weak levels of party identification? The book’s scope conditions remain ambiguous, the author limiting himself to stressing the advantages of testing his theory in the Westminster world.</p>
<p>Kam’s monograph follows a persuasive multi-methods design: interviews with parliamentary elites are complemented by formal modelling, various regression models, factor analysis, scaling, content analysis and simulations. Generally, they reflect sound methodological choices, except for running a negative binomial model with 13 independent variables and only 68 cases (pp. 161–167). The edited volume is also methodologically rich, comprising formal (Heller and Mershon, Schofield, Desposato) and spatial modelling (Desposato, McElroy and Benoit), OLS (Heller and Mershon), conditional logit (Desposato, McElroy and Benoit) and principal component factor analysis (McElroy and Benoit).</p>
<p>Both books target an academic audience (legislative and party scholars), while the clarity of the analyses recommends them as ‘textbook’ examples for research methods courses at graduate level. More importantly, they are path-breaking works demonstrating that party-switching and dissent in parliamentary systems are major phenomena following predictable patterns. This being said, one can only hope the books will trigger scholars’ interest, fully succeeding in elevating these topics from their undeserved marginality.</p>
