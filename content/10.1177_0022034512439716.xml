<p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of chewing gum containing phosphoryl oligosaccharides of calcium (POs-Ca) and a low concentration of fluoride (F) on the hardness of enamel subsurface lesions, utilizing a double-blind, randomized, and controlled <italic>in situ</italic> model. Fifteen individuals wore removable lingual appliances with 3 bovine-enamel insets containing subsurface demineralized lesions. Three times a day for 14 days, they chewed one of the 3 chewing gums (placebo, POs-Ca, POs-Ca+F). After the treatment period, cross-sectional mineral content, nanoindentation hardness, and fluoride ion mapping by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) were evaluated. Although there were no statistical differences in overall mineral content and hardness recovery rates between POs-Ca and POs-Ca+F subsurface lesions (p &gt; 0.05), nanoindentation at 1-μm distance increments from the surface showed statistical differences in hardness recovery rate between POs-Ca and POs-Ca+F in the superficial 20-μm region (p &lt; 0.05). Fluoride mapping revealed distribution of the ion up to 20 μm from the surface in the POs-Ca+F group. Nanoindentation and TOF-SIMS results highlighted the benefits of bioavailability of fluoride ion on reinforcement of the superficial zone of subsurface lesions <italic>in situ</italic> (NCT01377493).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sugar-free chewing gums may have an anticariogenic effect through the stimulation of saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512439716">Kandelman and Gagnon, 1990</xref>) and be an effective vehicle for bioavailable compounds such as calcium promoting enamel remineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512439716">Morgan <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). It has been suggested that low but slightly elevated levels of fluoride in saliva and plaque provided from drinking water and fluoride-containing products helped to prevent and reverse caries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512439716">Featherstone, 1999</xref>). Recently, manufacturers have been adding bioavailable calcium and fluoride in various forms to enhance the potential anticariogenic and remineralization potential of gums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512439716">Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512439716">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512439716">Cochrane <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512439716">Kitasako <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512439716">Shen <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the studies focused on the beneficial effects of remineralizing agents, transverse microradiography (TMR) has been commonly performed to evaluate enamel mineral loss/gain through whole lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512439716">Featherstone and Zero, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512439716">ten Cate <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). While useful for overall assessments, the x-ray-based technique may not provide information on any possible interactions between active ingredients and enamel structure. In contrast, depth-related properties of enamel subsurface lesions have also been described by microhardness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512439716">Featherstone <italic>et al</italic>., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512439716">Kielbassa <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512439716">Delbem <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Some correlations have been described between microhardness and mineral content in demineralized lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512439716">Featherstone <italic>et al</italic>., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512439716">Kielbassa <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>); meanwhile, the trends may not be exactly the same in remineralization, depending on the composition of the minerals deposited and their crystalline structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512439716">Kitasako <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nanoindentation techniques have shown great utility for high-resolution profiling of local mechanical properties of biological samples such as enamel. Moreover, elemental analysis of the composition and/or the type of mineral at each lesion depth might be helpful to fully understand the remineralization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512439716">Magalhães <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometery (TOF-SIMS) can measure tiny amounts of elements with small atomic sizes such as fluoride and has been recently used to investigate enamel caries lesions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512439716">Dickinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, no study has reported on the effect of chewing gum containing both calcium and fluoride on the hardness and fluoride distribution in enamel subsurface lesions <italic>in situ</italic>. The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional nanoindentation hardness profiles at different structural levels of enamel subsurface lesions after chewing sugar-free gum containing bioavailable calcium and fluoride utilizing an <italic>in situ</italic> model. Fluoride ion mapping was also performed at the superficial regions to aid our understanding of the role of fluoride added to the calcium-containing chewing gum. The null hypothesis tested was that there were no differences in the hardness of remineralized subsurface lesions with or without the addition of calcium and fluoride to the chewing gum.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022034512439716">
<title>Study Design and Protocol</title>
<p>This study was based on a double-blind, randomized, controlled <italic>in situ</italic> design with 3 sugar-free gums as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512439716">Kitasako <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In brief, phosphoryl oligosaccharides of calcium (POs-Ca<sup>®</sup>; Ezaki Glico Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) is a form of soluble, bioavailable calcium produced by enzymatic hydrolyzation of potato starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512439716">To-o <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), and added to a commercially available sugar-free gum. One of the gums was a sugar-free chewing gum without POs-Ca (placebo), and the other 2 contained 2.5 wt% POs-Ca or 2.5 wt% POs-Ca and 1.2% green tea extract containing 0.02 mg fluoride, namely, POs-Ca and POs-Ca+F.</p>
<p>Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee for Human Research at Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Fifteen healthy adults (eight males and seven females) were recruited (age 20-31 yrs) after informed consent was obtained. The volunteers were all residents of metropolitan Tokyo, where the tap water is not fluoridated (mean fluoride level: 0.07 ppm). The volunteers were examined to confirm that there was no current caries activity, periodontal condition, or any other oral disease, and that each individual had 22 or more permanent teeth. The volunteers were not taking any medication which could potentially influence their oral conditions. Health history questionnaires at baseline and health update questionnaires during the treatment periods were used to monitor the participants. They were randomly divided into three groups according to the crossover design.</p>

<title>Preparation of Enamel Subsurface Lesions</title>
<p>Enamel blocks (7 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm, width × length × depth) cut from the central part of bovine incisors were embedded in acrylic resin (Unifast Trad; GC, Tokyo, Japan). The outer enamel surface was polished, and one-third of the surface was covered with a nail varnish, to serve as the sound portion. Subsurface lesions were then formed on the remaining surface by the two-layer demineralization method, with 8% methylcellulose gel (Methocel MC; Fluka, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and 0.1 M lactate buffer (pH 4.6) at 37°C for 14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512439716">ten Cate <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). After demineralization, the blocks were sterilized by ethylene oxide gas sterilizer (Steri-Gas; 3M, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Another one-third of the surface was then covered by the nail varnish (demineralized; DEM), and the remaining exposed one-third of enamel surface served as the remineralization area (REM).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512439716">
<title>Intra-oral Appliances</title>
<p>Removable lower-buccal acrylic appliances housing the enamel blocks and covering premolars to molars were fabricated for each participant. Those wearing the appliances chewed 2 slabs of gum 3 times every day (at 8:00, 12:00, and 17:00) for 20 min each time. After chewing and before removing the intra-oral appliance, participants continued wearing the appliances for 20 additional min. They were asked to avoid eating, drinking, or brushing with the appliance inserted and to brush their teeth as usual 3 times a day with a non-fluoridated toothpaste. They were instructed to rinse the appliances briefly after removal with tap water and store them at 37°C in sealed and humidified containers until the next insertion. The treatment was performed in 3 periods of 2 wks each, during which the participants in each group received one of the gums randomly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512439716">
<title>TMR (microradiography and microdensitometry)</title>
<p>Approximately 150-µm-thick sections were obtained from each block, and were microradiographed together with high-purity aluminum step wedges (12.5 μm × 21 steps) onto high-resolution plates (Konica Minolta Opto, Tokyo, Japan) by a Cu Kα x-ray generated at 20 kV and 20 mA for 13 min (PW-3830; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The mineral profiles of DEM and REM areas were obtained from the digital images of the microradiographs, assuming 87 vol% as the maximum mineral content of enamel. Average mineral recovery rate was calculated from the ML (mineral loss or ΔZ) of DEM (ML<sub>DEM</sub>) and REM (ML<sub>REM</sub>) as follows: recovery rate (%R) = (ML<sub>DEM</sub>-ML<sub>REM</sub>)/ML<sub>DEM</sub> × 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512439716">
<title>Hardness Test</title>
<p>Sections from the same samples used for microradiography were embedded in epoxy resin (EpoxiCure; BUEHLER, Lake Bluff, IL, USA). To produce smooth cross-sectional surfaces suitable for nanoindentation, the surface on each sample was sequentially polished by silicon-carbide papers #600, #800, #1000, #1200, #1500, and #2000, followed by diamond slurries with particle sizes of 6 µm, 3 µm, 1 µm, 0.5 µm, and 0.25 µm, with a lapping machine (Maruto, Tokyo, Japan). Hardness profiles of the DEM and REM areas were measured with a nanoindentation device (ENT-1100a; Elionix, Tokyo, Japan) in two phases, namely, the whole lesion and the superficial zone. In the first phase, the hardness profile down to 150 μm below the enamel surface was assessed on all samples. A minimum of 160 indentations was performed along 16 lines, each with 10 points, across the polished cross-section, with a spacing of 10 μm between each 2 neighboring points. The first line of indentations was set within 10 μm from the enamel surface. In the second phase, the hardness profile of the superficial 20 μm was plotted for 5 samples in each group. For this purpose, 200 indentation points were programmed on 20 lines with 1 µm distance between each 2 adjacent lines in the axial direction and a lateral spacing of 10 μm between points. The first point was within resin approximately 2 μm above the visible enamel border. For all indentations, the maximum load was 2 mN at a loading rate of 0.2 mN/sec, with a Berkovich diamond tip. In total, over 20,000 indentations were performed. To calculate hardness (H) at each point, we divided the maximum load over the area projected under the load. In addition to the averaged hardness plot, mean hardness recovery rate (%) in each phase was also calculated as follows: recovery rate (%) = (H<sub>REM</sub>-H<sub>DEM</sub>)/H<sub>DEM</sub> × 100.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022034512439716">
<title>TOF-SIMS</title>
<p>Analysis was performed with TOF-SIMS300 (ION-TOF, Münster, Germany) equipped with a pulsed Bi<sub>3</sub><sup>++</sup> liquid ion gun operated at 25 kV. The system vacuum was held below 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa throughout the measurements. The average primary ion current was 0.04 pA, and beam diameter was 0.2 to 0.3 μm in the burst alignment mode. Images were acquired in an area 100 μm × 100 μm with 256 × 256 pixel resolution. Fluoride mapping and profile were obtained from the top surface to 80 μm below the surface.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding in this study was that the bioavailable calcium (POs-Ca) effectively enhanced the hardness of demineralized enamel in the lesion body. Addition of a low level of fluoride to POs-Ca seemed to exert a synergistic effect through enhanced mineralization and hardness of the superficial zones.</p>
<p>The present report may be the first on the direct detection of cross-sectional changes in nanoindentation hardness and structural integrity at 1-μm-depth increments, and on fluoride distribution in the superficial zone of enamel remineralized by chewing gum containing calcium and fluoride in an <italic>in situ</italic> model. Nanoindentation hardness mapping with micrometer spacing between adjacent points increases data resolution; however, given the time required to perform each indentation, sensitivity of the test at a small load (2 mN), and the large amount of data produced, such a strategy is technically difficult for a large number of specimens. Considering these limitations, and taking into account the reproducibility of TMR and whole-lesion hardness data of the <italic>in situ</italic> cross-over design, 5 samples were subjected to the test for superficial hardness.</p>
<p>The testing of nanohardness at 1-μm-depth increments suggested that an enhanced reinforcement at the remineralized superficial lesions was induced by the chewing gum containing a low fluoride concentration. Moreover, the TOF-SIMS fluoride mapping and profile revealed that fluoride ion was detected up to 20 μm. It is noteworthy that the maximum levels of both superficial hardness and fluoride distribution were near the surface at approximately 2 μm depth. In line with this finding, it was previously suggested that long-term exposure to low concentrations of fluoride (around 1 ppm) resulted in repair of the outer portion of enamel lesions, but did not significantly affect precipitation of mineral in the inner enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512439716">ten Cate, 2008</xref>). According to the results of the TMR and overall hardness profiles in this study, remineralization took place throughout the depth of the subsurface lesion in both POs-Ca gums. Our previous study showed high solubility of the POs-Ca: The chewing gum was shown to release 7.1 mM calcium ion, similar to the POs-Ca+F (7.3 mM), whereas a low level of fluoride ion concentration (up to 1.25 ppm) was extracted from POs-Ca+F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512439716">Kitasako <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). That finding, accompanied by TMR profiles, indicated that both calcium and fluoride ions were released from the POs-Ca+F gum in a bioavailable form without impairing their mutual effects. Even in the presence of low-level fluoride, POs-Ca could penetrate the lesion deeply, perhaps owing to its small size (average molecular mass, about 800; maximum chain length, about 4 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512439716">Kamasaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512439716">Tschoppe <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). These results are also in correspondence with those of wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXRD) in the previous report, which indicated additional benefits of a low fluoride concentration of the crystalline structure of remineralized enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512439716">Kitasako <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). It is therefore suggested that the increased hardness in the superficial area was a result of better crystalline structure, and formation of more acid-resistant and denser fluoridated apatite crystal, despite the fact that TMR did not show any differences between the two groups.</p>
<p>Both POs-Ca and POs-Ca+F showed remarkable similarities in mineral profiles around the lesion body which were in accordance with nanoindentation hardness profiles. However, mineral density changes in the placebo gum were not reflected in hardness profiles and hardness recovery, suggesting that the mineral deposition did not result in mechanical reinforcement of enamel in this gum, perhaps due to the lack of proper crystallization, as previously confirmed by the WAXRD for the placebo gum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512439716">Kitasako <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Previously, mathematical relationships were assumed between hardness and mineral content; however, it was recently suggested that the hardness and the mineral content might describe two different properties of enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512439716">Buchalla <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). It appears that meaningful hardness differences obtained by submicrometer-depth increment measurements could not be derived from TMR mineral density profiles. Further cross-sectional nanoindentation studies might be useful for understanding the relationships between the parameters and remineralization mechanisms.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this <italic>in situ</italic> study demonstrated that fluoride containing POs-Ca gum was superior in hardness recovery of enamel subsurface lesions especially at the superficial layers when compared with POs-Ca and Placebo gums. The study highlights the importance of calcium and fluoride ion bioavailability in the reinforcement of demineralized enamel. Nanoindentation hardness measurement with small forces and submicron distance increments is a unique approach for local assessment of enamel changes after remineralization.</p>
