<abstract>
<p>Redo femoropopliteal bypass surgery is associated with increased morbidity and related to a poorer outcome than primary procedures. Endografts might provide an alternative, avoiding dissection of a previously operated groin. Patients treated with a polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents for superficial femoral artery occlusive disease between February 2009 and September 2011 were prospectively gathered. Demographics, clinical status, procedural aspects, and follow-up were retrieved. Seventy-four patients were included of which 5 (7%) were treated before with a femoropopliteal bypass. Indication for intervention was Rutherford category 3 in all patients and the median ankle–brachial index (ABI) was 0.68. Technical success was achieved in all cases. The postoperative course was uneventful in all and the ABI increased to 0.95. After a follow-up period of 18 months, 4 of 5 endografts remained patent. The use of endografts after failed femoropopliteal bypass surgery is feasible and safe and could be used to avoid or minimize a difficult and hazardous dissection of a previously operated area.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the Inter-Society Consensus for the management of peripheral arterial disease (Trans Atlantic InterSociety Consensus [TASC] II), open bypass surgery is considered the gold standard for long occlusive lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443317">1</xref>
</sup> A review of the literature has shown that the primary patency rate of venous femoropopliteal bypasses is 81% at 2 years and 69% at 5 years, while the results of prosthetic bypasses are inferior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443317">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443317">3</xref>
</sup> At 5 years, 7% to 20% of venous bypasses and 17% to 40% of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypasses have definitively failed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412443317">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443317">5</xref>
</sup> Results of thrombectomy and thrombolysis aimed to salvage these bypasses are poor. In a series of salvage procedures, including surgical thrombectomy and thrombolysis, Pedersen et al reported a primary patency rate of redo procedures of 32% at 3 months, 28% at 6 months, and 12% at 12 months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412443317">6</xref>
</sup> Secondary femoropopliteal bypass surgery is associated with increased morbidity, including wound infection, lymphatic obstruction, lymphorrhea, and neurovascular injury. In a recent study, te Slaa et al have shown that redo peripheral bypass operations result in significantly more postoperative edema than a first-time performed operation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412443317">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In order to both improve the long-term patency rates of secondary procedures and avoid the dissection of a previously operated groin, thereby possibly reducing the incidence of complications, alternative strategies may be indicated. An endovascular approach using endografts provides a minimally invasive alternative. In a recent publication, McQuade et al have shown that a primary endoluminal bypass, using expanded PTFE (ePTFE)-covered stents, has patency rates comparable with above-knee prosthetic grafts at 4 years of follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412443317">8</xref>
</sup> In secondary open bypass surgery, prosthetic grafts are often used because the saphenous vein frequently has been used during the first procedure. The use of endografts for the creation of an endoluminal bypass as a secondary procedure has not been described to date. In this article, we describe the feasibility of an endovascular approach using endografts after failed above-knee femoropopliteal bypass surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574412443317" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>All patients with peripheral arterial disease and treated with an ePTFE-covered stent between February 2009 and September 2011 were prospectively gathered in a database. In all patients, secondary risk prevention was performed according to the national guidelines, and all patients with intermittent claudication were initially treated with (supervised) walking exercise. Only those with unsuccessful exercise training were indicated for intervention. The indication for endovascular treatment was based on anatomical suitability and the preference of both patient and surgeon. Generally, covered stents were used in lesions with a length of more than 15 cm, while bare metal stents were used in shorter lesions. Anatomical suitability consisted of an adequate inflow without a flow-limiting stenosis in the aortoiliac arteries, a patent popliteal artery above the P3 level with a diameter of at least 4.2 mm and at least 1 patent crural vessel.</p>
<p>Demographics, clinical status, and medical history were noted. Procedural aspects and follow-up data were retrieved. Lesions were reviewed and scored according to the TASC II criteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443317">1</xref>
</sup> Additionally, lesion length, luminal vessel diameters, and the number of patent runoff vessels were scored.</p>
<p>Follow-up consisted of clinical assessment and duplex ultrasound scans at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Complications and additional treatments were registered in the hospital files.</p>
<p>Restenosis was defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio &gt;2.5, as measured on ultrasound. An occlusion was defined as absence of flow in the treated segment of the superficial femoral artery.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574412443317">
<title>Treatment Protocol</title>
<p>Procedures were performed using antibiotic prophylaxis with cephazolin 1000 mg intravenously. The common femoral artery was approached percutaneously using ultrasound-guided or surgically, in an antegrade fashion according the surgeons’ preference. When there was a concomitant lesion in the common or profunda femoral artery, an endarterectomy was performed. Heparin (5000 IU) was administered, and an angiography was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412443317">Figure 1</xref>). The diseased segment of the SFA was passed using a Terumo wire (Terumo Medical Corporation, Elkton, Maryland) and a catheter, either endoluminal or subintimal, and a reentry was created distally. The segment was predilated with a regular angioplasty balloon, and the endografts were positioned from distal to proximal with minimal oversizing. The entire diseased segment was covered with endografts and the endografts were postdilated with an angioplasty balloon of the same size as the endograft. Control angiography of the bypass and outflow vessels was performed routinely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412443317">Figure 2</xref>). In case of a percutaneous approach, the access was closed using a closure device (Angio-Seal; St Jude Medical, Minnesota).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, a total of 74 patients were treated with ePTFE-covered stents for SFA occlusive disease. Results from the Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem (RHA) cohort have been described recently.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412443317">9</xref>
</sup> Five (7%) patients that had been treated before with an ipsilateral surgical bypass were identified. Four of them were male and 1 female. The median age was 60 years (range 52-74 years). Cardiovascular risk factors included smoking (3 of 5), hypertension (4 of 5), dyslipidemia (3 of 5), diabetes mellitus (4 of 5), and cardiac history (4 of 5). One patient had undergone kidney transplantation and the median glomerular filtration rate was 72 mL/min (range 63-87 mL/min).</p>
<p>Saphenous vein was used for the initial femoropopliteal reconstruction in 3 patients and a synthetic conduit in 2. The distal anastomosis was always in the above-knee area. Three bypasses were left sided and 2 were right sided. The median time frame between initial femoropopliteal reconstruction and failure was 4.8 years (range 0.3-10.2 years). In 4 patients, the entire bypass was occluded, and in the remaining patient, there was an occlusion of the popliteal artery immediately below the distal anastomosis, requiring reintervention.</p>
<p>The indication for intervention was Rutherford category 3 in all patients and the median ankle–brachial index (ABI) was 0.68 (range 0.46-0.85). The lesion was classified as TASC II C (n = 1) and D (n = 4). The median lesion length was 34 cm (range 8-38 cm) and the diameter of the popliteal artery was 5.5 mm (range 5.2-6.0 mm). The popliteal artery was patent above the upper border of the patella (P1) in 3 patients and below the tibial plateau (P3) in 2. In 2 patients, the SFA was occluded flush from the origin. Three patients had 3 and 2 patients had 2 crural outflow vessels.</p>
<p>Two patients were operated using general anesthesia, 2 using regional anesthesia, and in 1 patient only local anesthesia was used. The use of spinal or general anesthetics enabled a conversion to a surgical bypass within the same session, in case of a technical failure of the procedure. Three patients were treated percutaneously, and in 2 patients, the common femoral artery was dissected. In 1 of them, an additional endarterectomy with patch was performed. In all patients, the passage was subintimal without using reentry devices, and in all patients, the endografts (heparin-bonded Viabahn Endoprosthesis, W.L. Gore &amp; Associates) were successfully inserted. In 1 patient, 1 endograft was used, in 2 patients, 2 endografts, and in the remaining 2 patients, 3 endografts with a diameter of 6 mm (n = 4) and 7 mm (n = 1). The median operation time was 76 minutes (range 60-180 minutes), the used contrast medium was 105 mL (range 80-195 mL), and the fluoroscopy time was 13 minutes (range 11-14 minutes).</p>
<p>The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. Specifically, no wound healing disturbances or postoperative edema occurred. Patients were discharged on the second postoperative day (range 1-5), with the 2 patients undergoing a hybrid procedure staying longest, respectively, for 3 and 5 days. The median ABI had increased to 0.95 (range 0.70-1.18). The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were zero.</p>
<p>Follow-up was available for all patients and the median follow-up was 18 months (range 7-29 months). During follow-up, all but 1 endograft remained in the patient. One patient needed a thrombectomy for an acute occlusion 40 days after insertion and remained patent afterwards. In 1 other patient, routine duplex control demonstrated an asymptomatic occlusion of the endografts 12 months after insertion. Due to his good clinical condition, the patient was refrained from reintervention. The Rutherford classification had increased from category 3, with a walking distance of less than 100 m before the procedure to category 2, with a walking distance of 400 m after failure. His walking distance further improved following walking exercise. During follow-up, there were no minor or major amputations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present article, we have shown that an endovascular approach using endografts after failed femoropopliteal bypass surgery is feasible and safe for long chronic occlusive lesions of the SFA. Although the present study includes only few patients and the follow-up is limited, our data suggest that this strategy could be a valid alternative for redo femoropopliteal bypass surgery. Although larger series would provide a higher level of evidence, the combination of a failed above-knee bypass, an indication for reintervention, and a suitable anatomy for endovascular treatment seems to be uncommon. In our series, only 7% of patients treated with an endograft had been previously operated, complicating comparative studies with surgical reintervention.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce postsurgical complications, due to the dissection of a previously operated groin, Ascer et al have suggested a preferential use of the external iliac artery as an inflow source.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412443317">10</xref>
</sup> After a mean follow-up of 14 months, 25 of 29 popliteal bypasses were patent, while only superficial wound infection occurred at the below-knee popliteal incision. As a minimally invasive alternative, Constanza et al have studied the results of surgical thrombectomy and transluminal balloon angioplasty for failed above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412443317">11</xref>
</sup> In their series, surgical thrombectomy along with angioplasty, however, had an unacceptably high rate of failure and limb loss in patients treated for early (&lt;2 years) bypass thrombosis. Surgical graft revision or redo bypass was recommended to achieve successful revascularization in these patients. In the present study, we have successfully treated 5 patients using endografts to create an endoluminal bypass after failed femoropopliteal bypass surgery. There were no postoperative complications and the previously performed surgical procedure did not complicate various steps of the endovascular procedure, including access, subintimal dissection, creation of the reentry, deployment of the endografts, and closure of the puncture site. Their observation supports the hypothesis that an endovascular approach is feasible following previous surgical procedures and emphasizes that the dissection of a previous operated groin could be avoided.</p>
<p>The place of endografts in the algorithm of atherosclerotic disease of the SFA is still under debate. In primary procedures, the patency rates are comparable with prosthetic surgical bypasses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412443317">8</xref></sup> often used in redo surgery. The technique, however, might also be considered as a bridge to surgery, preserving vein and preventing scar formation, related to increased morbidity at secondary interventions. On the other hand, it may be considered as a way out for those unfit for surgery or as the technique of choice for those with failed surgery, such as in our patients.</p>
<p>In 1 of our patients, the endograft occluded within the first postoperative year. Due to a good clinical condition, with a Rutherford classification that had increased from category 3 before the procedure to category 2 after failure, no reintervention was performed, indicating that an endovascular strategy may postpone surgery in an often frail group of patients. Conclusions on the long-term performance of the endoluminal bypass after failed surgery may not be drawn from the present data due to the small sample size. Patency rates, however, might be lower when compared to the primary procedures, and this seems to be true for surgical bypasses. In a series of 112 prosthetic bypasses, Aune et al have shown that results of redo procedures are inferior to those of primary procedures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412443317">12</xref>
</sup> Adequate outflow and diameter of the popliteal artery seem to be important parameters for clinical success of an endovascular strategy. Studies with a larger sample size are indicated to clarify the performance of an endoluminal bypass after failed surgical or endovascular treatment using bare metal stents.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that the creation of an endoluminal bypass using endografts after failed femoropopliteal bypass surgery is feasible and safe and could be used to avoid or minimize the difficult and hazardous dissection of a previously operated area.</p>
