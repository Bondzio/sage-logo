<abstract>
<p>In modern society, men and women want to have a successful marriage and a career. However, people are faced with new demands at work and home, and therefore, finding a balance between work and family life is a real challenge. In this article, the data consist of stories written by Finns who have been married for more than 10 years (<italic>N</italic> = 342 married couples) and who were able to combine demanding work and family lives. In voluntary statements, the respondents discussed the factors that explain the stability and happiness of their marriages. Stories were analyzed with inductive content analysis and qualitative categorizing. Seven rules of personal behavior as the resolutions of having a good marriage along with work were found as results. The results show that none of the couples had avoided difficulties; instead, the couples had created personal models of interaction that could be seen as the secret of their marital success.</p>

<title>A Glance at the Interaction Between Work and Family</title>
<p>The combination of work and family life has increasingly been studied since women started to work outside the home (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448997">Aryee, Srinivas, &amp; Hoon Tan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448997">Barnett, 2004</xref>). Two different trends can be distinguished in research on the interaction between work and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448997">Barling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448997">Kinnunen, Loikkanen, &amp; Mauno, 1995</xref>): The first emphasizes objective and structural factors whereas the second focuses on subjective and empirical factors.</p>
<p>When dissecting the relationship between family life and work, structural factors, such as work-time policies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448997">Gornick, Heron, &amp; Eisenbrey, 2007</xref>) and family policies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448997">Heinämäki, 2008</xref>) are not the only definers of a well-balanced life. Instead, recent studies have also emphasized the significance of individuals’ subjective experiences at work and in marriage. Interest has been focused on employees’ conceptions of the content of their work, work processes, demands, management, and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448997">Uusiautti, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448997">Kinnunen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712448997">Sihvo, 2002</xref>). Marital satisfaction and happiness have also been self-evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448997">Bradbury, Fincham, &amp; Beach, 2000</xref>) in order to examine marital adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448997">Glenn, 1990</xref>) as well as marital stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480712448997">Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Work and family life can be considered separate and independent areas of life according to the segmentation perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448997">Lambert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712448997">Sihvo, 2002</xref>). Home, children, and marriage are part of life outside work, and work issues are not connected to home at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712448997">Alho, 1994</xref>). Work and family life are considered separate either because they are fundamentally independent of each other because of the time, space, and tasks that distinguish them or because employees actively tend to keep these areas of life separate in order to cope with work-related stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448997">Kinnunen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448997">Lambert, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the connection between work and family, it is important to notice the two-way interaction: how work affects family life and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448997">Frone, Russell, &amp; Cooper, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712448997">Gutek, Searle, &amp; Klepa, 1991</xref>). Such concepts as permeability, flexibility, and blending can describe the border between work and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448997">Clark, 2000</xref>). In addition, the combination of these two areas of life can also be described, for example, as the family–work balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448997">Frone, 2003</xref>). Conflicts between work and family can be divided into three categories based on whether they are related to time, an individual’s stress, or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712448997">Sihvo, 2002</xref>). Indeed, the connection between work and family life has been studied mostly from the negative conflict perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712448997">Greenhaus, Bedeian, &amp; Massholder, 1987</xref>), but it is obvious that the interplay between these two areas of life also has positive consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066480712448997">Leiter &amp; Durup, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>For instance, studies focusing on the expanding and positive outcomes of multiple roles (e.g., the roles of an employee, a spouse, and a parent) embody the positive perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448997">Kinnunen et al., 1995</xref>). Multiple roles—or in other words the role accumulation that means managing a variety of roles at the same time—enhance an individual’s self-respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712448997">Gutek, Repetti, &amp; Silver, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448997">Marks &amp; MacDermid, 1996</xref>), diversify one’s personality, and improve one’s social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712448997">Gutek et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, role accumulation prevents depression and increases personal latitude, quality of life, and perceived well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448997">Marks &amp; MacDermid, 1996</xref>).Furthermore, the contrariness of the experiences in these areas of life can be emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448997">Kinnunen et al., 1995</xref>). This compensation theory suggests that an individual tries to compensate for an insufficiency in one area of life if the other, for example, work or marriage, fails to satisfy him or her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448997">Lambert, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, the concept of spillover has been used to describe the connection between work and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448997">Lambert, 1990</xref>). According to the concept, moods, attitudes, and behavior follow from the workplace to home and vice versa: work and family lives share similar experiences because positive and negative experiences and emotions tend to find their way from one area of life to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448997">Kinnunen et al., 1995</xref>). In general, spillover represents how one area of life burdens the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712448997">Alho, 1994</xref>). This kind of spillover can be exemplified with a situation where an employee who has a monotonous job suffers from work-related stress that reflects on other family members. Positive spillover occurs, for example, when skills learned at work are useful at home as well.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies and theories concerning the difficulties achieving a balance between family and work, we wanted to define the factors that explain success in marriage and work. Thus, the fundamental assumption is that individuals and families can experience spillover and compensation effects simultaneously; especially, if the aim is to specify the positive interactional and behavioral manners that are significant for the quality of marital life by those who put their shoulder to the wheel. This issue is described by Finns who work regularly and have been married for at least 10 years. They were considered experts and suitable for describing how it is possible to sustain a satisfying marriage along with a busy work life. How can success in marriage be enhanced even if one works long hours? How is it possible to have a marriage that helps with coping with demanding work and supports this area of life and does not fall apart under the strain of a challenging work life?</p>

<title>The Research Methods, Data, and Analysis</title>
<p>The empirical data consist of voluntary, free-form statements written by married Finnish couples (<italic>N</italic> = 342 married couples) who have been married for more than 10 years. The couples were asked to describe the factors that explain the stability and happiness of their marriage and to describe and explain the secrets to their happiness and long-lasting marriage (Määttä, 2006). The data were based on a writing competition organized by a Finnish magazine. <italic>A VIP weekend</italic> (a new honeymoon) was raffled among participants. The winner was selected randomly and thus, the content of a couple’s story did not affect to the selection of the winner.</p>
<p>The writing competition inspired Finnish couples, and eventually, 342 married couples participated with their own stories. The participants represented the gamut of Finnish married couples well: they represented different ages (their specific ages were not asked), most had been married between 10 and 15 years, they had one or two children, and worked outside the home or from home (domestic work was not considered work in this case). For many of the writers (<italic>N</italic> = 306), this was their first marriage, but there were also a few (<italic>N</italic> = 36) who had been married at least twice. The written stories varied in length between 5 and 28 pages. All in all, the data were evaluated as comprehensive and sufficient.</p>
<p>This study was qualitative as the aim was to find out the married couples’ opinions on the secrets of successful combination of marriage and work. The couples were asked to describe and explain the secrets of their happiness and long-lasting marriage in their own words. Therefore, they could include in their stories the issues the couples considered the most important.</p>
<p>Miles and Huberman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1066480712448997">1994</xref>) point out that qualitative data come in the form of words rather than in numbers. The issue, then, is how these words were transformed into data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448997">Coffey &amp; Atkinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1066480712448997">Silverman, 2005</xref>). Interpretation involves transcending factual data and analyzing what is at the core cautiously. Because the form or the contents of the couples’ stories were not controlled in any way, the most natural way of analyzing the data was inductive content analysis. The purpose of qualitative inductive content analysis is to describe the data verbally and to create a theoretical entity of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1066480712448997">Tuomi &amp; Sarajärvi, 2002</xref>). Therefore, the focus is on creating categories that are reasonable for the purpose of the research.</p>
<p>The stories were categorized into themes based on the common features that emerged from the couples’ stories, such as how the couples had faced and overcome hardships, what kind of emphasis they had on their shared activities, and how they described their dedication. The stories did not describe only the lightness of marriage; there were some rough experiences and survival stories as well. Finally, the results were categorized according to the specific behaviors or the models of personal interaction that represented the characteristics that are essential for success in family life, and these categories represent the findings reported in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1066480712448997">
<title>Results</title>
<p>According to the couples’ stories, seven rules of personal behavior are introduced as the prerequisite for having a good marriage along with work.</p>
<sec id="section4-1066480712448997">
<title>The Ability to Turn the Downs into Ups</title>
<p>No one is perfect nor does anyone manage to avoid relationship problems at work or at home. “The pitfalls of our relationship have turned into resources along with the difficulties,” noted one couple. Hardships either bind or separate depending on whether they are solved or tolerated. How people handle indisputable problems and conflicts, tolerate them, and, if possible, are able to solve them are the most essential factors at work and home (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448997">Gottman, Coan, Carrére, Swansson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The work drive can fade and the sparkle can go out if work conditions are unsupportive. In addition, in a work community, flexibility is needed as well as individualized options that comply with the individual’s life situation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448997">Hall &amp; Lawler, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712448997">Hakanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448997">Maslach &amp; Leiter, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>At the best, spouses are able to comfort, support, and encourage each other in the tumults of life. The relationship stays alive in times of trouble if partners are willing to slow down, soothe, stay by each other’s side, introduce new views, encourage, and seek a better life arising from even the most intolerable situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448997">Carrére, Buehlman, Gottman, Coan, &amp; Ruckstuhl, 2000</xref>). Neither will work enthusiasm wilt because of failures or misfortunes. Work is allowed to be demanding if an employee has the resources needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712448997">Kanfer &amp; Ackerman, 2005</xref>). Support is crucial even when an employee’s own belief in survival and success is shaken. At its best, an employee can trust in the work community’s support during hardships as well. Supervisors’ appreciation is important (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1066480712448997">Stoltenberg, 2005</xref>), but top workers are also capable of giving positive feedback to themselves and understand the value of their accomplishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448997">Deci &amp; Moller, 2005</xref>). All things considered, a spiral of positive resources that feeds itself should be created in marriage as well as at work.</p>
<p>Still, difficulties cannot be avoided in any marriage, nor does coping with the difficulties tell the whole story. Equally important is creating situations that fill one with joy, for example, “a bottle of sparkling wine on the kitchen table without any particular reason” or “the annual concert journeys spark our relationship.” “I feel good, familiar, and safe with my spouse. The extra edges have worn smooth along the way.” In this way, the numerous moments spent in peace and harmony become significant at home and are reflected in work as well.</p>
<p>When a spouse supports and appreciates, acknowledges, and backs up, family life becomes rewarding and inspiring: the spouses can lean and rely on each other in times of hardship. They can figure out shared and pleasing activities that cannot be done alone and that bind them to each other in a healthy manner: they feel important to each other and are happy together. Adversities do not seem overwhelming when a couple has more positives and connections than difficulties. “We enjoy being together and appreciate the life we live. We have developed our own language over the years by which we sort out things; and outsiders would certainly not understand our intentions.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066480712448997">
<title>Activity, Creativity, and Imagination</title>
<p>Success is not obvious, either at work or in marriage. Even the phrase <italic>I will </italic>does not automatically guarantee marital happiness. A marriage requires sensitivity and effort to notice each other, to support, and to gratify; and so does a functional work community.</p>
<p>“Family is like starting a business! The troubles have to be predicted, and we do not go pell-mell into bankruptcy, although bankruptcy is sometimes the right decision.”</p>
<p>“There is no free ride for anyone.”</p>
<p>It is important to find pleasant shared activities—even rituals—in marriage. These rituals refer to the repetitious and rewarding activities that spouses do together and that are impossible to do alone. Every couple creates their own universe or system of habits. They need each other to satisfy sexual needs, discuss everyday happenings, share recreation and leisure activities as well as being an intimate to whom one can reveal one’s hopes and fears, worries, and jokes. A true resource in marriage is if one thinks not only that he or she is important to the other one but also that the spouse is important to oneself.</p>
<p>One can implement the same resource in the work community as well: Various educational and recreational days, informal happenings, as well as paying attention to employees’ anniversaries freshen up and promote the drive to work together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066480712448997">
<title>Tolerating the Dissimilarity and Change</title>
<p>It is important, but also hard to accept dissimilarities and changes in the other (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066480712448997">Nock, 1981</xref>). One couple wrote, “It is a hard school for the rest of your life. A human being has a constant desire to change the other in a direction he or she wants to.”</p>
<p>It is impossible to predict the degree of changes. Only a few know in advance how they will react to changes in work tasks, the birth of a child, or moving, economic pressure, or ageing. Even the changes in oneself may surprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1066480712448997">Riehl-Emde, Thomas, &amp; Willi, 2003</xref>). In addition, the spouses’ careers can progress at different paces: one may enhance his or her career quickly while the other prefers other areas over work.</p>
<p>Because of the natural resistance to change at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480712448997">Lines, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066480712448997">O’Connor, 1993</xref>) and in family life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712448997">Gottman, 1993</xref>), people try to mold their own lives and acquaintances according to their own wishes and needs. However, everyone knows that, for example, the changes in work life are constantly increasing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712448997">Hakanen, Perhoniemi, &amp; Toppinen-Tanner, 2008</xref>). This kind of change has to be tolerated within the marriage as well and should not be considered a threat: regardless of all the changes, spouses can maintain their safe and stable family life.</p>
<p>A spouse cannot be owned or treated like an object. Family life will blossom in marriage if the partners are allowed to maintain their differences and independence. Furthermore, the differences and the inevitable changes in the other and oneself have to be tolerated. Family life consists of various risks and changes in the other and oneself that cannot be predicted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480712448997">
<title>Patience, Flexibility, and Humbleness</title>
<p>Accepting changes requires compromises, flexibility, and bargaining but not excessively (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1066480712448997">Uusiautti &amp; Määttä, 2012</xref>). The things that are and are not negotiable should be made clear in the marriage. Being a martyr is not satisfying in the end. Maybe those who are able to overlook their partner’s annoying characteristics, small faults, and soft spots enjoy their relationships the most. The ability to enjoy or notice the other one’s good qualities may lead to happiness and success in family life and at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712448997">Femlee, Sprecher, &amp; Bassin, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In everyday life, patience can be evinced in several ways. A good example is a sentence that one Finnish man considered the secret to marital satisfaction: “Many times I have noticed that there is a more efficient phrase than ‘I love you’; it is ‘You are right’.”</p>
<p>Additionally, a sense of humor is just as important as the Swedish word for <italic>love</italic> expresses: Kär- lek (= <italic>love-play</italic>). Love and playfulness belong together. Humor helps solving and handling many work-related problems as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1066480712448997">
<title>Acknowledging, Supporting, and Admiring</title>
<p>“See, notice, hear the other but do not ignore.” A benign atmosphere results from caring and being interested in each other’s well-being without ignoring oneself. Words such as <italic>thank you, you make me happy,</italic> or <italic>I appreciate what you have done</italic> are of great importance. There is no reason not to say these words nor do they lose their value even with considerable use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066480712448997">Määttä, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712448997">2006</xref>). There are as many ways to fill the spouse with joy and nourish love as there are couples. “It is strange to notice how little our life depends on the big solutions and how much on the small ones that we have to do all the time.” According to the participants’ stories, little, everyday things are meaningful: “He gives me a pillow or a blanket when I seem tired” or “I am entitled to read the front page of the newspaper first.”</p>
<p>Therefore, the smallest everyday happenings affect the atmosphere in family life. Cultivating the atmosphere is everybody’s responsibility that cannot always be passed off to others. Thus, a positive atmosphere is significant, whereas continuous criticism, detraction, and nullification poison the atmosphere, and the spiral of malevolence accelerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712448997">Gottman, 1993</xref>). No one is immune to naughtiness, nor tolerates negative fulmination and understatement endlessly—and the atmosphere at home can affect one’s work and vice versa (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1066480712448997">Turner, Barling, &amp; Zacharatos, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A loving spouse and family do not suppress but, at their best, make one feel good and accepted as one is and, at the same time, give space to renew and develop oneself in a direction that one desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1066480712448997">Pukkala, 2006</xref>). The positive feedback given by one’s spouse inspires and supports. According to the Finnish couples’ stories, it is worth asking who would even be a better trendsetter for development than a life companion?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1066480712448997">
<title>Commitment and Dedication</title>
<p>Without proper concentration, work does not go right. Neither will the love life satisfy if one’s attitude towards one’s partner is a cavalier, <italic>let us see</italic> style. If one does not devote oneself to the relationship sufficiently, it will not satisfy. Commitment means a willing and strong decision to stick to that particular job or relationship and not to give up easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1066480712448997">Pukkala, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Love and commitment to work are manifested through employees’ determination and orderliness. An impulsive way of taking care of things or trusting that things will go right eventually hardly helps an individual succeed in human relationships either: A couple should reflect on the condition of their marriage in the same way as their own physical shape. If keeping fit requires a half-an-hour of exercise three or four times a week, the couple should spare at least that much time taking care of their relationship.</p>
<p>“The priorities should also be manifested by the division of one’s time.” When having got used to fixed schedules at work, the same practice can be carried out successfully in a marriage: to compare schedules and make agreements. A couple might and should make time for evenings at home and shared activities when it is easier to hold on to them.</p>

<title>Respecting Oneself</title>
<p>When a human being considers oneself, one’s own strengths, and one’s weaknesses in an understanding, kind, and human way, it is easier to transfer the same attitude to other people. One would not tend to demand perfection from the other to use time to control and look after all the time. Numerous psychological theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712448997">Gable &amp; Haidt, 2005</xref>) emphasize the meaning of healthy self-respect in creating and maintaining satisfying human relationships: “What one thinks of oneself determines one’s destiny.”</p>
<p>One cannot find the keys to success and happiness from some others’ pockets, if one does not get along with oneself. Indeed, Roman novelist Ovidius’s view launched more than 2000 years ago may turn into a ruinous attitude toward life: “I cannot live with you or without you.” Compared to Ovidius’s words, “I can live with myself, together with you” proves more promising.</p>
<p>One concrete way of knowing and respecting oneself is to cherish those things that one knows, finds pleasing, and appreciates. Love for work and success at work contribute to other areas of life and increase self-respect in an essential manner as does respecting and appreciating marriage. Yet, when work does not go well and intimate relationships have become tangled, one’s love for oneself may provide the basis for survival.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>According to this research, it seems that some common features explain how a couple can have a good marriage and success at work as well. Next, we will discuss the limitations of the original research and then expand our analysis, the implications, and demands for follow-up studies that emerged from this research</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1066480712448997">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>Writing about one’s love story or memories is not easy. Our research focused on extremely personal experiences: participants were supposed to reveal something special not just about their own lives but others’ as well. Yet, everything cannot be written down nor do people even want to tell everything (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712448997">Kyrönlampi-Kylmänen &amp; Määttä, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The stories used as data in this research represented filtered narrations to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1066480712448997">Rosenthal, 1991</xref>). One can paper over some events and highlight some others. Memories or stories are always summaries of the courses of events and reconstructed afterward by the tellers. Memory is also selective: sometimes memories grow sweeter with time. Some other times, reality is described as rougher than it actually was. Sigmund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448997">Freud (1992</xref>,) has pointed out this in a clever way: “All our memories are simultaneously curtains and screens where the past is reflected molded by the present” (p. 322).</p>
<p>When it comes to the reliability, one salient question in this research is the selected group of participants. However, every side of a marriage—the fascination of love and its crises, daily routines and festive moments, dreams come true and heartbreaks, arguments and harmony, growing apart and reuniting—was brought up in the stories. In this research, every couple reported having argued at least sometimes. None of them claimed that they live in a perfect relationship, are totally happy, or enjoy their spouses all the time. Everyone admitted that they had become frustrated or sad every now and then. The life of the married couples who participated in this research appeared extremely manifold. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the participants represented the average married couples well: the only criterion was that their marriage had lasted for at least 10 years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is hard to estimate to what extent the picture in these stories is exaggerated or prettified. Instead, we wanted to focus on what the participants wanted to reveal and emphasize in their stories. It is significant as such (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1066480712448997">Passerini, 1989</xref>). From this point of view, the data were regarded as good and reliable.</p>
<p>In addition, especially in qualitative research, reliability also relates to the way the data is analyzed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448997">Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1994</xref>), in other words, the trustworthiness of the research. The correspondence between the results and reality is hard to evaluate since the stories already are the writers’ interpretations of the actual events or issues. Yet, the researcher’s task is to remain loyal to the data and make interpretations that are based on the information. Simultaneously, the data have to be categorized and organized in such a way that answers the research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1066480712448997">Tuomi &amp; Sarajärvi, 2002</xref>). In order to illustrate and support our interpretations, quotations from the data were added in the Results section.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have paid attention to a researcher’s ethical responsibilities. We wanted to take care that the participants would not feel misunderstood or hurt but appreciated and respected. We have also realized that qualitative research is always a personal experience that affects the researcher’s own thoughts and feelings. When writing about someone else in qualitative research, the researcher writes about himself or herself as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712448997">Ukkonen, 2002</xref>). Therefore, researchers have to reflect their position in relation to the research and aim at ethical responsibility and fair interpretations.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Today’s relationships tend to lose strength and be shaken and at the same time human relationship nets have narrowed. As mentioned before, work life sets, for its part, increasing demands on employees’ know-how and development. Having a family does not prevent one from having a successful career, too. It seems that it is more important to be ready to make compromises and to take both spouses’ hopes into consideration (e.g., Uusiautti &amp; Määttä, 2010). Furthermore, research has shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1066480712448997">Pedersen Stevens, Minnotte, Mannon, &amp; Kiger, 2007</xref>) that in dual-earner couples, for men, relationship satisfaction was associated with positive family-to-work spillover, whereas satisfaction with the housework arrangement was related to women’s positive spillover. With men and women engaging in more nontraditional gender roles in work and family domains, there is a great need to understand the impact of these roles in each domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1066480712448997">Perrone, Wright, &amp; Jackson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The pressures of competition and performance-centered society are reflected particularly in the expectations that we set for intimate relationships and love affairs. The modern friendship and romantic relationship represent the possibility of an uncompelled, <italic>real</italic> life. In a relationship, busy modern people can reveal their fragile and private sides that are not necessarily shown at work. “This is what I truly and basically am.” Then, the intimacy and privacy of a relationship may provide emotional satisfaction that is priceless.</p>
<p>Within the turmoil of changes, many lean on the power of a nuclear family. A nuclear family and intimate relationship represent a haven and breeding ground. An individual’s self-confidence and survival in the challenges of working life depend greatly on the quality of relationships and how things are at home. Acting efficiently at work necessitates satisfying emotional life and intimate relationships that fulfill the needs of intimacy, tenderness, love, and privacy. Indeed, efficient and busy work life strengthens the appeal of marriage and other close relationships.</p>
<p>However, a modern marriage has to have firm ground in order to hold together. Starting a family refers to an optimistic presumption that this union will give its best to personal and mutual life, that one can be oneself and yet trust in one’s spouse’s support. A couple has to be emphatic, tolerant, and willing to make compromises if they want their modern relationship to work. Therefore, research that is focused on successful solutions deserves to be better known. The changes in modern working life and the increasing appreciation of family yearn for models that introduce successful strategies for combining these two important areas of life.</p>
