<abstract>
<p>This essay questions assumptions about agency expressed in prevailing concepts of freedom understood as autonomy. It also turns to contexts of bondedness, where one endures and negotiates one’s embeddedness in relations of power and thick webs of sociality, to explore alternative modes of agency, of response-ability. The theoretical analysis engages two sites of communal agency, particularly women’s: first, I draw from Saba Mahmood’s study of the women’s mosque movement in contemporary Egypt; and second, I look closely at Hồ Xuân Hương folk poetry in eighteenth-century Confucian-dominated Việt Nam. One can be conceived as a politics of piety, whereas the other can be aptly called a politics of impiety. Both offer glimpses into alternative ways of being and acting in the world. Together they challenge the prevalence of a freedom-centered approach in international relations and political theory.</p>

<title>Introduction: Questions of Freedom and Agency</title>
<p>With varying meanings, freedom remains a central concept in Western traditions of philosophy and political theory. In contemporary international politics, the drive for freedom undergirds a wide range of political programs under the sign of the progressive. To name just a few, liberalism pivots on individual autonomy and gauges so-called positive and negative freedom by one’s capacity to act according to one’s own will, reason, and conscious purpose, without interference by others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412465676">2</xref>
</sup> Marxism of various stripes tends toward a conscious vision of human emancipation in its critiques of global capitalism. Feminism is not uncommonly understood as the struggle for women’s freedom, even as feminists sustain vigorous debates over what and who constitute the categories of “women” and “liberation.” Different as they are, these commitments appear to share a common denominator: a modern project of freedom as autonomy. This essay examines the limits of this modality of agency and presents alternatives.</p>
<p>That freedom and autonomy have become interchangeable concepts owes largely to a specific genealogy of freedom that may be traced back to the writings of Immanuel Kant. Aligning freedom with acting from a self-given law in conformity with a universally shared Reason, Kant places the locus of autonomy in each individual: “Every action which by itself or by its maxim enables the freedom of each individual’s will to co-exist with the freedom of everyone else in accordance with a universal law is right.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412465676">3</xref>
</sup> For Kant, abstract rationality links freedom intimately with the morality of self-governance, and significantly, as Robbie Shilliam points out, its “core imperative is actionable.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412465676">4</xref>
</sup> Given this coupling of freedom with universal reason and the categorical imperative to act right, the modern subject is expected to publicly and vocally act to overcome self-incurred limits in striving for freedom.</p>
<p>Of course, there have been important efforts to deconstruct the notion of freedom as autonomy and open up other ways of conceptualizing freedom. Homi Bhabha, for instance, locates freedom in the indeterminate that constitutes “lived moment of resistance,” which does not fall into either “the nihilism of despair or the utopia of progress.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412465676">5</xref>
</sup> In a similar vein, Jacques Derrida turns to freedom as a freedom of play with possibilities, an opening of undecided futurity, which marks democracy as always “to come.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412465676">6</xref>
</sup> For another example of significant reconceptualization, Jared Sexton refers to “the music of madness” in George C. Wolfe’s <italic>The Colored Museum</italic> (1985) to talk about “a mad freedom there where there is none, in our unending, uninterrupted captivity in the colored museum, in the baggage we <italic>do</italic> claim, in the pain we can’t live inside of <italic>and</italic> can’t live without.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412465676">7</xref>
</sup> For these theorists, freedom is not a status to be evaluated as achieved (free) or not yet achieved (unfree); it is not even a process, but rather a mode of existence amidst the irreducible heterogeneity of the present and amidst the madness of survival. A mad freedom where there is none, even in captivity, even in pain. </p>
<p>I am also aware that the question of freedom might be considered indispensable in certain contexts such as antislavery and decolonization struggles. Still, I raise at least two questions: are the notions of “freedom” or “self-determination” articulated by these struggles the same with the modern notion of freedom as sovereignty? Is “freedom” always the defining value, or are there other aspirations that frame and drive antislavery and anticolonial resistance?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412465676">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Having acknowledged other conceptualizations, other lines of inquiry, I want to make clear that the first part of this article engages with a particular dominant concept of freedom, namely freedom as autonomy or autocausality (I elaborate further on what this means later). This concept is so prevalent that despite increasing “ambivalence and anxiety” about emancipatory politics,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412465676">9</xref>
</sup> freedom continues to be widely held as a political imperative. For some, freedom lies at the heart of the theory and praxis of modern democracy and of feminism. In the limited scope of this essay, I mainly engage with Wendy Brown and Linda M. G. Zerilli, whose contemporary political theories are prominent in this regard. For others, freedom is at stake when one seeks the epistemological and ontological limits of the self as well as the ever-present possibilities of transgression for other selves. This I take to be exemplified in the works of Michel Foucault and Judith Butler. </p>
<p>While I recognize the political and ethical drives behind the insistence on freedom in both sets of approaches, I am concerned about the structure of assumptions about agency that they might harbor. In this sense, the texts I choose to analyze are not meant to single out particular authors for critique, but to examine the implications of agency underlying certain discourses of freedom. In his historical and sociological research on freedom and slavery, Orlando Patterson notes the marked contrast between the supreme value of freedom in the West and the minor weight, even nonexistence, of the concept for non-Western peoples prior to their encounter with the former.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412465676">10</xref>
</sup> If we take this encounter to be not merely an historical event, but a zone of translation between existing life-worlds today, the subject of freedom can hardly be unquestionably valorized: whose is the subjectivity that is deemed, explicitly or implicitly, to lack freedom? who is the agent that presumably can exercise freedom? which (and how) are certain bodies constructed to need or desire freedom? For whom has freedom become a primary, or simply meaningful, aspiration? </p>
<p>Built on these inquiries, the second part of my article explores different modes of agency, other than freedom-driven, in contexts of bondedness. By “being bonded,” I mean not an antithesis to being free, as much as a hermeneutic of enduring<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412465676">11</xref>
</sup> one’s embeddedness in relations of power as well as in thick webs of sociality. In such a situation, what kind of agency does a bonded body perform when she does not practice freedom or orient herself toward freedom as defined by existing political theory? How do we enunciate her way of acting and being in the world without boxing it in categories of “lack” such as unfreedom, victimhood, the subjugated, and so on?</p>
<p>My theoretical analysis draws from two sites of communal agency, particularly women’s: (Saba Mahmood’s study of) the women’s mosque movement as part of the larger Islamic Revival in contemporary Egypt, and Hồ Xuân Hương tradition of folk poetry contesting Confucian patriarchy in eighteenth-century Việt Nam. Not only do these two global sites differ historically and culturally, but they also reveal critically different forms of agency: one can be conceived as a “politics of piety” (as represented in Mahmood’s book<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412465676">12</xref>
</sup>), whereas the other can be aptly called just the opposite, a politics of impiety. And yet, both sites offer a glimpse into multiple ways of being and acting in the world, challenging the overwhelming prevalence of a freedom-centered approach in political theory and international relations.  </p>

<title>Freedom as Theory and Praxis of Modern Democracy</title>
<p>Among others, political theorists Wendy Brown and Linda Zerilli situate their theorization of freedom, power, and feminism in democratic politics in late modernity. In<italic> States of Injury </italic>and <italic>Feminism and the Abyss of Freedom,</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412465676">13</xref>
</sup> both theorists critique what they see as problematic framings of freedom and acknowledge the challenges that critics from various traditions of thought (poststructuralism, postcolonialism, posthumanism, cultural studies) have posed to the pursuit of freedom. However, they admit the abounding sense of “crises” (Zerilli) and “anxieties” (Brown) only to reassert the indispensability of political freedom in democratic political culture.</p>
<p>Revisiting Nietzsche’s logic of <italic>ressentiment</italic>, Brown suggests that historically subordinated subjects should free themselves from their “wounded attachments” to identities that are too entrenched in experiences of exclusion. The fixed and defensive claim of “I am” should shift to a more inconclusive proposal of “I want this for us,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412465676">14</xref>
</sup> in the common struggle for “some degree of collective self-legislation.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412465676">15</xref>
</sup> More specifically, who are the “us” whom the theorist addresses, who share the “dream of democracy” wherein “humans might govern themselves by governing together”?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412465676">16</xref>
</sup> They are citizens of late modern democracies actively striving to shape the terms of their lives; their acts of freedom, in Brown’s conviction, must counter contemporary forms of domination and regulation by capitalism, law, and state institutions.</p>
<p>Distancing herself from Brown’s subject-centered approach while following Hannah Arendt closely, Zerilli defines freedom to be “a world-building practice based on plurality and nonsovereignty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412465676">17</xref>
</sup> Inaugurated in the intersubjective “space of appearance,” political freedom for her no longer gets trapped by the constraints of subject formation (as understood by Foucault and many third-wave feminists), but flourishes by virtue of human plurality creating together boundless and unpredictable words and deeds.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412465676">18</xref>
</sup> For Arendt and Zerilli, freedom is beginning the common world anew together through “acting in concert,” which constitutes the public realm without any restriction to “a set of institutions or to a specific location.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412465676">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Even though Brown works closely with Foucault’s understanding of subject and power while Zerilli relies greatly on Arendt’s conception of freedom and power, their common investment in democratic politics may foreclose the question of agency in a different (undemocratic) context in several important ways. First, their focus on late modern democracies is not simply a provincial choice among many sites of freedom but is premised upon a vital link between democracy and freedom, and thereby between democracy and agency. As Brown indicates, “freedom persists as our most compelling way of marking differences between lives whose terms are relatively controlled by their inhabitants and those that are less so, between conditions of coercion and conditions of action, <italic>between domination by history and participation in history, between the space for action and its relative absence</italic>.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412465676">20</xref>
</sup> This demarcation between relative freedom and unfreedom implies that despite structures of domination and regulation by capitalism, law, and state institutions (which Brown certainly criticizes but somehow does not count them as domination by history), late modern democracies belong to the sphere of the former, where people have the agency to act. Meanwhile, domination elsewhere forces people into relative inaction (“conditions of coercion”) and smothers their agency (“relative absence” of action). </p>
<p>Second, the democratic theorists’ emphasis on the human capacity for action, for doing, for transforming through doing, suggests that other human responses to the given terms of life such as affect (that is not driven to public action), speech without “doing,” and endurance (to name a few that are more prevalent in a context of bondedness), are not agentic enough.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412465676">21</xref>
</sup> Brown criticizes the kind of antifreedom, antiprogress defeatism that could “preempt the desire to act.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412465676">22</xref>
</sup> Zerilli reiterates the imperative to act in the Arendtian formulation of politics: “Power is actualized only where word and deed have not parted company.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412465676">23</xref>
</sup> Speech alone is insufficient (it does not constitute power or freedom), because it is not transformative of the world. As Zerilli makes clear, “A freedom-centered feminism, after all, is concerned not with knowing . . . but with doing—with transforming, world-building, beginning anew.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412465676">24</xref>
</sup> This is also why there is no “public” without people, “equal but distinct,” coming together, and “acting in concert.”</p>
<p>Third, the notion of agency in late modern democracies corresponds to a “fully secularized” responsibility for oneself and one’s world, as Brown observes, “there is nobody here but us—no “structures,” no supervening agent, no cosmic force, and no telos upon which we may count for assistance in realizing our aims or to which we may assign blame for failing to do so.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412465676">25</xref>
</sup> Similarly, Arendt notes that in the modern age, acting is equated with initiating “new, unprecedented processes” of our own.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412465676">26</xref>
</sup> Hence, the exercise of freedom is equated with “participation in history,” with “chang[ing] the conditions under which things are given to us.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412465676">27</xref>
</sup> There is no freedom under “domination by history” just as there is no agency in simply living with the conditions of life that we inherit. Distinct from agency conceived in other times and spaces, modern agency is attributed to human beings only, not to divinities, cosmic forces, or any superhuman presence such as spirits and ghosts.</p>
<p>Fourth, despite both theorists’ explicit attempt to move away from the claim to sovereignty, their theories of collective politics remain trapped in it. Let us look again at their formulations: Brown advocates a shift from “I am” to “I want this for us,” while Zerilli shifts from a subject-centered “I will” to a world-building “I can.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412465676">28</xref>
</sup> In both cases, the sovereign “I” still marks the beginning anew. Even though Zerilli insists on the intersubjective “space of appearance” as the creative site of world-building, such intersubjective space is premised on an “I-can” subject of appearance geared toward transforming individual and collective fate. The project of freedom as autonomy, then, is not limited to liberalism as Brown critiques,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412465676">29</xref>
</sup> but is perhaps specific to a modern epistemic structure wherein, as Talal Asad points out, “the paradigmatic agent is the human individual” and “self-constructive <italic>action</italic>” is central to the politics of consciousness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412465676">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Theoretically presupposing an essential link between freedom and modern democracy, whether intentionally or not, privileges a particular model of agency, namely modern and secular, which consciously works to reinvent the world through an action-centered democratic public. Contemporary theorists should be careful not to relegate those constituted outside of secular modernity to a realm bereft of freedom and agency. I do not believe Brown and Zerilli would endorse such relegation, yet this worry remains and needs addressing: other times (nonmodern) and other spaces (nondemocratic) are produced as lesser, as long as other ways of being and acting in the world are not recognized as human/agency because they are seen, under modern secular eyes, as neither politically active nor world transformative. <italic>They </italic>do not make history. <italic>They</italic> are not free to begin anew.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0304375412465676">
<title>Freedom and Critique</title>
<p>Foucault provides two important insights into the practice of critique. First, critique is always anchored in the terms that have formed the subject historically rather than springs from exteriority.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412465676">31</xref>
</sup> Second, critique makes possible transgression: “the critique of what we are is at one and the same time the historical analysis of the limits that are imposed on us and an experiment with the possibility of going beyond them.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412465676">32</xref>
</sup> Echoing Foucault, Butler finds “construction” and “agency” inseparable, the former inevitably enabling the latter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412465676">33</xref>
</sup> Sharing with him a faith in transgressive critique, she reiterates the enormous potential for self-transformation at the crucial joint between the “limits of what I might become and the limits of what I might risk knowing.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412465676">34</xref>
</sup> At stake in this “permanent critique of ourselves,” for both Foucault and Butler, is liberty, or the capacity to “separate out, from the contingency that has made us what we are, the possibility of no longer being, doing, or thinking what we are, do, or think.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412465676">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In his theorization of power, truth, and the subject, Foucault is quite persistently committed to a politics of resistance, to “freedom’s refusal to submit” to power relationships.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412465676">36</xref>
</sup> Consistent with his idea of critique as the art of “reflective indocility,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412465676">37</xref>
</sup> Foucault upholds freedom as a practice rather than a program or an institutionalized state: “‘Liberty’ is what must be exercised.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412465676">38</xref>
</sup> He turns to “ascetic” living in Greek and Roman times as an example of practices of freedom: “an exercise of self upon self by which one tries to work out, to transform one’s self and to attain a certain mode of being.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412465676">39</xref>
</sup> Foucault’s employment of the Greek <italic>ethos</italic>—a manner of being, a care for self that is also a care for others<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412465676">40</xref>
</sup>—could yield insights into thinking about possible modes of bonded agency that do not fold into the disciplinary separation of ethics from politics or of the private from the public.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Foucault precludes the possibility of such a translation across contexts by differentiating between the flexibility of a field of relations of power and the rigidity of a state of domination. Only the former counts as a space of “strategic” interactions, where there is “a perpetual mobility, an essential fragility, or rather an intermingling”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412465676">41</xref>
</sup> that can alter or undo various relationships of power, where practices of freedom can thrive. On the contrary, the latter state of domination consists of “congealed,” “invariable” relations of power that prevent “all reversibility of movement” and render the practice of liberty either nonexistent or “only unilateral” or “extremely confined and limited.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412465676">42</xref>
</sup> This special classification of “a state of domination” discursively incapacitates those subject to it, such as a married woman in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for whatever she does in or to her marriage amounts to hardly anything but “a certain number of tricks.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412465676">43</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Butler’s theory of performative resignification, however, may help us discern more than a bag of tricks. If norms are instituted and naturalized through a “stylized repetition of acts,” they can be destabilized by “a failure to repeat, a de-formity, or a parodic repetition” that exposes their vulnerable construction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0304375412465676">44</xref>
</sup> In other words, just as a body can obey structures of power by behaving according to what is disciplined to be normal in terms of gestures, movements, desires, intercourses, the same body can also defy and subvert the same structures by staging unruly acts, bodily and discursively. Drawing from Derrida’s notion of the performative, Butler argues, “That moment in which a speech act without prior authorization nevertheless assumes authorization in the course of its performance may anticipate and instate altered contexts for its future reception.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412465676">45</xref>
</sup> By conceptualizing agency in linguistic and corporeal terms, Butler renders agency intelligible even for those subject to a “state of domination.”</p>
<p>Yet, Butler does share with Foucault, as well as Brown and Zerilli, a desire for inexhaustible transformation of the self that breaks from the context in which the self is. The “how” of transformation varies with each theorist: desubjugation of the subject through practices of austerity (Foucault) and through subversive performativity (Butler), a plural space of appearance filled with world-building I-can (Zerilli), and a collective self-legislation of “I want this for us” (Brown). Nevertheless, for all of them, politics and freedom hang on the possibility of “beginning anew.” They all share a project of freedom as autonomy or autocausality insofar as they aspire toward a freedom which is “self-grounding,” which is “first and foremost, freedom from the given.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412465676">46</xref>
</sup> To clarify, freedom as autonomy here is not so much a complete break from the given as a <italic>limitless</italic> drive to transgress one’s limit at a given moment and to reinvent one’s individual and collective self. This is epitomized by, albeit not restricted to, Foucault’s theorization of transgression, which emphasizes the interminable making and unmaking of limits: “The death of God does not restore us to a limited and positivistic world, but to a world exposed by the experience of its limits, made and unmade by that excess which transgresses it.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412465676">47</xref>
</sup> In order to practice freedom and grow autonomy in this sense, deemed as full political subjects are those capable of self-consciousness, self-understanding, self-representation, and self-recreation/creation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412465676">48</xref>
</sup> Such a concept of self and freedom curbs the terrain of intelligible agency.</p>
<p>This is where I depart from contemporary political theorists and, again, raise questions about bonded agency that they do not ask and thus cannot answer: can we imagine ways of acting that do not aim to uproot settled norms and at the same time do not merely reinscribe them either?

</sup> Regarding the specific circumstances of bondedness on which I reflect below, can we contemplate a politics of piety without deeming acts of piety a mere submission to fixed relations of power?

<title>A Politics of Piety</title>
<p>Saba Mahmood’s recent work on the women’s mosque movement in Cairo, Egypt, challenges a wide spectrum of political and theoretical operations: liberal sensibilities, freedom-centered feminist projects, along with poststructuralist analyses of agency. Where secular liberals find pious submission passive and, oftentimes, viscerally repugnant, Mahmood draws attention to Egyptian women’s self-reflexive efforts to reconfigure their traditions. Where liberatory feminists exhort all women to unchain themselves from servile docility to orthodox patriarchy, Mahmood’s interactions with the women in the mosque movement elucidate their “embodied forms of attachment” that are embroiled in particular modes of subjectivation. Last but not least, where radical poststructuralists such as Foucault and Butler insist on transgression and subversion, Mahmood’s study of the Islamic Revival shows that the trope of resistance is inadequate in understanding “modes of action indebted to other reasons and histories.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412465676">50</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Mahmood’s ethnographic accounts and theoretical insights shed light on women’s agency under circumstances wherein they are not only wedded to structures of authority that modern theorists like Brown might brand as “domination by history” but women’s thinking, feeling, and being is also knitted in a thick social network rather than individually inaugurated (here I refer to the liberal notion of autonomous freedom as well as theories of agency that begin with “I-will,” “I-can,” “I-want,” “I-practice,” etc.). In what follows, I look closely at two anecdotes from Mahmood’s work to draw out that in between the binary dictates of repressive subordination and transformative opposition exists the inescapable entanglement of day-to-day negotiations with the conditions of living.</p>
<p>Consider first the story of Abir whose husband, Jamal, initially objected to her intensifying mosque involvement since it appeared backward in the eyes of his “worldly” friends and colleagues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0304375412465676">51</xref>
</sup> While he sneered at her pious activities, pressured her to abandon her religious studies, not to mention threatening to take a second wife, Abir gently enjoined him to pray with her, at times mocked his yearning to be “civilized and urbane,” other times sternly refrained from interacting with him, and often invoked God’s rights over him and the consequences of the Hereafter. Gradually, Jamal was persuaded to pray more regularly and even visited the mosque occasionally with his wife. It is important to note here that Abir and Jamal are bound together not only by marriage (which, we are told, is stringently demanded for women in Egypt) but also by a common faith in God (even though Jamal observes his faith much more loosely than Abir). Abir’s response to conflicts with or harassment from Jamal, therefore, was much less likely to break off the relationship than to attempt to hold Jamal morally and socially answerable for the Islamic values and principles that mutually structured their understandings of life. Abir’s action, accordingly, was neither open defiance of her husband nor docile capitulation to her husband’s pressure, but adjusted along a versatile and resilient range of humor, cajoling, reminding, teasing, prayer, gentle admonition, and so on. In this kind of scenario, “strategic” interactions do not abruptly alter or undo relations of power (or even aim to do so) in the Foucauldian sense of the word, but take time to meaningfully negotiate common terms of everyday living.</p>
<p>This story calls into question the familiar epistemic structure that exalts modernity as a liberatory space where one acts according to one’s wishes, as opposed to stultifying “tradition” that only suppresses individual desires.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0304375412465676">52</xref>
</sup> Such a polarization, as Mahmood points out, is premised upon the distancing of an autonomous interiority from external social forces.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412465676">53</xref>
</sup> It gives a seemingly black and white picture of individual freedom and agency: either one (more or less) has it or does not. But how do we conceive of a kaleidoscope of agency when, as Mahmood suggests, socially prescribed forms of conduct do not merely inhibit individual potentialities but act as “the ‘scaffolding’ . . . through which the self is realized?”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412465676">54</xref>
</sup> What if the self <italic>is</italic> the bonds that “knead” it, to borrow the language of “The Floating Cake”? This understanding of the relationship between oneself, others, and the world is often mistaken to be fatalism, wherein people supposedly accept everything without questions, without objection, without acting to change anything for their lives. On the contrary, conducting oneself with/in bonds calls for a highly nuanced and elastic range of dexterity and mobility in order to steer the course of interactions as well as to maneuver relations of power. Abir certainly did not silence her desire; she expressed it supplely. Her flexible and untiring labor gradually did yield fruit when Jamal started changing his manners. What made Jamal change? Of course, it could well have been that he, like many husbands in his case, would not have cared at all. Yet to the extent that he did, what made Jamal listen to his wife when he was so averse to her pious activities at first and, given his patriarchal authority, could have simply ignored her, if not harshly disciplined her or left her?</p>
<p>Bonds do not bind people unilaterally; they are often shared, no matter how unevenly. Bonded relationships, therefore, can demand bonded response-ability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412465676">55</xref>
</sup> An injustice is rarely framed as a generalizable wrong against an individual, which could be documented and intervened from afar,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0304375412465676">56</xref>
</sup> as in liberal discourses of human rights. Rather, the gravity of a wrong often lies in the violation of specific bonded relationships and the promises of respect and care that they carry. Righting wrongs, then, is an appeal, a summon to live up to a responsibility that is duty-bound to bonded others. As Gayatri Spivak deliberately stresses, it is not so much a responsibility <italic>for</italic> but a responsibility <italic>to</italic>, “before will” and textural.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0304375412465676">57</xref>
</sup> Similarly, Dipesh Chakrabarty attempts to translate the difference between <italic>embodied</italic> responses to suffering, which are as old as time, and reasoned, disembodied, generalized sympathy mobilized by the modern subject to end suffering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0304375412465676">58</xref>
</sup> In discussing different understandings of the problem of widow treatment, including widow burning, he notes, “one of the most interesting aspects of widows’ own critiques—in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries—of the cruelty they received at the hands of their relatives was an appeal to an ideal subject of the extended family. How should a brother behave toward a widowed sister, or a brother-in-law toward a widowed sister-in-law? Or a nephew toward a widowed aunt?”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0304375412465676">59</xref>
</sup> This relationally grounded ethics of bonds provides another way of asking for protection and care from each other that markedly differs from the abstract ethics of inalienable natural rights.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0304375412465676">60</xref>
</sup> Facing human vulnerabilities inherent in a situation of bondedness, the former is striving for response-ability without guarantees, whereas the latter presupposes transformative interventions <italic>a priori</italic> in lieu of a deep engagement with contextual singularities.</p>
<p>Not unrelatedly, Mahmood finds the socioreligious activism of the women’s mosque movement, and the Islamist movement more generally, well captured in the concept of da‘wa, which literally means “call, invitation, appeal, or summons.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0304375412465676">61</xref>
</sup> In this specific context, da‘wa could refer to proselytization or activities that urge fellow Muslims to greater piety. Yet more broadly, whether the other is God or human or another figure of alterity, is responsibility—before will, before abstraction—not a call, an invitation, an appeal, a summons toward a singular other? When Jamal criticized Abir for disobeying the wishes and commands of her husband and threatened to marry another woman as part of his rights as a Muslim man, Abir reminded him: “You keep insisting on this right God has given you. Why don’t you first take care of His rights over you?”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0304375412465676">62</xref>
</sup> Notice that Abir did not argue back for gender equality; she invited her husband to live up to what is ethically demanded of him, his duty before God and toward her.</p>
<p>Let us turn to a second anecdote, which was a surprising experience for Mahmood. When Iman asked her longtime friend, Nadia, whether to accept a marriage proposal from a man at work who was already married, Nadia suggested that Iman should have the man approach her parents formally so that they could evaluate if he was a suitable match. At the beginning, Mahmood was bothered by this advice, which she thought was improper, until Nadia explained the larger social, cultural context to her: “[Here in Egypt, a] woman who is not married is rejected by the entire society as if she has some disease, as if she is a thief. It is an issue that is very painful indeed.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0304375412465676">63</xref>
</sup> Having experienced it herself, Nadia understood the agony of being shunned by relatives and even by one’s own immediate family for being single when expected to be married, as if something must be wrong with her. In this bonded condition, Iman’s agency (her decision to accept the marriage proposal or not) and Nadia’s agency (what advice to give Iman) were mediated tightly by the dense web of sociality in Egyptian society. The many social bonds could impose dreadful tensions on an individual (such as the stigmatizing reactions of one’s relatives and society at large in this case), but they could also envelop her in guidance, sympathy, encouragement, reassurance, and so on, and give her strength in the face of difficulties (such as Nadia’s supporting advice). They are not only the ties that bind, sometimes in suffocating ways, but also the cords that connect and channel manifold sources of support, the ropes that sustain one’s survival and might even come to rescue with unexpected lifeboats. To borrow Asad’s incisive observation, “how pain is felt is in some measure dependent on how it is expressed, and how it is expressed is dependent on social relationships.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0304375412465676">64</xref>
</sup> In this instance, social relationships should not be understood as merely constraining or enabling women’s agency (as if they were external factors), but as constituting the very structure and expression of agency.</p>
<p>The density of bonds especially add layers and colors to the picture: It is not a clear-cut situation where one’s course of action is decidedly proper or improper, fair or unfair, right or wrong for oneself. Rather, one could do right by one person and offend or disappoint another, whose effect does not simply sever fragile civil ties but deeply affect often inseverable ties. One’s action is rarely one’s own and rarely for one’s own sake only, for it is pulled, pushed, harmonized, agitated, coaxed, pleaded . . . by multiple bonds. In this sense, one could say it is always already coauthored. So tightly knitted with others, one is not necessarily set on freeing oneself from the given (though the desire for autonomy cannot be ruled out altogether), but often navigates and negotiates carefully, subtly, even artfully within the intricate webs of what’s given.</p>
<p>The above stories also give a glimpse of how one’s relationship to divinity conditions one’s agency in all aspects as well: habits, attitudes, desires, deeds, fears, hopes, and dreams. Nadia explains to Mahmood that one practices the virtue of patience [<italic>sabr</italic>] and trusts in God in the face of troubles as well as in the face of happiness. <italic>Sabr</italic> is not a practical recourse to God when needed but a lifetime relationship in which one is “To be mindful of His rights upon you at all times.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0304375412465676">65</xref>
</sup> This attitude of endurance and virtue of patience yields a mode of acting and being very different from the one resulting from Butler’s and Foucault’s attitude of critique and “impatience for liberty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0304375412465676">66</xref>
</sup> Not only is the latter lodged in “an imaginary in which humans are regarded as the sole authors of their actions,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0304375412465676">67</xref>
</sup> but it also constantly strives to operate at the limit. The mindfulness that Nadia talks about, on the contrary, dwells within given bonds and bounds of (be)longing.</p>
<p>It is plausible to read <italic>sabr</italic> as a fatalistic way of internalizing oppression, especially for women. Yet, Mahmood is careful to note that Nadia is well aware of the injustice of others perceiving women to have “failing” in them because they have not been approached for marriage. To endure injustices involves an active struggle in ways that denying their existence at all does not. Furthermore, other women in Iman’s situation could interpret <italic>sabr</italic> to act differently or, like Sana, do not think <italic>sabr</italic> will get you anywhere. The multiple responses, many a time conflicting, that the same knotty circumstances generate, show that there is never one deterministic way of acting with/in bonds, even when the bond is with God.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0304375412465676">68</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Mahmood’s insightful fieldwork and analysis make it clear that agency cannot be determined theoretically and practically via a priori principles, but must be conditioned by and emerge through relationships of power, of sociality, and in many cases, of divinity. If Veena Das cautions us that “our theoretical impulse is often to think of agency in terms of escaping the ordinary rather than as a descent into it,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0304375412465676">69</xref>
</sup> Mahmood draws our attention to the patience, fortitude, and steadfastness involved in the work to make everyday life inhabitable. In this sense, it is not as “heroic” as secular criticism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0304375412465676">70</xref>
</sup> Understood broadly as one’s way of being and acting in the world, “agency” does not belong to a single desire for autonomy, a single time line of History (“participation in history” vs. domination by it), but inhabits heterogeneous temporalities, as Derek Walcott remarkably insists, “with real faith, mapless, Historyless.”<sup>

<title>A Politics of Imp(ropr)iety</title>
<p>It is said that Hồ Xuân Hương (HXH) was a Vietnamese woman poet who lived in late eighteenth, early nineteenth centuries when Confucianism was the dominant political and ethical system in Việt Nam and poetry was an almost exclusively male occupation. HXH is a central and unique figure in Vietnamese literature for several reasons. She is acclaimed to be “The Queen of <italic>Nôm</italic> poetry” who composed most of her works in the <italic>Nôm</italic> script (the Vietnamese adaptation of Chinese characters) rather than in classical Chinese and, thus, helped forge the Vietnamese<italic> Nôm </italic>as a national and literary language. Not only did her poetry include erotic subtexts and various criticisms of established conventions, but it was also unorthodox in its quotidian composition, including its everyday subjects and folklore references.</p>
<p>HXH’s daring, subtle, and witty poetry has remained one of the most popular verses on Vietnamese people’s lips till today.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0304375412465676">72</xref>
</sup> She is most admired for poems with double entendres that broach taboo topics and thereby far exceed the propriety codes for women in a Confucian-dominated society. They embody what I call a politics of impiety (which means not godlessness as much as irreverence in the face of cemented authority), whose expression of agency is in striking contrast to the politics of piety that Mahmood explores. This following poem is typical of HXH’s style:<verse-group>
<verse-line>Quả Mít</verse-line>
<verse-line>Thân em như quả mít trên cây,</verse-line>
<verse-line>Da nó sù sì, múi nó dày.</verse-line>
<verse-line>Quân tử có yêu thì đóng cọc,</verse-line>
<verse-line>Xin đừng mân mó nhựa ra tay.</verse-line>
<verse-line>(The Jackfruit<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0304375412465676">73</xref>
</sup>
</verse-line>
<verse-line>My body is like a jackfruit on a tree,</verse-line>
<verse-line>With rugged skin and thick flesh,</verse-line>
<verse-line>Virtuous sir, if you love me, drive in your stick.</verse-line>
<verse-line>Don’t just fondle, or the sap will stain your fingers.)</verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>
<p>One plausible way of reading this sexually evocative poem is to applaud it as a courageous act of resistance against the protocols of “proper” women’s conduct commanded by Confucian authority. The last line can be interpreted to be HXH’s implicit rebuke of a patriarchy that allowed men to sleep around casually while confining women to be chaste. In Butler’s terms, HXH’s poem can be lauded as an insurrectionary speech act which was not authorized to be visible but “assume[d] authorization in the course of its performance.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0304375412465676">74</xref>
</sup> It deformed, rather than consolidated, norms and upset the established order by discursively moving what had been culturally unintelligible to the domain of the speakable. In this way, HXH’s insurrectionary speech act was a new beginning in the slow process toward proliferating plural voices of sex and gender.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one can opt for a contrary view that ascribes little to no agency to HXH. So what if she wrote a few poems that voiced her dissatisfaction with the patriarchal society? At the end of the day, she, like other women of her time, continued to be a jackfruit that men fondled as they pleased because men held the ultimate power in the state of domination. The most damning “proof” of the futility of whatever HXH did was her woeful married life. Even though her poem “Sharing Husband”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0304375412465676">75</xref>
</sup> is a well-known condemnation of concubinage, in actuality, HXH stayed an unhappy concubine in more than one conjugal relation. Her poems, unfortunately, were mere curses at an irreversible dominance; they altered nothing.</p>
<p>Differing from both of the above views, I propose an alternative reading. It is a mistake to measure agency by one’s ability to undo asymmetrical relations of power, for such monopolistic rendering of agency is blind to many other forms of inhabiting relations of power, including the politics of piety that Mahmood’s study demonstrates. I find the Butlerian interpretation more compelling: HXH’s poetry was transgressive in the sense that it did not merely repeat but irreverently split from Confucian patriarchal norms. However, I remain skeptical of attempts to incorporate her speech act into a transformative logic oriented toward a new order of epistemology and ontology.</p>
<p>Let me first speak on the irreverence of HXH’s poetry. Her bold eroticism powerfully shakes the dominant image of women as a pure and unsullied sexual being, an image, needless to say, entrenched not only in Confucian-dominated societies. What is more, her deliberately vulgar language troubles the prim-and-properness of classical poetry and the literary piety accompanying it. If the classical form contemplates typical subjects like mountains, rivers, gardens, past glories, and so on, HXH feels completely at home in the most commonplace subjects, from rice cake to jackfruit. If classical poetry feeds on elegant and sophisticated word choices, her colloquial—often purposefully crude or bawdy—word plays come right off the streets or the markets, even as she skillfully satisfies all the matching of tones and rhymes required in a four-line or eight-line poem.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that HXH’s daring impropriety challenges the stifling orthodoxy of her time as well as modernity’s binary structure that claims audacity, openness, creativity, and self-expression for itself while equating tradition with modesty, concealment, unreflective repetition, and quiet submission. Nevertheless, contemporary readers should think twice before projecting what they take to be self-evidently progressive (by modern standards) onto HXH’s poetry. Many have commented that her openness about “women’s rights,” “gender equality,” and “sexual freedom” shows an early feminist consciousness. In various ways, she is deemed a protofeminist, a protoliberal, or a protoradical.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0304375412465676">76</xref>
</sup> Again and again, she is appreciated for being so incredibly “ahead of her time.” But what does it mean to read HXH’s poetry not as ahead of her time but in it and in ours? What does it take to read her as our contemporary, to learn to learn from her sense of the world?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0304375412465676">77</xref>
</sup> If we hesitate to appropriate her into some form of being proto-us, what potential alternative to modern politics and ethics might open up?</p>
<p>To begin with, HXH never uses terms such as “rights,” “equality,” “sex,” or “freedom.” The language of her contestation remains within social and cultural conventions. In “The Jackfruit,” she does not demand gender equality; she asks the man to commit, “If you love me, drive in your stick.” The poem’s vivid sexual innuendo lends itself to a reading that she is asking for pleasure, that her radicalness lies in her demand for sexual enjoyment when “the prime function of sex was to produce a male heir and to provide pleasure for men.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0304375412465676">78</xref>
</sup> This is plausible, yet it does not account for why she mentions “<italic>yêu</italic>” (love) at all (or “<italic>thương</italic>” in “The Snail”—see below for another poem with a similar structure). In fact, love is the very condition for pleasure: “<italic>có yêu thì . . . </italic>” (“if you love me then . . . ”). Furthermore, to whom is she addressing this conditional? Not any man, but “<italic>quân tử</italic>” (which loses its meaningfulness in the English-translated verse). <italic>Quân tử</italic> is often translated as “noble man,” “superior man,” “scholar-gentleman,” or “exemplary person.” Literally meaning “son of the Emperor,” <italic>quân tử</italic> is the Confucian model of an honorable man who cultivates five cardinal virtues: <italic>nhân</italic> (humanity), <italic>lễ</italic> (propriety), <italic>nghĩa</italic> (righteousness), <italic>trí</italic> (wisdom), and <italic>tín</italic> (loyalty). In addressing <italic>quân tử</italic>, HXH appeals to the ethics of bonds grounded in Confucianism, asking the man to live up to the shared ideal. Does she look for an exit out of her situation of bondedness or does she seek a lasting loving bond <italic>inside</italic> it?</p>
<p>In addition to associating HXH’s poetry with pleasure and “sexual freedom,” modern readers often attribute to her the desire to break with suffocating conventions, assuming a sharp distinction between an individual interiority and social external forces. The question is worth asking again: what if the self is the bonds that knead it? Even though Confucianism is said to be more human-centered than other religions because its precepts call for ethical cultivation without mediating it through a God, the Confucian concepts of <italic>phận</italic> (fate or lot) and <italic>duyên</italic> (kismet) still produce “the practical and conceptual implications of a religious imaginary in which humans are considered to be only partially responsible for their own actions.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0304375412465676">79</xref>
</sup> <italic>Phận</italic> and <italic>duyên</italic> appear in many of HXH’s poems, sometimes as lamentation, sometimes as a yearning for love. Consider the significance of <italic>duyên</italic> in one of the well-known poems:</p>
<verse-group>
<verse-line>
<italic>Miếng Trầu</italic>
</verse-line>
<verse-line>
<italic>Quả cau nho nhỏ miếng trầu hôi</italic>
</verse-line>
<verse-line>
<italic>Này của Xuân Hương mới quệt rồi</italic>
</verse-line>
<verse-line>
<italic>Có phải duyên nhau thì thắm lại</italic>
</verse-line>
<verse-line>
<italic>Đừng xanh như lá bạc như vôi!</italic>
</verse-line>
<verse-line>(Betel</verse-line>
<verse-line>A small areca nut, a piece of betel leaf</verse-line>
<verse-line>Here, Xuân Hương has smeared it</verse-line>
<verse-line>If it is kismet, let it be red</verse-line>
<verse-line>Don’t be green as leaf, white as lime!</verse-line>
</verse-group>
<p>This poem is based on the popular custom of chewing betel in Việt Nam. A piece of areca nut is rolled in a betel leaf, which is then smeared with lime paste; when chewed, this betel combination yields a red juice in the mouth. Traditionally, betel and areca symbolizes marriage and true love.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0304375412465676">80</xref>
</sup> People offer betel at weddings, but also at home when guests come over. Hence the saying “<italic>miếng trầu là đầu câu chuyện</italic>” (betel is the start of the conversation). Here, Xuân Hương’s betel is the start of what? The root of <italic>duyên</italic> (kismet) means to “join” or “glue together.” Far from wanting to “break free,” by offering betel, she invites the man to a lifetime bond of love. Playing on the double meanings of <italic>bạc</italic> (white), which refers to the white color of the lime paste as well as lovelessness, she tells him: Don’t be loveless.</p>
<p>In other poems where the woman’s fate is precarious or woeful, instead of understanding the circumstances to be ridden with gender inequality and reform-needed, HXH reaches for the most dignified possibilities that she can imagine in her lot. In “The Floating Cake,” <italic>phận </italic>appears right on the first line, conditioning what is to unfold. Through to the last line, she stays true to the Confucian ethics of “<italic>tấm lòng son</italic>” (a metaphor for unyielding integrity): “Firm or smashed, depending on hands that knead me/Deep inside I retain my pure red heart.” The visual image is of a floating cake, while the affirmed virtue is of a faithful woman. In “Sharing Husband,” she concludes that had she known the damned lot of a concubine, she “would have settled for being alone.” There is a sense of endurance in HXH’s poetry that resembles the women’s practice of patience in the mosque movement in Egypt: an everyday inhabiting of an oppressively painful condition with all the dignity one can muster. This idea of fate-bound “causality” does not fatalistically determine human course of action,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0304375412465676">81</xref>
</sup> but it does constitute human agency in a way that is different from the idea of secular or historical agency. Human agency here means acting in concert not only with those visible around you but also with those humans, forces, and imagined presences, seen as real even if not evidently observable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0304375412465676">82</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to what the content of HXH’s poems intimates about her mode of agency, the very form of her speech act is revealing. Rather than being directly conveyed, her erotic unruliness is always ambiguously (albeit not obscurely) coded in double entendres with creative puns, metaphors, word twisting, and so on. She does not straightforwardly shift from the domain of the unspeakable to the domain of the speakable as in Butler’s formulation of performative subversions. Instead, HXH plays with the unspeakable in speakable discourse. In this fashion of doubleness, her conduct is both proper and improper. She both violates and does not violate the norms. Swinging in poetic verses, she plays the game dexterously without obeying its strict rules:</p>

<p>Butler theorizes “impossible speech” as “the ramblings of the asocial, the rantings of the “psychotic” that the rules that govern the domain of speakability produce.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0304375412465676">85</xref>
</sup> What is noteworthy here is that HXH’s poetry smuggles impossible speech into possible speech in a way that might threaten established conventions and thereby be dismissed as too obscene or too vulgar by her or our contemporaries, but the speech certainly is not nonsensical like the figure of mad utterance. Consider a remark by Tản Đà (1889–1939), a famous Vietnamese (male) poet: “The poetry of HXH is truly efficacious. On reading the beautiful lines one feels a chill . . . However, between the lines is obscenity.” Along similar lines, Dương Quảng Hàm (1898–1946), a well-known (male) literary critic, commented that “her whole collection of poetry was either flirtatious or bitter in tone” and that it was such a pity since “her style was very smooth and the sound was very soothing” and “the description of scenery and feelings was expressed in outstandingly rhythmical words.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0304375412465676">86</xref>
</sup> Both Tản and Dương want to impose a filter of propriety on HXH’s poetry, to purify its beauty from what is perceived to be her unacceptable wildness, but in that very impulse to filter lies a recognition of <italic>intelligible</italic> danger. Their compulsion to ward off HXH’s “too much obscenity” is not a response to something unintelligible, something they structurally cannot comprehend, something necessarily in Butler’s domain of unspeakability. Rather, it is a response to something that they comprehend too well: <italic>this</italic> is obscene! It’s too much!</p>
<p>A remarkable feature of HXH’s poetry is its ordinariness, its folkness. The poetic double inscriptions are, as double entendres go, subtle and ingenious, but not esoteric. More often than not, the multiple layers of meaning in her poetry are glaring to those who share the same cultural repertoire of images, metaphors, proverbs, verbal gestures, rhetoric, and so on. HXH’s poetry is often regarded as folk poetry for its everyday language. As mentioned before, it entertains cheeky slangs and casual idioms, which high-culture classical poets at the time would not have deigned to use. Its verses are frequently interweaved with popular sayings in the folklore, instead of referring to classical images and sounds. Its subjects are familiar with commoners, not reserved for erudite elites, like paper fan, snail, rice cake, jackfruit, betel, coin, drum, swing game, unplanned pregnancy, pagoda, temple, cave, monks, weaving, bailing water, and so on. Any quotidian activity or object turns into stanzas of erotic play, of mockery, of desiring otherwise.</p>
<p>Indeed, HXH’s poems should not be attributed solely to a historical individual, for the culture of oral transmission has borne richly varied versions of these poems regardless of some written record, like a subterranean current that has always existed alongside the dominant discourse. This hybrid and subaltern circulation opens yet another dimension of bonded agency: collective energy does not necessarily manifest in the form of physical gathering or conscious, intentional coaction, such as the taken-for-granted “public” in late modern democracy, the “space of appearance” that many have drawn from Arendt. Butler has recently critiqued Arendt’s theorization of this public space by asking “Who enters this plurality and who does not, and how are such matters decided?”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0304375412465676">87</xref>
</sup> Butler is preoccupied with the foreclosure and differential allocation that might constitute the embodiment of the public sphere, especially in the context of thinking radical democratic change. I am, however, concerned with a different question here, namely a temporal space of coauthorship that does not always fold into a public of bodily appearance.</p>
<p>It makes more sense to speak of a HXH tradition of folk poetry rather than “HXH’s” poetry, for no single person could claim ownership or invention of it. Like <italic>ca dao </italic>(Vietnamese folk songs/poems), each time the verses pass onto the next person, some words may be adjusted, some play added, some rhymes twisted, depending on local idioms, village customs, personal experiences, and so on. This dynamics of retelling “everyday contentment and misery,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0304375412465676">88</xref>
</sup> of (re)constructing together a reality of what is undesirable/desirable, of sharing what each other bears and dreams, differs greatly from a transgressive self striving to undo given limits through maintaining a critical attitude or cultivating practices of the self. Voicing oneself and being voiced in people’s poetry, disseminated from village to village, from generation to generation, blurs the distinctions between public and private, individuality and collectivity, past and present, action and inaction. Communal practices such as “HXH” tradition of folk poetry seem to suggest that collective coauthorship can build across disjunctive spaces and times, as agency in this context is not about deliberate and intentional world transformation or order subversion, but about daily negotiations with one’s inherited terms of existence while the world gets transformed in existence’s temporalities.</p>

<title>Bonded Living and Response-ability</title>
<p>This article begins with a skepticism toward the overwhelming tendency in global politics and political theory to center agency on freedom as well as on conscious self- and world transformation. The more cosmopolitan these theories of agency claim themselves to be, the more suspicious are their structural assumptions. At their highest level of assertion, they valorize freedom over unfreedom and construct not only a hierarchy of values but, along with it, a hierarchy of subjects: subjects of freedom are presumed to be citizens of democracy and strategic players in the field of relations of power, whereas subjects of unfreedom are those categorized as dominated by history and invariably coerced by power. Even at the most modest, these liberty-oriented theories still privilege a particular mode of agency, namely conscious transgression of established orders. The concern is not with valuing freedom itself, but as David Scott articulates, the problem is “to arrive at a single political principle that all forms of life ought to subscribe to” instead of “affirm[ing] the validity of a variety of moral traditions and forms of political reasoning which, however reconfigured by modern power, produce the varied goods of human flourishing.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0304375412465676">89</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>How, then, to speak of other modes of agency in contexts of bondedness in a way that does not reduce them to “a certain number of tricks”? This question has implications for global politics, because how we speak of them prefigures how we would respond politically and ethically to them. I admit that “agency” is not an ideal language for me to talk about living with/in bonds, for it seems to ring too closely with a certain politics of self-assertion and self-consciousness from which I want to depart. Let me make clear that I do not offer yet another theory of agency. Rather, I wish to parochialize existing assumptions about political and ethical agency while pointing to space that talks about the labor and challenges involved in “making the everyday inhabitable” (to borrow Veena Das’ phrase). I turned to concrete stories from the Egyptian women’s mosque movement and potent verses from the HXH tradition of Vietnamese folk poetry. Yet in no way should a politics of bonded response-ability be limited to the relationships specifically cited above; it is open to all kinds of ties of intimacy: faith, friendship, queer relations, relatives, sisterhood, brotherhood, student-teacher, revolutionary groups, and so on. Gayatri Gopinath’s <italic>Impossible Desires,</italic> for instance, provides a highly nuanced analysis of the complex bonds that constitute forms of (be)longing in queer diasporic texts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0304375412465676">90</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The politics of piety and impiety examined in this essay open the door, with different keys, to exploring a politics other than (again, not antithetical to) freedom as autonomy. Despite their seemingly opposite expressions of agency, women in both contexts endure (i.e., inhabit in the most profound sense of that term) and negotiate their conditions of bondedness while envisioning self-fulfillment from within, not beyond, the entanglements of power, sociality, and divinity that shape their existence. Their life-worlds are what breathe behind theories such as Asad’s: “tragedy (like pain itself) may be actively lived as a necessary form of life, one that no amount of social reform and individual therapy can eliminate forever.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0304375412465676">91</xref>
</sup> Tragedy, however, is not the only form of life emanating from the women’s stories and poetry above. In between patient endurance, cries of burden, and curses of fate, are also moments of humor, of playfulness, of pleasure, of pride, of conviviality . . . which muddles our meditations on and ability to respond to how the knotty webs of bonded relations are lived intimately. I would like to end this essay, or rather begin this difficult conversation, by echoing some crucial questions posed by Jared Sexton:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Those of us writing in a critical vein in the human sciences often use the phrase “relations of power” and yet we just as often gloss over the complexity of the idea of relation itself, and especially so regarding the relation that relation has with power, or, rather, regarding the way in which power obtains <italic>in</italic> and <italic>as</italic> relation . . . We learn not just that power operates intimately (which it does) or that intimacy is inextricable from the question of power (which it is), but that the relation between the two—when it is brought into view, within earshot, when it enters language—deranges what we mean, or what we thought we understood, by the former <italic>and</italic> the latter. What is power? What is intimacy? How do we know this at all? How to communicate it?<sup>

<p>Take the multiplicity of anticolonial discourses from Việt Nam for example. In quite remarkable contradistinction to Hồ Chí Minh’s popular dictum “Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom,” the anti-French resister Hoàng Hoa Thám (HHT), well known as the Tiger of Yên Thế, pronounced, “In life there is nothing more precious than<italic> nghĩa</italic> [which roughly means being moved to do what is right in witness of wrongs, living up to what is ethical and just irrespective of consequences]. There is nothing which gives strength and confidence more surely than loyalty and gratitude.” HHT’s writing is taken from his letters to the French authorities in 1890 in reply to their summons to surrender, “ . . . Has France seriously considered whether it is possible to rule over the Vietnamese people when these are determined not to be loyal to France? As for us, we are loyal and grateful subjects of Việt Nam. We are intimately bound to the customs and habits of our country, and we are determined not to give up these customs and habits though we encounter death. We trust fully in Heaven, Earth, and the Spirits of our country, who well understand our destiny in this world and who will grant us their protection.” See an English translation of the full text in Trương Bửu Lâm, <italic>Patterns of Vietnamese Response to Foreign Intervention: 1858-1900</italic> (CT: Yale University, Southeast Asia Studies, 1967), 137-39. HHT’s letter is pertinent to this essay as it articulates the thematic of bondedness rather than that of freedom, even in a context that is often represented to be lacking and desiring the latter.</p>

<p>See “A Preface to Transgression” in Michel Foucault, <italic>Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews</italic>, ed. Donald F. Bouchard (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1977). Regarding Foucault’s limit attitude, Ajay Skaria incisively asks if Foucault’s reinscription of the Enlightenment as the refusal of limits “not only surreptitiously reinscribes once again the autonomous Subject, but makes that subject more powerful than ever”?

<p>Foucault’s concern with self-remaking often involves potential reversibility of relations of power. See Foucault, “What is Critique?” and “The Ethic of Care.” This emphasis on reversibility is clear from the quote with which I begin this article: Foucault maintains that a woman subject to a state of domination could never “bring about a reversal of the situation.” Not entirely dissimilar from Foucault, Butler’s political and analytical energy is dedicated to insurrectionary speech act that re-orders existing epistemology and ontology. With her counterhegemonic commitment, agency must be radically subversive so that proliferation of cultural configurations alter and pluralize the reigning domain of speakability. Butler stresses the gravity of the critical task: “can we think about how, under certain conditions, certain kinds of questions <italic>cannot</italic> be posed, or, rather, can only be framed and posed by breaking through a certain prohibition that functions to condition and circumscribe the domain of the speakable?” See Judith Butler, “Critique, Dissent, Disciplinarity,” <italic>Critical Inquiry</italic> 35, no. 4 (2009): 776–77.</p>

<p>This mutual response-ability is not available to situations of bondage without bonds, such as Atlantic slavery and European colonization, which may engender a call for freedom instead. I want to emphasize still that under such circumstances, absent are the bonds between the conqueror and the subjugated, but vital are the bonds among the subjugated themselves. It is the latter politics and ethics of bonds that nourish and strengthen subaltern struggles continually but get lost in translation when these struggles are framed mainly in terms of freedom.</p>

<p>Chakrabarty observes, “The capacity to notice and document suffering (even if it be one’s own suffering) from the position of a generalized and necessarily disembodied observer is what marks the beginnings of the modern self. This self has to be generalizable in principle; in other words, it should be such that it signifies a position available for occupation by anybody with proper training.” See Dipesh Chakrabarty, <italic>Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference</italic> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000), 119.</p>

<p>Chakrabarty has theorized the coevalness between human and divine or superhuman presence eloquently: “One empirically knows of no society in which humans have existed without gods and spirits accompanying them . . . I take gods and spirits to be existentially coeval with the human, and think from the assumption that the question of being human involves the question of being with gods and spirits.” See Chakrabarty, <italic>Provincializing Europe</italic>, 16. There also exist forces that are seen as real even if not evidently observable in secular spaces: imagined national and international communities, for instance.</p>

<p>In his critique of the poverty of historiography, Guha cites this phrase from the poet Rabindranath Tagore.

<p>To contextualize the quotation, Scott suggests that postcolonial criticism should give up the Enlightenment project “in which both Marxism and liberal democracy have sought their futures, and to which . . . even post-Marxists are committed,” and along with it “the arrogance that the world’s forms of life . . . ought to converge on the consensual norm of a secular reason and rational morality.” David Scott, “The Aftermaths of Sovereignty: Postcolonial Criticism and the Claims of Political Modernity,” <italic>Social Text</italic> 48 (1996): 21.</p>
