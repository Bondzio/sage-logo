                <p>Establishing early diagnostic markers of harm is critical for effective
                    prevention programs and regulation of tobacco products. This study examined
                    effects of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) on expression and promoter
                    methylation profile of critical genes (DAPK, ECAD, MGMT, and RASSF1A) involved
                    in lung cancer development in different human lung cell lines. NL-20 cells were
                    treated with 0.1-100 μg/ml of CSC for 24 to 72 hrs for short-term exposures.
                    DAPK expression or methylation status was not significantly affected. However,
                    CSC treatment resulted in changes in expression and promoter methylation profile
                    of ECAD, MGMT, and RASSF1A. For chronic studies, cells were exposed to 1 or 10
                    μg/ml CSC up to 28 days. Cells showed morphological changes associated with
                    transformation and changes in invasion capacities and global methylation status.
                    This study provides critical data suggesting that epigenetic changes could serve
                    as an early biomarker of harm due to exposure to cigarette smoke.</p>

                continues to represent the single most important risk factor for lung cancer
                        development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812465902">2</xref></sup> The exact underlying mechanisms of this malignancy require

                Elucidation of the underlying mechanism of smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis can
                help define future strategies for early diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and
                prevention of lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812465902">4</xref></sup> and inform the regulation of these products.</p>
            <p>Epigenetic mechanisms of carcinogenesis manifest as heritable changes in the gene
                expression without involving alterations in the underlying DNA sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812465902">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812465902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812465902">7</xref></sup> Aberrant DNA methylation is the
                best-studied epigenetic mechanism and causally implicated in human cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812465902">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812465902">6</xref></sup> A global loss of DNA methylation
                (hypomethylation) and a locus-specific gain in DNA methylation (hypermethylation)
                are 2 distinct hallmarks of carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812465902">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812465902">8</xref></sup> Aberrant DNA methylation occurs
                predominantly in the context of 5’-CpG-3’ dinucleotides (CpGs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812465902">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812465902"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812465902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812465902">8</xref></sup> In mammalian genomes, the vast
                majority of CpGs are normally methylated, for example 80% to 90% of CpGs in the
                human genome are methylated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812465902">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812465902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812465902">7</xref></sup> The remaining
                methylation-free CpGs are found in stretches of &gt;500 base pairs (bps) with a
                guanine–cytosine (GC) content of &gt;55% and an observed/expected CpG ratio of
                    <underline>≥</underline>0.65, conventionally termed CpG islands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1091581812465902">9</xref></sup> Of significance
                is the genomic locations of CpG islands, which often span the 5’ end region
                (promoter, untranslated region, and exon 1) of many genes, for example ∼70% of all
                human promoters encompass the CpG islands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812465902">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812465902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812465902">7</xref></sup> Differential DNA methylation at
                CpG islands has been associated with the regulation of gene expression, and aberrant
                differential methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the genes (cell

            <p>A positive correlation between tobacco smoking and promoter hypermethylation in human

                capacity to maintain the normal epigenetic code during the malignant transformation
                are yet to be fully determined. In this study, the effect of tobacco smoke in
                several lung cell systems was examined, including the expression levels and
                methylation status of a select group of genes. Cells were exposed to cigarette smoke

                <p>The human lung cell lines, immortalized bronchial epithelial (NL-20), fibroblast
                    (LL29), and  fibroblast (Hs.888), were obtained from the American Type Culture
                    Collection (Manassa, Virginia). The NL-20 cells were grown in Ham F12 medium
                    supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 15 000 U penicillin, 15 000 U
                    streptomycin, 2 mmol/L <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino
                    acids, 10 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.005 mg/mL
                    insulin, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, and 0.001 mg/mL transferrin. The LL29 cells
                    were grown in F12K–Kaighn-modified Ham medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 15 000
                    U pencillin 15 000 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. The Hs.888
                    cells were grown in Dulbecco-Modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 4 mmol/L
                    L-glutamine, 1.5% sodium bicarbonate, 10% FBS, 15 000 U penicillin, and 15 000
                    μg/mL streptomycin. The cells lines were routinely maintained at 37°C in a
                    humidified 5% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) atmosphere. Cigarette smoke
                    condensate (CSC) was purchased from Murty Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, Kentucky)
                    and was prepared using a smoking machine designed for Federal Trade Commission
                    testing. The particulate matter from Kentucky standard cigarettes (1R3F;
                    University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky) was collected on Cambridge glass
                    fiber filters and the amount of CSC obtained was determined by weight increase
                    on the filter. The CSC was prepared by dissolving the collected smoke
                    particulates in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to yield a 4% solution (w/v). The CSC
                    was diluted in DMSO and the aliquots were stored at −80<sup>o</sup>C. For smoke
                    condensate exposure experiments, cells (4 00 000 cells per plate) were cultured
                    in 100 mm dishes in appropriate media with or without CSC (0.1, 1.0, 10, 100

                    Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
                <p>Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cells using the Qiagen RNeasy isolation
                    kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California), according to the manufacturer's
                    instructions. The concentration of RNA was determined by NanoDrop
                    Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, Delaware). The OD260/OD280 nm
                    ratios of all RNA samples were determined to be between 1.7 and 2.0 to ensure
                    that all RNA samples are highly pure. The RNA integrity was verified by Experion
                    (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). The single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA)
                    used for analysis of DAPK, ECAD, MGMT, and RASSF1A was synthesized from 0.3 µg
                    of purified total RNA using an Advantage RT-for-PCR reverse transcription kit
                    (Clontech; Mountain View, California). Real-time polymerase chain reactions
                    (PCR) were then performed using a SyberGreen PCR master mix on iQ5 Multicolor
                    Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The primers for DAPK, ECAD, MGMT,
                    RASSF1A, and GADPH were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich Oligo Division (Woodlands,
                    Texas). Primers were as follows: DAPK: forward 5’-CGAGGTGATGGTGTATGGTG-3’ and
                    reverse 5’-CTGTGCTTTGCTGGTGGA-3’; ECAD:  forward 5’-CGGGAATGCAGTTGAG GATC-3’ and
                    reverse 5’-AGGATGGTGTAAGCGATGGC-3’; MGMT: forward 5’-TGCACAGCCTGGCTGAATG-3’ and
                    reverse 5’-GGTGAACGACTCTTGCTGG AAA-3’; RASSF1A: forward 5’-GTCGTG CGCAAAGGCCT-3’
                    and reverse 5’-GCGCGGCAGCGGTAGT-3’. The reactions were carried out in
                    triplicates in a 96-well plate in a total volume of 15 µL. Each reaction mixture
                    contained 7.5 µL of SyberGreen PCR master mix, 3.8 µL of sterile nuclease-free
                    water, 0.6 µL of forward primer (20 µmol/L), 0.6 µL of reverse primer (20
                    µmol/L). The PCR conditions were as follows: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10
                    minutes, 95°C for 15 seconds, and 60°C for 1 minute (40 cycles). Quantification
                    of the relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels was carried out by determining the
                    threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>), which is defined as the cycle at which the
                    reporter fluorescence exceeds by 10 times the standard deviation (SD) of the
                    mean baseline emission for cycles 3 to 10. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
                    dehydrogenase (GADPH) was used as an internal control. The mRNA levels of DAPK,
                    ECAD, MGMT, and RASSF1A were normalized to those of GADPH, according to the
                    following formula: C<sub>T</sub> (target) − C<sub>T</sub> (GADPH) =
                        ΔC<sub>T</sub>. Thereafter, the relative mRNA levels of these genes after
                    treatment were calculated using the ΔΔC<sub>T</sub> method: ΔC<sub>T</sub>
                    (treatment) − ΔC<sub>T</sub> (vehicle) = ΔΔC<sub>T</sub> (treatment). The fold
                    changes of mRNA levels were expressed as 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup>.</p>

                7, 14, and 28 days. Promoter methylation status for the 4 genes was similar after
                28-day exposures to methylation status shown at 72 days, except the RASSF1A promoter

                were observed after CSC treatment for 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1091581812465902">Figure 5</xref>). To determine the effect of CSC on
                cell invasion, the invasive capacities of NL-20 lung cells without and with CSC
                exposures of 7, 14, and 28 days at a dose of 1 μg/mL or 10 μg/mL were examined. The

                measured in an ELISA-based assay after exposures of 7, 14, and 28 days at a dose of
                1 μg/mL or 10 μg/mL. The CSC decreased global DNA methylation in NL-20 lung cells
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1091581812465902">Figure 7</xref>). This

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>The vast majority of lung cancers are directly attributable to cigarette
                        abuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812465902">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812465902">2</xref></sup>; furthermore, a
                substantial number of lung cancers in never-smokers are due to environmental tobacco
                exposure (passive smoking).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812465902">4</xref></sup> Continued efforts are necessary to better define the
                mechanisms contributing to tobacco-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis and to identify
                novel molecular targets for the treatment and prevention of this tobacco-related
                disease as well as molecular markers for the assessment of risk. Studies have
                implicated a relationship between aberrant DNA methylation and tobacco-related lung
                        cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091581812465902">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091581812465902"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812465902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812465902">15</xref></sup> However, mechanistic studies
                are yet to establish the exact nature of this relationship by finding the sequence
                of events that lead to global DNA demethylation and locus-/gene-specific gain of DNA
                methylation, which may, in turn, contribute to lung cancer development.</p>
            <p>In the present study, an in vitro model system was employed to gain insight regarding
                alterations potentially contributing to the promotion and progression of
                tobacco-lung cancers. Due to the difficulties in conducting such studies in vivo,
                investigations of the effects of in vitro exposure of human lung cell lines to
                cigarette smoke offer a rational approach. This study provides critical data showing
                epigenetic regulation of critical genes involved in DNA repair, invasion, and tumor
                suppression of lung cells treated with CSC. Specifically, CSC treatment increased
                expression of RASSF1A and MGMT in NL-20 lung cells after short-term exposure. For
                each gene, hypomethylation increased. On the other hand, the ECAD expression
                decreased with the CSC treatment, which correlated with the hypermethylation of the
                promoter. These results are in contrast to those in a recently reported study that
                investigated tobacco-induced epigenetic events in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1091581812465902">26</xref></sup> Expression and methylation of
                MGMT and ECAD were unchanged after CSC treatment, and RASSF1A expression was found
                to be reduced, which coincided with promoter hypermethylation. It should be noted
                that this study was conducted in a different lung cell line, HBEC, and the exposure
                duration was 5 months at doses of 50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL. However, in another study
                of in vitro CSC exposure in BEAS-2B lung cells, CSC was found to reduce the ECAD
                        expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1091581812465902">27</xref></sup> as demonstrated in the current study. Cells were
                chronically exposed for 1 month at a dose of 20 µg/mL. The DAPK is involved in DNA
                damage-induced apoptosis and has been shown to be inactivated via hypermethylation
                in a number of studies involving non-small cell lung cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1091581812465902">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1091581812465902">23</xref></sup> The MGMT is
                involved in DNA repair,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1091581812465902">20</xref></sup> and RASSF1A encodes an RAS effector that has been
                identified as a tumor suppressor of many different cancer types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1091581812465902">24</xref></sup> The loss of
                expression of ECAD, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adhesion molecule responsible for
                mediating intercellular contacts in morphogenesis and tissue structure maintenance,
                has been implicated in a number of cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1091581812465902">21</xref></sup> Increased ECAD promoter
                methylation has been shown in smokers using bronchial brushings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1091581812465902">25</xref></sup> Furthermore,
                silencing of the E-CAD by promoter hypermethylation has been reported in several
                cancer types including lung cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812465902">15</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The effects of longer term exposures of CSC in NL-20 lung cells were also examined in
                the current study. The observed morphological changes suggest that CSC has a
                transforming effect, as noted in chemical-induced cellular transformation
                        properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1091581812465902">28</xref></sup> These cells showed focal areas and loss of contact
                inhibition, which also indicated that they had begun to develop invasive properties.
                Phenotypic change has been observed in BEAS-2B cells chronically exposed with
                        CSC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1091581812465902">27</xref></sup>
                Because invasion contributes prominently to the tobacco-induced pulmonary
                carcinogenesis, the effect of cigarette smoke on the invasive behavior of NL-20 lung
                cells was tested after exposures of 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days. The CSC stimulated
                cell invasion in this system. The ECAD expression in these cells remained
                significantly decreased after the 28-day exposure. The ECAD has responsibility for
                mediating intercellular contacts in morphogenesis and tissue structure
                        maintenance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1091581812465902">21</xref></sup> and loss of ECAD expression is a hallmark of
                epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1091581812465902">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1091581812465902">30</xref></sup> Chronic exposure of these
                cells to CSC decreased global DNA methylation. Global loss of DNA methylation is
                also associated with carcinogenesis, which is thought to contribute to oncogenesis
                by reactivation of the latent retrotranspoons, inductions of genomic instability,
                and activation of proto-oncogenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1091581812465902">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1091581812465902">32</xref></sup> These results are in agreement
                with a previous in vitro study in which CSC treatment was shown to produce
                hypomethylation of D4Z4, NBL2, and LINE-1 repetitive DNA sequences, surrogate
                markers of global DNA methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1091581812465902">26</xref></sup></p>
            <p>In summary, this study demonstrated that short-term or long-term exposure of CSC
                exerts changes in the lung cells that have been shown in the lung cancer in vivo.
                The increase in MGMT and RASSF1A could be in response to induced damage to the
                cells. The MGMT expression may represent the cells’ attempt to repair damage;
                however, if the cells escape repair, these cells can begin to transform to cancer
                cells. The RASSF1A, the tumor suppressor, also increased to suppress transformation
                or altered cells becoming cancer cells. This study also showed that CSC can exert
                its effects through epigenetic mechanisms. The in vitro approach provides a useful
                model in establishing causal linkages between tobacco smoke exposure and events
                leading to potential harm in humans.</p>
