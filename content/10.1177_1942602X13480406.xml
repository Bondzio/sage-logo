<abstract>
<p>In August 2012, the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Division of Nursing hosted a 2-day conference to discuss the three Ds: workforce diversity, social determinants, and health disparities that nurses face every day. In particular they wanted to begin a discussion on how nursing, which is still a field of little diversity, must address the needs of a nation that is quite diverse. The framework of the discussion focused around the need to address health in its complexity of the social determinants and health disparities that exist. The purpose of this article is to personalize these concepts to school nurses.</p>

<p>In August 2012, the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Division of Nursing hosted a 2-day conference to discuss the three Ds: workforce <bold>diversity</bold>, social <bold>determinants</bold>, and health <bold>disparities</bold> that nurses face every day. In particular they wanted to begin a discussion on how nursing, which is still a field of little diversity, must address the needs of a nation that is quite diverse. The framework of the discussion focused around the need to address health in its complexity of the social determinants and health disparities that exist. (Recorded sessions and copies of the presentations can be found at the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942602X13480406">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services [n.d.]</xref> website. The material is free to view.) After Linda Davis-Alldritt (president of NASN), Donna Mazyck (executive director of NASN), and Erin Maughan (director of research at NASN) attended the summit, NASN leadership felt it important to personalize the message to school nursing and discuss how school nurses can contribute to the conversation.</p>
<sec id="section1-1942602X13480406">
<title>Diversity</title>
<p>As school nurses, we see the interplay among diversity, social determinants, and health disparities every day. Consider that the 2011 NASN membership survey indicated that 99% of school nurses are women, and 91% are White, non-Hispanic with over 60% of school nurses being 50 years old or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X13480406">Bergren &amp; Monsalve, 2012</xref>). In contrast, school nurses work with children (&lt; 21 years old) who are male and female and who are 53% White, 24% Hispanic, and 14% Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X13480406">Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011</xref>). This means the majority of our student populations and their families come from cultural backgrounds that are different from our own. Given the differences in the demographics of school nurses and their student populations, successful work with children/families, including improved health outcomes, requires school nurses to be more culturally sensitive and have a heightened awareness of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X13480406">Betancourt &amp; Green, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only must we become more culturally sensitive, but we should seek to understand how cultural differences in health beliefs and perceptions, possible treatments and approaches to care, and differences in the metabolism of medications may impact our students’ health. This is not only considered the standard of practice, but it is the only way to ensure that a student’s health needs will be properly met. It is also an opportunity for school nurses to build a relationship of trust with students and families. This will enable mutual respect, shared decision making, and more effective communication among school nurses and students and families. In addition, as we make special efforts to reach out to students of diverse backgrounds, we can share the great opportunities available within the nursing profession and encourage them to become nurses. In this way, we, as school nurses, can promote that the future nursing workforce becomes more diverse.</p>

<title>Disparities and Determinants</title>
<p>In the United States, health disparities among minority groups (including children) are common. Children from minority backgrounds are at greater risk for chronic diseases, such as asthma or obesity, and suffer poorer health outcomes. Black and Latino children are twice as likely as White children not to be in excellent or very good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942602X13480406">National Institute for Health Care Management, 2007</xref>). Black and Latino children are more likely to be obese and be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X13480406">Children’s Defense Fund, 2012</xref>). Researchers have found that these disparities in race/ethnicity are not due to genetic differences but rather to social complexities, racism, and differences in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942602X13480406">National Institute for Health Care Management, 2007</xref>). These disparities are often attributed to barriers associated with access to basic/preventive care, low levels of cultural competence among health care providers, and a lack of cultural diversity of health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X13480406">Kagawa-Singer &amp; Kassim-Lakha, 2003</xref>). School nurses can address these issues by striving to always provide culturally sensitive care and by assisting children and families in obtaining needed access to quality health care.</p>
<p>As school nurses, we understand and can articulate the social contexts in which our students live. We know of the housing conditions of the family—those whose families are struggling to pay bills or whose parents have a lower educational level—as well as the conditions of the surrounding community and how these might impact the health and well-being of our students. For this reason, a fact sheet entitled “Home and Community Factors That Impact Health and Learning” was created to provide a graphic illustration of the prevalence of some of the social, economic, and cultural conditions that may impact a child’s health and learning. The design of this fact sheet was based on a previous NASN fact sheet entitled “Health Conditions per 100 Students.” The front of the fact sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942602X13480406">Figure 1</xref>) displays a pictorial illustration of the issues with additional data (bullets below, along with references) on the reverse side. School nurses can use this fact sheet as they work with local, state, and national law-makers to advocate for change.</p>

Undernourishment affects a child’s physical, emotional, and cognitive development. A child can be overweight and undernourished.

Research has also shown links between parental education and child academic and behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X13480406">Mather, 2010</xref>).</p></list-item>

Children from single-parent households have an increased risk for dropping out of school, becoming teen parents, and confronting barriers to success in the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X13480406">Davis-Kean, 2005</xref>).

Individuals who lack access to health care are at increased risk for delaying to seek appropriate care and are less likely to receive preventive care services. As a result, individuals who cannot afford to see a health care provider when sick (lack insurance) have inferior health status and outcomes. Data show that uninsured children achieve lower educational outcomes than those with insurance. Children who cannot afford to see a medical provider miss more days of school, experience increased severity of illness, and suffer from disparities in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X13480406">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>).</p></list-item>

Lack of transportation can be a major barrier for some families, especially for those living in urban or rural areas where public transportation is limited. Lack of transportation can limit a family’s access to employment, medical care, and quality foods. In addition, it also prevents a parent from engaging in a child’s school or other community services/programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X13480406">Athens County Job and Family Services, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>

Homeless children develop increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the stress of their living situation can negatively affect their development and ability to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942602X13480406">National Center on Family Homelessness, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>School nurses are in a prime position to assist the nation in addressing the critical health concerns of <bold>d</bold>iversity, <bold>d</bold>isparity, and social <bold>d</bold>eterminants. We witness them every day, and as advocates for our patients, we can tell their stories to law-makers and health care providers. We must address the social factors that impact students’ health needs in the individual student care plans, as well as from a population/community level. School nurses are in a key position to assist in identifying children and families at risk and partner with them to better address their needs. Copies of this fact sheet will be available on the NASN website in the near future. More material and resources on diversity, disparity, and social determinants will be available shortly on the NASN website to assist you in your practice and leadership efforts.■</p>
