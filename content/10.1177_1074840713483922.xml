<abstract>
<p>The spouse of a patient who has experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) reportedly has psychological and social needs and challenges during the patient’s hospitalization but there is a lack of knowledge regarding spouses’ coping experiences and resources. The aim of this study was to develop a substantive theory to help explain the coping experiences of the spouse during the patient’s hospitalization following an acute MI. Twenty eight spouses of patients in two Finnish hospitals participated in an open-ended interview within 2 to 5 days of the MI and included 12 husbands and 16 wives. The core category “Seeking balance” included the spouses’ emotional, cognitive, and social coping experiences following an acute MI. This study adds new information about spouses’ coping experiences as well as tensions and problems in interaction between the patient and the spouse. Challenges were reported in talking about serious illness concerns between the spouse and patient and also with other family members.</p>

<body>
<p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant source of stress and a frightening experience for both patients and their spouses. While patients experience the cardiac event, their spouses live through a parallel emotional experience of their own that may be equal to the patients’ experience in intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840713483922">Azoulay et al., 2003</xref>). The unexpected hospitalization may cause psychological and social problems for spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840713483922">Fleury &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1074840713483922">McLean &amp; Timmins, 2007</xref>), for example, causing them to lose control over the day-to-day management of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840713483922">Vandall-Walker &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>). Spouses often confront emotional, cognitive, and social stressors including information ambiguity, uncertain prognosis, fear of death, role and lifestyle changes, financial concerns, and disruption to normal routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1074840713483922">Moser &amp; Dracup, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840713483922">Stewart, Davidson, Meade, Hirth, &amp; Makrides, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1074840713483922">Verhaeghe, Defloor, Van Zuuren, Duijnstee, &amp; Grypdonck, 2005</xref>). They may suffer from depression, anxiety, fatigue, disbelief, irritability, and various psychosomatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713483922">Bennett &amp; Connell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840713483922">Bijttebier, Vanoost, Delva, Ferdinande, &amp; Frans, 2001</xref>). In this research report, the focus was on the spouses’ coping during the acute phase of the illness; defined, in this study, as the first 2 to 5 days of hospitalization.</p>
<sec id="section1-1074840713483922">
<title>Background</title>
<p>There is a lack of nursing research concerning the coping experiences of spouses of MI patients. Although it is acknowledged that the spouses of MI patients have psychological, social, and economic needs and problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840713483922">Azoulay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713483922">Bennett &amp; Connell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840713483922">Bijttebier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1074840713483922">McLean &amp; Timmins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1074840713483922">Moser &amp; Dracup, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840713483922">Stewart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1074840713483922">Verhaeghe et al., 2005</xref>), there is a lack of knowledge regarding spouses’ coping resources.</p>
<p>One significant finding in the existing literature is that the most important needs of spouses of patients experiencing a critical illness concern assurance, information, communication, proximity, support, and comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840713483922">Alvarez &amp; Kirby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840713483922">Azoulay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840713483922">Engstrom &amp; Soderberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840713483922">Johansson, Fridlund &amp; Hildingh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1074840713483922">Mattila, Luukkaala, &amp; Åstedt-Kurki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1074840713483922">Maxwell, Stuenkel &amp; Saylor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1074840713483922">Miracle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1074840713483922">Paavilainen, Lehti, Åstedt-Kurki, &amp; Tarkka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1074840713483922">Paul &amp; Rattray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1074840713483922">Plakas, Cant, &amp; Taket, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1074840713483922">Rantanen et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1074840713483922">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1074840713483922">Vandall-Walker, Jensen, &amp; Oberle, 2007</xref>; Yeh, Gift, &amp; Soeken, 2004). Spouses need information about the patient’s condition, progress, and treatment choices. They also need to become empowered and enabled so that they are able to make full use of their individual resources when striving to cope with the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840713483922">Johansson et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important area discussed in recent literature is the impact of MI on family functioning. All relationships in the family are interactional and reciprocal; what affects one family member, affects the family as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840713483922">Black &amp; Lobo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1074840713483922">Tomlinson &amp; Åstedt-Kurki, 2008</xref>). The hospitalization of a family member has an impact on the whole family system and on the equilibrium of the family system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840713483922">Fleury &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840713483922">Holden, Harrison, &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>). Having a family may help a patient and his/her spouse show more resilience during critical illness and give them the ability to endure the emotional stress caused by the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840713483922">Åstedt-Kurki, Lehti, Tarkka, &amp; Paavilainen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840713483922">Åstedt-Kurki, Paavilainen, Tammentie, &amp; Paunonen-Ilmonen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840713483922">Bohn, Wright, &amp; Moules, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840713483922">Eggenberger &amp; Nelms, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1074840713483922">Nelms &amp; Eggenberger, 2010</xref>). Serious illness can strengthen, renew, and deepen relationships between the patient and the spouse. Serious illness can also cause relationships to become conflicted and troubled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840713483922">Bell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840713483922">Lindsey Davis, Gilliss, Deshefy-Longhi, Chestnutt, &amp; Molloy, 2011</xref>). It has been reported that a MI may disrupt the whole family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840713483922">Koivula, Paunonen-Ilmonen, Tarkka, Tarkka, &amp; Laippala, 2002</xref>). From a nursing perspective, it is important to explore the spouse’s attitudes and coping resources after the patient’s MI because it may affect the patient’s recovery, emotional adaptation to the illness, and the whole family’s coping with the changes brought on by MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840713483922">Benzein, Johansson, Årestedt, Berg, &amp; Saveman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840713483922">Hilbert, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840713483922">Koivula et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840713483922">Luttik, Blaauwbroek, Dijker, &amp; Jaarsma, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1074840713483922">Svedlund &amp; Axelsson, 2000</xref>). How spouses experience a serious illness can shape the physical, psychological, and social aspects of their lives and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713483922">Dalteg, Benzein, Fridlund, &amp; Malm, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For a definition of coping, this study draws on the widely used work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840713483922">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref>; coping is seen as constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external or internal demands. There are a number of ways of classifying coping strategies. Previous research has suggested that spouses may use emotion-focused, problem-focused, and relationship-focused strategies to cope with MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713483922">Bennett &amp; Connell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840713483922">Kettunen, Solovieva, Laamanen, &amp; Santavirta, 1999</xref>). It has also been proposed that if the individual feels that something can be done about the situation, she or he mostly relies on problem-focused coping. If nothing can be done, it is natural to resort to emotion-focused coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840713483922">Lazarus, 1993</xref>). Another well-known classification includes task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840713483922">Endler, 2002</xref>). The task-oriented strategy, similar to the problem-focused strategy, involves taking action to alter the situation, whereas in emotion-focused or oriented strategies, efforts are directed at affecting emotional responses to stressors. Avoidance-oriented coping consists of actions and solutions, whose purpose is to evade the problem instead of altering it.</p>
<p>Spouses may try to manage negative emotions and stress by seeking information concerning exercise, diet, and ways of coping. They may also seek emotional and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840713483922">Eggenberger &amp; Nelms, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1074840713483922">Luttik, Jaarsma, Moser, Sanderman, &amp; van Veldhuisen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840713483922">Stewart et al., 2000</xref>; Yeh et al., 2004) and use various behavioural and cognitive strategies to reduce stress caused by MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1074840713483922">Luttik et al., 2005</xref>). One of the most frequently used coping strategies is positive reappraisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1074840713483922">Santavirta, Kettunen, &amp; Solovieva, 2001</xref>), which means that the spouse seeks to transform a threat into a challenge by focusing on the possibilities. Active engagement, problem solving, and communication have been identified as important relationship-focused coping strategies because it is essential to discuss difficult topics with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1074840713483922">Santavirta et al., 2001</xref>). It has also been suggested that spouse’s coping includes patient-related, nurse<italic>/</italic>physician-related, and self-related work. It involves the physical, emotional, and behavioral responses to crisis and stress, but also the spouse’s intense need to be present, a response to duty, commitment, and obligation, based on the spouse’s relationship with the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840713483922">Vandall-Walker &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, resources are defined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840713483922">Jones and colleagues (2011)</xref> as factors supporting positive appraisal of caregiving demands and facilitating effective coping. They may include intrapersonal resources, such as coherence and spirituality, and external or contextual resources, such as family support or community resources. Social reality, another concept referred to throughout this study, is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin and Strauss (2008)</xref> as a context in which spouses’ experiences arise and to which they respond through some form of action, interaction, and emotions. In this study, the social context is the time and place in the acute phase of illness in which coping occurs. It includes spouses’ interaction relationships and communication within the culture and habits of the surrounding society. Social reality can either support or constrain spouses’ coping.</p>
<p>The need for studies on spousal coping has been recognized by many researchers. Special attention needs to be given to spouses with insufficient resources and nonsuccessful coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840713483922">Vandall-Walker &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>). The goal of family-centred care during the acute phase after a cardiac event should be to reduce the psychological stress experienced by patients and spouses and to guide spouses to support the patient during the hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840713483922">Fleury &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1074840713483922">Plakas, Cant, &amp; Taket, 2009</xref>). In this study, the focus was on spousal coping during the acute phase of illness, that is during the patient’s hospitalization following MI.</p>
<sec id="section2-1074840713483922">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to develop a substantive theory to help explain the coping experiences of spouses during the patient’s hospitalization for MI. Nurses, who may not always be able to assess the needs and individual resources of spouses in the acute stage of a patient’s illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713483922">Bennett &amp; Connell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840713483922">Kleinpell, 2006</xref>), would benefit from knowledge of how spouses cope during the patient’s hospitalization. The rationale for the current study is to explain spousal coping experiences during patient’s hospitalization and better understand spouses’ genuine experiences as seen from their own perspective. It is hoped that the findings will be useful in developing family-centered nursing and supporting patients and spouses more effectively.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The grounded theory method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin and Strauss (2008)</xref> was used to examine the experiences of MI patients’ spouses because it allowed a focus on informants’ personal experiences and on identifying interactional influences. It also facilitated taking into account both macro and micro influences on a phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840713483922">Cutcliffe, 2000</xref>). Micro influences consisted of informants’ experiences in family relationships, whereas macro influences consisted of their experiences in relationships with other people. The need to identify these factors was justified in the study because the spouses’ experiences were dependent on varied emotional and social factors both in the hospital and at home. Another reason for choosing a grounded theory method was that it is suitable when a new perspective on everyday phenomena is required. The method enhanced the study of the phenomenon both conceptually and also as an interactive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). In this study, it was essential to understand what was going on, to appreciate the nature of experience as dynamic and continually evolving, and to explore the importance of change and process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840713483922">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). It was also important to examine the variability and complexity of life of the spouse during the patient’s hospitalization. Furthermore, it was important from the perspective of the spouse’s coping experiences to illuminate the interrelationships among acute phase conditions, the meaning of the situation for the spouse, and his/her ability to take action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840713483922">Cutcliffe, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1074840713483922">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Informed consent was obtained from the participants of the study. Oral and written information about the study was given to each potential participant. The respondents were informed that they could withdraw at any time and that all data would be treated confidentially. Permission for the study was obtained from both hospitals in Finland where the interviews were conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840713483922">Carpenter, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The spouses were interviewed personally, and with their permission, the interviews were audiotaped and transcribed by the researcher herself. The spouses are not identifiable in the research report or by the original quotations cited in these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840713483922">Carpenter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1074840713483922">Wimpenny &amp; Gass, 2000</xref>). During the interviews, the researcher paid special attention to the spouses’ feelings and resources because the topic was sensitive and the spouses were vulnerable and subject to many demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840713483922">Carpenter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1074840713483922">Wimpenny &amp; Gass, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1074840713483922">
<title>Recruitment and Sample</title>
<p>Data were collected in 2006 in two Finnish central hospitals by interviewing 28 spouses of patients hospitalized for MI. The interviews were conducted 2 to 5 days after MI, while the patient was recovering either in CCU or medical ward. Theoretical sampling, which is an integral part of the process of grounded theory, was used both in the recruitment of participants and in data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Recruitment for the study commenced after institutional ethical approval had been received. Potential spousal participants were initially identified, approached and recruited by a rehabilitation nurse as individuals whose experience might provide unique perspectives to inform the emerging theory. The rehabilitation nurse observed the investigator’s clear instructions on what type of spouses to approach. The nurse forwarded the names of the voluntary participants, but did not contribute in any other way. Additional participants were recruited by the same method until the researcher was satisfied that data saturation had been achieved. Conducting theoretical sampling went on until no new properties emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840713483922">Chiovitti &amp; Piran, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). Participants chosen had the ability to reflect and they were willing to participate in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The spouse was defined as being legally married to the patient. The central criterion for selecting informants was their experiential knowledge of the phenomenon; spouses were qualified for the study if the patient had a first time MI. Another inclusion criterion was that spouses had no cognitive or memory problems. The age of the 12 men (husbands) and 16 women (wives) selected, all of whom are Finns, varied from 30 to 78 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840713483922">Table 1</xref>). The researcher continued selecting participants until nothing new was said about the concepts being explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The interviews were conducted separately with each spouse during the hospitalization of the patient. Each interview was conducted in Finnish language in the hospital setting. A peaceful place was secured and there were no other people present or listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840713483922">Carpenter, 2003</xref>). One researcher conducted all the interviews, which each took 45 to 60 minutes. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed with the permission of the spouses.</p>
<p>Theoretical sampling meant that data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Collection of data was directed by the emerging theory; as theoretical constructs evolved, more information was sought to refine the emerging ideas. Concepts, not the participants, were the basis for sampling. In concrete terms, the participants were asked to describe their coping experiences during the time their spouses were taken care of in hospital. When asking questions, the investigator had in her mind a set of preset interview themes, which were based on the study aim but loosely formulated and flexible so as not to constrain the development of theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1074840713483922">Wimpenny &amp; Gass, 2000</xref>). The questions concerned experiences of MI, coping with the acute situation, and emotions that the spouses might have. When required, the interview questions were refocused to gain further information or to redirect the interviews as some categories became saturated and participants introduced new concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840713483922">Draucker et al., 2007</xref>). A preliminary conception of the phenomenon emerged during the data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1074840713483922">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The interview material was analyzed using grounded theory method. The analysis was based on Strauss and Corbin’s inductive method of three coding phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). The investigator began by listening to tape-recorded interviews and by reading 558 pages of transcripts in order to get a general overview and to check the accuracy of the text. At the stage of open coding, the data were analyzed line-by-line picking out all the original expressions concerning the spouses’ experiences of MI and coping. Coding was guided by questions “What is happening and being expressed here, what does it mean, what is essential and in what context is the action used?”</p>
<p>The words and phrases were categorized under a conceptual label and data were compared to find similarities and differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). The open codes helped the investigator to separate data and to see processes. The coding also helped the investigator to focus on further data collection. Similarities were identified in original expressions, which were combined into empirical codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). These were formed into substantive codes, which were divided into 20 subcategories according to code properties.</p>
<p>At the stage of axial coding, the properties and dimensions of the contents of each subcategory were examined. Properties are characteristics of categories, whereas dimensions are locations of properties along a continuum. Subcategories with similar properties and dimensions of contents were combined into seven categories describing domains of spouses’ experiences. The subcategories and categories were connected along the lines of their properties in the axial coding process, which consisted of an examination of causal conditions, the phenomenon, context, intervening conditions, and consequences. The properties and dimensions identified in data collection included the following interactional relationships: spouse-patient, spouse-family members, spouse-health care personnel, and spouse-other people. The properties also included events at the hospital ward and at home; the contextual and structural properties were also influential for the spouses’ coping experiences.</p>
<p>The inductive analysis process continued until data saturation occurred about the viewpoint of the spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). Throughout the process, the investigator returned to the original data to ensure that the connection between spouses’ experiences and the emerging theory was maintained. The final, selective stage of analysis produced a core category which combined all categories created up to that point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). An exploration of the contents of the categories and their connections, and their comparison with the notes written at an earlier stage of the analysis produced a conception of the core phenomenon. The notes helped to integrate connections between categories and to gain a perception of the social reality of the phenomenon. The core category was named “Seeking balance.”</p>

<title>Structure of the Substantive Theory</title>
<p>A core category and several main and subcategories built the foundation of the theoretical structure. The core category that evolved in this study was named “Seeking balance” and it is related to seven main categories, which explain why and how spouses seek balance in their lives: dealing with emotional stress, protective interaction with the patient, keeping up-to-date with the patient’s condition, denial of the possibility of the patient’s death, obtaining social support from family members, maintaining day-to-day routines and interests, and praying and hope (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840713483922">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Each main category was found to consist of several subcategories, which represent variations in spousal coping experiences. For example, “Dealing with emotional stress” involves the following four subcategories: recognizing emotional stress factors, recognizing one’s own emotions and emotional resources, accepting, and denying. Further subcategories are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1074840713483922">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The theory also suggests that factors influencing spouses’ coping include factors that pose coping requirements, those that promote coping, and those that interfere with coping. These three sets of factors are preceded and influenced by causal, contextual, and intervening factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840713483922">Figure 1</xref>). Conceptual interrelations and connections between these factors explain why spousal coping manifests itself as “seeking balance.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1074840713483922">
<title>Core Category: Seeking Balance</title>
<p>The core category “Seeking balance” explains the spouses’ emotional, cognitive, and social coping experiences with the effects of MI during the patient’s hospitalization. The situation is characterized by spouses’ need to find balance in relation to their own emotions and physical and psychological resources. Spouses also experience a need to seek and maintain balance in their relationships, especially with the patients but also with other family members. Seeking balance can be seen as a complex phenomenon, whose central feature is the spouses’ need to control, change, or avoid demands that occur externally in the environment or internally within themselves.</p>
<p>Seeking balance can also be defined as a short process with variations under different conditions. The variation in spouses’ experiences can be explained by personal factors, by the conditions under which it can be detected, and by some of the consequences of action, interaction, and emotional responses. In other words, seeking balance consists of spouses’ psychological processes, their dealing with difficult and stressful emotions, and their facing and attending to challenges and demands posed by the surrounding social reality. It seems typical of spouses that they seek to maintain the safety of everyday continuity and to avoid things which induce anxiety and fear. Seeking balance manifests itself as a dynamic phenomenon, which can also be understood as a continuum, on which acceptance and denial alternate consistent with spouses’ experiences and psychological resources. The phenomenon of seeking balance is strongly influenced by factors posing coping requirements, by factors promoting coping, and by those interfering with coping.</p>
<p>Finally, seeking balance can be seen as the result of action and interaction between the spouse and the patient; between the spouse and health-care personnel; and also between the spouse and other family members. There exists, for example, great variety in interaction episodes between the spouse and health-care personnel depending on the spouse’s individual interaction skills and the staff’s willingness to meet the family members.</p>
<p>Spouses’ coping manifests itself as acceptance of the situation, as a sense of coherence, and as physical and mental well-being. Seeking balance may also involve denial of the situation, insecurity, sleep disorders, and anxiety. Balanced coping includes dynamic and open interaction, flexibility, and social support. The spouses’ coping experiences, presented through the seven main categories below, describe the spouses’ cognitive and social resources.</p>

<title>Main and Subcategories</title>
<sec id="section12-1074840713483922">
<title>Dealing With Emotional Stress</title>
<p>The category “Dealing with emotional stress” includes the following subcategories: recognizing emotional stress factors, recognizing one’s own emotions and emotional resources, accepting, and denying. Dealing with emotional stress is important because spouses experience MI as a sudden, unexpected situation, which evokes emotional stress, powerlessness, and feelings of anger, despair, guilt, and anxiety. Dealing with these feelings and stress factors is a dynamic process, with acceptance and denial of the situation alternating. Acceptance requires that spouses adopt a realistic attitude toward the situation, seek to endure stress, and act in terms of the situation. Denying the seriousness of the situation involves refusal to believe or to accept the diagnosis. Spouses also experience an imbalance of emotions and resources, which one interviewee talked about in the following way: “I cannot find a balance, my mind is a windmill and I react very fast.” It is not easy to recognize one’s imbalance and admit to negative feelings, as some spouses remarked: “I do not accept all of my feelings of despair” and “I admit that I deny the seriousness of the situation, it protects me from difficult emotions.” Ultimately it is a question about spouses not availing themselves of the resources and courage to face the situation at that particular time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1074840713483922">
<title>Protective Interaction With the Patient</title>
<p>The category “Protective interaction with the patient” includes three subcategories: avoiding difficult discussion topics, hiding one’s fears, and pretending that everything is in order. Spouses try to protect the patient from information that might cause additional stress. They do not discuss topics which they consider too sensitive, that is, the seriousness of the situation, the possibility of death, or their own fears. In the spouses’ own words: “I want to protect my husband from bad things” and “It’s important to be sensitive and neutral, not to cause more worries.” Topics to be discussed are carefully chosen and sometimes humor is used to approach serious issues. According to the spouses, it is important that they keep their own fears hidden. This idea is perhaps accompanied by the (irrational) belief that they might lose their loved one if they expressed their fear. Instead, spouses make an effort to be happy and lively during their visits to hospital, hiding their negative emotions and seeking to affirm strengths, possibilities, and hope: “It’s like a disguise—when I go to the patient room, I try to be lively, I don’t express my worries.” It is, however, stressful not to be able to share one’s fears with the patient. Some spouses feel the need to keep up a front not only in front of the patients but hospital staff as well. They find it impossible to share fears and stress with the nurses and do not know how to ask for help regarding psychological or interaction-related worries. Protecting the patient and hiding one’s fears may add to the spouses’ mental burden and anxiety. One spouse explained: “I have to be like a chameleon, pretend that everything is fine when I visit my husband at the hospital but I can be myself alone at home.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1074840713483922">
<title>Keeping Up-to-Date With the Patient’s Condition</title>
<p>The category “Keeping up-to-date with the patient’s condition” includes two subcategories: personal analysis of the patient’s condition and consulting the nursing staff. Spouses feel that coping with the situation is easier when they have information about the patient’s condition and prognosis and are kept up-to-date by the nurses: “Luckily, some of the nurses keep me up-to-date.” Some spouses, however, feel compelled to rely on their own observations and assessment of the situation. One of the spouses interviewed reported: “When I get no updates from the nurses, I observe his breathing and the color of the face, he is not so pale anymore.” Spouses described observing the patient’s facial expression, appearance, and tone of voice, wishing to detect signs of recovery, which would make it easier to accept MI as a life situation. “When I look at him and see that he is not so anxious any more, I feel that there is hope.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1074840713483922">
<title>Denial of the Possibility of the Patient’s Death</title>
<p>This category has two subcategories: denial as a defense mechanism and time to gather resources. Denying the possibility of losing the loved one alleviates dealing with the acute situation. It provides time and space to gather physical and psychological resources. Looking at the spouses’ comments, denial commonly seems a conscious choice: “I have to think that my husband cannot die, I deny the possibility of losing him” or “I know that I must deny this to be able to go on, it is my defense mechanism and it gives me time to collect emotional resources.” Denial also helps with controlling sensitive topics, allowing spouses to concentrate on future and on the positive aspects of the situation. They postpone thinking about death because they do not have the necessary resources: “I don’t allow my thoughts to concentrate on losing my wife, I cannot even think about death.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1074840713483922">
<title>Obtaining Social Support From Family Members</title>
<p>This category was found to include four subcategories: recognizing one’s need for social support, lack of social support, sharing difficult emotions, and empowerment through support. Many spouses consider their children or own parents a great source of social support, who allow them to be themselves and help them in coping with the situation. The support from family members also considerably assists spouses’ supporting the patient during hospitalization. Sharing the experience reduces anxiety and hopelessness. In the interviewees’ own words: “The family is my resource, I can be myself, I don’t need to try to be more than I am” and “I can share my worries with my children, they understand.”</p>
<p>There are, however, families who find sharing not so easy. Many spouses feel that they would need more information about how to tell their children and other relatives about the MI. They would appreciate patient-family meetings during hospitalization, with nurses available to inform the family of MI as an illness and to discuss the prognosis and life changes required. Spouse group meetings are also suggested to discuss how to tell about MI to other relatives and how to interact with relatives and friends: “Why aren’t there any meetings arranged for spouses where they would teach us how to tell about the illness to other people? It’s so difficult to talk about sensitive and difficult topics.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, a need for solitude seems to coexist with need for social support. Spouses do not always have the resources to meet friends and relatives or to answer their questions when the patient is still hospitalized. They need time to adapt and cope with the situation before they see their significant others. Some spouses feel the need to close themselves off from the outside world and to seek solitude in order to gather their emotional resources: “I don’t have strength to discuss it with friends how . . . I don’t have the right words . . . ” and “I need to take some time of my own and just be alone.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1074840713483922">
<title>Maintaining Day-to-Day Routines and Interests</title>
<p>The category “Maintaining day-to-day routines and interests” includes three subcategories: maintaining normal life, safety of everyday routines, and maintaining a sense of continuity. Spouses find it important to keep carrying out their daily tasks. For many of them, action and work seems to equal time spent without worrying; there is something normal and safe on which to concentrate. This experience was expressed in words like: “Work, doing something all the time, it’s good, maintaining the routines, just keeps life rolling.” Handicrafts, reading, listening to music, and walking in nature were also important resources. They provided the opportunity to have a break or to avoid facing the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>Adherence to daily routines can also promote coping in a situation characterized by depleted resources. Some spouses feel that “life has stopped” and that time spent at home only involved constant waiting for a call from the hospital. They find it difficult to concentrate on anything and may forget their own needs, only focusing on the patient’s needs and recovery: “I just walk from one window to another. I cannot concentrate on anything.” or “When I sit in the kitchen with my children, I cannot say anything warm, I just cook and sit—I feel a little blocked.” Despite these feelings, there is still something that spouses feel in control over, that is attending to every day routines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1074840713483922">
<title>Praying and Hope</title>
<p>The last category “Praying and hope” includes three subcategories: praying as an empowering experience, praying as a comforting experience, and hoping as a sign of future orientation. Praying is important to several spouses interviewed. It provides strength and confidence. In the spouses’ own words: “I trust in the power of prayer” and “Praying gives me more trust and hope.” Praying spouses also feel that they are not alone. Many of them would like to see a pastor during the patient’s hospitalization to help them cope in the acute phase. They would also appreciate an opportunity to pray with a religious member of staff at the patient’s bedside. “I think that I could get strength and hope—by praying with a pastor.” According to spouses, praying reduces anxiety and adds dynamic life force. Praying together with other people enables spouses to make sense of the crisis caused by MI. Some spouses seek a purpose in faith. Spirituality, praying, and hope are essential factors of resilience and they provide the ability to understand and overcome the acute phase of MI.</p>

<title>Factors Influencing Spouses’ Coping</title>
<p>Factors influencing spouses’ coping experiences consist of factors posing coping requirements, factors promoting spouses’ coping, and factors interfering with spouses’ coping, whereas their background factors include the causal factor, contextual factors, and intervening factors.</p>
<sec id="section20-1074840713483922">
<title>Factors Posing Coping Requirements</title>
<p>“Factors posing coping requirements” include patient-dependent factors, spouse-dependent factors, health-care personnel-dependent factors and situation- and condition-dependent factors. These factors occur in action and interaction between the spouse and the patient; between the spouse and health-care personnel and also between the spouse and other family members.</p>
<p>The patient-related factors, which call for adaptation and reevaluation of the situation, primarily involve the patient’s serious condition and confused emotional state. Spouse’s coping may also be compromised by their own confusion and insecurity. The following quote is an example of this: “My husband got sick so fast, I haven’t really had time to put my thoughts and emotions in order yet, I’m a bit confused.” Various emotional, cognitive, and social stressors jeopardize spouses’ feeling of life control. They must face the disruption to their normal daily life and start seeking for psychological resources required in dealing with the new situation. They simultaneously strive to adapt themselves to the patient’s illness, control their emotions, and ensure continuity of daily life. This often means assuming responsibility for new tasks, which the spouse has previously taken care of. The hospital environment, along with strange routines and sometimes with lack of empowering counseling, bring further coping requirements. Spouses, seeking balance in this situation, often have to confront challenging interactive situations involving the patient, other family members, and hospital staff. The most demanding coping requirements appear on an emotional level, as spouses, after facing MI as a shocking, unexpected event, try to manage both protection of the patient and dealing with their own anxiety and fear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1074840713483922">
<title>Factors Promoting Spouses’ Coping</title>
<p>“Factors promoting coping” include patient-dependent factors, spouse-dependent factors, family-dependent factors and health-care personnel-dependent factors. The patient’s fast recovery promotes spousal coping. Coping is also promoted by spouses’ good physical and psychological resources and sense of coherence. Good experienced health provides them the confidence that they will be able to cope alongside their wife or husband. Especially older spouses regard spirituality as an important resource in their lives. Sense of control, preceded by acceptance of the situation, is considered important. One spouse explained: “It’s easier to cope with the situation, when you just take it realistically as it comes and trust that you will make it.” On the other hand, a part of the spouses experience denying the seriousness of the situation as an important emotion-focused strategy or as a factor that promotes their coping in the acute stage. Denial gives them time to gather resources to deal with the situation. Support from other family members and sharing experiences with them also promote coping, as does empowering counseling from health-care personnel. Finally, many spouses report that concentrating on daily tasks and routines enhances their coping by creating a feeling of safety and continuity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1074840713483922">
<title>Factors Interfering With Spouses’ Coping</title>
<p>“Factors interfering with spouses’ coping” include patient-dependent factors, spouse-dependent factors, family-dependent factors, and health-care personnel-dependent factors. The patient’s unstable condition is a major factor that interferes with spouses’ coping in the acute stage. Recurrent chest pain, arrhythmia, and shortness of breath are typical and the return of the symptoms may lead to patient’s depression. The patient’s mood strongly affects the spouses’ sense of coherence and their experienced coping. Spouse-dependent factors, on the other hand, include lack of physical and psychological resources and fear and anxiety due to patient’s disease. Spouses’ coping is impeded by experienced lack of psychological and physical resources. They describe their lack of physical resources as a state of fatigue. For example: “I’m quite poorly, we both are, how can we manage, both being so weak and frail.” The patient’s illness evokes fear and anxiety, both experienced as powerful stressors.</p>
<p>Thirdly, family-dependent factors, which interfere with spouses’ coping, contain the spouses’ experience that they are left alone, without support from other family members, to bear the responsibility for both daily routines and the patient’s condition. Sometimes spouses feel that they cannot share the demands with other family members, who do not seem able to endure the seriousness of the patient’s condition. In these situations, spouses must be stronger than normal. In some families, lack of open interaction, conflicts, and other aspects of poor family dynamics lead to lack of mutual support and interfere with spouses’ coping. Lastly, health-care personnel-dependent factors include lack of information and counseling from staff regarding the illness, its prognosis and treatment. Spouses worry about the consequences of the illness and about how to manage lifestyle changes.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1074840713483922">
<title>Causal, Contextual, and Intervening Factors</title>
<p>The core category “Seeking balance” is also related to the following causal, contextual, and intervening factors, which explain spousal coping.</p>
<p>The patient’s MI as an unexpected, serious, and acute event is the causal factor, which poses coping requirements for spouses and shakes their balance. Home and hospital as social and physical environments are contextual factors, which can either promote or interfere with spousal coping. Home strongly represents safety and continuity in life, but being at home may not always increase the feeling of safety if the spouse constantly worries or suffers from guilt or loneliness. Household problems may prevent spouses from visiting the hospital as often as they wish and they may have to face new demands in the changed domestic situation: “It was not easy to take care of children alone when my wife was in hospital.” Spouses wish to be more present and support the patient, but the new, sometimes confusing hospital environment makes it difficult for them. They are not familiar with hospital culture and routines and may feel insecure about what is expected of them. Many spouses may simply lack information of schedules and of how to act in the ward. This is apparent from the interviewees’ comments, for example: “I didn’t know when to visit and how long I could stay with my spouse” or “I didn’t know what was expected of me in the ward.” For other spouses, on the other hand, hospital is a safe place and they can trust that the patient will receive prompt care there. Time can be seen as another important contextual factor that has bearing on spouses’ coping in the acute stage of the patient’s illness. The hospitalization period is short and spouses do not always have time to fully understand or come to terms with the situation or its influence on the family’s daily coping.</p>
<p>In addition to the causal and contextual factors, the theory comprises intervening factors, which explain spouses’ experiences and affect their coping. Intervening factors are general conditions that have a bearing on actions and interactional strategies. Very often these factors are beyond spouses’ control. They may be related to the patient, spouse, family member, or health-care personnel. Patient-dependent characteristics include, for example, unexpected changes in the patient’s condition and their emotional state and recovery speed. The interviewees were sometimes quite articulate in formulating their experiences: “The patient’s condition and the progress of recovery meant a lot for my coping ability” and “When my spouse became severely depressed, it diminished my emotional coping in the situation.”</p>
<p>The spouse’s health, mood, physical and psychological resources, and earlier life experience are spouse-dependent characteristics. One of the spouses explained: “I felt that I had enough mental resources to face this situation, I felt balanced the whole time.” Spousal coping is supported by a sense of coherence, proactivity, and good interaction skills. The following quotes may serve as examples: “I felt that my own activity helped me to cope with my spouse’s acute phase” and “Had I not been so active, noone would have paid attention to me as the patient’s spouse.” Spousal coping is also influenced by such external spouse-related factors as their work situation, financial issues, and other family members’ expectations and attitudes. Spouses may be burdened by concurrent worries. Moreover, family lifestyle and the surrounding culture affect their coping. The family’s everyday interaction and activities, as well as family dynamics and history of sharing various experiences, including the attitudes and fears of significant others have a strong influence on spousal coping. Spouses’ coping can be either promoted or complicated by family dynamics and intrafamilial relationships. The essential question is how to share the challenges brought on by illness.</p>
<p>Thirdly, spouses’ coping experiences are influenced by health-care personnel-dependent factors. Some nurses and physicians are prepared and willing to encounter spouses, whereas others seem to ignore them or refuse contact with them. Many spouses experience lack of attention from the health-care professionals, explaining, for example: “Some nurses seemed to hide in the coffee room. I felt like they were avoiding meeting the family members” or: “One nurse was really uninterested, she did not take notice of our presence and did not even greet us.” The following, however, is an example of opposing experiences: “Some nurses and doctors greeted us warmly and told us the news about the patient’s situation unprompted.” Spouses expect to have empathy and comfort from nurses and lack thereof can sometimes be quite disconcerting: “I felt that I was like air to the nurses, they did not ask about my emotions or feelings.” Informing families is also seen as an important task of nurses; failure to accomplish this a relatively common complaint: “I did not get any comfort or realistic information about my husband’s situation.” The spouses’ need for support in mobilizing resources and in coping with the situation is indicated by quotes like the following one: “There was not any empowering counseling or discussion with the personnel.”</p>
<p>Lastly, intervening factors may involve various action and interaction, which spouses experience as stressful. For example, family dynamics may not allow sharing things and keeping the serious situation to oneself may become a burden, or the spouse does not want to share all things, for example work-related worries with the patient or other family members. Sometimes intervening factors call for a permanent change in the life of the patient and spouse, making it necessary for the spouse to assume more responsibility for daily life.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to develop a substantive theory which explains the coping experiences of spouses during patient’s hospitalization for MI. MI has an extensive impact on patients and their spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713483922">Dalteg et al., 2011</xref>) and it poses a variety of coping requirements. Coping is seen as a way to manage or alter demands that occur externally in the environment or internally within oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840713483922">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). As earlier studies confirm, spouses confront emotional, cognitive, and social stressors including role and lifestyle changes and disruption to normal routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1074840713483922">Moser &amp; Dracup, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1074840713483922">Verhaeghe et al., 2005</xref>). Like informants in other research, the spouses interviewed for this study revealed that continuing daily routines was an important source of safety. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713483922">Dalteg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840713483922">Eriksson, Asplund, &amp; Svedlund, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The core category produced in this study, seeking balance, reflects spouses’ strong need to find balance in relation to their own emotions and psychological and physical resources. It also represents spouses’ need to seek and maintain balance in human relationships, especially with the patient and other members of the family. Seeking balance is a complex phenomenon, characterized by spouses’ need to control, change, and sometimes avoid demands that occur externally or internally. In this study, spousal coping experiences are described by means of seven main categories: dealing with emotional stress, protective interaction with the patient, keeping up-to-date with the patient’s condition, denial of the possibility of the patient’s death, obtaining social support from family members, maintaining day-to-day routines and interests, and praying and hope.</p>
<p>In this study, coping with MI very often seems to involve acceptance of the situation, maintenance of a sense of coherence, and physical and mental well-being and it is strongly linked with open interaction between the spouses. Sometimes, however, the spousal relationship seems marred by lack of sharing. Similar findings have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840713483922">Allman et al. (2009)</xref>, who suggest that successful coping occurs as active coping, acceptance, and planning. It leads spouses to maintain positive outcomes, life satisfaction, and functioning in daily life. In contrast, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840713483922">Klein et al. (2007)</xref>, denial, self-distraction, and self-blame affect the quality of life negatively.</p>
<p>One important finding in the study is the complex nature of the spouses’ situation. The core category produced, seeking balance, can also be studied as consisting of varied episodes experienced in the interaction process between the spouse and the patient, between the spouse and the health-care personnel and also between the spouse and relatives. The spouses’ social reality enfolds itself as an ambiguous situation involving a variety of emotions and imbalance both in hospital and at home. It is essential to pay attention to the ambiguity of the phenomenon of the coping experience. “Push and pull”—reactions and opposite emotions occur frequently in the spouses’ coping behavior. For example, the spouses seem to want support from family and friends and yet they need to be alone. The spouses want information but want to deny possible death. This tension and varied emotions are typical and describe spouses’ imbalance during the patient’s hospitalization.</p>
<p>As described above, the study sees spousal coping as a process of seeking balance, influenced by various contextual and intervening factors. These include patient-dependent, spouse-dependent, health-care personnel-dependent factors, and situation- and condition-dependent factors. Some of these factors pose coping requirements, while others promote or interfere with coping. The intervening factors can cause short-time coping requirements, which call for situational sensitivity but also longer lasting requirements, which means that spouses must adapt themselves to the fact that their daily lives are more permanently affected. Earlier studies have described how MI can lead to changes in domestic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713483922">Dalteg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840713483922">Eriksson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840713483922">Lukkarinen &amp; Kyngäs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840713483922">Mahrer-Imhof, Hoffmann, &amp; Froelicher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840713483922">Stewart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1074840713483922">Svedlund &amp; Danielson, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840713483922">Lukkarinen and Kyngäs (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1074840713483922">Svedlund and Danielson (2004)</xref>, spouses need to take on new tasks or carry out tasks on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>The spouses interviewed for this study employed all possible variations of coping strategies. Their situation changed constantly, sometimes even on a single day, which resulted in changing, episodic experiences of coping. It could be said that the spouses’ coping took place on a continuum as they responded to changes in the patient’s condition, fluctuating between acceptance and denial.</p>
<p>The spouses used emotion-focused, problem-focused, relationship-focused, and avoidance-oriented strategies in order to cope with MI. Similar findings have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840713483922">Kettunen et al. (1999)</xref>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840713483922">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref>, coping strategies have two primary functions: managing the problem causing stress and governing emotions relating to those stressors. In this study, especially emotion-focused strategies were common. It seems that MI, as an acute and unexpected event, shakes the spouses’ sense of life control, causing confusion, and diminishing their use of problem-focused coping strategies. This means that they mainly seem to seek relief for their anxiety and insecurity by employing emotion-focused strategies. Dealing with emotional stress, denial of the possibility of the patient’s death, and praying and hope are all examples of this approach. It has been suggested that emotion-focused coping is more effective than problem-focused coping if an event is evaluated as uncontrollable, whereas controllable events may be best managed through problem-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840713483922">Kendall &amp; Terry, 2008</xref>). It is most likely that many spouses experience MI as uncontrollable in the first days following the event.</p>
<p>Spouses’ reports of spirituality are an example of emotion-focused coping experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840713483922">Black and Lobo (2008)</xref> found that praying is connected with affirming strengths and maintaining courage and hope. Spiritual dimensions, religious attitudes, ethical sensitivity and harmony have been reported to play an important role in the coping processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840713483922">Krok, 2008</xref>). This study also brings into light spouses’ religious needs. Many spouses would like to see a pastor during the patient’s hospitalization, or pray together with a religious member of staff. Praying is considered important and it appears to be an empowering and comforting experience. The emergence of spiritual and religious needs may be related to the acute situation itself, as spouses experience insecurity and powerlessness during the short hospitalization. It may also be indicative of a more general value shift in Finnish society.</p>
<p>This study reveals that spouses of MI patients also commonly resort to the avoidance-oriented coping strategy. In the acute stage, spouses still lack the resources to face and emotionally work through the serious situation. Avoidance-oriented coping strategy comes close to the emotion-focused coping strategy; in a way both strategies work as defense mechanisms until the individuals regain balance. Spouses’ various behavioral or psychological maneuvers enable them to minimize or avoid anxiety, painful ideas, and other affects or impulses arising out of the acute situation. In the spouses interviewed for this study, avoidance-oriented coping meant denying the seriousness of the situation and avoiding discussion on painful topics with the patient or significant others. The avoidance-oriented coping strategy may initially be an appropriate reaction to stress but in the long run it is associated with poorer adjustment. Endler, for example, has suggested that ultimately task-oriented coping is the most efficacious coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840713483922">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>An important finding in this study, perhaps related to the avoidance-oriented coping strategy, is some spouses’ difficulty to discuss MI. Communication deficiency and changes in domestic roles following MI have been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713483922">Dalteg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840713483922">Lukkarinen &amp; Kyngäs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1074840713483922">Svedlund &amp; Axelsson, 2000</xref>). According to Webster and colleagues (2002), some spouses and patients do not discuss MI and its effects on daily life at all. Partners experience it stressful to deal with the patients’ emotional turmoil and withhold their feelings in order not to disturb the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840713483922">Bennett &amp; Connell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840713483922">Dalteg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840713483922">Stewart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1074840713483922">Svedlund &amp; Axelsson, 2000</xref>). This study also reveals how difficult it is for many spouses to share and discuss the seriousness of the situation with the patient and to find a way to inform concerned friends and relatives. Interaction problems and tension are common. Sensitive topics are avoided but keeping up a front, pretending that everything is in order, elicits a great deal of stress. Spouses report a need for help on how to discuss the situation. As is clear from earlier studies as well, they feel a need to be close and protect their critically ill family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840713483922">Kinrade, Jackson, &amp; Tomnay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840713483922">Vandall-Walker &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1074840713483922">Wagner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Inadequate information and the spouses’ experience of not being kept abreast of the developments in the ward were another significant finding in this study. Spouses’ coping may be jeopardized as they do not always have as much information as they wish of the patient’s current situation, recovery process, and prognosis. They often need to be active themselves to keep updated. Some spouses complain of lack of attention, even reporting that nursing staff seek to avoid family members. This makes it all the more challenging to discuss the illness with the patient or significant others. Spouses also reported that they had not received empowering counseling and that nurses had not paid adequate attention to their psychological resources. A study conducted some 15 years earlier in Finland also found that only one third of family members felt that nurses were interested in the family’s well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840713483922">Åstedt-Kurki, Paunonen, &amp; Lehti, 1997</xref>). At any rate, empowering counseling seems indicated to facilitate coping and well-being.</p>
<p>It seems on the basis of this study that the problem-focused coping strategy is most commonly used by spouses with a strong sense of coherence and need to effectively control the situation. These individuals trust their abilities to cope and are ready to take on new challenges or tasks previously carried out by the patient. On the other hand, even these spouses expect to have empowering counseling from nurses. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840713483922">Kuokkanen and Leino-Kilpi (2000)</xref>, empowerment can occur when the conditions are suitable and relationships trusting and respectful. Empowering counseling helps spouses to recognize, promote, and use their abilities to meet their needs; solve problems; and mobilize the necessary resources in order to feel control over their life and cope with the varying situations. It can lead to a sense of control and give actual or practical power for spouses to affect their own lives. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840713483922">Falk-Rafael 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840713483922">Kuokkanen &amp; Leino-Kilpi 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1074840713483922">St-Cyr Tribble et al., 2008</xref>). Often, many useful resources are already present or possible, but the process of empowerment is required to make the spouse aware of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840713483922">Falk-Rafael, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, spouses also employ relationship-focused coping strategies, which take the form of social support from family members and protective interaction with the patient. In a study conducted in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1074840713483922">Santavirta et al., 2001</xref>) it was found that seeking social support was the most common strategy employed by spouses of MI patients. Similarly, the spouses in this study required social support from their significant others but also stressed their need to be alone in order to gather resources and to detach themselves from relatives and their questions. The finding on protective interaction has been reported on earlier. In addition, patients have been found to sometimes experience spouses’ behavior as over-protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840713483922">Eriksson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840713483922">Lukkarinen &amp; Kyngäs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840713483922">Mahrer-Imhof et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840713483922">Stewart et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings discussed above make it clear how important it is also for health-care providers to be aware of factors that pose coping requirements for spouses or promote or interfere with their coping in the acute stage. It is useful for them to know that spouses use such a variety of coping strategies.</p>
<sec id="section25-1074840713483922">
<title>Validity and Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The grounded theory method is suitable for the purpose of this research because it enables a study of spouses’ coping experiences as part of various interactive episodes. An effort has been made to pay attention to the transparency, accuracy, purposivity, utility, propriety, accessibility, and specificity of the study process and its results, all connected to study rigor, ethics, and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1074840713483922">Pawson, Boaz, Grayson, Long, &amp; Barnes, 2003</xref>). The reliability of the study was enhanced by theoretical sampling; the participants were selected based on their own experience and data collection was based on concepts derived from data. This responsive approach made sampling open and flexible. Concepts were derived from data during analysis and questions about those concepts drove the next round of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>.) The participants also had the ability to reflect and were willing to participate in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840713483922">Cutcliffe, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis are discussed in a detailed way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>), including a description of the participants’ selection and inclusion criteria. The findings are clarified and exemplified with authentic quotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1074840713483922">Porter, 2007</xref>), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Strauss and Corbin’s (2008)</xref> advice to use participants’ own language at all levels of coding to facilitate grounded theory construction and to add the credibility of findings. For the same purpose and to ensure that the phenomenon investigated was accurately identified, the participants were allowed to guide the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840713483922">Eaves, 2001</xref>). The criteria used in approaching the transcribed interview data were specified by delineating questions consistently asked of the transcribed data during the analytical process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840713483922">Cutcliffe, 2000</xref>). The coding was guided by the questions: “What is happening and being expressed here, what does it mean, what is essential, and in what context is the action used?” The claims made are based on relevant and appropriate knowledge and interpretation of the meanings that have occurred in social interaction processes in the original data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Creativity and flexibility, enhanced by the method, have given the investigator a possibility to utilize theoretical sensitivity to understand and create categories and subcategories and to recognize the emerging theory. Also returning to original data every now and then, writing memos, comprehensive data treatment, and using the constant comparative method improve the validity and credibility of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840713483922">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1074840713483922">Pawson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1074840713483922">Porter, 2007</xref>). A single researcher conducted the data analysis but four other researchers evaluated and commented on the validity of the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1074840713483922">Pawson et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this study worth noting. The sample size is small and may limit transferability to different critical care settings. The findings are limited to the specific context and time period in which the study was conducted, but they can be still be useful in health-care education, nursing practice, and in organizing counseling and support interventions for the spouses of patients with MI. The researcher’s clinical experience in cardiac nursing care may have resulted in preconceptions; the possibility that the interpretation of the results has been affected by this fact cannot be entirely excluded.</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusion</title>
<sec id="section27-1074840713483922">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Spousal coping is a complex phenomenon. Nurses caring for patients hospitalized for MI may benefit from considering spousal coping and paying attention to the psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs and resources of the patients’ spouses. This study provides new information about coping requirements and factors that promote and interfere with spouses’ coping. If nurses were attentive to the various coping strategies employed by spouses, it might be easier to provide information, support, and empowering counseling.</p>
<p>The study reveals how important it is for spouses to be kept abreast of the patient’s condition. Nurses and doctors have the means to reduce fear and tension by providing information about the recovery period and by helping spouses to find ways to talk about the situation with the patient and significant others. It is also advisable to facilitate the development of accessible help-seeking resources and provide opportunities to share experiences and receive social support, for example in peer groups or nurse-led family meetings. More attention needs to be paid to the spiritual and religious needs of spouses; a hospital policy of responding to these needs is indicated. Finally, focusing on spouses’ individual psychological resources and on family strengths rather than weaknesses may have profound implications for promoting spousal coping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1074840713483922">
<title>Implications for Education</title>
<p>The results can be used in nursing education as a theoretical frame of reference to help students become aware of factors that contribute to the coping of MI patients’ spouses. The knowledge produced may also help students become aware of such factors as family dynamics and interaction, the spouses’ need for social support and empowering counseling, and the nurses’ role in the provision of counseling and support. Ultimately, this awareness might help students better understand spouse’s role and the insecurities involved in it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1074840713483922">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>The substantive theory outlined in this study produced new nursing scientific knowledge of spousal coping experiences during the patient’s hospitalization for MI. It is suggested that in future, an instrument could be developed to measure the coping of spouses to gain further knowledge of a larger target group. An international comparative study on the spouses’ coping experiences is also proposed.</p>
