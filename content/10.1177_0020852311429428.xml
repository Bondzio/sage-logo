<p>It has been said that the 2010 WikiLeaks disclosures mark ‘the end of secrecy in the old fashioned, cold-war-era sense’. This is not true. Advocates of WikiLeaks have overstated the scale and significance of the leaks. They also overlook many ways in which the simple logic of radical transparency – leak, publish, and wait for the inevitable outrage – can be defeated in practice. WikiLeaks only created the illusion of a new era in transparency. In fact the 2010 leaks revealed the obstacles to achievement of increased transparency, even in the digital age.</p>
<sec><title>Points for practitioners</title>
<p>Some commentators have regarded the WikiLeaks disclosures of 2010 as evidence of a broader breakdown in the conventional mechanisms for controlling government-held information. This new world has been described as one of ‘radical transparency’. But claims about the breakdown of old-style secrecy are overwrought. This article says that the significance of the WikiLeaks disclosures has been exaggerated, and provides reasons why it will be harder to achieve radical transparency, especially in the security sector of government.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0020852311429428" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It would not be entirely accurate to call WikiLeaks an organization. In 2010 it was a network of individuals committed to a project in which new information technologies are used to eliminate the barriers to leaking governmental and corporate secrets, and to public disclosure of leaked information. Throughout most of 2010, WikiLeaks had perhaps a hard core of 40 volunteers, led by the charismatic Julian Assange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311429428">New York Times, 2011</xref>). Its aim, some admirers have said, is to wage ‘war on secrecy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852311429428">Calabresi, 2010</xref>). WikiLeaks itself says that its aim is to challenge ‘increasing authoritarian tendencies’ in government and the growth of unaccountable corporate power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852311429428">WikiLeaks, 2011a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852311429428">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2010, after four years of operation, WikiLeaks orchestrated a series of disclosures which seemed to give a brilliant demonstration of the power of its methods. In April, WikiLeaks released a classified video showing an attack by US Army helicopters in the streets of Baghdad in 2007 that killed 12 people, including two journalists with the Reuters news agency. In July, it collaborated with a consortium of three major newspapers on the release of 90,000 documents describing US military operations in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010. These are known as the Afghan war logs. In October 2010, the same consortium collaborated with WikiLeaks in the release of a similar but larger set of documents – almost 400,000 – detailing US military operations in Iraq over the same period. In November came the <italic>coup de grâce</italic>: partial disclosures from a cache of a quarter-million cables sent between the US State Department and its diplomatic missions around the world.</p>
<p>By the end of 2010, WikiLeaks and Assange had become the center of a vast media spectacle. The scale and significance of the leaks, and the rapidity with which one followed another, led many observers to conclude that the world was moving into a new era of supercharged or ‘radical transparency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311429428">Sifry, 2011a</xref>). The 2010 leaks marked ‘the end of secrecy in the old-fashioned, cold-war-era sense’, according to two journalists from the <italic>Guardian</italic>, David Leigh and Luke Harding, who worked in the consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 183). WikiLeaks had triggered ‘a true information and political earthquake’, concluded another commentator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311429428">Heusser, 2010</xref>). A Norwegian politician nominated WikiLeaks for the Nobel Peace Prize, saying that it had helped to ‘redraw the map of information freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311429428">CNN, 2011</xref>). ‘Like him or not’, said <italic>Time</italic> magazine in December 2010, Assange now ‘has the power to impose his judgment of what should or shouldn’t be secret’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852311429428">Calabresi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>All of this is vastly overwrought. Certainly, new information technologies have made it easier to leak sensitive information and broadcast it to the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852311429428">Roberts, 2006</xref>: 73, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852311429428">2008</xref>: 167). A generation ago, leaking was limited by the need to physically copy and smuggle actual documents. Now it is a matter of dragging, dropping, and clicking send. Nevertheless, the 2010 leaks did not mark the end of ‘old-fashioned secrecy’. Boosters of WikiLeaks have overestimated the scale and significance of the leaks. They have also overlooked many ways in which the simple logic of radical transparency – leak, publish, and wait for the inevitable outrage – can be defeated in practice. WikiLeaks only created the illusion of a new era in transparency. In fact, the 2010 leaks revealed the obstacles to achievement of increased transparency, even in the digital age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0020852311429428"><title>How big a breach?</title>
<p>We should begin by putting the 2010 leaks in proper perspective. A common way of arguing for their significance is by emphasizing the sheer volume of leaked material. In July 2010, the <italic>Guardian</italic> – a key player in a newspaper consortium that collaborated with WikiLeaks in the last three of the 2010 disclosures – described the Afghan war logs as ‘one of the biggest leaks in US military history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852311429428">Davies and Leigh, 2010</xref>). Assange himself compared the war logs to one of the most famous leaks in history, the Pentagon Papers, disclosed by Daniel Ellsberg in 1971. ‘The Pentagon Papers was about 10,000 pages’, Assange told the United Kingdom's Channel 4 News in July 2010. By contrast, there were ‘about 200,000 pages in this material’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852311429428">Channel 4 News, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Afghan war logs did not retain this record-breaking status for long. In October, the title was assumed by the Iraq war logs – ‘the greatest data leak in the history of the United States military’, according to <italic>Der Spiegel</italic>, another consortium member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852311429428">Spiegel Online, 2010</xref>). Within weeks, WikiLeaks was warning that this record would soon be shattered. In November it boasted on Twitter that its next release would be ‘7× the size of the Iraq War Logs’. Once the State Department cables were released, WikiLeaks called it ‘the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852311429428">WikiLeaks, 2011b</xref>). It was ‘an astonishing mountain of words’, agreed the <italic>Guardian</italic>’s Leigh and Harding:
<disp-quote>
<p>Its sheer bulk was overwhelming. If the tiny memory stick containing the cables had been a set of printed texts, it would have made up a library containing more than 2000 sizeable books. No human diplomats would have attempted to write so much down before the coming of the digital age … and no human mind would have been able subsequently to analyze it without spending half a lifetime at the task. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 140)</p></disp-quote>This way of measuring the significance of leaks is misguided. The reasoning is this: if we are in possession of a very large number of records, we must also have a very large fraction of the total number of records that are stored behind the wall of secrecy that normally surrounds the diplomatic and national security complex. The difficulty is that we know only one part of the fraction – the numerator. We tend to think that the denominator – the total stockpile of sensitive information – has not changed. So if the Afghan war logs are, by number of pages, 20 times larger than the Pentagon Papers, then perhaps they are 20 times more significant.</p>
<p>However, the denominator is not unchanged: it is immensely larger than it was in 1971. Technological change has caused an explosion in the rate of information production within government agencies, as everywhere else. For example, the leaked cables might have summed to two gigabytes of data.</p>
<p>By comparison, it has been estimated that the outgoing Bush White House transferred seventy-seven terabytes (or seventy-seven thousand gigabytes) of data to the US National Archives in 2009. (This was 35 times the amount transferred by the Clinton administration eight years earlier.) In 2009, a data center within the Department of Energy, a moderately sized federal agency, determined that it held over four petabytes of information – that is, four billion megabytes – in almost 70 million files, and that this volume was doubling annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852311429428">Government Accountability Office, 2010</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>In the digital age, all numbers are large, and a mere count of messages – 90,000, a quarter million, 400,000 – tells us almost nothing about the significance of a breach. The State Department’s undersecretary for management, Ambassador Patrick Kennedy, told Congress in March 2011 that only a small fraction of the total flow of State Department cable traffic was recorded within SIPRNet, the secure interagency information-sharing system from which the leaked material was retrieved. In the period in which most of the quarter-million WikiLeaks cables were posted to SIPRNet, Kennedy said, ‘we [also] disseminated 2.4 million cables, 10 times as many, through other systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852311429428">Aftergood, 2011</xref>). The State Department’s most sensitive communications, classified top secret, were not accessible through SIPRNet. Neither were a substantial number of less sensitive documents which the State Department decided should be withheld from other agencies.</p>
<p>The annual report of the Information Security Oversight Office provides another sense of the scale of production of classified information within American government agencies. The ISOO estimated that federal officials made 50 million classification decisions in 2009. This is a very rough estimate, because the counting of classification decisions in an ‘electronic environment’ is extraordinarily difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852311429428">Information Security Oversight Office, 2009</xref>: 8). Whatever the precise count, it is clear that the growth in classified data parallels the overall growth in volume of federal records. Even if we were to assume, rashly, that every one of the records disclosed by WikiLeaks in 2010 ought to be counted as a discrete classification decision, it would still be clear that they constitute a small proportion of the total number of such decisions made in the last six years. (In fact, only 6 percent of the State Department cables that were leaked in 2010 were classified as secret.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0020852311429428"><title>The Internet is not a commons</title>
<p>The WikiLeaks program is based on a simple logic – what I have described as the three steps of leaking, publishing, and waiting for the outrage that will precipitate political change. The logic itself is not new. The novelty, it is argued, is that technological change has eliminated many of the practical barriers to executing this program – because digitized information is easier to leak; because appropriately designed technologies can protect the anonymity of leakers; because the Internet allows the instantaneous and universal sharing of information, and perhaps also because it is easier to mobilize outraged citizens. New technologies, applied to the old logic of disclosure, are predicted to lead us to a new world of radical transparency: a world in which, as Assange has said, ‘strong powers [are] held to account, while the weak [are] protected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852311429428">GreenLeft, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This vision suffers from at least four difficulties. The first comes out of a misunderstanding of the character of the Internet itself. In its early days, the Internet was envisaged as the platform for a global commons – a free space that would impose no barriers to the sharing of information, including the leaked information obtained by WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks itself said its aim was to ‘provide a forum for the entire global community to examine any document relentlessly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852311429428">Schmidt, 2007</xref>).) But the Internet is not the platform for a true global commons, and most of the business and governmental entities that dominate the online world do not take it as their goal to construct one. In the real world of the Internet, commercial and political considerations routinely compromise the free flow of information, just as they did when we relied on more primitive communications technologies.</p>
<p>This reality was quickly illustrated after the release of State Department cables in November 2010. On 1 December, Amazon Web Services – a subsidiary of Amazon.com that rents space for the storage of digitized information – stopped acting as a host for WikiLeaks' material, alleging that WikiLeaks had violated Amazon’s terms of service by distributing material which it did not own. The same day, a smaller firm that provides online graphics capabilities, Tableau Software, also discontinued its services to WikiLeaks. On 2 December, the firm that managed WikiLeaks’ domain name, EveryDNS.net, suspended its services, so that the domain name wikileaks.org was no longer operable. On 20 December, Apple removed an application from its online store that offered iPhone and iPad users access to the State Department cables.</p>
<p>All of these actions complicated WikiLeaks’ ability to distribute leaked information. Decisions by other organizations also undermined its financial viability. On 3 December, PayPal – a business that manages online payments – announced that it would no longer process donations to WikiLeaks, alleging that WikiLeaks had violated its terms of service by encouraging or facilitating illegal activity. On 6 December, MasterCard said that it would no longer allow payments to be made to WikiLeaks on its cards, also claiming a breach of its rules against support for illegal activity. The next day, Visa Europe suspended payments to WikiLeaks as well.</p>
<p>Critics alleged that many of these firms were responding to political pressure to stop doing business with WikiLeaks. The leaks had produced a furor in Washington. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee, publicly encouraged businesses to stop providing services to Assange’s organization, and his staff queried Amazon directly about its relationship with WikiLeaks. Tableau conceded that it acted in response to Lieberman’s request. PayPal denied that it had been contacted by any governmental organization, but acknowledged that its decision was taken after the State Department said publicly that WikiLeaks’ documents might have been obtained in violation of US law.</p>
<p>But direct political pressure was hardly necessary for firms to abandon WikiLeaks. Hard business judgment would have led to the same conclusion. WikiLeaks produced little revenue for any of these businesses, but threatened to entangle all of them in public controversy. A public relations specialist told Seattle's KIRO News that it was ‘bizarre [for Amazon to assist WikiLeaks] during a holiday season … You don’t mix politics with retail’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852311429428">Porter, 2010</xref>). Conservative bloggers were calling for a boycott of Amazon as soon as it was publicly known that it was providing support to WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>Worse still, businesses supporting WikiLeaks could be exposed to hacker attacks that disrupted their relationships with other, more profitable clients. EveryDNS.net claimed that its decision to abandon WikiLeaks came after a series of ‘denial of service’ attacks that ‘put at risk … the service that hundreds of thousands of other websites depend on …. [EveryDNS.net] is following established policies so as not to put any one EveryDNS.net user's interests ahead of any others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852311429428">Ragan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These business decisions hurt WikiLeaks significantly. Assange called it ‘economic censorship’ and claimed that actions by these financial intermediaries cost WikiLeaks three-quarters of a million dollars in lost donations. A financial report from the Wau Holland Foundation, a German philanthropy which manages WikiLeaks’ finances, also appeared to show a substantial decline in donations in the latter months of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 241–242).</p>
<p>A loose collective of hackers known as Anonymous attempted to retaliate with denial of service attacks against several of the firms that severed ties with WikiLeaks. Operation Avenge Assange, as it was called, was heralded as ‘a chance to kick back for Julian … a chance to fight the oppressive future which looms ahead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311429428">Anonymous, 2010</xref>). ‘The first serious infowar is now engaged’, the Internet activist John Perry Barlow tweeted on 3 December 2010. ‘The field of battle is WikiLeaks. You are the troops.’ A week later, Barlow told the <italic>New York Times</italic>: ‘This is kind of the shot heard round the world – this is Lexington’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311429428">Cohen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Operation Avenge Assange was nothing like Lexington. PayPal said that Anonymous’ attack ‘slowed [PayPal’s] website for a short while but did not significantly impact payments’. MasterCard conceded that its capacity to process credit card payments was disrupted, but only briefly. Anonymous’ assault on Visa Europe did nothing except hamper access to the company’s corporate website. Its payment processing systems were unaffected. The hacker network failed entirely to mount a successful attack against Amazon. ‘The big question’, an industry analyst said on the third day of Operation Avenge Assange, ‘is, what’s next?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852311429428">Digital Transactions, 2010</xref>). There was nothing next. The ‘first serious infowar’ was over, with negligible damage to the targeted institutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0020852311429428"><title>Disclosure is not enough</title>
<p>The vision of radical transparency has a second difficulty: a serious neglect of the function of intermediation – that is, the tasks of organizing, interpreting, and drawing attention to information. The radical view assumes that these tasks are straightforward. Information is received; it is posted online; and it readily finds an audience, which in turn easily makes sense of it. (As Daniel Domscheit-Berg, one of Assange’s earliest collaborators, explained: ‘People have an innate interest in being informed but are kept in a state of ignorance by the media, the politicians, and their bosses. If you provide people sufficient background information, they are capable of behaving correctly and making the right decisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 51).) In practice, however, WikiLeaks learned that intermediation was not a function that could be taken for granted – or even one that WikiLeaks itself was capable of executing.</p>
<p>One prosaic challenge was managing such a large mass of digitized information. Even though WikiLeaks’ members were highly skilled in the use of information technology, the handling of bulk data leaked from the Defence Department was daunting. In the final days before the release of the Afghan war logs, Daniel Domscheit-Berg says, WikiLeaks was ‘completely swamped by the task of technically processing the documents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 181). Domscheit-Berg left WikiLeaks before the publication of the Iraq war logs, but speculates that it took the unprecedented step of hosting that material on an Amazon server because WikiLeaks’ own technicians ‘had clearly not been able to get the organization’s own infrastructure back up and running to the point where it could cope with a publication of that kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 247).</p>
<p>The problems confronted by WikiLeaks were not merely technical. In its early days, the organization assumed that the simple act of disclosing information would be enough to trigger political action. When WikiLeaks released a series of US military counterinsurgency manuals in 2008, Domscheit-Berg says that he ‘thought this handbook would cause outrage around the world, and I expected journalists to beat down our doors’. The manuals described techniques for preventing the overthrow of governments friendly to the United States. The reaction was negligible. ‘No one cared’, says Domscheit-Berg, ‘because the subject matter was too complex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 174–175).</p>
<p>As the British journalist John Lanchester has recently observed, WikiLeaks’ ‘release of information is unprecedented: but it is not journalism. The data need to be interpreted, studied, made into a story’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852311429428">Lanchester, 2010</xref>). WikiLeaks attempted to do this itself when it released the Iraq helicopter video in April 2010. Assange ‘premiered’ the video at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, and packaged it so that its significance would be clear. The edited video, said Assange, provided evidence of ‘collateral murder’, of ‘indiscriminate … [and] unprovoked’ killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311429428">Cohen and Stelter, 2010</xref>). Assange made clear that his intention was to capture public attention. ‘The promise we make to our sources’, Assange said a week later, ‘is [that] we will try and get the maximum possible political impact for the material that they give to us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311429428">Assange, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Even with this priming, the public reaction was muted. ‘Something went wrong’, say Leigh and Harding. The release again failed to generate ‘universal outrage and pressure for reform’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 70). On the contrary, many people turned on WikiLeaks itself, charging that it had manipulated the video to bolster its allegations of military misconduct. ‘This strategy for stirring up public interest was a mistake’, Domscheit-Berg agrees. ‘A lot of people [felt] … that they were being led around by the nose’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 163).</p>
<p>The release of the Afghan war logs in July 2010 gave WikiLeaks further evidence of its own limitations in managing the release of sensitive information. The logs were ‘vast, confusing, and impossible to navigate’, Leigh and Harding say, ‘an impenetrable forest of military jargon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 101). Furthermore, the logs contained the names of many individuals who had cooperated with the American military and whose lives could be threatened if their names, or other identifying information, was disclosed. WikiLeaks recognized the need for a ‘harm minimization’ plan but lacked the field knowledge necessary to make good decisions about redaction. It was also overwhelmed by the scale of the task. ‘Ninety-one thousand documents!’ Domscheit-Berg thought before the release of the Afghan logs. ‘It was simply too much … There was no way we could do what we needed to with the raw material’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 183).</p>
<p>Technical problems with handling data, lack of skill in redacting and interpreting records, failure in capturing public attention – by the summer of 2010, all of these difficulties had driven WikiLeaks to seek a partnership with major media outlets in handling the release of US diplomatic and military records. A media consortium collaborated with WikiLeaks on all of its major releases of 2010: the Afghan war logs, the Iraq war logs, and the US State Department’s diplomatic cables. By the end of 2010 this consortium included <italic>The New York Times</italic>, the <italic>Guardian</italic>, <italic>Der Spiegel</italic>, <italic>Le Monde</italic>, and <italic>El Pais</italic>. Of these five newspapers, the first three bore most of the burden in processing WikiLeaks’ material.</p>
<p>The leaders of this consortium have given breathless accounts of the effort that they put into the handling of these records. The <italic>Guardian</italic> organized what it called ‘a multinational war room’ within its London headquarters to interpret the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 104–105). The <italic>New York Times</italic> also assembled its own team of reporters ‘with extensive experience in the field … in an out-of-the-way office’ in its Manhattan headquarters. The <italic>Times</italic>’ reporters ‘fashion[ed] coherent and instructive reporting from a jumble of raw field reports’, said Executive Editor Bill Keller. ‘[They] supplied context, nuance, and skepticism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311429428">New York Times, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar method was used in handling the much larger collection of State Department cables. The <italic>Times</italic>’ Washington bureau coordinated consultations with State Department officials to determine whether information was too sensitive to be released. In London, meanwhile, the editor-in-chief of the <italic>Guardian</italic>, Alan Rusbridger, told Assange that the newspaper had ‘thrown huge resources’ at the interpretation of the cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 172). It had legal counsel standing by to advise on the review and release of documents. The work was ‘exhilarating’, said the <italic>Guardian</italic>’s chief legal advisor. ‘You got completely sucked in. Suddenly you find yourself becoming an expert on all the world’s governments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 185–187).</p>
<p>The immediate temptation for a reader is also to be sucked in by the excitement surrounding the handling of the leaked material, and impressed by the scale and intensity of the consortium’s effort to interpret the leaked information. And certainly we should be thankful that this effort was made. At the same time we must recognize that it was, in the broader scheme of things, a very small project of data interpretation, vastly inferior in scale and sophistication to the governmental structures to which it was opposed. The inequality in resources was illustrated as the media consortium consulted with federal officials on the release of the Iraq war logs. While a small team of reporters worked on one side, the Defence Department established an Information Review Task Force that relied on more than 100 analysts to comb through records that might be released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852311429428">Fallon, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The media consortium provided several essential services for WikiLeaks. It gave technical assistance in organizing data, and provided the expertise needed to decode and interpret records. It opened a channel for communication with government officials which Assange himself was unable to establish. The consortium also had access to skilled legal advisors, and by becoming complicitous themselves in the release of documents, helped to shield WikiLeaks against criminal prosecution. Finally, of course, these media outlets had the capacity to command public attention to the disclosures. They were trusted by readers and had a finesse in packaging information which WikiLeaks itself clearly lacked.</p>
<p>By the end of 2010 it was clear that WikiLeaks’ <italic>modus operandi</italic> had fundamentally changed. It started the year with a straightforward conception of its role as a receiver and distributor of leaked information. At year’s end, it was performing a different function: still hoping to function as a trusted receiver of leaks, but now working with mainstream media to decide how – or if – leaked information ought to be published.</p>
<p>For WikiLeaks this involved difficult concessions. Its media partners became gatekeepers, or chokepoints, for leaked documents. ‘We were no longer in control of the process’, Domscheit-Berg later said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011: 181</xref>). The outflow of leaked information was constrained by the newspapers’ judgement of its newsworthiness, and their willingness to invest money and time in the task of processing more records. This was, from the point of view of WikiLeaks, a distasteful bargain, against which Assange himself routinely kicked, either by threatening to release information unilaterally or by adding new media outlets to the consortium without the consent of its other members.</p>
<p>The success of this reluctant marriage hinges on the capacity of major media to invest resources in the task of sifting and interpreting leaked information. Ironically, though, this capacity is itself being undermined by the growth of the Internet. In the last 20 years, advertising and circulation revenue for major American newspapers has collapsed. In 2010, total revenues for US papers was $26 billion – down from almost $50 billion earlier in the decade. The collapse in revenues has caused several major newspapers to cease operations entirely, while others have drastically curtailed their spending on news production. American newspapers employed 56,000 full-time editorial staff in 2000, but only 42,000 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852311429428">Pew Research Center, 2011</xref>). The <italic>New York Times</italic> is one of a handful of US newspapers still capable of dedicating the resources needed to handle a project like the war logs or State Department cables. But even the <italic>Times</italic> has felt the pressure operating on the newspaper industry as a whole. Its revenue dropped by 25 percent between 2004 and 2010. It reduced its reporting staff by 15 percent in 2008–09.</p>
<p>The collapse of the newspaper industry is not a phenomenon limited to the United States. A recent OECD report observed that the same trend is observable in other developed countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852311429428">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2010</xref>). Even the <italic>Guardian</italic>, one of the lead members of the consortium, has had to retrench. Unlike most newspapers, the <italic>Guardian</italic> is owned by a non-profit organization. This has saved the <italic>Guardian</italic> from the need to respond to the short-term expectations of private investors, but does not protect it entirely from the fate of a declining industry. Its circulation has dropped by more than 25 percent since 2006. In 2009 the Guardian Media Group cut its roster of journalists by one-third.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0020852311429428"><title>The public is not outraged</title>
<p>In November 2010 the <italic>New York Times</italic> laid out what it considered to be the most important reason for publishing excerpts from the State Department cables. The documents, said the <italic>Times</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>… tell the unvarnished story of how the government makes its biggest decisions. … They shed light on the motivations – and, in some cases, duplicity – of allies on the receiving end of American courtship and foreign aid. They illuminate the diplomacy surrounding two current wars and several countries, like Pakistan and Yemen, where American military involvement is growing. … [I]t would be presumptuous to conclude that Americans have no right to know what is being done in their name. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311429428">New York Times, 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote>This is the conventional journalistic argument in defense of disclosure, and there is no doubt that the WikiLeaks disclosures provided vivid and often disturbing illustrations of the ways in which power is wielded by the United States and its allies. Whether the leaks provided substantial revelations can be seriously debated. Even the <italic>New York Times</italic>’ Bill Keller concedes that the documents do not ‘expose some deep, unsuspected perfidy in high places … [They] provide texture, nuance and drama’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311429428">New York Times, 2011</xref>). ‘The only surprising thing about the WikiLeaks revelations is that they contain no surprises’, says the philosopher Slavoj Zižek. ‘The real disturbance was at the level of appearances: we can no longer pretend we don’t know what everyone knows we know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852311429428">Zizek, 2011</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>Certainly there is a substantial range of facts about which we can no longer feign ignorance. The Afghan and Iraq war logs provide evidence that the number of civilian deaths in those conflicts is far higher than official estimates, and also that American officials knew about systematic abuse of civilians by local authorities. We have learned about American attempts to gather intelligence on senior United Nations diplomats, and thwart investigations by Spanish courts into the US practice of extraordinary rendition. We know more about the breadth of the United States’ covert military action against suspected terrorists in Yemen. And we know that there are many places in which American diplomats have considered it in the national interest to continue doing business with regimes that are rotten with corruption.</p>
<p>It might be enough of a defense for the <italic>New York Times</italic> to say that it has improved public understanding of the way in which American power is exercised abroad. But WikiLeaks itself wanted bigger things to flow from its disclosures. It wanted outrage and political action. The goal, Assange said in 2006, when WikiLeaks was just being established, was ‘to radically shift regime behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852311429428">Assange, 2006a</xref>: 1). WikiLeaks would ‘rel[y] upon the power of overt fact to enable and empower citizens to bring feared and corrupt governments and corporations to justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852311429428">WikiLeaks, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Assange told Britain’s Channel 4 News in July 2010 that he expected the release of the Afghan war logs to shift public opinion against the conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852311429428">Channel 4 News, 2010</xref>). Domscheit-Berg also ‘expected the documents to change people’s thinking about the war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311429428">Domscheit-Berg, 2011</xref>: 187). The <italic>Guardian</italic>, on the day of publication of the State Department cables, predicted the onset of a ‘global diplomatic crisis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852311429428">Leigh, 2010</xref>). The Internet activist Micah Sifry suggested in January 2011 that WikiLeaks’ work might even be ‘fundamentally disruptive to the old balance of power politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852311429428">Sifry, 2011b</xref>: 167).</p>
<p>Of course it may be too soon to judge the final effects of the 2010 leaks. So far, however, there is little evidence that they are likely to produce deep changes in policy or in the existing power structure. And this signals a third difficulty with the vision of radical transparency: an overestimation of the willingness of the American public to respond to disclosures with the required level of outrage.</p>
<p>It is not clear, for example, that disclosure of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs has substantially influenced American public opinion about those wars. Opinion about American engagement in Iraq has not changed significantly in years. Meanwhile, perceptions about the conduct of the war in Afghanistan actually <italic>improved</italic> after WikiLeaks’ July 2010 disclosures. In a CBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311429428">News Poll conducted in March 2011</xref>, more respondents said that the war was going well than in any preceding survey in the last three years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020852311429428">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are good reasons why we should be skeptical about claims that disclosures such as these will produce significant changes in policy or the political order. It is helpful to make a contrast to the disclosure of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. It might be possible to argue that the 1971 disclosure contributed to growing public disillusionment with the Vietnam war, and with the Nixon presidency, and thus to two important policy shifts: the withdrawal from Vietnam, finalized by 1973, and the adoption of several laws to increase oversight of the executive branch, including the strengthening of the Freedom of Information Act in 1974. However, it would be foolish to claim that the release of the Pentagon Papers alone produced these effects, or even that it was the major contributing factor.</p>
<p>Policy change in the 1970s happened because a host of forces operated in the same direction at the same time. The American public was exhausted by the war, which at its peak involved the deployment of three times as many troops as are now in Iraq and Afghanistan, and twice the expenditure as a share of GDP. Many Americans were also increasingly skeptical of all forms of established authority. Federal authority was further tarnished by revelations about the abuse of power by the White House, CIA and FBI.</p>
<p>Circumstances today are quite different. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are smaller, fought by volunteers, technology-intensive, and less likely to produce American casualties. There is no broad reaction against established authority in American society; no democratic surge as there was in the late 1960s and 1970s; no youth rebellion. On the contrary, the American public feels less secure than it has in decades. This is true as a matter of material well-being and also in perceptions about physical security. Terrorist assaults within the United States are still regarded as a major public problem. There is also widespread anxiety about the decline of American influence in global affairs, particularly since the advent of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>This is not an environment in which the revelation of abuses of power abroad are likely to provoke public outrage. Indeed, the incidents revealed by WikiLeaks might not even be construed as abuses of power at all. On the contrary, they might provide reassurance that the American government is willing to act ruthlessly in the pursuit of American interests, and that it actually has the <italic>capacity</italic> to act ruthlessly. To a public that is preoccupied with the decline of security and the erosion of American influence, revelations about excesses in the use of power would not be the worst thing. Revelations about the ineffectuality of American policy would be more troubling.</p>
<p>Not only were Americans not primed to receive and act on the message which WikiLeaks was sending: many seemed ready to turn on the messenger. WikiLeaks could be viewed as doing what Americans least wished to have done. It was aggravating instability. If the 2010 leaks had been narrower in scope, and targeted toward the revelation of specific abuses, Americans might have viewed them more positively. But the leaks were large and indiscriminate, and WikiLeaks appeared to suggest that its aim was as much to upset the existing order as to correct specific injustices. ‘That's anarchy’, <italic>New York Times</italic> columnist Thomas Friedman protested in December 2010. ‘I don't want to live in a country where any individual feels entitled to just dump out all the internal communications of a government or a bank in a way that undermines the ability to have private, confidential communications that are vital to the functioning of any society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852311429428">Friedman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The more that WikLeaks disclosed in 2010, the more American public opinion hardened against it. In August, 42 percent of respondents to an ABC News poll were prepared to say that WikiLeaks’ releases served the public interest. By December, this had dropped to 29 percent. A December 2010 CNN poll found that almost 80 percent of Americans disapproved of its release of US diplomatic and military documents. In a contemporaneous CBS News poll, most respondents thought WikiLeaks’ disclosures were likely to hurt the US’ foreign relations. Three-quarters of respondents affirmed that ‘there are some things the public does not have a right to know if it might affect national security’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0020852311429428"><title>Government fights back</title>
<p>The fourth and final difficulty with the vision of radical transparency rests in its assumptions about the passivity of governments. In other words, we assume that governments do nothing in response to the threats to their control that are posed by new technologies. But this is not the case. Governments are capable of responding to such threats with speed and brutality.</p>
<p>The movement for transparency must be regarded as a game that is played repeatedly. In one iteration of the game, activists use some new tool – perhaps a new law, or a new technology, or a new form of social mobilization – to extract and share governmental information; in the next iteration, politicians and bureaucrats respond to this new level of exposure by restricting laws or policies, changing their own use of technology, or adapting administrative procedures (perhaps to avoid recording sensitive information). In the case of WikiLeaks, we have already seen evidence of a forceful response from American government agencies, even though this is an administration that promised, on its first day in office, to ‘usher in a new era of open government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852311429428">US Department of Justice, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>By far the heaviest burden has fallen on US Army private Bradley Manning, the apparent source of all four of the 2010 leaks. Manning was arrested in May 2010 and held at a confinement facility in Quantico, Virginia. He was kept within a small cell for 23 hours a day, barred from conversation, and subjected to constant surveillance to guard against attempts at suicide. By March 2011, the US government had laid 34 charges against Manning in connection with the leaks. The most serious charge, aiding the enemy, could result in a death sentence, although prosecutors said they would not seek it in this case. The US government also investigated other individuals associated with the leaks. Some members of Congress also used the leaks to argue for strengthening the law on unauthorized disclosure of national security information.</p>
<p>At the same time, US federal agencies have responded to the leaks by tightening administrative controls on access to sensitive information. Manning said in May 2010 that the Iraqi army base at which he was posted was a ‘perfect example of how not to do [information security] … Weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, inattentive signal analysis – a perfect storm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852311429428">Poulsen and Zetter, 2010</xref>). The leaks themselves have reduced the probability that a perfect storm will reoccur. The Defense Department quickly ordered that computers with access to sensitive material be disabled from downloading information ‘to mitigate the future risks of personnel removing classified information’, and later prohibited personnel from using removable media (such as DVDs or flash drives) on computers connected to SIPRNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852311429428">Aftergood, 2010</xref>). In October 2010, the US Army also adopted new rules making it an offense for personnel not to report suspicions about ‘the unauthorized disclosure of classified information… including leaks to the media’. It established a ‘centralized system of control’ to track reports about possible unauthorized disclosures (Army Reg. 381-12, §§1(5)(a) and 3(1)((j)).</p>
<p>The government’s response to the 2010 leaks is not limited to the military establishment. In November 2010, the Office of Management and Budget ordered all federal agencies to review their procedures for safeguarding classified information. Each agency was instructed to ensure that employees ‘do not have broader access than is necessary to do their jobs effectively’, and also to establish firm rules against the downloading of material from classified networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852311429428">Lew, 2010</xref>). A later OMB memo directed agencies to consider adopting procedures for detecting ‘behavioral changes in cleared employees’ and requiring employees to ‘report their contacts with the media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852311429428">Lew, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nor is the federal government’s response to WikiLeaks limited to the prevention of similar leaks in the future. The 2010 leaks have also increased the capacity of federal agencies to manage the consequences that flow from substantial leaks. The Afghan and Iraq war logs gave the Defense Department more experience in managing the consequences of substantial data breaches. Following the Defense Department’s example, the US State Department assembled a team to manage fallout from the State Department cables that comprised over 120 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 199). The White House even found ways to use the leaks to its advantage. Leigh and Harding observe that it used the Afghan war log disclosures ‘to project a message’ about its concern over its difficulties with the Pakistani intelligence service, and that British officials ‘chimed in, in what seemed a synchronized way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311429428">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>: 125). Even if government officials have lost control of the information itself, they have not lost their capacity to shape the way it was interpreted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0020852311429428"><title>The scale of the problem</title>
<p>The WikiLeaks program is politically naive. It is predicated on the assumption that the social order – the set of structures that channel and legitimize power – is both deceptive and brittle. Deceptive, in the sense that most people who observe the social order are unaware of the ways in which power is actually used; and brittle, in the sense that it is at risk of collapse once people are shown the true nature of things. As Assange said in December 2006:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n a world in which leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems. … [M]ass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311429428">Assange, 2006b</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The primary goal, therefore, is revelation of the truth. In the past it has been difficult to do this, mainly (it is assumed) because primitive technologies made it difficult to collect and disseminate damning information. But now these technological barriers to revelation are gone.</p>
<p>None of this is right. There is no such thing, even in the age of the Internet, as the instantaneous and complete revelation of the truth. In its undigested form, information has no transformative power at all. Raw data must be distilled; the attention of a distracted audience must be captured; and that audience must accept the message that is put before it. The process by which this is done is complex and easily swayed by commercial and governmental interests. This was true before the advent of the Internet and remains true today. Moreover, it is not clear that the social order is either deceptive or brittle. We might even say that WikiLeaks proved the reverse: that what was in fact going on behind the curtain was more or less what most people had suspected and were prepared to tolerate. Perhaps for this reason, revelations were not destabilizing. There does not appear to be any fundamental way in which these disclosures have changed realities about the exercise of American power abroad.</p>
<p>The diplomatic and national security apparatus of the United States government employs millions of people and consumes perhaps a trillion dollars annually. Its internal architecture – a mass of laws, regulations, treaties, routines and informal understandings – was built up over three-quarters of a century and is now extraordinarily complex. Little of this happened in secret. Most of the critical decisions about the development of American foreign policy, and about the apparatus necessary to execute that policy, were made openly by democratically elected leaders, and sanctioned by voters in 30 national elections.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to deny the need for stronger accountability, and thus increased transparency, for the diplomatic and national security apparatus. Precisely because of the scale and importance of this sector of American government, it ought to be subjected to close scrutiny. Existing oversight policies are inadequate and ought to be strengthened. The monitoring capacity of journalists and other nongovernmental organizations must be enhanced. And citizens should be encouraged to engage more deeply in debates about the aims and methods of US foreign policy. All of these steps involve hard work. There is no technological quick fix. A major difficulty with the WikiLeaks project is that it may delude us into believing otherwise.</p>
