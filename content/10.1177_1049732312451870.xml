<abstract>
<p>Health interventions are currently being revamped to address the specific needs of chronic illness and population aging. In this context, focus has increasingly turned to Alzheimer-type dementia, an illness that is considered to mobilize a large number of social actors into long-term involvement of varying intensity. Linkage problems between families and professional systems have been well documented, yet the reasons for this remain relatively unexplored. In this article, we outline how we used social network data and narrative methods to better understand the linkage processes between formal and informal care systems. We present the trajectories of four caregivers of people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease who were able to establish relationships with resources outside the family. In each of the cases, the dimensions of trust and recognition were central to establishing and maintaining supportive relationships, and must therefore be understood in light of social network dynamics and the broader environment. Although preliminary, this study contributes to the state of knowledge on linkage problems by proposing “bottom-up” solutions that are client centered.</p>

<p>The difficulty of linking formal and informal care systems has been the subject of numerous publications in recent years, particularly with respect to the care of persons with Alzheimer-type dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451870">Lyons &amp; Zarit, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312451870">Szinovacz &amp; Davey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312451870">Ward-Griffin &amp; Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312451870">Wuest &amp; Hodgins, 2011</xref>). The lack of adapted services is considered a significant barrier to achieving policy outcomes of partnerships between the numerous actors involved in long-term care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312451870">Ashley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451870">Nolan, Lundh, Grant, &amp; Keady, 2003</xref>). Yet there has been little research into the processes that might explain why linkages between families and professional services are so problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451870">Brodaty, Thomson, Thompson, &amp; Fine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451870">Lloyd &amp; Stirling, 2011</xref>). Data concerning forms of communication, division of tasks, and the evolution of human and social interactions between the two systems remain incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312451870">Timonen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the relationships between families and practitioners represents a major shift in thinking and practice that is now under way in health institutions. Such scholarship marks the need to move from an intervention model based on patients’ acute and urgent needs to a model that includes an ongoing support component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451870">Coleman, Austin, Brach, &amp; Wagner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312451870">Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, 1996</xref>). Indeed, most chronic illness trajectories are characterized by situations whereby actors providing support require guidance to avoid a crisis and to prepare for transition periods. Adapting care for chronic illnesses means, therefore, developing a care process aimed at promoting physical, mental, and social well-being, for both the sick person and the actors involved in caregiving. Both the chronic care model and the social model of disability have been designed to respond in these ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451870">Coleman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451870">L. Robinson et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the increasing availability of services in the community—memory clinics, day centers, community groups, respite and food services—research indicates that families remain reluctant to use them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451870">Toseland, McCallion, Gerber, &amp; Banks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312451870">Van der Roest et al., 2009</xref>). It is thus essential to obtain a better grasp of the process underpinning the formation of links between individuals as they move through care trajectories. Thinking about chronic illness care should be framed in these terms because it is relationships that represent the foundation of patient support and care. The objective of our study was to achieve a better understanding of the linkages made between families and services as a social process. To do this, we took into account the negotiations between actors and the significance attributed to their responsibilities in the care process. Despite their key role in improving health services, such micro-level interactions between formal and informal care systems have received little attention from researchers.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312451870">
<title>From Large-Scale Studies to Processes Analysis</title>
<p>Thinking about problems of linkage between formal and informal care systems was initially based on models that anticipated the relationships between these two systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312451870">Cantor and Little’s (1985)</xref> model, for example, proposed that formal services replaced the work of families or compensated for their absence. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451870">Litwak (1985)</xref> suggested that services complemented the work of families, depending on the nature of the tasks to be done and the families’ structural characteristics. Various empirical studies have demonstrated either the relevance or inadequacy of these models, although most researchers today believe that the relationships between families and professionals are complex and subject to multiple arrangements in the course of the care trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451870">Chappell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312451870">Timonen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312451870">Ward-Griffin &amp; Marshall, 2003</xref>). The problem of linkage between the two systems has also been highlighted in studies detailing caregivers’ underuse of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451870">Kosloski, Montgomery, &amp; Karner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312451870">K. M. Robinson, Buckwalter, &amp; Reed, 2005</xref>) and research on barriers to obtaining care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451870">Carpentier, Ducharme, Kergoat, &amp; Bergman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of these studies, however, were based on large-scale survey data that have been much criticized in recent years. For example, survey data did not allow for a consideration of the complexity of the phenomenon under study. Instead, this type of research is individualist (focused on a single actor), static (presenting only a single point in time), and based on “rational choice.” In other words, recourse to services is considered a rational strategy that actors can use to meet their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312451870">Biddle, Donovan, Sharp, &amp; Gunnell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312451870">Carpentier &amp; Ducharme, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451870">Pescosolido, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, a growing number of studies are beginning to consider the complexity of the linkage process, the micro interactions between professional and family actors, and the surrounding support networks and social environment. These studies have argued that human relationships are based on a number of elements, including trust, recognition, empowerment, and social experience. The notion of trust is considered fundamental to the creation and maintenance of relationships, as it facilitates decision making, reduces the cost of transactions, encourages cooperation, and diminishes uncertainty in complex situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312451870">Brown, Calnan, Scrivener, &amp; Szmukler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312451870">Weber &amp; Carter, 2002</xref>). The same is true of recognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312451870">Honneth (1996)</xref> has identified three spheres of recognition—emotional, legal, and social—that enable individuals to relate to the world and develop a sense of belonging to a group. Recognition is central to care work, which is often invisible and undervalued, and where the relationship between caregivers and practitioners must be founded on mutual recognition of identities and competencies.</p>
<p>Springing from the individual’s desire for autonomy, empowerment is another concept central to the construction of a social relationship. Individuals take control over their life, search for information, and mobilize the resources in their network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451870">Haber, 2009</xref>). A final notion is that of social experience, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451870">Dubet (1995)</xref> has proposed as a principal parameter for understanding social relations. In circumstances where social roles, socialization, and codes fail to enable individuals to reasonably predict actions, individuals draw on their past experience as a guide. In reflexive societies, actors are programmed in various ways, notably through their experience. Through life’s challenges, growth, and opportunities, they engage in various types of linkages with other actors, be they individuals and/or groups or collectives.</p>
<p>The notions presented above can be viewed as processes that take place in a network of social relationships. According to network theoreticians, the transformation of social connections must be understood as part of a group dynamic within a context of alliances, oppositions, and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312451870">Degenne &amp; Forsé, 2004</xref>). Actions do not occur in isolation: What is negotiated between two actors might be rooted in—or have repercussions on—other relationships in the network. Networks therefore provide the capacity to circulate information, support dialogue conducive to sharing experience, interpret actions of recognition or disrespect, and adjust expectations, thereby contributing to the establishment of a trusting relationship. This perspective becomes more important for families who live in a broad environment whereby care resources and organizations are unequally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451870">Kirby &amp; Kaneda, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, some neighborhoods benefit from nearby resources and others not, contributing to social exclusion or integration and influencing the creation of social linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451870">Calkins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312451870">Grenier &amp; Guberman, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Explaining Phenomena Through Narrative</title>
<p>Over the years authors have called for a diversification of methodological approaches that are capable of understanding the complex phenomena associated with medical help seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312451870">Biddle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451870">Dean, 2004</xref>). The narrative approach represents one option available to researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312451870">Thomas, 2010</xref>). Although the focus and procedures of narrative inquiry vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312451870">Abbott, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451870">Bury, 2001</xref>), the following shared principles were relevant for our analysis. First, the narrative approach emphasizes the interconnections of actions and social actors that take place across time so that social phenomena can be understood in a daily context. As such, evolving events and actors’ transforming identities are taken into consideration. Second, by nature, narrative approaches strive for and exhibit a fair degree of consistency from the narrator—who must maintain a consistent identity—and the researcher, who must maintain theoretical consistency. Third, the analysis of narrative requires the integration of a broad range of dimensions of social life, including individual perceptions, social interactions, culture, and organizational effects.</p>
<p>In our research, we adopted a narrative approach that employed a certain degree of formalism, as we considered dimensions of content as revealed through social representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312451870">Carpentier &amp; Ducharme, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451870">Carpentier et al., 2008</xref>). The notion of a “narrative fragment” was introduced as the basic narrative unit. These fragments were part of the story and related to other fragments or sections of the account. The accumulation of the fragments formed the narrative. The process unfolded in two stages. The first stage consisted of the construction of the fragment as such: A significant nucleus was identified, which included various components that interacted in more or less complex ways (actors, actions, social representations). Next, connections between the fragments were examined. Here, we determined a logical progression by proposing, for instance, that a specific phenomenon led to another phenomenon or that they acted in a parallel fashion. In this respect, the fragment became a gateway for the continuation of the trajectory, or marked a bifurcation or a dead end. In some cases, the sequential progression followed a cause-and-effect logic (the physician’s referral led to an appointment with a specialist). Usually, however, we were dealing with a complex heuristic-type process. In this respect, narrative served as a progressive elucidation of a process in which certain factors acted or remained neutral and produced direct, indirect, immediate, and more long-term effects.</p>
<p>Consider the following example: A caregiver purchased a book on dementia and learned about the problems he or she could expect to encounter over time. The person acquired a better grasp of the situation and could speak more clearly about what was going on, with both family members and professional practitioners. Better communication promoted trusting relationships and enabled the formation of relationships with professionals. Here is a graphic depiction:
<disp-quote>
<p>Caregiver buys a book (empowerment) → knowledge acquisition → exchange with family members (network) → attitudinal adjustment → successful meeting with a practitioner → development of a trusting relationship (trust) → creation of social link (successful linkage).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The example demonstrates how linkage progression can be observed in both the construction of the elements constituting the fragment as well as the linking of the fragments themselves. Linkages of varying complexity can be constructed that include parallel actions taken by other actors acting at various levels (micro or organizational) or refer to the macro-social phenomena that transcend the caregiver’s daily reality. As such, narrative-type explanation can be seen to derive from both the respondent’s point of view and the researcher’s interpretative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312451870">Daiute &amp; Lightfoot, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Source and the Research Question</title>
<p>Data for this study were drawn from a subsample of caregivers taking part in an ongoing longitudinal study. The caregivers’ support network was determined at each interview. Data accumulated to date indicated that these support networks were comprised of family members (47.5%), friends (40.4%), and professionals (12.2%). The quoted figures indicate that caregivers did not perceive professionals as sources of support and confirmed the hypothesis of a linkage problem between these systems. In some cases, however, caregivers did form links with professionals. In this article, we focus on the trajectories of four caregivers who were the most successful in connecting with formal care resources. The research question was formulated as follows: What processes were used to create and maintain links and encourage partnerships with and between different care stakeholders? Such partnerships were described in the literature as profitable for all stakeholders, including the caregiver, the family, the older person suffering from dementia, and the practitioners.</p>

<title>Four Case Studies</title>
<p>The original sample comprised 60 caregivers (71.7% women) whom we began to recruit in 2003 from two specialized clinics in Montréal (Canada). The four caregivers described in this analysis were among those reporting the largest number of professional actors in their support networks during the first three interviews. The group included two women (daughters) and two men (spouses) from different social classes. Two caregivers were middle class, one was from a very privileged background, and one was from an underprivileged background. Three caregivers were retired and one received social assistance benefits. In three cases, the caregiver lived with the ill relative. The fourth involved a caregiver whose ill relative lived in a long-term-care residence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312451870">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The semidirected questionnaire used to interview the caregivers consisted of three sections. The first asked a series of questions about the beginning of the care trajectory. The caregiver was asked to describe the context in which he or she was living when the symptoms first manifest and to give his or her impressions of the situation. In the second section, the caregiver’s social network was reconstructed, using a “name generator” that involved seven questions about actors who provided the caregiver with emotional, instrumental, social, or informational support. For each member of the network identified in this manner, we obtained a sociodemographic profile, information about the duration of the relationship, and the member’s experience caring for an older person. Network density was obtained on another occasion. In the third section, a series of questions (e.g., “Tell me about something significant that has happened since our last meeting in [June 2004]”) was used to document the respondent’s social relationships, resources, and assistance obtained from the time they entered into the care trajectory. Resources and assistance came from family, friends, community groups, and/or professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312451870">
<title>Connection Between Formal and Informal Actors</title>
<p>Most of the 60 caregivers in our sample called on professional or community-based services at some point. However, a caregiver could technically be in contact with the staff of a day center over a long period of time without forming a significant link. Relationships sometimes developed out of frustration and misunderstanding but were pursued in the interest of the ill relative’s welfare. In our study, we considered that a connection was “established” when a caregiver identified the practitioner as being part of his or her social support network, that is, providing emotional, instrumental, social, or informational support. Numerous studies have confirmed the strength of the connection when actors maintain a relationship based on support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451870">Marin &amp; Hampton, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1049732312451870">
<title>Narrative Fragments and Interpretative Analysis</title>
<p>Our analytical process was essentially based on identifying fragments, their arrangement, and their relationships as clues to explain the linkage process between formal and informal care services. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312451870">Table 1</xref> we present fragment categories, their components, and their definitions. Four types of fragments were identified: before onset [BO], link formation between caregiver and practitioner [LF], main story [MS], and broader environment [E]. A list of components found in the fragments appears at the end of the table. Our analysis centered on the construction of fragments and the relationships among them. The aim was to seek consistency of the whole in a sequence capable of involving linear or parallel actions.</p>

<title>Case 1: Monica as the Caregiver and Her Mother as the Ill Relative</title>
<p>Monica had just retired when her mother began complaining about memory problems. Monica’s support network at T<sub>0</sub> was fairly small, with 80% consisting of family members (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451870">Figure 1</xref>). [BO<sub>1</sub>, ex] Monica worked with the public in a clinic that provided psychological services. She said, “I applied to myself what I was counseling others to do.” [BO<sub>2</sub>, ex] She was also helping an aunt with cancer. [OAD] Her mother informed her family doctor about her memory problems and Monica sought the advice of a specialist. [MS<sub>1</sub>, ne] The caregiver (Monica) used her contacts to obtain specialized services: “My sister is a physician. She’s familiar with the network.” This was the context in which she met with a number of health professionals. [MS<sub>2</sub>, se-os-kn-ne] Next, she obtained the assistance of professionals to organize meetings with family members to circulate information and share care duties. In addition, Monica ensured that practitioners communicated test results with each other: “I made sure that no information got lost.” [LF<sub>1</sub>, tr] These positive experiences reinforced the links with the attending team and a trusting relationship was formed. [MS<sub>3</sub>, em] Monica signed up for workshops on Alzheimer’s disease. [E<sub>1</sub>, ne-os-se] Throughout her life, the mother was a businesswoman and volunteer in her neighborhood and had formed numerous social ties. The family was aware of the importance of their mother’s social involvement, and Monica mobilized her mother’s friends and contacted the local community care center.</p>

<p>[<bold>T2</bold>-MS<sub>4</sub>, os-se] The caregiver saw herself as a coordinator: She chose the resources, reorganized the house, and set up appointments. “I devote entire days to doing this.” Among other actions, Monica hired two private caregivers who took turns working at her mother’s home. [LF<sub>2</sub>, tr-ex-sr-kn] These paid caregivers provided assistance and psychological support: “It reassures me. They have also experienced health problems in their families.” Discussions led to the development of mutual recognition of their work. Regarding the professionals, she said, “I trust them but I maintain my critical judgment. You have to be ready to take over because the professionals are overworked.” Monica diversified her information sources so that she did not have to limit herself to professionals for information. [MS<sub>5</sub>, os-ne-se-cr] The caregiver (Monica) regularly set up family meetings, sometimes involving professionals, which she believed helped to reduce conflict: “We do not have any conflict in the family, but we do have different ideas. Many of them say I’m way too involved with my mother.” [E<sub>2</sub>, ne] The caregiver (Monica) cultivated relationships in the neighborhood by inviting neighbors to her mother’s birthday.</p>
<p>[<bold>T3</bold>-MS<sub>6</sub>, se-os-em] Monica constantly sought to diversify helping resources and shared the leadership in caregiving with her sister: “We decided that there had to be two of us if we were going to make it.” With respect to formal services, she used the day center, home support services, and respite care, and went to the Alzheimer’s Society regularly. She was very positive about the respite care practitioners: “They love their work. They’re not just there for the money and that makes a huge difference.” [MS<sub>7</sub>, ev] The private caregivers she’d hired earlier found a job that paid more and stopped caring for her mother. The caregiver (Monica) noted that the illness had progressed. [E<sub>3</sub>, kn] As the illness worsened, the support provided by people in the neighborhood and family was no longer enough, and Monica began to look for a place in a residence. [LF<sub>3</sub>, os-sr-tr] The caregiver cultivated relationships and sought to maintain reciprocity. She encouraged family meetings and maintained respectful relationships with the professionals. She believed that her work was recognized and reported that the geriatrician was giving her emotional support: “When you’re in a rut, you need outside help.”</p>

<title>Case 2: Paul as the Caregiver and His Wife as the Ill Relative</title>
<p>Paul and his wife were enjoying their retirement. The couple had always carried out a number of activities together, and their family was happy and close, although the children were now scattered across the country. The couple was surrounded by good friends who represented 30% of Paul’s network at T<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312451870">see Figure 2</xref>). [BO<sub>1</sub>, ex] Paul and his wife also assisted an elderly woman with cancer. [OAD] The caregiver (Paul) became concerned about his wife’s condition and asked his family doctor for a referral to see a geriatrician in a specialized clinic. [MS<sub>1</sub>, se] He appreciated the clinic’s multidisciplinary team and was eager to give his feedback: “Everything went quickly and we really felt well cared for.” [MS<sub>2</sub>, se-ne-kn] The attending team encouraged Paul to join some groups: he attended talks, met other families, and joined two caregiver associations. He gathered valuable information and ideas: “You don’t get advice, exactly; people just talk about what they’re going through.” [LF<sub>1</sub>, tr] At these meetings, Paul came to realize the quality of the services provided by the clinic: “I feel lucky because no one seems to be getting such good services.” Paul trusted the practitioners, whom he considered highly competent. [MS<sub>3</sub>, ex-kn] Their friend with cancer (mentioned above) became a trusted confidant: “We’re now on the receiving end; she talks a lot with me and helps me so much during this hard time.” [E<sub>1</sub>, os] Paul, however, found the local health care services in his region to be unsatisfactory. The couple decided to move closer to a large urban center and created a financial cushion by selling their house: “This will help us prepare for the future.”</p>

I know a lot about the subject.”), at the same time working with activist groups demanding that caregivers’ work be recognized. [E<sub>2</sub>, os] The couple continued to plan their move: “Here, no one has any experience with dementia; there are no geriatric services and you have to wait years before you can see a psychologist.” [LF<sub>2</sub>, tr] The geriatrician was the only professional he considered as a support; the caregiver (Paul) trusted him completely.</p>
<p>[<bold>T3</bold>-E<sub>3</sub>, ev-ne] The couple moved to the city, and into the same building as their daughter. She stayed close and provided respite to Paul, her father, and the primary caregiver. [MS<sub>6</sub>, se] The necessary services, however, were not immediately available, which disappointed the caregiver. The wife started attending a day center for a day per week only. She did not like the atmosphere there and was put on a waiting list for other services. [LF<sub>3</sub>, tr-se] Since moving, Paul became close to a second practitioner in the clinic: she assisted him in dealing with other services and to pressure for more access to home support services. [MS<sub>7</sub>, ne-kn] Paul continued his involvement with three community groups and sought information on placement in a semiprivate residence.</p>

<title>Case 3: Peter as the Caregiver and His Wife as the Ill Relative</title>
<p>Peter was a retired engineer. He and his wife had several children, all of whom were professionals. They were financially well off and lived in an upscale neighborhood downtown. The family met once a week for a meal. Peter admitted that he had always had a close relationship with his wife: “We’ve always been a team; she helped me and I helped her” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1049732312451870">Figure 3</xref>). [BO<sub>1</sub>, ne-se] The family had no caregiving experience but all members endorsed the medical perspective: Peter and his wife were on the board of the local hospital. They saw their family doctor regularly and one of the children worked in the medical field. [BO<sub>1</sub>, sc] The house cleaner and the cook were considered part of the family, having worked for the couple for 25 years. [OAD] Peter and his wife had the same family doctor for 40 years and mentioned the wife’s memory problems during a routine appointment. The physician immediately referred them to a specialized clinic. [MS<sub>1</sub>, se-ev-ne] The wife was diagnosed with dementia and invited to take part in a pharmacological study. She was reluctant to attend this clinic; however, as a past board member, she enrolled in the study: “She doesn’t want to be treated as a patient.” The children began to see their mother more often and one of them met with the geriatrician: “It shows you how interested my family are. We are very close; we help each other a lot.” [E<sub>1</sub>, se] The neighborhood did not represent a barrier and the caregiver was well satisfied with the services: “I have been living here 20 years and I’m going to stay here for the rest of my life.” [LF<sub>1</sub>, sc-tr] His involvement with the board opened doors, and because he shared the values of the institution, he believed he could trust the staff.</p>

<p>[<bold>T2</bold>-MS<sub>2</sub>, ev] Peter was very satisfied with the clinic doctors, although they did refer the couple to another physician once the pharmacological study was complete. Peter admitted he had not received much help from the professionals, but he has a natural trust of institutions: “The doctors are very busy, but they would respond quickly if I needed anything.” [MS<sub>3</sub>, se] When the illness progressed, Peter hired a full-time nurse. The caregiver (Peter) placed great importance in the choice of this nurse: He wanted to find someone who was competent, flexible, and open to performing a diverse range of tasks. [LF<sub>2</sub>, tr-sr] Over time, Peter and the nurse established a harmonious working relationship based on mutual recognition and trust.</p>
<p>[<bold>T3-</bold>MS<sub>4</sub>, ev-co] By his third interview, the situation had greatly deteriorated, in terms of both his wife’s health and his family relationships. His wife suffered from hallucinations and continually asked for Peter; the couple’s social activities were at a minimum. A family dispute split the family apart. The main issue centered on a disagreement about the choice of a new private caregiver. One of the children wanted to hire a private caregiver, but Peter did not get along with her. The family conflict persisted, and Peter lost significant emotional support. [LF<sub>3</sub>, ss] Contact with the new physician and private caregiver was strictly limited to support (advice and instrumental). [MS<sub>5</sub>, di] Peter was going through a difficult period and was angry with his family: “My children have never helped; they had money too early.” The future appeared bleak: “I have no prospects for the future: My whole life is devoted to my wife.”</p>

<p>[BO<sub>2</sub>, ev-ss] Penelope moved in with her mother for financial reasons and to provide her with daily support. [OAD] After noticing her mother’s odd behavior, Penelope asked the family physician for a referral to a specialized clinic, where her mother was diagnosed with dementia. [MS<sub>1</sub>, ev-co] Penelope stopped working to take care of her mother full time, but other family members had trouble understanding the situation: “There’s a lot of denial, incomprehension, and several family members have backed off.” [MS<sub>2</sub>, em-se-kn] Penelope sought information and found a caregiver support group. She befriended the group leader. She then contacted the local health service and met with a social worker who let her borrow some equipment (which she could not afford herself), directed her to a respite center (which she used on two occasions), and later referred her to a homecare worker. [LF<sub>1</sub>, sr-ex] The social worker’s dedication was highly appreciated and the caregiver compared him to the other practitioners: “The geriatricians and doctors are in a hurry, too busy, and they don’t take any time to get to know us.” The worker at the community group was also appreciated; she had also engaged in caregiving, so they could share experiences of feeling guilt and denial. [MS<sub>3</sub>, cr-os-kn] Penelope’s social network remained weak. She was constantly trying to settle family fights and avoid confrontations with her brothers and sisters: “I need their help and I don’t need to make my life more complicated.” The caregiver recorded the progression of the illness, and after her meetings with practitioners she asked questions and described herself as proactive: “I’m a very resourceful person, I’m very organized.”</p>
<p>[<bold>T2</bold>-MS<sub>4</sub>, di] The caregiver’s mental health was affected by the caregiving work, and she thought about placing her mother: “I want my life back.” She believed she was not receiving enough help and that the services were not coordinated. The example she gave was of respite care: “I can have a few days of rest but they don’t tell me how to prepare my mother for the separation.” [MS<sub>5</sub>, ev-se] Her mother was admitted to an institution (in an emergency), and this put an end to the relationship with two professionals who had provided valuable support to the caregiver. Penelope went to live with her brother. She was exhausted and asked a social worker for help. She resumed her social life and began a romantic relationship. [LF<sub>2</sub>, tr-sr-cr] Penelope formed a friendship with two practitioners in the residence: “They are easy to talk to, they solve problems and intervene in family disputes.” The caregiver had no trouble delegating: “When they give me a choice, I tell them they can decide, that I trust their judgment.” The social worker continued to support the caregiver on the issues of guilt and her family responsibilities.</p>
<p>[<bold>T3</bold>-MS<sub>6</sub>, ev-cr] One of the residence staff members who was a source of support left her job, and the second worker continued to help with resolving family disputes. [LF<sub>3</sub>, tr-sr] The caregiver (Penelope) said she was “realistic” and did not expect the impossible from these services. She monitored the situation but did not demand explanations for everything. The relationship with her social worker was essential to her: “She is a willing ear, a supportive shoulder. She listens to me and gives good advice.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The four caregivers who were the subject of this analysis had one point in common: They succeeded in creating links with formal services and maintaining them over many years. Unfortunately, as this situation was rare in the sample, we wanted to better understand the processes that enabled the establishment of such linkages. We proposed that the formation of social links relied on social support and the establishment of a trusting relationship and/or social recognition, but that these dimensions took root in social relationships. When combined with network analysis, the narrative fragment approach offered the flexibility required to integrate the numerous dimensions that contributed to successful linkage.</p>
<p>The four caregivers had various social locations in terms of gender, residential status, social class, and state of health, but all succeeded in mobilizing support outside of the family. What were their common strategies? First, they made caring for their ill relative a central focus of their life and devoted much effort to covering a broad array of activities (recreation, medical follow-up, and so forth). Second, these caregivers used several services and through these encounters developed close ties with practitioners. Finally, these four caregivers organized themselves from the very start of the care trajectory, which enabled them to better prepare for the future.</p>
<p>We can now discuss the various strategies that caregivers used to compensate for the skills or resources they lacked. For instance, although Paul and Peter had limited experience with illness, they surrounded themselves with experienced people (private caregivers, community group members) who helped them rapidly assimilate information. Experience was thus a key concept in the area of health that enabled caregivers to thoroughly assess situations, anticipate events, and set priorities. This supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312451870">Suitor, Pillemer, and Keeton (1995)</xref>, who have highlighted how shared experience among social actors is a stronger foundation for the creation of supportive relationships than variables such as gender, age, and marital status. The notions of trust and recognition have also been shown as central to the formation of links. Although trust can be built spontaneously—from a few comforting words or a setting containing symbolic elements that spark a sense of belonging—it was most frequently developed over time in the context of stable relationships conductive to a process of learning about the social actors’ qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451870">L. Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Social recognition in relation to “care work” also developed in the course of long discussions whereby caregivers gradually learned to appreciate their respective involvement and competencies. Our study revealed that links formed with professionals were rooted more in trust, whereas those with members of community groups seemed to combine trust and recognition. The stronger networks were those in which all actors, formal and informal, combined support with trust and recognition.</p>
<p>In addition, there was undeniably a network effect observed at different levels in the process of establishing linkages among care systems. Caregivers were aware of the potential impact of their home neighborhood and realized the importance of good management of daily social relationships. In delegating tasks and diversifying their requests for social support, caregivers expressed their concerns for overburdening the members of their networks. For example, although some were less available at certain moments, they could be called on at other times during the trajectory. But what was critical was how several of the caregivers surrounded themselves with people who could offer them advice and emotional support. Both of these elements were crucial to decision making and the formation of links with practitioners. Decisions that were made throughout the care trajectory emerged from a foundation of subjectivity and emotion that could be reinforced by discussions and interactions to shed light on changing conditions and/or help structure a caregiver’s thinking. Caregivers were engaged in a constant process of constructing their responses and actions based on interactions with the members of their network. In particular, discussions with informal actors were considered to help better prepare them for meetings with formal practitioners by adjusting their expectations, comparing experiences, and/or contextualizing their situation. Interactions with a few key actors had both a direct and an indirect impact on their linkage with professional practitioners.</p>
<sec id="section16-1049732312451870">
<title>Academic Considerations</title>
<p>The nature of action is a central debate in the social sciences. Whereas some sociological traditions have suggested that action is a result of the assimilation of social roles that dictate behavior, recent authors have referred more to the increasingly complex roles and multiple cultural affiliations of individual members of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451870">Stryker &amp; Burke, 2000</xref>). As such, explanations focused on the creation of new social connections can increasingly be based on concepts such as those introduced in this study rather than on personal attributes such age or level of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312451870">Sabir, Pillemer, Suitor, &amp; Patterson, 2003</xref>). Yet considering close relationships according to concepts such as empowerment, recognition, and experience takes place within a larger sociocultural context and has broader theoretical implications. In introducing the notion of social experience, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451870">Dubet (1995)</xref> has suggested considering individuals’ daily experiences in ways that also take into account the actual scope that is implied by a changing and heterogeneous society. We now find ourselves in a society where, rather than individuals interiorizing their roles, they construct their experiences and are called on to coordinate the diverse social and cultural dynamics that ensue from their networks of relationships under transformation. The methodology proposed in this article was intended to take context into account in a way that would avoid linear causality. Human actions take place within a constellation of phenomena at many levels that involve meanings and subjectivities that are shared to varying degrees. In other words, we exist in a “network” of causality where a number of mechanisms contribute to the formation of social links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312451870">Carpentier &amp; Bernard, 2011</xref>). The narrative fragment approach was for us an appropriate tool to explain the linkage between systems based on a dynamic analysis of the negotiations between actors and their environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312451870">
<title>Implications for Intervention Planning</title>
<p>Until now, care programs have primarily been developed by experts, although many have argued that reforms should be “bottom-up” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451870">Killeen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451870">Martin &amp; Sturmberg, 2009</xref>). We take the position that caregivers and their families have expertise relevant for rethinking care programs. For instance, we have seen that the managerial principles of efficiency and coordinated or integrated care services are inapplicable in situations in which no bonds of trust and recognition have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451870">Grenier &amp; Wong, 2010</xref>). The reform of health care systems and, in particular, responses to client groups such as persons with dementia, require a better grasp of how social relationships that encourage cooperation among various actors in care delivery are formed. On embarking on a chronic care trajectory, caregivers go through a notable experience; social recognition processes should thus be central to the relationships between caregivers and practitioners. Linkage cannot be achieved if relational values focus solely on expert knowledge and rational modes of operation. In many cases, caregivers are on a path that ultimately leads their loved one to death. As such, their trajectory is not about seeking a cure but is rather a process of accompaniment in which no one formula is better than another. If practitioners were to receive training and the space within which to meet and develop supportive relationships based on trust and recognition, they would be more likely to form solid links with families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451870">Grenier, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section18-1049732312451870">
<title>Study Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The strength of drawing on the cases of four caregivers lies not in its representativeness or potential for generalization. Rather, case illustrations allowed us to conduct an in-depth examination of issues of which we still have little understanding and, in doing so, to stimulate theoretical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312451870">Stake, 2000</xref>). In our study, we conducted a detailed examination of a limited number of cases in an attempt to explain a complex phenomenon. However, we recognize that a comparison of similar themes and insights can strengthen the validity of the narrative approach. The next stage of the research consists of contrasting the four trajectories presented in this article with the histories of caregivers who have not succeeded, or did not wish to form linkages with the public system. New concepts will surely emerge from these analyses, such as lack of reciprocity, sensitivity, or respect. Continued exploration is needed to improve our understanding of assistance of families in public systems of care.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of our study can be contextualized in what has been referred to as a crisis of confidence that exists between citizens and the state, and in particular between families and health practitioners. In a context where the health systems of most Western countries are adapting to the growing need to provide elder care, one of the greatest challenges for social scientists is to better understand the relationship between institutions and individuals. With social and human relationships at the heart of health care reform, scholars need to better understand these relationships to advocate for and implement change. However, it is apparent that the challenges related to linkage phenomena will not simply be solved by minor adjustments or establishing new programs. The medical system must also adapt, moving from the model of standardized programs to an approach that incorporates the unforeseen, uncertain, and diverse viewpoints. The heterogeneous nature of populations and family situations, combined with a growing number of actors who range in their responses to care systems, raise challenges for understanding the complexity of the social phenomenon of linkage.</p>
