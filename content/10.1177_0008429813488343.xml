<p>While it may be suggested, under the manifold and ever-shifting definitions of religion in the academy, that environmentalism is already a tradition bearing many of the attributes associated with differing forms of religious belief, it is worth differentiating between such an outside assessment and an internal identification on the part of an individual, group, or movement. In Bron Taylor’s <italic>Dark Green Religion </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429813488343">2010</xref>), various forms of established thought with regard to environmental ethics are brought together in a way which suggests that they are key elements of a religious movement in and of itself. For Taylor, to be “dark green” is not simply to infuse pre-existing foundational tenets of belief with environmental significance, it is to be a member of a fresh (albeit deeply rooted) religious tradition and community. His project in this book is, at least in part, one of displaying the varying ways in which dark green religion already exists, whether acknowledged or not, within a variety of environmentally sensitive, earth-centered, or bio-centric philosophies and traditions.</p>
<p>It may be worth critically addressing, however, the question of whether or not such a task is entirely benign – particularly when considered at the functional level, as opposed to plain formalism. The appeals to the “family resemblances,” Wittgensteinian model of the appropriation of religious designations may outwardly appear neutral on the level of mere identification – that is, to call something “religious” because to the observer it appears to be akin to “religion”; however, the reception of such a label may be more problematic. When Taylor asserts that there are individuals who express convictions that “resemble religious characteristics without being self-consciously religious” (2010: 71), and who are included in his definition of practitioners of dark green religion, scholars of religion should feel cause for concern. Thanks to the work of Jonathan Z. Smith, Tomoko Masuzawa, Wilfred Cantwell Smith and others,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429813488343">1</xref>
</sup> those in our field should by now be intensely aware of the difficulties that come with ascribing such labels. While such scholars generally accept the power that comes with “naming” for the purposes of academic categorization, none are unaware of the potential for homogenization that comes in labeling groups or individuals as “religious.” This concern, in general, is given insufficient treatment in Taylor’s work, as will become evident.</p>
<p>In this vein, it is worth recalling Jonathan Z. Smith’s disturbing account of early anthropologists’ encounters with natives of the Canary Islands, who were said to have “no religion at all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429813488343">1998</xref>: 269). His now classic essay, “Religion, Religions, Religious,” begins with the discussion of this dismissal of potential indigenous religious practices by colonists, who seemed immediately convinced that such “primitive” individuals could not possibly hold the same kinds of complex, cosmological, meaning-making belief systems and rituals held by the more “sophisticated” dominating culture. This leads Smith to outline a pattern and tendency which has long haunted the study of religion. Most pertinent to the current study is the following, oft-quoted, observation: “‘Religion’ is not a native category. It is not a first-person term of self-characterization. It is a category imposed from the outside on some aspect of native culture. It is the other, in these instances colonialists, who are solely responsible for the content of the term” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429813488343">1998</xref>: 269). This issue of scholarly “naming” is evident throughout Smith’s work, and is particularly relevant to the issue raised here – whether or not Taylor is justified in applying this title of “religion” to groups that may not willingly embrace it. Given his claim that the role of the scholar is precisely to utilize whatever theoretical tools are at her or his disposal in constructing analyses, Smith himself would not find it problematic to label an individual “religious” or “not religious” regardless of – or even <italic>despite</italic> – the individual’s own affiliation. However, some scholars, such as those named above, may agree that such labels have the capacity to violate the self-understanding of their objects of study, and thus that this kind of engagement should be approached with more caution than has been applied in the past. Whether the naming is positive (environmentalist groups are <italic>really</italic> religious, whether or not they acknowledge this), or negative (such “savages” could not possibly be religious), the issue remains the same.</p>
<p>Indeed, Taylor is but one representative of this; however, his uncritical designations of religiosity, and his indiscriminate application of the title “religion” regardless of the beliefs or intentions of his subjects, provide an example particularly worthy of engagement. To be clear, my issue is not that Taylor critically and creatively applies the term to establish a new way of knowing or understanding environmentalism. Rather, what is particularly concerning is his utter <italic>lack</italic> of critical engagement with the loaded term “religion,” and his admitted disinterest in even considering wading into this admittedly murky academic pool. In his own words, “I began this study by suggesting that explanatory power can be achieved by employing a flexible definition of <italic>religion</italic> as an analytic strategy. I also indicated that it does not matter to me whether anyone concludes that <italic>religion</italic> is a good term for the types of experiences, perceptions, values, and practices that I have described and called dark green religion” (2010: 223). Perhaps unwittingly, the hasty embrace of such a stance leads him to adopt a position similar to that of the aforementioned colonizers who rejected the “religion” of the island natives, albeit in reverse: rather than denying religiosity, he ascribes it. It is worth asking what the impetus might be for ascribing a sort of anonymous affiliation to those who possess environmentalist convictions. Are all of those who profess deep concern for environmental causes, and who feel any kind of kinship with the multitudes of life on Earth – in whatever way, or for whatever reasons – automatically subject to his designation? If so, this external identification may extend to the point of a colonization of thought, a state in which the word of the scholar overrides the self-conception of the individual.</p>
<p>To set the stage for such a critique, let me turn to the section of Taylor’s book entitled “Rejecting (and Defending) Dark Green (Para)religion.” Here, Taylor critiques Richard Dawkins’ insistence on not assigning religious terminology to what he deems non-religious experience or sentiment. He argues that Dawkins’ definition of religion is too narrow, that it focuses too exclusively on the idea of an “‘interventionist, miracle-wreaking … prayer-answering God’” (2010: 159). There is certainly little denying such a shortcoming in the thought of Dawkins and his ilk, and Taylor rightly points out the powerful weight of specifically religious language. However, he condemns Dawkins’ efforts to stress that those who utilize such language, but who are not otherwise affiliated with a religious tradition or worldview per se, “are not <italic>really</italic> religious (as he understands religion, of course)” (2010: 160). Renowned figures such as Albert Einstein and Carl Sagan are invoked by Dawkins as occasionally making recourse to the language of the transcendent, while rejecting the perceived traditional confines of specifically religious structures. According to Taylor, Dawkins uses the words of these individuals to stress their feelings of kinship with the earth, which he divorces from a religious context (again, as he understands it) by means of illustrating their well-known distance from typical religious forms. Taylor (perhaps rightly) complicates this, noting through example the complex, and perhaps at times ambivalent, thought of each of these individuals with reference to questions of god, metaphysics, the futures of religious traditions, and the like. He includes them in his definition of dark green religion, because his “definition of religion is more flexible for the simple strategic reason that it serves [his] interpretive purposes” (2010: 177).</p>
<p>Without delving into the understandably complicated thought of figures like Einstein and Sagan with respect to religious belief, we may still contemplate the ramifications of such a broad definition of religion, and the corresponding inclusion of those who are not “self-consciously religious” in this definition. This term “self-conscious” is of particular concern. There are, obviously, those for whom an identification of religiosity is lacking, and who do not perceive themselves as “religious” individuals. Despite this, they may adhere to some of the criteria or experience some of the phenomena Taylor establishes as part of his dark green religion. They are not “<italic>self</italic>-consciously” religious. Taylor, however, ascribes to them a form of religiosity – <italic>he</italic> is conscious of their religious nature, even if they themselves are not aware of it. He defines a kind of religion in which such individuals are included, even if they are oblivious to such an identification, or even perhaps unwilling to embrace it. An example of this might be someone like Tim Nicholson, who famously won the November 2009 court case in England which resulted in the protection of environmentalist philosophy under the same heading as protection for religious beliefs. It is not a mighty leap to assume that a person who holds such an environmental ethic so strongly as to assert that his convictions are <italic>on par</italic> with religious beliefs would be included under Taylor’s umbrella of dark green religion. Nicholson, however, has been quick to distance himself from such a potential affiliation: “Belief in man-made climate change <italic>is not a new religion</italic>, it is a philosophical belief that reflects my moral and ethical values and is underlined by the overwhelming scientific evidence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429813488343">Telegraph, 2009</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429813488343">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It seems that such a wide definition of religion serves the purpose of creating a meaning system that can be labeled as such, and yet which rejects what are seen as the sometimes violent and arrogant tendencies of, particularly, the Abrahamic traditions. Taylor mentions multiple times in his book that many eco-spiritualists, naturalists, and the like, are wary of such traditions, due to their often anthropocentric worldviews and their role in the overwhelming disregard for non-human life on earth over the centuries (2010: 5, 8, 32, 36, 75, 163, 170, 210). Of course, Taylor makes note of those within these traditions who try to reclaim environmentalist or bio-centric ethics and include them within their already existing worldviews – though even these, he says, often only do so by “apologetic” or “confessional” means (2010: 11–12). In trying to escape the perceived violence of these prevailing systems, Taylor may have unwittingly unleashed a different sort of negativity upon those whom he includes in his definition. Under the standard of dark green religion, the multitudes of life on earth may be spared the ravaging caused by philosophies which disregard or minimize their value. But at the same time, an injustice is done to the idea of the lived-life of humans, the ability to at least in part define one’s own self, via a sort of imposition of identity that comes with assigning religiosity where it is internally unnoticed, or perhaps, unwelcome. In this way, Taylor may be simply exchanging one form of violence for another.</p>
<p>An illustration of this in Taylor’s book might be his discussion of James Lovelock, the first modern advocate for Gaian naturalism. Taylor notes time and again Lovelock’s personal agnosticism, and general distrust of established religions (2010: 36–38). As such, Taylor utilizes the figure and thought of Lovelock as representing the difficulties of moving past the use of religious language – generally in the form of metaphor – when discussing matters considered worthy of reverence (2010: 40). While Lovelock may have grown “to appreciate the impulse to consider the Gaian system in religious terms” (2010: 46), in Taylor’s own citation of his work, he nonetheless refers to such translations as an instance of utilizing “the crude tool of metaphor” (2010: 38). Religious language serving as a symbol to cultivate a particular form of understanding may indeed be a useful tool. However, such an admission does not necessarily warrant his inclusion under a specifically religious heading. Taylor says that “it seems clear that what Lovelock would most like to see is not an ecologized theism but a Gaian religion of nature” (2010: 38). However, that does not seem “clear” at all. For a self-professed agnostic, wary of religious traditions, warning against anthropocentrism in established religions and against the concrete application of the concept of Gaia as a specifically theistic construction, what “seems clear” is that he is attempting to <italic>make space</italic> for potential metaphorical interpretations of his theories for those who already possess deep-seated religious convictions. It may be accurate to state, with Taylor, that “one need not believe in nonmaterial divine beings to have religion” (2010: 40), and his inclusion of such a wide variety of thinkers and philosophies in his definition of dark green religion may surely be indicative of this. However, it is worth asking, does this also fit into <italic>Lovelock’s</italic> definition of religion, or the definition of religion held by any or all of the other groups or individuals included in Taylor’s study? Taylor may then be imposing upon Lovelock a designation which Lovelock would not attribute to himself. His constant and consistent distancing from definitive religious statements, at least in Taylor’s depiction, suggests a negative response to this question.</p>
<p>Simon Appolloni has noted, in his contribution, that to utilize the language of religion is to wield a powerful tool, loaded with potential for meaning. In line with this, Jürgen Habermas rightly asserts, “Philosophy … will be able neither to replace nor to repress religion as long as religious language is the bearer of a semantic content that is inspiring and even indispensable, for this content eludes (for the time being?) the explanatory force of philosophical language and continues to resist translation into reasoning discourses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429813488343">1992</xref>: 51). As the case of Tim Nicholson suggests, imbuing philosophical or ethical convictions with at least a <italic>quasi</italic>-religious sentiment provides a remarkable source for the validation of these convictions in the public and legal spheres. To quote Russell T. McCutcheon:<disp-quote>
<p>Whatever else religion may or may not be, it is at least a potent manner by which humans construct “worlds” by which they negotiate not simply their way around the natural world but through which they defend and contest issues of social power and privilege in the here and now … Religious language, therefore, is a terribly efficient and often uncontested means for abstracting issues, claims, and institutions from the tug-and-pull of historical existence, thereby privileging them, their participants, and one particular view on how reality ought to be constructed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429813488343">2001</xref>: 134)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The semantic potential of religious speech offers a source of power and agency, in terms of asserting authenticity or identity as groups or individuals deeply bound to particular standards and experiences. In a sense, this can be a positive instrument for those with pre-existing religious convictions who wish to imbue their environmental beliefs with religious sanction or justification. Yet, as with all forms of power, one must always make room for words of caution. In establishing this kind of thought as a viable alternative or supplement to the already-existing global religious traditions, Taylor advocates the idea of environmentalism as religion in an attempt to move away from what he considers the violence of anthropocentrism, as a form of disregard for the variety of life on our planet. In so doing, however, it is perhaps advisable that too wide a net is not cast in delineating this new tradition. While defining others as religious participants may not be the same form of violence as the ravaging of the earth and its inhabitants, it may be a harmful act nonetheless.</p>
<p>Those who establish the parameters (and those within or outside the parameters) of social, religious, or political movements, certainly have vested interests in how such definitions are negotiated, and the same can be said of scholars attempting to etch out new understandings of religion or religiosity. However, such interest intensifies the need to avoid the potentially injurious act of removing an individual from the process of defining her or his identity. Equally damaging is the more passive act of disregarding the centrality of such self-naming in each individual’s identity formation. It is essentially to state that that person’s vision and projection of herself or himself is irrelevant, or, worse, incorrect. If the potent language of religion is indeed a means of asserting power, and if we can here include the idea of assigning a designation of religiosity, then scholars such as Taylor may be well advised to avoid laying a foundation for applying such language to those for whom it is foreign. This results in a sort of internal contradiction. Just as he criticizes Dawkins for manipulating the designation of religion for his own ends, so Taylor labels particular individuals as “<italic>really</italic> religious” – as he understands religion, of course.</p>

<p>As Simon Appolloni notes above, while it may seem that our conclusions differ, they are, rather, determined by our particular form of analysis for examining this specific example. In Simon’s contribution, the particular power that comes with an external <italic>recognition</italic> of at least <italic>quasi</italic>-religious status, particularly on the part of those with legislative authority, is addressed. For my purposes, I am including Nicholson’s attempt to avoid external <italic>application</italic> of specific religious associations, which, he states, do not inform his particular worldview, as one with such deeply-set beliefs regarding environmental justice. While these may border on, or share some form of kinship with, the religious, they do not appear to be religious <italic>qua</italic> religious, from Nicholson’s perspective.</p>
