<abstract>
<p>Aluminium smelter reduction cells typically operate at 4.5 V and 100–400 kA DC. The voltage loss associated with electrical conductors and connections is approximately 0.4 V, which equates to 10 per cent of the total electricity consumed in the reduction cell. It is estimated that process improvements of 5 MW per plant (50 000 t CO<sub>2</sub>e pa for coal based electricity) are possible through optimization of the stub to carbon (STC) contact interfaces within the anode assembly. The objective of this study is to develop a finite element analysis (FEA) model to predict the voltage loss through the STC contact interfaces as a function of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and thus evaluate the effect of this ECR on cell operation. ECR is affected by the pressure and temperature at the STC contact surfaces and is potentially sensitive to a change in stub diameter or thermal properties of cover material. In this article, a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical-electrical FEA has been developed to model the process of casting in a typical anode assembly and its subsequent usage in the reduction cell. The ECR and its dependence on temperature and contact pressure have been derived from data available in the public domain. The FEA results are presented and discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211417369"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Aluminium is produced by the process of electrolysis in aluminium reduction cells. During this complex process, molten aluminium is deposited on the cathode at the bottom of the cell, while carbon dioxide is discharged from reaction with the carbon anode. A schematic geometry of a typical aluminium reduction cell is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417369">Fig. 1</xref>. Reduction cells for a typical aluminium smelter operate at approximately 4.5 V DC with current in the range 100–400 kA DC. As the theoretical reduction of alumina requires only about 1.8 V, it is clear that there are significant energy losses in the process. Of the excess 2.7 V, power losses associated with electrical conductors and connections represent approximately 0.4 V [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417369">1</xref></bold>]. The significant energy wastage through the cast iron to anode carbon interface, which equates to about 60 mV of voltage drop, will contribute to the operational cost for a typical modern smelter in excess of $1 million per year [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417369">2</xref></bold>]. It is generally quite expensive to undertake a complex technology retrofit to improve energy efficiency in existing aluminium smelters which were typically built without much consideration for efficiency in electrical connections; therefore, primary aluminium producers have focused on anode stub hole design to achieve substantial savings in energy and the attendant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211417369" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic geometry of an aluminium reduction cell</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417369-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The contact surface between the cast iron thimble and anode carbon, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417369">Fig. 2</xref>, is a major contributor to variations of electrical contact resistance (ECR). These variations depend on not only the roughness of the contact surface but also the effective contact pressure generated on the contact surface. The contact pressure is a function of the initial air gap that forms during thermal contraction of the cast iron and steel stub during the casting process, as well as the subsequent thermal expansion generated during use within the reduction cell. The casting geometry, known as the stub hole design, as well as the temperature of the molten cast iron, carbon, and steel stub, will all influence the size of the air gap when the cast iron solidifies. When the anode assembly is set into a reduction cell, not all of the initial air gap will be taken up by thermal expansion of the cast iron thimble and steel stub within the carbon anode. Some portions of the contact interface will have very low contact pressure and result in a high ECR.
<fig id="fig2-0954406211417369" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>FEA models: (a) sequentially coupled thermal–mechanical and uncoupled heat transfer models; (b) fully coupled TE model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417369-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Optimization of the stub hole design to improve the contact performance between the cast iron and carbon surfaces was first performed by Dupuis and co-workers [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417369">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417369">4</xref></bold>] and Hou <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417369">5</xref></bold>]. A three-dimensional (3D) thermo-electric (TE) finite element model was used by considering a constant ECR applied over the entire contact interface between the cast iron and carbon. The constant ECR value would be determined via model calibration with voltage measurements at cell operating conditions. However, a constant ECR could underestimate the significance of the contact, as the actual value is strongly dependent on contact pressure and temperature at the contact interfaces. The model also ignored undesirable mechanical effects on the carbon anode that could cause localized high stress and consequently anode cracking.</p>
<p>Richard <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417369">6</xref></bold>] first developed a thermo-electro-mechanical (TEM) model using an in-house finite element code to study the complex physical behaviour of the stub to carbon (STC) contact resistance. The method is well presented and demonstrates very good understanding of the behaviour of STC contact resistance related to contact pressure and temperature. Unfortunately, the in-house finite element code is difficult to understand and prevents adoption by the aluminium industry for commercial use. For that reason, Richard <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211417369">7</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211417369">8</xref></bold>] later improved the TEM model using the commercial finite element code ANSYS®. The initial TEM model was 2D axisymmetric and then was improved into a 3D model. Unfortunately, the early ANSYS® version was limited and unable to provide a suitable contact element for a fully coupled TEM analysis. The approach taken used a fully coupled TE analysis, which was indirectly coupled to the mechanical analysis and solved iteratively. As there were no contact elements at the STC interface, the line elements (LINK68) had to be used to transmit heat and current between the contact surfaces. The same meshed model was used to independently run the thermal and mechanical analyses to determine the assumed contact status for each node of the STC surface with contact pressure and temperature. Once local contact pressure at the interface was known, local ECR and thermal contact conductance (TCC) could be predicted. The contact status and the new values of contact resistances were then calculated and sent back to the TE model by updating the LINK68 elements. This whole process was repeated until convergence. It is noted that the LINK68 elements are uniaxial elements only and could be highly sensitive to the mesh size of model.</p>
<p>Dupuis [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211417369">9</xref></bold>] recently developed the TEM model using ANSYS® version 12.0 with the newly introduced 3D element (SOLID226). The element was used for the fully coupled TEM analysis together with the TEM contact pair elements (CONTA174 and TARGE170). The CONTA174 contact element has a table option, which is used to input values in a table format of the TCC and electrical contact conductance (ECC) at each pressure and temperature on the STC interface. The method is robust, but the TCC and ECC tables as inputs for the STC contact resistance could be a huge matrix if the contact element reads a value with an interpolation function. The whole analysis with one element type only is uneconomical and requires more time to run, especially for the inelastic behaviour of materials involved. In addition, the model presented less information for the mechanical effects on the STC interface, such as the initial air gap generated in the casting process. It is noted that although ANSYS® version 12.0 is available for TEM second-order elements, it is not clear how to use this TEM model alone with the same element type to deal with different mechanical procedures under the different boundary conditions such as the casting operation and the cell operation. For example, some physical components such as cover and bath are not present during the casting analysis, which is a pure thermal–mechanical process.</p>
<p>ABAQUS software was used for this approach to determine the STC voltage drop. A flow chart of the process is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417369">Fig. 3</xref>. The ECR was defined as a set of functions of temperature and contact pressure using regression equations [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417369">10</xref></bold>] from published experimental data [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211417369">11</xref></bold>]. The functions were then programmed into an ABAQUS user subroutine (GAPELECTR) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211417369">12</xref></bold>], which specifies the gap conductance (which is the reciprocal of ECR) for the STC contact surfaces. As the first step in simulation, the thermal–mechanical modelling process will deal with the air gap change in expansion and shrinkage and contact pressure in the STC interfaces for both the casting operation and the cell operation. Second, in a coupled TE modelling process, the nodal temperature is a calculated variable while the node contact pressure can be read in from an external file generated from the thermal–mechanical modelling process in the previous step. This approach allows the ECR for the STC interfaces to be automatically determined by GAPELECTR and thus, no calibration or manual adjustment is required.

<p>The purpose of this article is to describe in detail the development of a finite element model to achieve a sequentially coupled TEM analysis of an anode assembly. A range of geometric and material parameters are then used to conduct a sensitivity study to improve the model to a quality sufficient for future potential studies to improve stub hole design and achieve substantial savings in energy consumption for reduction cells.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417369">Figure 2</xref> shows the finite element analysis (FEA) model geometry used to consider a typical anode assembly used within the aluminium smelting process. The model consists of eight components: anode rod, transition joint (Al–Ti–Steel), crossbar (including steel welds), stub, thimble, carbon anode, cover, and bath. The FEA model used four- and eight-node hexahedral continuum elements. The element type was chosen in accordance with each analytical scheme and the physics involved, but the number of elements and nodes must remain the same for each analysis. For a heat transfer analysis, DC3D8 and DC3D4 element types were used, for a thermal–mechanical analysis, C3D8R and C3D4 element types, and for a TE analysis, DC3D8E and DC3D4E element types. The details of element and node numbers of the FEA model for each part are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211417369">Table 1</xref>. The typical element edge lengths vary quite considerably from 0.01 up to 55.0 mm depending on the local geometry being represented.

<sec id="sec4-0954406211417369"><title>2.2 Analysis procedure</title>
<p>The modelling aims to simulate the TEM performance in the STC interface. This requires conducting several analyses described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417369">Fig. 3</xref>. There are three main steps in the flow chart of the modelling procedure:</p>
<p><italic>Step 1</italic>: the transient thermal–mechanical analysis and transient TE analysis were performed to determine the temperature profiles and historic data at each node of the anode assembly in the casting operation and the cell operation (at the half-rota), respectively.</p>
<p><italic>Step 2</italic>: the thermal–mechanical analysis was undertaken for cell operation to obtain the main output of contact pressures on the STC interfaces, reading the results of each nodal temperature history in the anode assembly from Step 1 as the thermal inputs. <italic>Step 3</italic>: the final TE analysis was performed utilizing GAPELECTR in terms of a function of temperature and contact pressure. The contact pressure was read in from the previous thermal–mechanical analysis (Step 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954406211417369"><title>2.3 Electrical contact resistance</title>
<p>The ECR at the STC interface is a function of temperature and contact pressure. Its value can be calculated using information already available in the public domain [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211417369">11</xref></bold>]. Mathematical regression was applied to the experimental data points to obtain the equations [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417369">10</xref></bold>]. These equations were coded into GAPELECTR as inputs for ECR for the final determination of TE performance in the corresponding analysis. Simultaneously, the contact pressure at the STC interfaces being read from the thermal–mechanical analysis allowed the calculation of electrical gap conductance for the STC interfaces through GAPELECTR.</p>
<p>The equations for ECR can be expressed as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954406211417369"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417369-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>If <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 MPa and the interface gap is less than or equal to 0.5 mm, it was assumed that there was partial contact due to micro-mechanical interlocking between the cast iron and the carbon surfaces and the ECR was set to a constant value of 8 Ω mm<sup>2</sup>. For <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 MPa and an interface gap of greater than 0.5 mm, the ECR may assume a very high value of 2000 Ω mm<sup>2</sup> and this represents very poor contact.</p>
<p>From a heat transfer point of view, an experiment conducted by Sørlie and Gran [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211417369">13</xref></bold>] revealed that the TCC between steel and carbon was very high, and that heat loss on the contact interface was unlikely. At this point, a constant high value of the TCC in the model is assumed to ensure that the heat at the contact interface between steel and carbon is continuously transmitted without any loss.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0954406211417369"><title>3 MATERIAL PROPERTIES</title>
<p>The FEA model includes cover on the top and sides of the anode and bath in which part of the anode is submerged. The thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of each material used for different analysis procedures were obtained from the public domain. As the inelastic behaviour of carbon anode material is difficult to find in the public literature, its mechanical behaviour has been assumed as elastic for the thermal–mechanical analysis.

<sec id="sec7-0954406211417369"><title>4 OPERATION AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS</title>
<p>The operating current density on the side of the anode rod (500 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup>) from the anode bus bar is 0.1 A/mm<sup>2</sup>, which gives a rod current of 7500 A. The carbon anode is submerged in the bath to a depth of 170 mm. The anode-to-cathode distance is 35 mm with a total bath height of 205 mm. The bath temperature is about 960°C in the reduction cell. In the casting process, the molten cast iron temperature begins at 1450°C.</p>
<p>Thermal boundary conditions were applied as the radiation and convention conditions on the exposed surfaces of each component in the anode assembly. The convection interfaces were applied through film coefficients and sink temperatures to transfer heat from the heating sources to the referenced environmental temperatures, while the radiation interfaces were applied by emissivity for each material and sink temperatures for the environment, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211417369">Table 2</xref>.

<p>In the thermal–mechanical analysis for the casting operation, the bottom surface of anode carbon was supported by the ground to aid convergence by avoiding rigid body motion. During cell operation, the vertical constraints on the carbon were released and fixed boundary conditions were applied to the top surface of the anode rod. In this analysis, gravitational forces were taken into account and these ensured that the anode was in contact with the flutes on the thimbles, thereby preventing rigid body motion.</p>
<p>A ‘hard’ contact relationship (described below) was applied for all contacts in the normal direction and a small sliding relationship in the tangent direction with a friction coefficient of 0.3. The contact between thimble and stub was assumed as a tied (glued) contact. The ‘hard’ contact relationship is the most common pressure–overclosure relationship for contact surfaces. It describes surfaces in contact such that any contact pressure can be transmitted between them. The surfaces separate if the contact pressure reduces to zero. The separated surfaces come into contact when the clearance between them reduces to zero [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211417369">12</xref></bold>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954406211417369"><title>5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Results are presented for selected cross-sections at a given instant in time or as history at specific locations where simulated probing points are located in the model. The simulated probing points are in preparation for collecting voltage and temperature data from wiring of an actual anode assembly in a typical aluminium smelter. The probe locations in the model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417369">Fig. 4</xref>. Each STC voltage drop is defined by two probe locations; from the stub at 50 mm above the thimble's top surface to in line with the base of the stub hole at 70 mm out from the flute base's widest point, rotated 45° away from the centre of the anode. All STC voltage drops are recorded from the right-hand side of the anode when looking into the cell from the side channel (s/c). Towards the centre channel (c/c) is a temperature probe located 100 mm below the anode's top surface in the middle of the anode. The STC temperature probes are exactly as per voltage probes but on the left-hand side of the anode with the stub thermocouple embedded 25 mm in from the surface.

<p>A site measurement campaign is usually conducted at the half anode cycle time (half-rota). This is because the STC voltage drop is more stable. For a typical reduction cell with the AP30 technology operating at 350 kA, the temperature of the lower portion of the stubs in the anode is around 800–850°C and the STC voltage drop is in order of 120 mV [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211417369">14</xref></bold>]. These values can be used as reference points to validate the modelling results because stub current in the AP30 configuration is only 2 per cent higher than in this model. It should be noted that the differences in the STC measured locations, the cell operation conditions, and the anode assembly configurations need to be taken into account.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0954406211417369"><title>5.1 Current density distribution</title>
<p>As the current density applied to the area of 500 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup> on the side of anode rod was 0.1 A/mm<sup>2</sup>, the bulk of current density through the Al rod is 0.3 A/mm<sup>2</sup>. The detail of electrical current density distribution in the lower portions of anode assembly is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417369">Fig. 5</xref>. The results indicate that the current flow is more uniform in the mid-stub holes than either the s/c or c/c ones. This is because differential thermal expansion of the yoke results in poor contact pressure distribution and subsequently leads to a high contact resistance. At the top portions of the stub hole wall, there is close-to-zero electrical current as a result of very high contact resistance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417369">Figure 5</xref> also indicates that at the welds between the crossbar and stubs, the current density distribution is locally high compared to the bulk of current density on the crossbar.

<p>The carbon stress is very high at the small curved corners of the stub hole bases, close to 143 MPa, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417369">Fig. 7</xref>. The high tensile maximum principal stress predicted in the carbon anode would indicate that cracking or damage is likely to occur in these areas. The high localized stress generated at the curves of the stub hole bases is a result of both extremely small modelling elements and the inelastic material property used. The stress within the remaining carbon anode surrounding the stub hole remains reasonable low, which is within the limits of carbon material strength (estimated as 10–15 MPa). At this point, in this model, a linear mechanical property is assumed and predictably, it overestimates the stress state in the carbon. Parameter studies were conducted to investigate effects on carbon stress by changing the Young's modulus (<italic>E</italic>) of cast iron and carbon materials. A significant reduction in the reported maximum principal stress of the carbon anode in the stub hole region was achieved when using a low value of <italic>E</italic> for both the cast iron and carbon materials.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211417369">Figure 8</xref> shows the comparison of the resultant contact zones and pressures at the STC interfaces for each stub hole wall. The peak contact pressure is located at the low end of the stub hole walls close to the stub hole base, even though the contact zone is slightly changed for each stub hole wall. The locations that have significant contact pressure buildup on the interface will have low ECR. The regions with no contact pressure represent high electrical resistance. It can be seen that there is almost no contact pressure on the entire collar area, particularly for the mid-stub holes. Limited contact pressure occurs at the collar of the s/c and c/c stub hole walls only due to the expansion of the crossbar, also known to cause ‘stub toe-in’.

<p>The resultant stub hole wall contact pressure for the middle stubs is much lower than that for the s/c and c/c stubs. The contact zone for the middle stubs presents a few discrete locations with higher stress around the bottom edge of the stub hole wall.

Reducing the stub diameter from 160 to 150 mm increases the total voltage drop by approximately 42 mV and a further reduction in stub diameter to 140 mm further increases the total voltage drop by another 38 mV. The STC voltage drops from the two simulated probe points in the anode and stub are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0954406211417369">Table 6</xref> for 160 mm stub diameter. The two mid-stub holes have lower voltage drops with an average value of 109 mV, being about 11 per cent lower than that for the s/c and c/c stub holes. This is due to the outer STC connections having a lower ECR due to the higher contact pressure being applied by differential thermal expansion of the steel hanger compared to the carbon anode. The lower STC ECR of the outer stubs results in a marginally higher current flow and subsequently, a higher voltage drop may be measured across the outside stubs.

<p>A mixture of crushed bath and alumina is normally used as cover material for anodes in the reduction cell to prevent heat loss from the anode surfaces and air burn of the carbon anode. Being unable to initially locate a suitable value of the material thermal conductivity, a parameter study was conducted to investigate the influence on the overall temperature and voltage drop performance at the STC region. Upon completion of the parameter study, a more suitable reference for the thermal conductivity of the cover was identified [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417369">15</xref></bold>]. The variation in thermal conductivity of the cover material and the resultant temperature is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0954406211417369">Table 7</xref>. A node in the middle of the anode at approximately 84 mm below the top surface of the carbon was utilized for this parameter study. A thermal conductivity of 0.41 W/m K for the cover [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417369">15</xref></bold>] provides a more realistic temperature profile compared to the initially assumed thermal conductivity of 13 W/m K when the study commenced. The low thermal conductivity of the cover material limits heat loss from the anode and consequently results in an increase in the anode and stub temperature around the stub holes. This will improve the STC contact and electrical resistance performance around the stub hole regions via differential thermal expansion of the steel and carbon components.

<sec id="sec15-0954406211417369"><title>5.7 Stub diameter reduction</title>
<p>Stub deformation usually occurs when the applied stress is beyond the metallic yield stress. Under this analysis conditions with a thermal conductivity of 0.41 W/m K for the cover material, there is a potential metal failure zone around the stub connected with the thimble caused by the localized high stress, which exceeds its yield stress and forms plastic strain. The stubs result in high equivalent plastic strain, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211417369">Fig. 10</xref>. However, due to the repeat use of stubs for the reduction cell operation, the stub continues to be deformed further and consequently reduced in its diameter, shortening the service life of the stub. In order to understand the effect on the voltage loss due to the stub diameter reduction, a parameter study was undertaken in which the stub is deteriorated to diameters of 150 and 140 mm from the initial one of 160 mm. In this study, the diameter reduction of the stubs was applied over the entire length of each stub. The original size of the stub holes was unchanged. As the stub diameter is reduced, the STC voltage drop increases consistently for each stub, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211417369">Fig. 11</xref>. The voltage loss at the s/c stub increases to 160.4 mV from 122.6 mV for a stub reduction to 150 from 160 mm. A further STC voltage drop increase to 207.5 mV from 122.6 mV would be expected for a stub with a diameter of 140 mm. The temperature of the anode and stubs also increase consistently, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211417369">Figs 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211417369">13</xref>. A reduction of stub diameter increases the cast iron volume and thimble thickness, leading to an increase in the air gap formation and resultant ECR. An increased ECR will result in an increased voltage drop for a given current density and will also result in increased localized heating at the contact interface.

<sec id="sec16-0954406211417369"><title>6 CONCLUSION</title>
<p>This study suggests that the stub hole design can be potentially improved to reduce energy consumption in the reduction cell. The thermal conductivity of anode cover plays an important role in preventing heat loss from anode surfaces and potentially reduces the voltage loss in the anode assembly. High tensile stresses in the anode carbon were predicted at the base of the stub holes where consideration has to be given to a new stub hole design to avoid unnecessary stress concentration at small edges or curves. The mechanical performance of anode carbon is strongly dependent on the mechanical material properties of cast iron and anode carbon. However, the voltage loss due to the anode assembly in this model could be over estimated as the material property data and cell operations used from the public domain were not consistent with industrial reduction cells. Further work will be undertaken to optimize the stub hole design with improved material properties and cell operating conditions and to validate the model with both experimental and plant measurements.</p>
