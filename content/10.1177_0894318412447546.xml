      <p>Discussions criticizing the value and use of the Thomson Reuters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447546">Garfield, 1994</xref>) impact factor, which measures only the frequency of citations to a journal, abound in academic and publication circles. The one-size-fits-all number-crunching procedure for determining a journal’s ultimate impact on disciplinary knowledge places the quantity of citations over the quality of substance. The Thomson Reuters impact factor procedure does not consider the mission of a journal or the nature of the articles, both of which are critical for works to reach appropriate audiences. What’s wrong with this picture?</p>
      <p>In a recent editorial in the <italic>Journal of Clinical Nursing</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447546">Oermann (2012)</xref> wrote, “Impact factors (IFs) continue to be used as an indicator of a journal’s quality despite extensive criticism about their value for this purpose . . . . There are many reasons why IF is not a good indicator of the quality of nursing journals or importance of the author’s work” (p. 299). Scholarly research reports and clinically-based evidence that appears in articles should be placed in journals that reach the intended audiences without consideration of the journal’s impact factor. For example, articles in specialty journals intended for practitioners mostly appear in journals such as the <italic>Journal of Clinical Nursing</italic>, and most if not all of the grand and middle-range theory articles that are published appear in <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic>. It is logical, then, that most citations about the substantive content in these types of articles are consistently cited in these journals. The impact factor as determined by Thomson Reuters totally ignores the mission, substance, and audience of journals. What is wrong with this picture is that the uniqueness of a journal, which appeals to a certain audience, is not considered primary by the Thomson Reuters impact factor procedures.</p>
      <p>What is more disturbing is that in schools of nursing the impact factors of journals where faculty members publish their works have been used inappropriately as criteria for tenure and promotion. “IFs were never intended for use in judging the performance of faculty members, for promotion and tenure decisions, and for evaluating departments within an institution or for use in funding decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447546">Oermann, 2012</xref>, p. 300). What’s wrong with this picture? “Impact factors measure the frequency of citations to a journal but not to an individual article in that journal. They do not reflect the importance of an article and the information it disseminates nor its use by readers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447546">Oermann, 2012</xref>, p. 299).What <italic>is</italic> important is the impact a journal and its articles have on disciplinary knowledge, which is demonstrated by the number of readers, not by the number of citations.</p>
      <p>The impact factor might be useful in the medical sciences (as shown by the large numbers published as impact factors) and with certain disciplinary citation patterns, but for the discipline of nursing it is a different story. The literature in nursing is much more varied than reports of random trials and social science treatises, which lend themselves to many citations in order to demonstrate the usefulness of an intervention or promote a social perspective.</p>
      <p>Is it time to re-evaluate for nursing journals the use and purpose of the Thomson Reuters impact factor? Perhaps a different gold standard that better reflects the mission and purpose of the various journals should be developed with or without Thomson Reuters. There must be another way to evaluate the quality of journals and their articles, especially in the discipline of nursing. For example, a systematic program could be developed that focuses on semantic consistency and coherence, rather than simply numbers of citations, which ignore a journal’s mission, the substance of articles, and the desired audience. Questions that might be considered in such a program include among others:</p>

         <list-item>

            <p>Are the majority of articles useful to the discipline and the profession of nursing?</p>
         </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>This editorial is a clarion call for publishers and editors of nursing journals and nurse leaders to reconsider the purpose and use of the impact factor. Nurse leaders in academic and healthcare institutions should reconsider the practice of using impact factors of journals in which faculty members publish as criteria for promotion and tenure and as determination of institutional quality. What is most important is the substantive quality of faculty members’ works and the publication avenues chosen to reach the appropriate audience. Will publishers and editors of nursing journals and nurse leaders in academic and healthcare institutions collaborate to change the picture reflected in the criticisms regarding the value and use of impact factors, or will they continue to support the quantity of citations over the quality of substance? Only time will tell!</p>
