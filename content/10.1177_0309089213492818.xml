      <abstract>
        <p>The semiotics of Yuri Lotman employs a theoretical contradiction. A symbol, by
          definition, must be both repeatable and unrepeatable within the same semiotic system. This
          paradox precludes the possibility of a perfectly static symbol in poetry. Every symbol, by
          nature of its syntagmatic axis, must develop as the surrounding semiotic system unfolds.
          This article demonstrates that when Lotmanian semiotics is applied to the poetry of
          Obadiah, it becomes evident that Obadiah's use of ‘day’ originally appears to be two
          distinct symbols as determined by their differing syntagmatic values. Yet as the system
          develops, the apparently separate usages of the symbol are drawn together in a heightened
          state of tension before their fusion into a single unified sign for the ‘day of the Lord’
          within the system.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The semiotics of Yuri Lotman has an unusual difficulty that could run the risk of
        ordinarily being discarded as a weakness of little value to the Hebrew scholar. The theory
        contains a self-identified contradiction between the necessitated multiple occurrences of a
        symbol in a semiotic system, and the unrepeatable character that symbol assumes in its
        unique utilization within a belletristic text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213492818">1</xref></sup> Though logical inconsistencies of this type
        may ordinarily ward off biblical scholars in search of new ways to look at old texts, I
        believe it is within this very contradiction that a benefit of Lotmanian semiotics lies for
        biblical scholars. The present study intends to survey the paradox of Yuri Lotman and the
        assistance it may yield for the study of Hebrew poetry. The conclusions drawn from this
        paradox will then be demonstrated in assessing the semiotic development of the ‘day of the
        Lord’ in the book of Obadiah.</p>

    <sec id="sec2-0309089213492818">
      <title>2. The Lotmanian Paradox</title>
      <p>Yuri Lotman views language as a semiotic system. ‘Natural language’, as he calls it,
        becomes the primary sign system from which literature is constructed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213492818">2</xref></sup> Thus all literature, whether
        poetry or prose, should be approached as a semiotic system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213492818">3</xref></sup> Poetry in particular is developed as a
        secondary sign system imposed upon the natural language. The additional linguistic rules and
        constraints could ordinarily be expected to restrain the information-transmitting capacity
        of the language, but Lotman curiously observed that this was not the case. He found that
        poetry actually had the unique capacity to bear more information with the added linguistic
        rules. This observation eventually led Lotman to the publication of <italic>Analysis of the
          Poetic Text</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213492818">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Lotman observed that in poetry, the <italic>denotata</italic> of a symbol is determined by
        two axes: the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic. That is to say, a word is properly defined
        within a poem by both its semantic domain in the natural language, and its linguistic
        ordering within the secondary modeling system of the poem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213492818">5</xref></sup> The nomenclature utilized in Hebrew poetics to
        explain this concept is more commonly drawn from Roman Jakobson's description of the ‘axis
        of selection’ and the ‘axis of combination'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213492818">6</xref></sup> As a word is placed in a poetic system, its
        natural meaning is nuanced and adjusted by the systemic relationships it holds with the
        words and structures around it. Lotman supports this fact by observing how readers draw upon
        the contextual system of the poem to interpret pronouns and previously unknown
            vocabulary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213492818">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>It logically follows, therefore, that in poetry there is no such thing as true repetition.
        If a symbol is defined by both paradigmatics and syntagmatics, then the symbol may never
        truly be repeated within a poem. While a word may draw its meaning from the same
        paradigmatic value, it may never repeat the identical syntagmatic positioning within a
        poetic system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213492818">8</xref></sup> Thus the
        grapheme may be repeated, but the semiotic value it represents may never be perfectly
        identical to a previous or subsequent usage.</p>
      <p>An example of this may be found in Obadiah. Obadiah exhibits what may be identified as
        several variations of repetition throughout the poem. Among these is the identical
        repetition of the phrase ‭הוהי םאנ‬ (‘declares the Lord’) in vv. 4 and 8. Strict repetition
        of this sort is often considered significant by commentators<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213492818">9</xref></sup> and occasionally labeled a poetic
            refrain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213492818">10</xref></sup> Yet Lotman
        would caution against reading v. 8's ‭הוהי םאנ‬ as an exact duplicate of v. 4's ‭הוהי םאנ‬.
        Though drawing from identical paradigmatic values, these repeated phrases differ in their
        syntagmatic relationships. Though the syntagmatic differences emerge on many
            levels,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213492818">11</xref></sup> Lotman's
        theory necessitates a difference in the relationship ‭הוהי םאנ‬ has with its parallel
        occurrence. The two usages of ‭הוהי םאנ‬ form a system within which each one serves a
        different purpose. Verse 4's utilization is unprecedented in the poem. Verse 8's employment
        of the phrase, by nature of being second, establishes a sequential relationship that
        remained previously unknown to the audience during the reading of verse 4. Every repetition
        necessitates at least a primary occurrence, and a secondary occurrence. The function of each
        repeated symbol is syntagmatically different in relation to its parallel occurrence. Thus
        the syntagmatic axis of ‭הוהי םאנ‬ shifts between the occurrences resulting in a different
        nuance of force and function.</p>
      <p>Herein lies the logical inconsistency of Lotman's approach to semiotics. A symbol may never
        truly be repeated in a belletristic text. Yet by definition, for a symbol to be a symbol it
        must be repeated enough within a semiotic system to establish a relationship between the
          <italic>signan</italic> and <italic>signatum</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213492818">12</xref></sup> Lotman writes that ‘the text is a concrete
        expression of the system'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213492818">13</xref></sup> Thus the primary means for understanding the secondary modeling system
        governing the syntagmatic coding of symbols within a poetic text is the poem itself. This
        approach to poetics necessitates an emphasis on the unity of the line, the stanza, and the
        poem as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213492818">14</xref></sup> These
        units become key constituents in properly determining the <italic>denotata</italic> of a
        symbol within its system. Thus the symbol must repeat within these systems. Lotman writes,
        ‘the resemblance of sign and object constitutes the minimal act of repetition'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213492818">15</xref></sup> A symbol by definition,
        therefore, may only be established by intra-systemic repetition, but may not be truly
        repeated within a poetic system. In short, a symbol must be both repeatable and unrepeatable
        within the same semiotic system.</p>
      <p>This conflict could at first glance be troubling for the biblical scholar. It may represent
        a portion of Lotman's system that is in need of revision or softening prior to approaching a
        Hebrew poem. After all, the ‭הוהי םאנ‬ of Obadiah either functions as a symbol, or it does
        not. I propose that within this paradox, the student of the Hebrew Bible will find immense
        insight into the development of a semiotic system within poetry.</p>
      <p>Instead of engaging the paradox as an ‘either/or’ contradiction, perhaps it could be
        approached as a ‘both/and’ tension. Thus the necessitated repetition and the unrepeatable
        nature of symbols become two sides of the same coin. Lotman observes that poetic structure
        emerges on numerous levels within the poem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213492818">16</xref></sup> The interaction between these levels yields
        either complementing or conflicting structural patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213492818">17</xref></sup> Lotman writes: ‘in a text a polylogue of
        different systems is constantly taking place; different modes of the explanation and
        systematization of the world, different pictures of the world, come into conflict. The
        poetic (belletristic) text is in principle polyphonic.'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213492818">18</xref></sup></p>
      <p>This leads to two logical conclusions. First, there must be enough repetition from the
        paradigmatic and the syntagmatic axes of a word for the value of its semiotic usage to be
        established within a system. Second, as the poetic system unfolds and develops, the
        syntagmatic employment of a symbol will inevitably shift. The shift of the syntagmatic axis
        of a symbol within a poetic system will inevitably produce a shift in the nuance of the
        symbol's <italic>denotata</italic>. Thus it can be expected that a symbol repeated within a
        poem will undergo development and change as the semiotic system defining its syntagmatic
        value develops around it. In short, there are no static symbols. Shifting semiotic values is
        necessitated by Lotman's theory.</p>
      <p>With these two conclusions in mind, the biblical scholar approaching Hebrew poetry as a
        semiotic system would look for several things. Not only would the scholar seek to identify
        the various systems of a poem interacting on the numerous linguistic levels. The scholar
        would also approach the poem as a developing unified system, and seek to understand how the
        unfolding system shapes and nuances the ever changing symbols employed within that system.
        The scholar could seek to track the growth and development of the poetic symbols. This
        approach to Hebrew poetry will now be demonstrated by exploring Obadiah's use of the ‘day of
        the Lord'.</p>

      <title>3. The Semiotic Development of Obadiah's ‘Day of the Lord’</title>
      <p>Obadiah was written as a prophetic oracle against Edom for the sins they committed against
        the people of Judah. There is a fair amount of diversity in dating Obadiah. Most scholars
        understand the Edomite participation in the 587 <sc>bce</sc> fall of Jerusalem as the
        occasion warranting Obadiah's accusations against Edom. Thus dates typically fall sometime
        in the exilic period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213492818">19</xref></sup> It
        is suspected that the oracle against Edom was occasioned by Edom's part in the siege and
        sacking of Jerusalem as well as seizing land from the former kingdom in its weakened
            state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213492818">20</xref></sup></p>
      <p>There has also been a fair amount of scholarly diversity in deciphering the textual unity
        of Obadiah. Obadiah 1–8's relationship with Jeremiah 49 indicates the likelihood of
        Obadiah's employment of pre-existent prophetic material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213492818">21</xref></sup> This has led several scholars to suggest a
        multi-staged compositional development of the final text currently found in the Book of the
            Twelve.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213492818">22</xref></sup> Though a
        redactional process is probable, the final form bears remarkable structural unity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213492818">23</xref></sup> indicating that the poem may
        still be read as a unified whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213492818">24</xref></sup> Paul Raabe comments that the stylistic shifts often occasioning
        redactional hypotheses are characteristic of prophetic discourse, which is inclined toward
        shifts on all levels of language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213492818">25</xref></sup></p>
      <p>By way of introduction, I divide Obadiah into seven stanzas, with v. 1 set apart both
        conceptually and grammatically as an introductory beckoning to the audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213492818">26</xref></sup> Each stanza is semantically
        and grammatically linked to the preceding stanza, tightly binding the unity of the poem.
        Furthermore, each stanza conceptually builds upon the previous stanza in the development of
        the semiotic system. Though numerous symbols are employed in Obadiah, one of prime
        importance is the ‘day of the Lord'. The references (both direct and indirect) to the ‘day
        of the Lord’ occur frequently enough that the nuanced value of the symbol can be observed
        shifting throughout the course of the poem as its syntagmatic placement changes.</p>
      <p>The paradigmatic value of the ‘day of the Lord’ can be drawn from its utilization in the
        natural language. Though the natural language of ancient Israel is largely lost to modern
        researchers, some of its paradigmatic value can be determined from literary and prophetic
        occurrences outside the poetic discourse in Obadiah. The ‘day of the Lord’ is directly
        referenced by some combination of the words ‭הוהי םוי‬ over two dozen times in the Old
            Testament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089213492818">27</xref></sup> Scholars
        are not entirely sure when the concept developed. Gerhard von Rad has suggested the
        tradition developed from holy war ritual in ancient Israel. This emerged from the image of
        God as a divine warrior who is the decisive force in battle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089213492818">28</xref></sup> For this reason, many scholars believe the
        ‘day of the Lord’ was originally directed against other nations until Amos’ radical
        reappropriation of it against the northern kingdom of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089213492818">29</xref></sup></p>
      <p>More frequently it occurs in prophetic literature in an abbreviated form of ‘the day'. This
        condensed expression is often used in oracles after the author has already begun describing
        the actions of God ‘in that day'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089213492818">30</xref></sup> Scholars suspect this alternative expression became more popular during
        the post-exilic period after the tetragrammaton fell out of use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089213492818">31</xref></sup> The ‘day of the Lord’ is referenced in this
        form over two hundred times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089213492818">32</xref></sup> It can often be expressed along with the name of the target group (e.g.
        ‘the day of Midian’ in Isa. 9.4), or a description of what the day will be like (e.g. ‘the
        day of trouble’ in Ezek. 7.7).</p>
      <p>References to the ‘day of the Lord’ are broadly used to describe a time in which God
        intervenes in human history (Isa. 13.6; Ezek. 13.5; Amos 5.18). More specifically, they
        often speak of divine judgment and violence. Thus it frequently appears in oracles against
        the nations (such as Obadiah). In addition to speaking of divine judgment, it also
        incorporates an element of divine justice in which the oppressed will be delivered (Hos.
        2.21–22; Zech. 3.18–20; 9.15; 14.10–11; Mal. 4.4; Isa. 25.6; 29.17; 35.8–10; Zeph.
            3.18–20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089213492818">33</xref></sup> Sixty of
        the biblical references to the ‘day of the Lord’ involve some form of restoration of
        inheritance to Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089213492818">34</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The ‘day of the Lord’ does not begin to emerge semantically until the third stanza of
        Obadiah. Its centrality in the poem is prefigured in the first two stanzas. The poem's first
        stanza (vv. 2–4) is composed of divine speech concerning the active divine agency in Edom's
        coming judgment. The stanza opens with two parallel curses being proclaimed against Edom in
        the prophetic perfect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089213492818">35</xref></sup>
        This promise of divine judgment is followed in v. 3 by a statement concerning Edomite
            pride.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089213492818">36</xref></sup> Verse 4 then
        serves as a response, or resolution to the prideful questioning of the Edomite heart in v.
        3. In v. 3 Edom asks, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’ In v. 4 the Lord responds,
        ‘from there I will bring you down'. The stanza ends with the previously mentioned ‭הוהי
        םאנ‬. This stanza foreshadows the ‘day of the Lord’ in two ways. First, it asserts that Edom
        has lifted himself up, and second, it declares that the time is coming when the Lord will
        bring him down.</p>
      <p>The second stanza (vv. 5–7) opens with a reduplication of the structural parallel protasis
        ‭םא‬ clauses that closed the first stanza. This provides a clear structural link between the
        two stanzas. The notable shift between the first and second stanzas is the active judgment
        agent. In the first stanza, the Lord was the active agent carrying out judgment on Edom. In
        the second stanza, the active party becomes human agents. Verse 5 employs the metaphor of
        the thief and the grape-gatherer, to demonstrate that each leaves something behind. Verse 6
        then introduces Edom in contrast to this metaphor expressing that nothing will be left
        behind from Edom. Verse 7 has no shortage of fascinating problems and peculiarities that are
        beyond the purpose of the present study. It is sufficient to say that v. 7 closes the second
        stanza articulating the betrayal and infliction Edom will receive from their
            allies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089213492818">37</xref></sup> Once again,
        a coming judgment is foreshadowed in this stanza.</p>
      <p>It is in the third stanza (vv. 8–9) that the ‘day of the Lord’ makes its first semantic
        appearance. Stanza three opens with the interrogative ‭אולה‬ clause linking it with the
        previous stanza. Verse 8 opens with, ‘“Will not on that day”, declares the Lord…’ As was
        previously discussed, the abbreviated ‭םויב‬ often serves as a contracted representation of
        the ‘day of the Lord’. This symbol is then nuanced by its syntagmatic employment in the
        secondary modeling system of Obadiah's poetic discourse. The occurrence of ‭אוהה םויב‬ is
        followed by two parallel constructions nuancing how this day is being utilized. Verses 8 and
        9 read: ‘I will destroy the wise from Edom, and [I will destroy] understanding from Mount
        Esau. Your warriors shall be shattered, Teman, in order that [every] man will be cut off
        from Mount Esau, from slaughter.’ This ‘day’ is now directly introduced as a symbolic
        representation of the coming divine judgment against Edom. The ‘day’ is Edom's, and it
        belongs to the future. This is the first utilization of the ‭םויב‬ symbol in Obadiah.</p>
      <p>The fourth stanza (vv. 10–11) contains two additional usages of ‭םויב‬. Though the
        abbreviated symbol is being repeated, the syntagmatic shifts surrounding each utilization
        reveal a change in the nuancing of the symbol. Stanza three's ‭םויב‬ was juxtaposed to the
        prophetic perfect empowered by divine agency indicating a future oriented event. Stanza
        four, however, opens with a description of the violence Edom committed against their brother
            Jacob.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089213492818">38</xref></sup> Edom becomes
        the active agent. The prophetic perfect ceases and the verbs suddenly express past completed
        action. Verse 11 then specifies Edom's crimes against Jacob ‘in that day'. The temporal
        nuance of the symbol has shifted. Whereas the first appearance directly addressed a future
        destruction of Edom, the second and third occurrences of the symbol reflect a past
        destruction of Jacob.</p>
      <p>This is a significant shift that threatens to violate the necessity for consistent
        repetition. At first glance, this could qualify as two separate signs unified on the
        paradigmatic axis but divided on the syntagmatic axis. The first is Edom's future oriented
        day of divine judgment while the second is Jacob's past tense day of destruction. The
        semiotic shift, however, continues in stanza five, demonstrating why this is not the
        case.</p>
      <p>The fifth stanza (vv. 12–14) further elucidates the crimes of Edom against his brother
        Jacob. An important shift in content and structure occurs. Stanza five employs ‭םויב‬ no
        fewer than eight times, clearly linking it with, and developing it beyond, the previous
        stanza. Whereas stanza four addressed the passive sins of Edom (‘In that day you stood
        aside’), stanza five moves to active transgressions. Furthermore, each transgression listed
        occurs in one of eight sharply paralleled lines. Each line may be divided into a bi-cola
        structure in which the first colon opens with the <italic>waw</italic> adjoined to the
        negative particle ‭לא‬ followed by the second person imperfect verb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089213492818">39</xref></sup> The second colon concludes the line with the
        ‭םויב‬ followed by a descriptor of the day. This pattern is only broken in the seventh line
        when the second colon does not contain the ‭םויב‬ formula.</p>
      <p>Here, ‭םויב‬ finds itself syntagmatically related to two conflicting levels of the semiotic
        system. On the one hand, the strong connection between the fourth and fifth stanzas
        indicates that stanza five ought to be read as description of past completed actions. On the
        grammatical level, however, the stanza begs to be read as in the present or future tense.
        ‭לא‬ plus the imperfect typically refers to a specific command for a specific occasion in
        the present or future. It does not reach into the past nor extend its authority to universal
            maxims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089213492818">40</xref></sup> This has led
        to a conflict between scholars who choose to translate this stanza contextually in the past
            tense,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089213492818">41</xref></sup> and scholars
        who attempt to preserve the grammatical temporal implications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089213492818">42</xref></sup> One cannot help but notice the irony of each
        structural level seeking simultaneously to pull the symbol into both the past and the
        future. Thus the repetition of the symbol serves to pull the previously established symbol
        into a semiotic system of conflicting tense.</p>
      <p>The first line reads, ‘But you should not look in the day of your brother; in the day of
        his misfortune'. The dual employment of ‭םויב‬ occurs in the parallel expressions ‭ךיחא
        םויב‬ (‘in the day of your brother’) and ‭ןרכנ םויב‬ (‘in the day of his misfortune’). ‘Your
        brother’ has already been identified in v. 10 as Jacob. Drawing from the principle of
        equivalence between the two parallels, it can then be concluded that ‘his misfortune’ is
        referring to Jacob. The day being spoken of is, like in stanza four, Jacob's day. This
        construction necessitates a past tense reading of the line. Thus the opening of the line
        looks to the future while the closing of the line pulls from the past. The second line
        continues, ‘You should not rejoice over the sons of Judah in the day of their destruction'.
        Once again, this day belongs to the ‘sons of Judah',’, that is, to Jacob. The repeated line
        includes the tension of tense, establishing a sequential pattern for the usage of ‭םויב‬.
        The third line reads, ‘you should not make great your mouth in the day of distress'. A
        syntagmatic shift begins to occur in the employment of ‭םויב‬. Like the preceding two lines,
        ‭םויב‬ is juxtaposed to a descriptor. Unlike the previous two lines, the ‭םויב‬ is not
        clearly linked to a target recipient. The sharp parallelism between the first, second and
        third lines would imply that the day is still Jacob's. Yet the pronominal suffixes affixed
        to the descriptor and the clear identifiers of ‘your brother’ and ‘sons of Judah’ have
        ceased, leaving the possibility for poetic ambiguity. The link between ‘the day’ and the
        target (Jacob) is weakened.</p>
      <p>The next three lines in v. 13 raise the tension between the future oriented ‘day’ of Edom
        in stanza three and the past oriented ‘day’ of Jacob in stanza four to a new level. The
        first line reads, ‘You should not enter the gate of my people on the day of their calamity'.
        Once again the line opens with the grammatical structure orienting the reader toward the
        future. Following this is found the reemergence of the clear target and corresponding
        pronominal suffix urging a past tense reading of ‭םויב‬. The tension soars in the second
        colon's concluding formula, reading ‭םריא םויב‬. The word-play is unmistakable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089213492818">43</xref></sup> Lexically and grammatically
        this is ‘the day of their calamity’, meaning the past tense oriented day of Jacob. But
        phonetically, this becomes the ‘day of Edom'. The apparently distinct symbols of stanzas
        three and four are suddenly being drawn together in stanza five as a single entity.</p>
      <p>The fifth line follows suit, reading ‘You should not look, even you, over his destruction
        on the day of his calamity'. Once again, the pronominal suffixes define the day as Jacob's.
        Yet at the same time the phonetic word-play persists. There is nearly identical repetition
        between colon B of the fourth and fifth lines. Though the pronominal suffix on the repeated
        root ‭ךיא‬ shifts from the third person plural to the third person singular, resulting in
        the loss of the final labial phoneme completing the word-play, the alliterative relationship
        remains strong enough for the word-play to persist. Phonetically, the day remains Edom's.
        The sixth line repeats the same tension, once again reading, ‘You should not send off his
        wealth on the day of his calamity'. Colon B perfectly parallels the word-play, ‭ןךיא םויב‬.
        The tension soars as some linguistic levels clearly nuance the syntagmatic axis of ‭םויב‬ to
        denote the future-oriented day of judgment against Edom in stanza three, while other
        linguistic levels sharply demand the syntagmatic axis of ‭םויב‬ nuance Jacob's day of
        suffering in the past as found in stanza four. What originally appeared to be two separate
        symbols become merged together into a single semiotic sign.</p>
      <p>Verse 14 closes the stanza with a prime representation of Lotman's ‘law of three
            quarters'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089213492818">44</xref></sup> The
        seventh line reads, ‘You should not stand at the crossroads to cut off his fugitives'. The
        absence of the ‭םויב‬ formula of colon B disrupts the structural expectations of the reader
        immediately after the systemic tension reaches its peak. The closing line reads, ‘You should
        not deliver his survivors on the day of distress'. The sequential patterning is
        reestablished, but the systemic tension is softened. Colon A includes a pronominal suffix
        that contextually would indicate Jacob as its antecedent, but colon B lacks the expected
        indication of whose day it is. The second colon's use of ‭הךצ םויב‬ is an exact parallel to
        the stanza's lowest point of tension in the third line. The day is not clearly defined as
        anyone's day. Once again, poetic ambiguity begins to surface.</p>
      <p>Stanza five, therefore, took the future oriented symbol against Edom of stanza three, and
        the past oriented symbol of judgment against Jacob in stanza four, and held the two together
        in a system that both heightened tension and led to calm ambiguity. What appeared to be two
        symbols systemically grew into one, calling for both the future and the past orientation of
        ‭םויב‬ to reside in the mind of the audience.</p>
      <p>The tension is finally resolved in stanza six (vv. 15–18). It opens, ‘For the day of the
        Lord is near against all nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you. Your actions
        shall return onto your own head.’ Here, the symbol finally appears in its
            fullness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089213492818">45</xref></sup> It is no
        longer abbreviated as ‭םויב‬ but is fully written as ‭הןהי םןי‬. It is followed by three
        expressions of <italic>lex talionis</italic> in vv. 15 and 16. Thus the symbol that ‭םויב‬
        developed into incorporated both the day of Jacob and the day of Esau. It reached both into
        the present and into the future. The description of ‘the day’ spoke of the past
        transgressions Edom inflicted upon his brother Jacob. While at the same time, <italic>lex
          talionis</italic> reveals that those descriptions are likewise articulations of what is to
        come in Edom's future ‘day'. There is one ‘day of the Lord'. This one symbol is experienced
        by Jacob in the past at the hand of Edom, and will be experienced by Edom in the future as
        divine judgment.</p>
      <p>The seventh stanza (vv. 19–21) closes the poem, gazing beyond the ‘day of the Lord'. It
        describes the expansion of Israel's borders as restitution for the injustices suffered at
        the hands of its enemies. It finally closes with the establishment of God's ultimate rule
        over the land.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Lotmanian semiotics does include a conceptual contradiction at the theoretical level. This
        contradiction, however, may prove to be beneficial in practical application. Lotman's
        paradox necessitates that symbols be both repeatable and unrepeatable within a semiotic
        system. From this paradox, the present study concluded that there is no such thing as a
        perfectly static symbol in a system. Every symbol, by nature of its syntagmatic axis, must
        develop as its surrounding semiotic system unfolds. This observation has the potential to
        yield great insight when applied to the poetry of the Hebrew Bible.</p>
      <p>When applied to the poetry of Obadiah, it became evident that Obadiah's ‘day of the Lord’
        originally appeared to be two distinct symbols as determined by their differing syntagmatic
        values. Yet as the system developed, the apparently separate usages of the symbol were drawn
        together in a heightened state of tension eventually revealing their unified nature. There
        is one ‘day of the Lord’ that different nations may experience at different times.</p>

        <p>Verse 4 employs ‘declares the Lord’ at the close of the verse, closing the first stanza
          of divine speech promising divine action in vv. 2–4. Verses 5–7 comprise the second stanza
          engaging divine speech concerning human actions against Edom. Then, v. 8's ‘declares the
          Lord’ opens a new stanza returning to divine speech promising the divine action introduced
          in the first stanza. These three stanzas are chiastically structured around the active
          agents carrying out judgment upon Edom. Each occurrence of ‘declares the Lord’ serves a
          very different purpose within its stanza and within the poem as a whole. Verse 4's

        <p>Some scholars, such as Young, Keil, Delitzsch and von Orelli, proposed an earlier date,
          suggesting this oracle could speak of an Edomite revolt against Jerusalem that occurred
          under the rule of King Jehoram in 850 <sc>bce</sc> (2 Kgs 8.20–22; 2 Chron. 21.8–10).
          Cresson recognizes that this early dating could be supported by the lack of Aramaisms,
          references to the destruction of the temple and references to Nebuchadnezzar. Many
          scholars, however, believe the description of events found in Obadiah best fits the
          context of the fall of Jerusalem. This leads to two scholarly opinions concerning the date
          of composition. First, authors such as Wolff, Limburg, Cresson and Armerding suggest a
          two-staged composition history in which the first half of the poem originates in a
          pre-exilic environment and the second half of the poem develops in an exilic context in
          close temporal proximity to the fall of Jerusalem. The second opinion suggesting a unified
          composition in the exilic period is held by commentators such as Smith, Brown, Page and
          Renkema. Many scholars suggest a date of final composition to within close proximity of
          the 587 destruction of Jerusalem. William P. Brown, <italic>Obadiah through

          as a unified prophetic composition. The pre-existent material would still be interwoven

        <p>Verse 1 employs the only reference to Edom in the feminine. Furthermore, it is the only
          place in the poem with speech from the envoy to the nations. This grammatically sets v. 1
          apart. The first stanza is composed of vv. 2–4 characterized by divine speech concerning
          divine action. The second stanza entails vv. 5–7 in which the divine speech continues but
          shifts to human agency imagery. The third stanza returns to divine speech concerning
          divine action in vv. 8–9. The sins of Edom are recounted in the fourth stanza, vv. 10–11.
          This recollection further develops into the highly structured sequential patterning of vv.
          12–14 in the fifth stanza. The sixth stanza finally articulates the ‘day of the Lord’ that
          the poem has been leading up to in vv. 15–18. The poem closes with the seventh stanza's
          establishment of the kingdom of the Lord in vv. 19–21.</p>

        <p>In each parallel, the effect of the curse (‘small’ and ‘despised’) emphatically occurs at
          the beginning of the phrase. These have been identified by Douglas Stuart as a curse of
          decimation (‭םיןגב ךיתתנ ןטק‬, ‘I will make you small among the nations’) and a curse of
          degradation (‭ךאמ התא יןזב‬, you [will be] greatly despised’). See Douglas Stuart,

        <p>The verse may be divided into a tri-cola structure with clear intra-colon parallelism in
          colon B. The first half of the colon, ‭צלר יוגחב ינחש‬, ‘living in the clefts of the
          rock’, thus inversely parallels ‭ןתבש םןךמ‬, ‘the seat of your height’, with the verbal
          participle ‭ינכש‬ functioning as a gapped verb between the phrases. ‭צלם‬, ‘rock’, is of
          course a word-play on the Edomite capital city. Excavations of the natural fortress have
          been published by William Morton. See Pagan, ‘The Book of Obadiah’, p. 447; Cresson,
          ‘Obadiah’, p. 147; William Hardy Morton, ‘Umm el-Biyara’, <italic>BA</italic> 19, no. 2

        <p>The first two lines of this tri-cola verse are relatively clear. The parallel sequential
          relationships emerge on semantic, lexical, and grammatical levels. The problem is the
          third line of the verse. Two enigmas preclude a clear translation. The first is the
          verse's opening ‘to your bread'. Several proposed emendations have been suggested to
          remedy the peculiarity. Pagan describes this as an uncertain idiom. Allen revocalizes the
          consonantal text to imply ‘those who eat bread with you’ thus reaching a semantic
          equivalent of ‘your guests'. This reading has support from the <sc>lxx</sc>, Targums,
          Vulgate and Symmachus. Wolff similarly renders it ‘your friends'. Stuart revocalizes the
          text to read ‘comrades’ based on the verb ‘to fight'. Prince likewise reads ‘those at war
          with thee'. The <sc>neb</sc> produces a unique translation of ‘your own kith and kin’,
          which Davies presumes is based upon an Arabic cognate <italic>laḥmun</italic> influencing
          an understanding of the Hebrew ‭ךמחל‬ to mean ‘meat, flesh'. Davies provides an argument
          against such a reading and rather proposes that a word has been lost from the text he
          proposes inserting <italic>lōḥamě</italic>. The relationship of ‭ךמחל‬ to the rest of the
          line can be elucidated by its syntagmatic relationships with the rest of the verse. The
          first two lines are comprised of two essential elements: a description of what will be
          inflicted upon Edom and a description of the men who will do the inflicting, described in
          terms of their close relationship to Edom. If the third line is considered part of this
          parallel, then we can expect to see these two elements. The first element is readily
          perceived in colon B of the final line. Thus the word ‭ךמחל‬ would have to serve as a
          description of the active agent in relation to Edom. The relational element is included in
          the second person pronominal suffix. What is missing is the ‭ישנא‬ of the first two lines.
          If ‭ישנא‬ is read preceding ‭ךמחל‬, then it would not only fit the parallel, but also read
          ‘men of your bread’, which is far more intelligible than the current rendering. The
          present lack of ‭ישנא‬ in the Masoretic text could be attributed to a scribal error, or
          more likely to the simple practice of poetic gapping. The verse therefore reads, ‘To the
          border they have driven you, all the men of your covenant. They have had power, they
          deceived you, your men of peace. [Men of your] bread, they placed a trap beneath you.
          There is no understanding of it.’</p>
        <p>The second problem is the <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> ‭רןזמ‬. The matter has been
          confused by the presence of a homonym in Jer 30.13 and Hos. 5.13. The word employed in
          these verses means ‘to wound'. Such a reading is notably difficult to reconcile with the
          juxtaposed ‭ךיתחת‬, ‘under you’, in Obad. 7. Several scholars rather relate the word to a
          Post-biblical Hebrew root ‭רזמ‬, meaning ‘to twist, weave, or cover'. From this root the
          meaning of ‘a trap’ may be acquired.</p>

        <p>Fishbane and Wolff both explore the semantic domain of ‘brother’, concluding that it may
          refer to both familial and political relationships. Anderson notes that this verse is
          ironically reversed in vv. 11 and 18. Krause links this wording with Genesis’ description
          of Esau's intent to kill Jacob. See Bradford A. Anderson, ‘Poetic Justice in Obadiah’,

        <p>This is typically discussed as the imperfect with the jussive sense. Recall that ‭לא‬

        <p>This sequential break is reminiscent of what Lotman (<italic>Analysis of the Poetic
            Text</italic>, p. 49) termed the ‘law of three-quarters'. He observed that a poetic unit
          divided into four sections will often employ the first two sections in establishing
          structural sequential patterning. The third section will break the pattern effectively
          disrupting the expectation of poetic progression, only to have the final section
          reestablish the syntagmatic sequence.</p>
