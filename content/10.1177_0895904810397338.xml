<abstract>
<p>This article, drawing especially but not exclusively on Bourdieu’s work on practice and its relationships with habitus, capital, and field, argues for a perspective on policy, as informed by and as practice, and applies it across all elements of the policy cycle. It is argued that a practice perspective captures well the economies of power in policy in its various contexts. A conception of policy as practice also provides analytical resources to account for the dynamic nature of the production and movement of policy ideas and their resemiotization, as they are pulled into and used in, and for, education policy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article has two aims. Underlying these aims is the desire to drill down into one aspect of the practice approaches to education policy as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904810397338">Levinson, Sutton, and Winstead (2009)</xref>. Their recent article provided a comprehensive overview of researching education policy as a “practice of power.” The first aim here then is to keep power as the focus but to centre the work around different conceptualizations of practice to capture power relations in contexts of education policy production and enactment. The first such conceptualization is based on Bourdieu’s theorizations of practice involving habitus, fields, and capitals; the second works from studies of consumption and organization practice, and the last focuses on the production of policy “meaning potential” in practice and the ways that these potentials may move into and between various policy sites. The second aim is to use these characterizations of the power relations, which are theorized through different practice-based approaches, and investigate the gains to be made as a result when applied to the various contexts where education policy is produced and/or enacted. The uses of practice here are not metatheoretical. They are, rather, a way of gathering together approaches and insights from diverse fields which may be brought together to research the intersections of power and the material effects of education policy in practice.</p>
<p>In the “totally pedagogized society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904810397338">Bernstein, 2001</xref>) the boundaries around what is education policy work, and what is not, are not clear. In this article however, education policy is about the ideas which are born through policy into the workings of schools and colleges and universities; where what happens is labeled broadly as education. It could be, but is not about broader “education” which may be seen to work, for example, through public health campaigns, television, and so on. There are no neat beginnings and endings here though, and practice, it is argued in this article provides a way of focusing on education policy work and the diversity of influences from which its (and education) practice is constituted. The argument made here is that the application of practice-based theoretical resources to different policy contexts of production and/or enactment may be felicitous for policy research. Although this desire to articulate a set of resources which may be “applied” in multiple and different sites may seem overly modernist, the argument is that the practice-derived theoretical resources provide scope for both sensitivity to the social logics <italic>in</italic> different contexts of policy production and enactment, <italic>and</italic> a degree of useful comparability <italic>between</italic> them.</p>
<p>Education policy is especially suited to such an approach, because of the distinctive logics of practice where education policy is made, remade, and enacted.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And yet we in education have allowed politicians to push us to act as if the most important goal of our work is to raise test scores. Never mind the development of the human beings in our charge—the integrity, the artistic expressiveness, the ingenuity, the persistence, or the kindness of those who will inherit the earth—the conversation in education has been reduced to a conversation about one number. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904810397338">Delpit, 2006</xref>, p. xiv)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Delpit is writing about the effects of the No Child Left Behind policy on the U.S. educational topography. It is a salutary reminder of the power of politics to march with steel heels into the terrain of teachers and children and attempt to secure a flattened terrain. But in education there is always the possibility of resistance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904810397338">Delpit (2006)</xref> later notes</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“On the other hand, I am filled with hope when I see schools like Hyde and others around the country that treat children with the belief that we are working with precious resources when we seek to educate young people.” (p. xix)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers can remake policy as “street level bureaucrats” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904810397338">Lipsky, 1980</xref>) and make education work beyond measurable performance in a test. Policy here can be seen as enactment through teacher practice rather than as simply policy implementation.</p>
<p>A few further introductory caveats are in order however. This article is overtly theoretical. It draws on policy examples, but its purpose is to contribute to the theoretical work within a growing body of literature around the uses of practice for education policy research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904810397338">Blackmore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904810397338">Lingard &amp; Rawolle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0895904810397338">Rawolle, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0895904810397338">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0895904810397338">Rawolle &amp; Lingard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904810397338">Taylor &amp; Singh, 2005</xref>; and using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904810397338">Fairclough’s [2003]</xref> social <italic>practice</italic> grounded approach to critical discourse analysis, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904810397338">Adie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0895904810397338">Taylor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0895904810397338">Thomas, 2008</xref>). Although power and its workings are the focus, there is no explicit or overriding theory of power presumed or argued for. Rather the practice orientations provide access to different ways of characterizing relations of power. The theory then will be made to work in the interests of researching the power relations of education policy practice. However, although this article aims to contribute to theory, the working together and drawing on multiple perspectives on practice is a way to resist theoretical dogmatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904810397338">Connell, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, there are no explicit arguments made here with respect to the methodological implications of such an approach, however, thinking about research as practice (in the terms offered here) may be a valuable way to proceed. The other obvious methodological possibility is that this approach may be applied to a single policy, or groups of policies around a single theme, where their gestation and production (and perhaps the research practice which produced the “evidence” on which the policy ideas may be based) are followed and the policy is traced through its movements in and around government, through media and other “external” to the government responses, and then to its enactment in institutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0895904810397338">Stein, 2004</xref> or in trajectory studies of policy, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904810397338">Lingard &amp; Garrick, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptualizations of practice proposed here have as a commonality a focus on overcoming dualisms; for example, between subject and object, agency and structure, micro and macro and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0895904810397338">Sandberg &amp; Dall’Alba, 2009</xref>). This article seeks to explore ways to think about policy through the “in-betweeness” inherent in conceptions of practice. A practice approach generates a research focus on what policy agents do and say (or write, video [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904810397338">Koh, 2009</xref>], blog, etc.) and the relations to conditions of that saying and doing. The relations are the focus, in my account, as this is where the economies of power play, and the opportunity for both resistances to and take up of policy ideas and their adherence in further policy derived work is made.</p>
<p>Policies are formed and reformed in government and bureaucracy and reformed again in the work of institutions through their management, administration, teaching, and learning. The approach taken here however, does not signify a limit to the genesis of the ideas embodied in these policies, but works to understand the complex of simultaneous production of them, in the sense that global and local (i.e., framed through the nation state) understandings are rearticulated into policy and that they are continuously remade through their reenactment in different government and institutional settings. Practice therefore provides a way of unpacking the multiple scalar interventions in and of policy ideas: where ideas with a global/local circulation are realized and accounted for in practice.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article therefore is to make a contribution to policy understandings by characterizing aspects of the policy production and enactment in terms made available through thinking about practice. The concern is with keeping the analysis of policy alive to the possibilities of the ways in which power works in and through it. The article begins by setting out broad features of practice as it is used here, and then suggests gains from using practice approaches with education policy. The subsequent three sections of the article outline each of the different approaches to practice, the way power relations are captured in them and how this may produce gains for education policy research.</p>
<sec id="section2-0895904810397338">
<title>Features of Practice</title>
<p>Possible worlds are always “in” practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904810397338">Harvey, 1996</xref>). As practice is never in a state of permanent completion, the world is constantly recreated and made possible in and through practice. The terms of its engagement are contemporaneously and contiguously the “event” and the “conditions” which allow for that event and which the event partly constitutes. Practice can account for these conditions in diverse and divergent times and places and looks to the interrelation between these conditions for explanation. This is useful when the conditions are increasingly, in the global north, in part constituted beyond the local (and nation-state). The advantage therefore is the multiple ways which practice may be viewed, in a sense from the inside of practice to both the specifics of the elements of the practice and also to the conditions which it constitutes and it is constituted by. None of the conditions therefore is “natural” or “neutral” and intersects multiply with the positional advantages afforded through historical clines of (dis)advantage. So whereas possible worlds are always “in” practice, these possibilities are conditioned iterations of iterations. What happens today is a result of what happened yesterday. But, “[I]t is not a relation of similarity between the structure of today and the structure of yesterday that is the point, but a relation of practice between them, the way one was <italic>produced</italic> [italics added] out of the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904810397338">Connell, 1983</xref>, p. 149). The ongoing production of practice is taken up in the final section of this article.</p>
<p>Following Bourdieu, practice engenders thinking in a relational as opposed to substantialist way. This is not straightforward. Relational thinking requires access to tools which can cope with in-betweenness and becomingness, with dynamic and unfolding elements, but which can capture these for discussion and analysis. Notions such as ideology, hegemony, culture, and discourse, which have been used to account for the fluidity and power differentials of social life, have lost some of their generative/explanatory capacity as a result of multiple and often contradictory uses. Although practice may be an “open” signifier to the extent that it has had multiple uses, its application in policy research is still viable. Conceptions of practice efficaciously focus on what people do and say and can account for that doing and saying recognizing the emebeddedness, and constitution of power relations which may in turn be analyzed through the concepts.</p>
<p>It will also be argued here that the use of Bourdieu’s theoretical triumvirate, habitus, field, and capitals, <italic>together</italic> may strengthen their explanatory potential. An approach to policy interested in policy production and enactment (what is most often described as implementation) in different settings, may usefully describe the particular policy field, or habitus, but without the relating of the two through the capitals which are produced and sought in this relation in that particular policy space, important insights (particularly to do with the ways in which power operates) may not become as apparent. This is especially the case in education, where students will form part of the street level bureaucracy, and when teachers exercise professional judgment to derive education relevant to a particular set of students from curriculum and other locally available resources.</p>
<p>Also, a dialectical approach to relational thinking and analysis is proposed and involves the “relationship of form with content and of content with temporality i.e. becoming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904810397338">Lefebvre, 1982</xref>, p. 58). Form and content are both crucial policy production and enactment parameters, but are static until they move through time and the contexts of people and the things they use to make and enact policy. The becomingness of policy creation, enactment, and recreation suggests that as ideas in policy circulate some of them “adhere” and some do not. In effect, they gain a temporary permanence (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0895904810397338">Rawolle, 2005</xref> on education policy and temporary social fields); the objects of study, it is suggested here, are the mechanisms which keep this permanence in place and allow it to adhere and “transmit” ideas with ease and efficacy. This variability of the social logics of policy practice and the adherence of the ideas in them is not benign. A dialectical relational approach conceptualizes the different power relations and their effects through viewing practice as having elements which are in a constant and coconstitutive relation with one another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904810397338">Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999)</xref> offer a “way into” researching practice in this way. Their proposition (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904810397338">Harvey, 1996</xref>) sees practice both with “internal” elements and in an external dialectical relation with other practices. None of the internal elements is reducible to the other and each is in part coconstituted in the practice by the other elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904810397338">Fairclough, 2009</xref>); which may be, for example, people (e.g., policy makers and enactors) with beliefs, attitudes, values, and their action and interaction; material objects; social relations such as, previous relationships between and among politicians and bureaucrats and semiosis. Change in one element of the practice will produce change in the others. So to account for change, analysis can be made of a particular element in terms of its relations with the other elements.</p>
<p>Policy is productive of the potential to change, where no change, and the continuum to radical change, is possible when policy is produced and enacted. The embedding of power relations, in practice, in each part of the policy cycle produces possibilities and constraints on the daily lives of policy makers and teachers and students alike. The next section of the article begins to work further with the idea of thinking about policy in practice terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0895904810397338">
<title>Policy and Practice</title>
<p>This section draws on previous education policy work and makes a case for the application of practice across the policy cycle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904810397338">Ball, 1994</xref>, who describes this cycle as policy influence, text production, and practice). Policy here is taken to be articulated beyond (but includes) the text of official policy documents, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904810397338">Lingard and Ozga (2007)</xref>, who outline an ecumenical approach to defining the concept of policy. This means that policy research is concerned with not only the actual policy documents but also, for example, their conditions of constitution (why the policy was written in the first place; in response to what set of problems and how these problems were “produced”) to looking at the mediatization of the policy and to the (potentially messy and uneven) enactment of the policy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Policy is . . . an “economy of power,” a set of technologies and practices which are realized and struggled over in local settings. Policy is both text and action, words and deeds, it is what is enacted as well as what is intended. Policies are always incomplete in so far as they relate to or map on to the “wild profusion” of local practice. Policies are crude and simple. Practice is sophisticated, contingent, complex and unstable. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904810397338">Ball, 1994</xref>, p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Policy works as an economy of power in local settings; a vassal for values and the authority to allocate them (following the view that policy is the authoritative allocation of values; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904810397338">Easton, 1953</xref>). This does not mean that policy ideas necessarily originate in these local places (although they may). In a rescaled polity and in an increasingly globalized or globalizing education policy field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904810397338">Lingard, 2009</xref>) policy ideas (and the values they embody) may form from a diversity of places (local, national, regional, global).</p>
<p>The most profoundly economic power though is the power which is executed without apparent investment in its exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904810397338">Lukes, 2004</xref>). It is the smooth power of the “naturalised” and “naturalising” world; the distinctions and classifications that hold the social world together in its unequal and enduringly distending ways. But smooth power always has a cost and the point is that the smoother, the more the cost is hidden (characterized as symbolic violence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904810397338">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>). So a key question is, what are the economies of power in policy? Written another way—what are the values embodied in the policy and what are the mechanisms (technologies) which make those “natural” and valorize those values economically (in the sense of with due and utmost expedience) and at what cost, to whom? Practice when used to conceptualize the enactment of power relations in education policy, it is argued, offers some useful tools to approach these key questions.</p>
<p>Realization and struggle in local settings highlight the contingent and uneven uptake of policy. Policy is never “implemented,” only enacted where “[P]olicy <italic>as</italic> practice is ‘created’ in a trialectic of dominance, resistance and chaos/ freedom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904810397338">Ball, 1994</xref>, p. 11, italics in original). This trialectic works through the textual and action nature of policy. As Ball says, it is always what is written as well as what is done that makes policy and makes it incomplete and unfinished when the policy is enacted in practice.</p>
<p>Practice is sophisticated, contingent, complex, and unstable. How best then to approach this sophistication and complexity? In response, I want to suggest here initially that a practice orientation might be</p>
<list id="list1-0895904810397338" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>sensitive to the complexity of and economies of power in different policy contexts (e.g., those of influence/text production/practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904810397338">Bowe, Ball, &amp; Gold, 1992</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>able to work with the heterogeneity within and between these contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904810397338">Taylor &amp; Singh, 2005</xref> suggest subfields within a bureaucracy have distinct logics of practice); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>able to consider the internal logics of policy practices (but also account for their immutable interconnectedness with other policy and nonpolicy practices). These internal logics are socially derived and may be analyzed using conceptions of practice where the logic of practice “ . . . defines what is and is not thinkable and what is doable . . . ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904810397338">Grenfell, 2008</xref>, p. 223).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Thus far this article has outlined the ways in which practice is conceived of here and how education policy may be approached through a practice orientation. In subsequent sections of the article, three proposals are enumerated which offer a way in which to explore and account for the socially derived logics of education policy practice in more detail. The focus of the next section of the article is Bourdieu’s theoretical triumvirate; habitus, capital(s), and field(s). It outlines how they might be applied in a relational sense to education policy contexts. A key argument made is that these three theoretical ideas work most efficaciously “in concert”; that an analysis of power relations is possible through the social logics that these ideas, working together, make more apparent. In the second detailed section, theories of practice which have been derived from studies of both organizations and consumption are reviewed and suggestions are made for their use in education policy research; taking a logics of practice approach affords the use of a variety of theoretical resources which can build a complex picture of complex education policy practice. The final detailed section synthesizes a set of theoretical tools which may enable the production and movement of policy ideas to be researched. It makes particular use of multimodal meaning making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904810397338">Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>), resemiotization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904810397338">Iedema, 2003</xref>), and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904810397338">Debray, 2000</xref>). The next three sections of the article therefore aim to articulate a complementary and richly useful set of theoretical resources which researchers with a concern for education policy and its effects might apply.</p>

<sec id="section4-0895904810397338">
<title>Distinctive Logics: Bourdieu</title>
<p>Bourdieu provides one set of “thinking tools” for considering the social logics of practice. The first is social space where “ . . . the notion of space contains, in itself, the principal of a relational understanding of the social world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904810397338">1998</xref>, p. 31). Habitus, field, and capitals are “Bourdieu’s conceptual triad” for use in a relational analysis within this social space. This assumes a socially derived relational view of both logic and practice where the logic of practice is “the product of a lasting exposure to conditions similar to those in which they [agents] are placed, they anticipate the necessity immanent in the way of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904810397338">Bourdieu, 1990a</xref>, p. 11); so teachers anticipate the world in ways which politicians may never begin to (and vice versa). This conceptualization of the logic of practice is useful, as it places an agent into the world and with a relationship to the world that is predeveloped through exposure and predisposed to engagement in the future. Bourdieu suggests that the logic of practice is not a logic of the logistician, but a socially (in)formed logic. This form of logic both is made through and within practice and constitutes the practice itself in an ongoing, but not determining way through, habitus, fields, and capitals. These three concepts, central to Bourdieu’s approach are outlined briefly below.</p>
<p>Habitus is composed of embodied durable dispositions which are inculcated within the social agent by exposure to social conditions. These social conditions are both produced by the agent and reproduced by the agent. In this dual action of production and reproduction the agent is able to transcend the conditions of habitus to the extent that the habitus is prestructured to the conditions it will meet. Habitus applies as a concept to both individual social agents and to groups of social agents with dispositions which are similarly inculcated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904810397338">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>). So a teacher habitus will produce and be produced by teaching (and its social conditions). A policy actor habitus will likewise structure policy structures at the same time as being structured by them. These distinctive inculcated dispositions play an important part in the formation of the social logics of different policy contexts.</p>
<p>The concept of habitus has been criticized for being too “pre-conscious” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904810397338">Crossley, 2001</xref>). It cannot account for the rational actor, even when rationality is temporally, spatially, and contextually bound. This reading of habitus may occur, it is suggested here when the concept is removed from its theoretical partners—fields and capital; a reductive theoretical action which is like trying to understand why a plane flies by only looking at the wings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904810397338">Bourdieu (1990b</xref>) however, does suggest that habitus does not account for all embodied action. There is the possibility of reflexivity, which may lead to a social agent understanding their location within the social milieu, which is constituted in their body and its very social functioning. The difficulty with the concept of habitus is the ways in which data may be derived by a researcher that can adequately be explained in its terms. However, field and habitus are two sides of the same coin and capital is the “medium of communication between them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904810397338">Grenfell, 2010</xref>, p. 89). Contemporaneous focus on the three concepts may provide access to the relations between them and a powerful set of explanatory ideas. Use of Bourdieu’s terms then demands an approach to research which is situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0895904810397338">Suchman, 2007</xref>), temporary and thickly descriptive. Situated suggests a need to account for the social historical geography (or geographical history; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904810397338">Harvey, 2007</xref>), from a research perspective, fixing the time and place, but accounting for the social and material construction of each.</p>
<p>A field is a network or configuration of relations between positions both present and potential, situated in the structure of the distribution of power (and capitals) and relations to other positions, which can be either dominant or dominated. Each field generates belief in its own value (Bourdieu in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0895904810397338">Wacquant, 1989</xref>, p. 39). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0895904810397338">McNay (2004</xref>, p. 184) notes, “[A]ctors occupy positions within social fields that are determined both by the distribution of resources within a given field and also by the structural relations between that field and others.” The embedded or overarching fields of power and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904810397338">Lingard, 2009</xref>) contribute to the social logics of the practices which the habitus and the fields generate. The positions which teachers and students and politicians and bureaucrats hold and the articulations of those positions with respect to the embeddings of power, and its manifestations through gender, are important to considerations of policy. For example, a minister of education holds a position with respect to the field of education which is very different to a teacher in terms of the power relations (made active through the possession of field-produced and enacted capitals), which accrue to the positions and the distribution of its effects. The politician for example, may generate policy for thousands of schools; the teacher may remake policy for 30 students. The teacher’s power will be mediated through that of the politician, but the converse would rarely be the case.</p>
<p>Also generated are the capitals (economic, cultural, and social; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904810397338">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>), the extent of their convertibility, and the convertibility of other capitals within the matrix of intersecting fields in question. In this way, relationality is highlighted. Each of the concepts (capitals, fields, and habitus) generates change in the other as they change and this change does not stop. This is a way of thinking “dialectically” as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904810397338">Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999)</xref>. There is no sense that a field is ever complete or that habitus is ever fully “developed,” or that capitals are defined and unchanging. The strength of Bourdieu’s terms, and their importance for policy is that they allow power to be theorized and accounted for empirically through the dialectical conceptual triad of habitus, field, and capitals. The positions that the field, the habitus, and the capitals make available are held in place by these power relations. And these power relations define the forms and relative values of the capitals that the field–habitus relation produces. Different policy contexts have different social logics of practice, which are logics derived through power and the ways in which power is made material in the capital in its forms and distributed volumes (possessed unequally by various social agents).</p>
<p>Differing logics of practice inhere in different policy sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904810397338">Lingard, Hayes, Mills, &amp; Christie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904810397338">Lingard, Rawolle, &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904810397338">Taylor &amp; Singh, 2005</xref>). This means that policy which is “made” in one place and time will have an interest in the policy-making processes of that particular place with variable insights about the ways in which the people who will put the policy into practice actually carry out their work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904810397338">Lingard et al. (2003)</xref> suggest that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . following Bourdieu, that education policy producers within the state and educational practitioners in schools are located in different subfields within education and are positioned in relation to overlapping fields such as the political one, in different ways, then the almost inevitable morphing of policy intentions to mutant policy practices in schools is understandable. (p. 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Certain fields then have a logic which is specific and “in” them. Two issues arise. The first is that fields, even though they have different boundaries, are intertwined and overlap (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904810397338">Lingard &amp; Rawolle, 2004</xref> regarding cross field effects and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904810397338">Lingard et al., 2003</xref> on interplay of fields). This means that there will always be logics, which may be specific to a field, but which will have logics from other fields informing that logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904810397338">Lingard et al., 2003</xref> note the embeddedness of the fields of power and gender and the economy to the field of education). Second, that in the relation between habitus and field and capital, practice and its logics are implicated in multiple and intricate ways. Practice can play a role in different policy sites through the theoretical prisms afforded by field, capital, and habitus. And yet habitus, capital, and field when understood relationally <italic>are</italic> practice. So practice is the elements combined and also the logic of practice is in the field(s). The ways in which the relations between each of the theoretical elements can be understood to work together to <italic>be</italic> practice and the logic of this practice is both part of the interplay between fields and the interplay between the habitus, the fields and the capitals and the strategies of agents, which are recognized within the field and therefore crucially, as suggested above, the way power is able to both accrue and is distributed among these agents.</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s conceptual resources when applied to the distinctive social logics of education policy produce certain gains. These are that the conterminous nature of scales (i.e., the local/global) can be accounted for through the notion of fields. So, for example, how do transnational organizations such as the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) impact on policy production through the range of responses that are available for politicians and bureaucrats in different nations with varying amounts on “national capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904810397338">Bourdieu, 2003</xref>). How do they affect on what teachers do; how might transnational policy ideas be inflected locally? Power then is expressed through national capital dis/enabled responses in a globalizing education policy field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904810397338">Lingard, 2009</xref>). Second, that habitus puts people into the analysis but not on the basis of their individual actions, rather through these actions socially derived bases. This allows an account of the homologous relation with similarly inculcated social agents. Importantly, rationality is denied as a freewheeling conceptual category tied to individual people, but still allows the regularities of practices and the rationality specific to them to be considered. So, for example, how might teachers’ dispositions affect the ways in which policy is enacted locally and how are these “dispositionary” responses similar in different contexts of enactment? How does policy invoke certain teacher dispositions? Third, capitals signify what is valued, their contents (i.e., the type of value, for example, money, prestige, etc.) and respective actual values of these contents (e.g., how valuable money is to teachers as opposed to policy makers) in specific contexts. So taken together the possibility of accounting for different policy logics using these concepts is not bound to a place, or to particular individuals, but to social logics across places and individuals, but still with a degree of specificity which may account for the distinctiveness of what happens in policy sites such as governments, the media, and education institutions.</p>
<p>The next section of the article reviews other recent approaches to practice research which may produce other and complementary gains for education policy analysis.</p>

<title>Distinctive Logics: Other Practice Concepts</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0895904810397338">Warde (2004)</xref> argues that Bourdieu’s theory of practice is neglected in his later work, especially (post <italic>Outline of a Theory of Practice</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904810397338">1977</xref>] and <italic>The Logic of Practice</italic> [1990a]), in favor of the fuller development of the theory of field, capital, and habitus (although the alternative view is that these conceptions <italic>are</italic> the constituents of practice) and suggests ways of “recuperating” practice as a theoretically useful idea. He suggests that Bourdieu does not take into account or, at best, alternates between two different ways of thinking about practice, which are identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904810397338">Reckwitz (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Practice (Praxis) in the singular represents merely an emphatic term to describe the whole of human action (in contrast to “theory” and mere thinking). “Practices” in the sense of the theory of social practices, however, is something else. A “practice” (Praktik) is a routinized type of behavior which consists of several elements, interconnected to one another: forms of bodily activities, forms of mental activities, “things” and their use, a background knowledge in the form of understanding, know-how, states of emotion and motivational knowledge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904810397338">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>, p. 249)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this view of practice (i.e., Praktik) locates the potential analysis and understanding of practice with the person (henceforth social agent), it is nonetheless useful for its focus on bodily activity and interconnectedness of elements (there are links here to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904810397338">Chouliaraki &amp; Fairclough, 1999</xref> that will be taken up later).</p>
<p>Bourdieu argued for and developed specific uses of language (e.g., field, habitus, capital) to overcome the exclusive focus on either the social agent or the structural conditions of practice of previous sociological theory and research. That is, his approach is proffered as an alternative to the structure agency dualism. Bourdieu based his theoretical conceptions on empirical work. Derived from empirical research concerned with practice in organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0895904810397338">Nicolini, Gherardi, and Yanow (2003</xref>, p. 8) likewise suggest that “[P]ractice is both our production of the world and the result of this process. It is always the product of specific historical conditions resulting from previous practice and transformed into present practice.” The transformational (and temporal) aspect of practice becomes the focus, but linked to conditions which are steeped in the ongoing relations of production and power which they are constituted by and constitute.</p>
<p>Transformation can be captured in “practice” as always “becoming” (to different extents depending on the practice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904810397338">Bjørkeng, Clegg, &amp; Pitsis, 2009</xref>). It is never in a state of completion and is neither directly comprehensible through observation (an implication for the research methods here), nor static. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904810397338">Bjørkeng et al. (2009)</xref> conducted a 5-year empirical study and suggest that practice theories have general characteristics in common as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0895904810397338" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Practices are “embodied arrays of activities” based on shared understanding and competence.</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Bjørkeng et al. in the presentation of findings of the study of practice as “becoming” suggest that to conceptualize practice in terms of its <italic>unfolding</italic> three features need to be identified. These are “authoring boundaries” (“processes by which activities are constructed as legitimate part of practicing (or not)” [p. 149]), “negotiating competencies” (“processes by which practising, and practitioners, are constructed as competent”; p. 149) and “adapting materiality” (“the processes by which material configurations are enacted and entangled in practising and constructed as essential elements of (a) practice”; p. 149). These are important findings as one of the issues identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0895904810397338">Warde (2005</xref>) is that the formation of new practices and the relationships between practices are not well documented or understood.</p>
<p>Working within the same field as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0895904810397338">Warde (2005</xref>; studies of consumption), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904810397338">McMeekin and Southerton (2007)</xref>, researching innovation in consumption, make some key points about practice which are consonant with and add to Bjørkeng et al’s findings. These are as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0895904810397338" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Macro socioeconomic shifts affect the material and temporal ordering of practices (e.g., 24-hr society, banking online),</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>The key elements of practice are materiality, emotion and meaning, routines, know-how, taste, and competence.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With respect to elements of practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0895904810397338">Schatzki (1996)</xref>, proposed two ways to think about practices. These are first “dispersed” (e.g., describing, explaining, etc.), which are based on understandings, evidenced in the ability to carry out acts, ability to identify and attribute, prompt or respond, to a particular saying/doing, for example, explaining. Dispersed practices are found in many different places in social life and are often included in another type of practice, which Schatzki calls “integrative.” These “integrative” practices, which generally include such understandings as found in dispersed ones, also have teleoaffective structures (which guide for example, ends and purposes) and explicit rules. To take teaching practice as example, explicit rules about how to teach are located in the rules of the school (perhaps via a code of conduct) and what to teach (via a curriculum document), and the theoretical models (taught in preservice teacher education courses), which induce rules of pedagogy, assessment, and so on. Teachers will work toward certain ends and have purposes in mind (education perhaps, although in Australia more recently to focus on passing a test) and there will be a set of understandings based on previous learnings and accumulated knowledge about how to teach. Although power does not feature strongly in Schatzki’s conceptualizations, his work can be applied to changes in practices over time (e.g., the insipient deprofessionalization of teachers in Australia via changes to assessment and curriculum policy) based on descriptive and then comparative accounts of practices across places and times.</p>
<p>To summarize the argument thus far, an approach to policy practice based on habitus, field, and capital (Bourdieu) allows a focus away from the binary of actor/structure and can account for relations of power and the ways which it plays out distinctively in different policy contexts. Importantly, it is suggested here, that the relations between the dispositions, which can account for “‘unconscious’ rather than strategic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904810397338">Lingard et al., 2005</xref>, p. 764) actions of policy agents, the capitals derived and recognized through the logics of practice and the interacting fields in each policy context are researched together. Findings from organization studies especially Bjørkeng et al’s conception of practice as always “becoming,” especially constituting competence, shifting boundaries, and adapting materiality help to introduce ways to account for movement in terms of practice and bring into focus other aspects of practice for analysis. Material and temporal orderings are important as ways in which to characterize possible changes to and the elements of practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904810397338">McMeekin &amp; Southerton, 2007</xref>). Likewise change may be accounted for through the notions of dispersed and integrative practices.</p>
<p>These ideas of change and movement and becomingness are not ethereally above or removed from interests of power; the how and why of “becomingness,” movement and change occur within relations of power. These may be viewed pace Bourdieu as conditioned by the positions available in fields, the capitals of value and their valuations and people with socially derived dispositions, who are all implicated in the ongoing production of practice. And following Bjørkeng et al., how policy practice in government and bureaucracy and in education institutions is both transformative and is transformed may be viewed through researching the ways in which competence is constructed and assessed, what materialities are adapted to the practice, and what activities are constructed as “in” and “out”? For example, given a particular policy frame, What knowledge does a policy maker need? How is this knowledge used in policy and how is it assessed? What knowledge does a teacher need? How is this assessed? Where does the power to make these knowledge forms mandated and assessable lie (and in whose interests)? How do policies change the materialities of education? Who has access to what forms of education and on what conditions, for example? And how do the materialities of particular political and bureaucratic settings change policy production possibilities (given for example, the strict temporalities of the political cycle)? What is it that policy producers “can” do? What activities are doable (what is thinkable, what not?). What is it that educators must do, or have a choice over, given a particular set of policy demands? Responses in different contexts of policy make explicit the power relations constraining, affording, and constituting practice.</p>
<p>Practices though are in a dialectal relation with other practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904810397338">Chouliaraki &amp; Fairclough, 1999</xref>). For example, thinking about the relationships between practices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0895904810397338">Warde (2005</xref>) suggests that a practice approach to research might address questions around the prevalence of certain practices in any given context and any combinations which are typical. What level of commitment people have to different practices, how they develop (both internally and in view of external constraints) and how different practices affect one another, especially as understandings and knowledge cross boundaries are all important. Boundaries between the places and times of policy production and enactment are important and these are in part mediated through the varying degrees of commitment to and understandings of distinctive policy practices which policy agents may have. What crosses boundaries, and how, is the focus of the next section of the article.</p>

<title>Practice: Production and Transmission</title>
<p>The trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904810397338">Lingard &amp; Garrick, 1997</xref>) that policy makes from the contexts of influence and text production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904810397338">Bowe et al., 1992</xref>) to contexts of enactment is not linear or unidirectional. It is subject to contestation and the different logics which pertain in the various fields through which it passes. In this section of the article a theoretical perspective on policy production and transmission is proposed which may provide ways to think about the production and movement in and of policy across the cycle.</p>
<p>Practice involves both saying (and writing) and doing; both produce meaning. Meaning is established through and in practice and is subject to the power relations of practice in its production. Resources which may be used for analyzing meaning elements of practice could apply either a multimodal or textual orientation (discourses, genres [ways of acting and interacting], and styles [ways of being; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904810397338">Fairclough, 2003]</xref>) or both. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904810397338">Fairclough (2003)</xref> has extensively and usefully proved a solid basis for textual analysis. A multimodal point of view may be particularly relevant to policy study now, as increasingly policies are promulgated via video (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904810397338">Koh, 2009</xref> for work on video policy), websites, and glossy brochure-like documents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904810397338">Kress and van Leeuwen (2001)</xref> argue for a conception of multimodality that encompasses content (discourses and design) and expression (production and distribution). Discourses are “socially constructed knowledges of (some aspect of) reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904810397338">Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2001</xref>, p. 4); design involves uses of semiotic resources to make discourses realizable; production is the actual bringing together of the (selected) discourses and design into a form which may be interpreted; and distribution concerns the replication and dissemination of the production.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904810397338">Kress and van Leeuwen (2001)</xref> argue that these are four strata of communication that articulate a meaning, which may in turn be interpreted through the four strata. So, for example, when a person speaks, the listener brings a set of discourse, design, production, and distribution elements to the interpretation so that communication is both articulation and interpretation. They argue also that each of the four strata adds meaning both in articulation and interpretation. Production therefore is one of the strata of a theoretical conception of both the articulation and interpretation of meaning. And this meaning is produced in practice. Therefore the historical sum of the conditions of possibility allows for the production of an artifact that has a meaning potential (not a read-off-able meaning). This artifact (e.g., a public policy document, or policy speech, or policy directive, or informal negotiation between a policy public servant and an education “provider”) is positioned in relation both to the conditions and embodiment of its production but also to the conditions and embodiment of its interpretation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904810397338">Bourdieu (1999)</xref> notes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he fact that texts circulate without their context . . . they don’t bring with them the field of production . . . the fact that recipients . . . re-interpret the texts . . . generate some formidable misunderstandings and that can have good or bad consequences. (p. 221)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How policy means is never a function of its production alone, it is always in the constant nexus of a new production through interpretation in practice. And to refer back to the dialectical relational approach to social practice proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904810397338">Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999)</xref>, the meaning aspect of practice is in a constant and coconstitutive relation with the people who produce it (with their beliefs, values, social relations), and the materiality of the production (with respect to policy for example, the extent of the resources invested in the policy, the ways the policy confines relations between teachers and students in terms of resources and space and class size—teacher ratio, for example).</p>
<p>So meaning is produced in practice and partly constitutes practice. However, policy moves from place to place, from person to person, and from organization to organization through time, through different logics of practice. Some ideas in this movement disappear altogether, some may reappear in a different space and/or time (e.g., as shown in travelling or vernacular global policy) and some of them adhere through time. “Adhere” here, means to remain current and in use as “dominant” ideas. For example, in Vocational Education and Training (VET) Institutions in Australia “quality” is “managed” via a system of audits through the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF). In the case of the AQTF, ideas about the management of quality are informed by accounting and quality assurance principles. These are then recontextualized within the field of VET through the AQTF.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904810397338">Debray (2000)</xref> developed the notion of transmission to account for the ways in which ideas are carried through time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0895904810397338">1</xref></sup> Two ways which Debray proposes for thinking about the materiality of this transmission of ideas are provided through the concepts of organized materiality (OM) and materialized organization (MO). With respect to education, for example, textbooks may be seen as OM and institutions as MO. So in textbooks, knowledge is organized through a technology (the book as a printed object) that allows for its possible transmission in pedagogical places, and times. Institutions however, as materialized organizations are structured in ways that are the result of ideas about education and its place in society. VET institutions, for example, were created in Australia to “train” apprentices to contribute to national skills development. As MO, they provided an important function to society and will continue to, as long as the productive cost is within the ambit that the “society” is willing to pay. Equally, text books provide a way of delimiting knowledge and pedagogising it so that “dominant” forms of knowledge are reproducible through time. This suits those with the power and influence to “produce” and delimit what counts as knowledge in a particular discipline at a particular time, and who also are able to control the means of that “production.” The organized materiality of policy has the potential to reorder the materialized organization of education institutions. This is perhaps best exemplified in the textbook and testing controlled character of U.S. primary schooling.</p>
<p>As part of the movement across the policy cycle, policy ideas may be “resemiotised” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904810397338">Iedema, 2003</xref>) between contexts and within the distinct logics of practice in different policy settings. Resemiotization involves the changing meaning potential that is derived through time and changing conditions of materiality and production. The concepts of transmission and resemiotization offer tools to analyze and think about ideas in policy as they are rearticulated through time and space, but do not assume a temporal or spatial linearity. There is no lock step “production,” but one which incorporates dispersed geneses and scattered products. Transmission offers a way to approach the adherence of some ideas and the loss of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904810397338">Lemke, 2000</xref>), as meaning potential is remade through time and space (resemiotization) and may account for the “manufacture of consent” through “investment” in the materiality of the meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904810397338">Iedema, 2003</xref>), or work in the opposite direction in contexts of professional logics where policy is “unmade.” An analysis then is possible of the links of effects that different logics of practice may have on transmission as the policy moves between policy sites, making visible the adherence of policy ideas through the power relations in them.</p>
<p>The point, with respect to education policy studies, is that policy problems and solutions form from disparate idea sources and from their site(s) of production are mediated in the transmission to their sites of enactment (these sites may or may not be the ones or constituted in the particular ways), which the policy problem/solution nexus foresaw. In the processes of transmission, the ideas in the policy nexus are differentially taken up in different places and times. Although the concepts of organized materiality and materialized organization can be used to characterize these policy processes and their effects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904810397338">Debray (2000)</xref> also suggests that the “armature” required for transmission is greater when ideas are less mainstream (dominant), therefore the resource investment in transmission is greater when ideas are emergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0895904810397338">Williams, 1977</xref>), if they are to be transmitted. And as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904810397338">Miller (2005</xref>, p. 20) argues “[P]eople in institutions such as bureaucracy appear mostly as the product of the sheer density and authority constituted by institutionalised materiality” so that “it is at this institutional level that the general point becomes remarkably clear: that power is, among other things, a property of materiality.” Power, it is argued here then, is materialized in organizations through the organization of materiality, in practice, in and across distinct policy sites.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is suggested here that policy can usefully be conceptualized and analyzed in terms of practice. Power and its relations in policy can be made explicit. A practice approach can also make use of diverse intellectual resources which all work to capture elements of the interstitiality and fluidity of social life. The relations in and between policy derivation and enactment, can be thought of in terms of the distinct logics of different contexts and the movement of policy ideas through transmission and resemiotization. A dialectical relational approach to the distinct logics offers a way to think about policy practice in its complexity and its economizing of power. Analysis of the complexity of these logics is made through complementary theoretical concepts which share as a commonality an interest in “practice.” Each of them denies any primacy to either individual accounts of policy practice or totalizing conceptions of power or social order made through analysis of policy. Rather, the intent is to work with individual policy makers and enactors and the artifacts which they produce and work to consider the logics of their practice and their use in, and in making, their particularly policy contexts. This does not deny the usefulness of research that focuses on different aspects of practice individually (e.g., a focus on semiosis or habitus or field), and methodologically this may be necessary, but the argument here is that a practice orientation can broaden the focus on the power relations which make up practice. These may then tell us something about the material effects on teachers and students made through the economies of power in policy.</p>
<p>Questions remain about the ways in which to approach the production of research methods and data using the practice approach outlined here. However, a theorization of research as practice using the same resources may provide a way to orient the approach. Also, the combination of Chouliaraki and Fairclough’s dialectical relational account of social practice, and Kress and van Leeuwen’s approach to thinking about meaning potential in practice, offer powerful tools for analysis of semiotic artifacts (and the other related and coconstituted elements of practice), which should include accounts of policy agents, policy documents, and other documents related to policy (e.g., curriculum documents, school polices, etc.).</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s ideas have been used in a quite defined and defining way; suggesting especially that habitus, fields, and capitals are used together for conceptual/analytical gain. Notions of the game, illusio, and strategy may add further to analysis. The main point here, however, is to try to maintain the relational aspects of his three main thinking tools to provide a powerful resource for thinking about policy and its power economies in practice in specific contexts. Power may easily be overlooked in policy analysis and yet remains the key to understandings its disparate effects, with outcomes for teachers, and students that are not benign.</p>
<p>The disjunction between what people in government and bureaucracy do and what people in education institutions do in relation to policy, and why, motivates the argument here. Policy, whatever its purpose and outcomes, takes a mix of ideas and moves them. The production of the ideas into materiality through action and words, at each stage of the policy cycle is made through practice within entangled and immutable power relations. Importantly practice is “open” in that there may be opportunities for change and transformation—possible worlds are always created in practice. The task is to look for and enumerate the elements of practices and “their incompleteness, their contradictoriness, their gaps, i.e., the properties which keep systems open and make them amenable to transformative action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904810397338">Chouliaraki &amp; Fairclough, 1999</xref>, p. 65).</p>

<p>Debray is interested in much broader cultural transmission, especially across millennia, but the concepts are nonetheless useful here for orienting thinking about the ways materiality is part of the adherence (or not) of ideas in policy through time.</p>
