<abstract>
<p>The primary purpose of this article is to combine both transfer of learning (hereafter, transfer) and creativity into similar processes that can increase the products of transfer and creativity. Both transfer and creativity operate within reciprocal relationships between memory storage and working memory. Moreover, they are also based on moving from System 1 processing (rapid, associative, automatic) to System 2 processing (slow and controlled) by several sequential series of circular stages: (1) acquisition and storage of the learning to be transferred and created; (2) identifying a problem/goal after a time interval; (3) active and controlled search in the memory storage for a solution, weighing alternative solutions, deciding what is the correct and most efficient solution and executing that chosen alternative; and (4) evaluating the process while deriving feedback and drawing conclusions for the next round of the above stages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transfer and creativity are two trees far apart in the vast forest of scientific literature. Even <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429412440647">Hennessey and Amabile (2010</xref>), in an extensive updated review on creativity, do not mention the word ‘transfer’. The notion of transfer, which is affected by multilevel variables, has been highly controversial, both conceptually and empirically. In general, transfer is productive, and supports the use of acquired knowledge, skills, and motivations in new contexts and learning tasks. Such a definition of ‘transfer’ is so broad that it encompasses most realms of psychology. Thus, for example, transfer can include two opposites such as (a) transfer from operating Word 2003 software to operating Word 2007 software or (b) transfer of a corporate president’s decision-making processes from machines to interpersonal relations. The definition’s breadth leaves transfer confused with similar concepts, such as generalization, induction, concept formation and application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429412440647">Howard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429412440647">Kaniel, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Creativity, like transfer, is also difficult to define because it is such a complex phenomenon, with different forms of expression and with many potential influences. There have been several attempts to conceptualize creativity on a broad scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429412440647">Hennessey and Amabile, 2010</xref>). Because the methods and aims are so disparate, it is difficult to agree on a common theoretical language to address the phenomenon of creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429412440647">Runco, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0261429412440647">
<title>Scope of this article</title>
<p>Separately, each domain (transfer or creativity) is very complex and by combining them we multiply the complexity. Owing to such complexity we need to focus the article by setting some limits as follows.</p>
<sec id="section3-0261429412440647">
<title>Focusing on prescriptive rather than descriptive processes of everyday problems</title>
<p>The present article is based on a prescriptive rather than descriptive approach. A descriptive approach describes how subjects actually proceed when solving problems using transfer or creativity. Usually most of the theories on transfer and creativity focus on such descriptive processes. Unlike the descriptive approach, a prescriptive approach delineates what to do when a problem has to be solved by describing those steps that will optimize problem solving of the type in question. This article will relate only to such prescriptive processes for everyday problems.</p>
<p>I will also not discuss eminent creativity or unusual talent (also called ‘Big C’), reserved for the great creators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429412440647">Simonton, 2006</xref>), but rather the everyday creativity that might be possessed by many people such as ‘little creativity, mini-creativity and professional expertise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429412440647">Kaufman and Beghetto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261429412440647">Simonton, 2003</xref>) and the extent to which the transfer and creative processes can be reliably guided by the individual.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261429412440647">
<title>Focusing on processes</title>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the complexity of transfer and creativity, researchers have made various attempts to categorize and organize the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429412440647">Burke and Hutchins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429412440647">Rittle-Johnson, 2006</xref>). Within the domain of creativity, the most common categorization is the four P elements (product, person, place [press or environment] and process). Of the four elements, process seems the most central for the purposes of comparison and connection between transfer and creativity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261429412440647">
<title>Prescriptive processes of transfer and creativity</title>
<p>The processes of transfer and creativity can be understood by reciprocal mechanisms between memory storage and working memory. Both have strong scientific bases and there are enough data from which to deduce important applications to everyday life in general and to the process of transfer and creativity in particular.</p>
<p>Based on our understanding of memory storage and working memory, we can proceed to understand the processes similar to transfer and creativity. There are several well-known concepts that distinguish between different processing styles, such as automatic vs. controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261429412440647">Sherman et al., 2008</xref>); impulsive vs. reflexive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429412440647">Hinson et al., 2003</xref>); and heuristic vs. analytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261429412440647">Shah and Oppenheimer, 2008</xref>). The ‘System 1 vs. System 2’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429412440647">Kahneman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0261429412440647">Zacks et al., 2007</xref>) was chosen because it is wide enough to encompass many subconcepts and supports our macro view. The main assumption is that the optimal processes for creativity and transfer are a combination of different styles of processing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429412440647">
<title>System 1 and System 2 processing</title>
<p>System 1 and System 2 processing are two extreme poles containing several dimensions. People who use System 1 are inclined to use dysfunctional self-regulatory processes. These are rapid, associative, occur automatically with almost no mental effort and usually governed by habit, and therefore are difficult to control or modify. Judgments arrived at through System 1 processing hardly rely on reasoning or computational analyses, and little or no attention is paid to formal rules of inference or decision-making. System 1 can also be powerful and accurate as are skills that are acquired by prolonged practice. Although it is a rapid process, sometimes it is close to the optimal solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429412440647">Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2002</xref>). In System 1, decisions are made by shortcuts and simple generalizations that a person believes are the correct decisions because these heuristics have been efficient in previous experiences. They feel intuitively correct, but the basis for this feeling is often difficult to articulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261429412440647">Simmons and Nelson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, System 2 requires efficient controlled self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261429412440647">McCullough and Brian, 2009</xref>) for various parameters: setting goals, planning and using effective strategies, managing time, organizing work, self-monitoring, evaluating strategy use (organizing and remembering information, etc.), overcoming distractions and seeking help in planning alternative pathways to success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261429412440647">Schmeichel and Baumeister, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429412440647">Shell and Husman, 2008</xref>). Such control processes are slower, sequential, require effort, more likely to be consciously monitored and potentially rule-governed. In System 2 processing, people need to efficiently use the memory (retrieval) and working memory systems, especially the ‘central executive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440647">Baddeley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>System 1 processes can operate with little or no intervention by System 2 and often serve as the default. System 2 processes may or may not intervene in order to revise, inhibit or replace this default. When System 2 processing does takes place, the influence of System 1 will decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429412440647">Kahneman, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429412440647">
<title>Transfer and creativity: System 1 processing</title>
<p>System 1 is the most frequent process in transfer and creativity. In transfer it is the low-road transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261429412440647">Salomon and Perkins, 1989</xref>) that occurs when a skill that has been practised to the point of automaticity in one context is spontaneously elicited by a new context. In creativity it is making automatic uncontrolled remote associations between separate ideas. Such associations are generated by trial-and-error processes without immediate control over the outcome. System 1 processing is based on working memory activities that are automatically performed and retrieved from memory because they are very familiar well-learned mental sets. As such, these processes are rapid, automatic, associative and sometimes efficient. In regard to memory storage, transfer, like creativity, is based on using a flat hierarchy of associations as compared with the steep hierarchy of associations of those with low transfer and creativity. A flat associative hierarchy means that for any given stimulus, the person has many associations available, all with roughly equal probabilities of retrieval. As such, flat associative hierarchies are necessarily more susceptible to relatively minor priming effects, and unexpected input of either external or internal stimuli can easily change the relative probabilities of the associations making up the hierarchy. On the other hand, persons who are very low in creativity, and apparently in transfer, have steep associative hierarchies in which any given stimulus elicits few responses in a highly predictable fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261429412440647">Simonton, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429412440647">
<title>Intuition and insight belong to System 1</title>
<p>In addition to differences in the structure of the associations, System 1 is characterized by intuition and insight. Analysis of the literature on intuition and insight leads to the conclusion that both concepts are highly overlapping. Intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. A common denominator of intuitive phenomena is a feeling of knowing and ‘knowing without knowing why’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429412440647">Raidl and Lubart, 2000</xref>–2001). Some relate to intuition as mental shortcuts; heuristics that are highly susceptible to irrational biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429412440647">Kahneman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261429412440647">Pretz and Totz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Insight is characterized as a sudden, unpredictable and non-verbalizable solution discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429412440647">Metcalfe and Weibe, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261429412440647">Sio and Thomas, 2009</xref>). The essence of both intuition and insight is that they are reached on partial information, with little apparent effort, and typically without conscious awareness. As such, they belong to System 1 processing, where decisions are made by shortcuts and simple generalizations (heuristics) that are felt to be intuitively correct but hard to explain.</p>
<p>The main possible difference between intuition and insight is that insight is sudden whereas intuition is incremental. Based on self-reports, insight always occurs suddenly, without warning. This is referred to as the ‘Aha!’ experience, and is taken by some authors to be the defining feature of insight. Whilst intuition may also occur suddenly, it appears most often in a progressive manner. Furthermore, there is a preparatory stage preceding intuition that makes it more likely that intuition will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429412440647">Bowden and Jung-Beeman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429412440647">Metcalfe and Wiebe, 1987</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0261429412440647">
<title>Transfer and creativity: System 2 processing</title>
<p>However successful are associative linkages (intuition or insight), they are quite rare and we need System 2 to increase the probability for efficient processes of transfer and creativity. It is suggested that System 2 processes consist of a sequential series of circular stages: (1) acquisition and storage of the item to be transferred or used for creative products; (2) identifying a problem/task/goal; (3) active and controlled search in memory storage for a solution and checking alternative solutions, and deciding which would be the correct and most efficient solution and performing the chosen alternative; (4) evaluating the process and deriving feedback and conclusions for the next circle of the above stages. Here we will discuss the stages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261429412440647">
<title>Stage 1 within System 2: acquisition of the knowledge to be transferred or to be creative</title>
<p>The first stage of increasing transfer and creativity is the acquisition of relevant knowledge. Acquisition means storing, clustering or encoding what was learned in memory storage. Retrieval is the ‘twin brother’ of acquisition because the only way to know if something was acquired is by retrieving it from memory storage. Many principles are related to acquisition for retrieval accuracy (Koriat et al., 2000 ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429412440647">Roediger and Gallo, 2001</xref>). For our purposes, we will focus on three main principles: (a) schemata similarities; (b) schemata distinctiveness (novelty, isolation); and (c) schemata organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261429412440647">Polyn et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>(a) Similarities among schemata depend on having and using knowledge of shared features or categories among items that will guide appropriate retrieval (Thorndike’s notion of common elements). Several types of similarities between acquired and retrieval needs (target problems) have been identified, including attributional versus conceptual, surface versus deep or structural, object versus relational and procedural versus structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429412440647">Catrambone, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>(b) Distinctiveness relates to difference within the context of similarity, namely processing of differences among elements that are similar in some dimension. Distinctive processing involves item-specific processing of the properties that uniquely specify a particular item within a category and distinguish it from otherwise similar or related items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429412440647">Hunt and Worthen, 2006</xref>). Distinctiveness (isolation) states that a shift in context can isolate a set of items from those studied prior to the acquired event. This causes the isolated items to cluster together in a distinctive schema. Because it was acquired distinctively, it may have increased retrievability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429412440647">Bunting, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>(c) Using similarities and distinctiveness can produce organizational processing of higher-order dimensions (clusters and templates, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429412440647">Gobet, 2005</xref>). Organization can be described by levels which may run from the simplest classification of grouping to highly complex logical hierarchical structures. The organized schemata simplify access (retrieval) to individual informational units. These organizations are among the memory skills that allow experts to increase, improve and expand the functioning of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429412440647">Ericsson and Kintsch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0261429412440647">Zacks et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The time gap between acquisition and when the acquired information is needed and retrieved to reach the goal is crucial for transfer and creativity. The memory traces of the items to be recalled suffer from time-related decay as soon as attention is switched away from maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440647">Baddeley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261429412440647">Nairne, 2002</xref>). Within this time gap, several processes might affect the acquired and stored schemata that might reduce their potential to be retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429412440647">Lansdale and Baguley, 2008</xref>). Retrieval demands presented close to the acquisition phase are likely to share more similar contextual elements with those present at the moment of acquisition than retrieval demands presented further away from the acquisition. When there is a lengthy interval between acquisition and the need for transfer or creativity, the original task becomes part of the rich reservoir of schemata in memory storage. In this situation, retrieval difficulties will arise because the learner may be unable to find the specific original task containing the similar/common elements needed for solving the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429412440647">Cowan et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261429412440647">
<title>Stage 2 within System 2: goal/task/problem identification defining the goal in transfer and creativity terms</title>
<p>Only if System 1 (automatic association) did not help to solve the problem, should System 2 processing come into play. The probability to reach transfer and creative products will increase when controlled self-regulation processing is in use – such as goal-directed self-reflection regarding processing attempts and effort, etc. As in creativity, transfer also starts with the decision to be creative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0261429412440647">Sternberg, 2005</xref>) or to be transferred by defining the goal: ‘I need to solve the problem using the process of transfer or creativity’. Whatever the kind of goal or problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429412440647">Perkins, 2000</xref>), it consists of a set of steps, or transformations, from one state to another. When these steps are executed in the correct sequence, they result in a solution path from the initial state to the goal state via a series of intermediate states and subgoals.</p>
<p>Creativity and transfer are associated with goals or problems in which one or more of the components of the problem space are ‘ill defined’, namely multiple possible competing goals and solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429412440647">Mumford et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the initial state may be poorly specified, the operators may be multiple and diverse, the constraints may be vague and unstable, and the goal states may be ambiguous – or any combination of these possibilities. In general, the more ill defined the problem space, the greater the need to use transfer and creativity through System 2 processes. Efficient processes of transfer and creativity must be a decision over which one has substantial control and self-regulation. The main idea here is that the solver must define the goal in transfer and creative terms. Several studies have found that when individuals know that creativity is important they are more likely to actually be creative (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261429412440647">Shalley et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Once the problem has been defined in terms of transfer or creativity it will influence motivation through the impact on self-regulatory mechanisms. Goals regulate action directly by affecting what people pay attention to, how hard they work and how long they persist with a task. In addition, goals affect action indirectly by motivating people to discover and use task strategies that will facilitate goal achievement. Finally, goals are more likely to be attained when people are strongly committed to their goals and are given feedback concerning their progress in relation to their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261429412440647">Shalley et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261429412440647">
<title>Stage 3 within System 2: active retrieval from memory storage, choosing the best alternative to reach the goal</title>
<p>The hallmark of both transfer and creativity may be how widely and efficiently memory storage is searched. The solver must start by generating relevant information, synthesizing that information and selecting from among that information. The goal of solving the problem must be enhanced into the goal of retrieval in transfer and creativity terms. For example, ‘I am searching in my memory storage to find a solution to my students’ problems in reading comprehension by using transfer and creative principles’. It is like searching memory storage with a spotlight illuminating a very narrow beam of schemata while trying to find relevant ones in a huge ‘warehouse’ that is usually not organized for efficient retrieval. The intensity with which each item is illuminated directly influences its likelihood of being recalled.</p>
<p>Retrieval will be facilitated if the retrieval cue used for recall matches the specific attributes emphasized during acquisition (encoding).</p>
<p>Such matching can be enhanced by organizing the memory storage in schemata maps according to the principles of cognitive or concept maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429412440647">O’Donnell et al., 2002</xref>). Such maps provide a high degree of structure and can facilitate navigation in the memory storage for improving retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429412440647">Amadieu et al., 2009</xref>). By making their own memory maps, people organize the content they wish to acquire and set the relationship between various parts of the overall content. This in itself can lead to clearer communication of goals and subsequently to improved retrieval.</p>
<p>Once a goal/problem has been identified, a series of operations begins within working memory, with the aim of solving the difficulty through transfer and creativity. To perform the process successfully, the ‘central executive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429412440647">Baddeley, 2007</xref>) controls goal aspiration by maintenance, processing, retrieval and suppression (attention processes). More specifically, the ‘central executive’ influences access to required information, inhibits interfering information, sequences symbolic-level operations and resolves many types of conflict while simultaneously grounding operations in a current, dynamic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429412440647">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Active searching for relevant schemata to reach the goal places a considerable load on working memory. The heavy demands placed on working memory make the transfer and creativity processes error prone, and limit the memory space available for other useful activities, such as performing a qualitative analysis of the problem to decide what principles/concepts may be applicable and the best procedures for applying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0261429412440647">Sweller, 2006</xref>). Abstraction (‘high-road transfer’) reduces the burden on working memory and allows efficient retrieval and increases the range of applicability (generalization). That is because an abstract concept is worth thousands of pictures and it takes fewer ‘bytes’ of working memory than an analogy or prototype image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0261429412440647">Sloutsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0261429412440647">Sweller, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0261429412440647">
<title>Deciding among alternatives – the problem of censorship</title>
<p>After an active successful search for a solution, one or more alternatives might be retrieved. For each option, people should anticipate potential difficulties and then examine its feasibility and applicability. Based on a comparison between the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, the best solution is selected. One should avoid situations in which people select an alternative in advance and then justify it by artificially enhancing the chosen plan and reducing the attractiveness of the others. Choosing the right alternative, people will solve the problem by transferring a principle or a strategy to the domain of the problem from another domain. This stage involves the practical implementation of the chosen alternative, which can be enhanced by visualizing the solution and examining its feasibility and applicability. Such examinations will reduce the probability of choosing an inappropriate solution (negative transfer or inefficient product of creativity).</p>
<p>Solvers must be aware of self-censorship, which is a conscious choice to withhold ideas or the preconscious inhibition of one’s performance. Both transfer and creativity are enhanced in an environment perceived to be comfortable and psychologically unthreatening so that the person can relax internal and external barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261429412440647">Williams, 2002</xref>). One of the main reasons often given for self-censorship is that people may fear that their ideas will not be favourably evaluated. As such, the self-esteem motive is the primary cause of self-censorship. People whose self-esteem would be hurt by criticism of their creative ideas tend to repress them, intentionally or unintentionally. When an individual judges his ideas to be unfeasible, ineffective or strange, he may consciously choose to withhold them. On the other hand, when judgment is suspended, people are more inclined to share the unconventional ideas that come to mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261429412440647">Williams, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Several principles can be used to reduce self-censorship: (1) preparing individuals for negative feedback on their novel ideas by making predictions about its antecedents (e.g. expected criticism) and consequences (e.g. fewer suggestions), and drawing conclusions about self-censorship by inference; (2) self-censorship can be reduced by eliminating the particular types of feedback that are most likely to cause defensiveness and introducing constructive, informational feedback. Feedback on new ideas that is informational rather than evaluative contributes to a favourable environment for on-the-job creative problem solving; (3) self-instructional training that teaches ‘self-talk’ and how to refute counterproductive types of self-talk. Such self-reports may be able to tap self-censorship at the conscious level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261429412440647">Williams, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Stage 4 within System 2: feedback on process and solution: drawing conclusions for the next stage</title>
<p>The processes of transfer and creativity are circular, so that once the chosen alternative has been implemented, one is obliged to prepare for the next goal by means of a systematic and orderly process of feedback and constructive conclusions. Effective and complete feedback provides the answers to three questions: (a) What worked well and effectively and is worth continuing?; (b) What should we stop doing?; and (c) What should be done instead of the things we decided (in (b)) to stop doing? Answers to these questions should cover the entire transfer process, including its final products. Feedback is part of a database that returns to the beginning of the process and becomes the foundation of the transfer process. Effective feedback supplies data relevant to improving the next process, without which one is left ‘shooting in the dark’.</p>
<p>The feedback provides two kinds of products: conclusions and constructive conclusions. Conclusions are commonly phrased in a general and non-operative manner. In contrast, constructive conclusions are always expressed as practical and operative deductions that can be implemented either immediately or later (in cases where the conclusion load is great, making immediate execution difficult). Whatever the chosen alternative (even if it is not efficient and the problem will not have been solved), there is a need for feedback on the process and behaviors, in order to prepare for the next stage like any efficient system that controls itself (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429412440647">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>). People should seek feedback because it has informational value that helps them meet their goals and regulates their behavior. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429412440647">Beghetto (2006</xref>) found that middle and secondary students’ reports of teachers providing positive feedback on their creativity was the strongest unique predictor of students’ beliefs in their own creativity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0261429412440647">Zhou, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-0261429412440647">
<title>Demonstrating an optimal process</title>
<p>The optimal process for transfer and creativity is demonstrated here through an example. Stage 1: A little girl acquires the principle that when you assemble a jigsaw puzzle you must start from the whole to the parts. This principle was reactivated when the girl became a mother and did jigsaw puzzles with her own son. She explains to him the rule she acquired as a little girl, that ‘you must start from the whole to the parts and so you must look at the picture on the box’. The mother is also a sixth-grade teacher and a week after playing with her son, she discovered that some of her students were having difficulty with reading comprehension. No solution comes to mind in an automatic associative manner (System 1 processing). She activates stage 2 and sets her next goal in terms of transfer and creativity: ‘How will I teach my sixth-grade students to understand a text according to the principles of transfer and creativity?’ Having defined the goal, she moves on to stage 3 and systematically searches her memory storage for ‘something I can transfer from another field to that of reading comprehension’ that will help to attain the goal and solve her pupils’ reading comprehension problem. She raises several options but discards them and then reaches the area of playing with her child, where she finds the principle for doing puzzles – from the whole to the parts. She then transfers this principle to reading comprehension as follows: ‘As for a jigsaw puzzle, when reading a text one should start with understanding the whole, through the title, and then move on to the parts.’ In the last stage she executes the transfer or creativity and assesses the results, drawing conclusions via feedback in anticipation of the next transfer and creative goals. In each stage she can stop the System 2 process and move to System 1 processing.</p>
<p>In summation, after having analysed the optimal processes of transfer and creativity, it seems that, overall, we can increase transfer and creativity by using System 1 and System 2 processes. The essence of transfer and creativity is to move ‘something’ from one mental set to another mental set, in order to reach a goal or solve a problem. Such a ‘move’ is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon but a continuum containing several dimensions: (a) the amount of control and awareness (System 1 vs. System 2); (b) the distance (close and far transfer) of the process and products of transfer and creativity. The main difference between transfer and creativity is that, unlike transfer, the process and product of creativity are accompanied with the surprise ‘Aha!’ feeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429412440647">Henderson, 2004</xref>). As such, each creativity process contains transfer but not every transfer contains creativity. We still do not understand this surprise Aha! feeling; however, by using both System 1 and 2 processing, the probability of creativity and transfer products will increase. Namely, moving from chance, intuition, trial-and-error processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429412440647">Kozbelt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261429412440647">Simonton, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261429412440647">2006</xref>) to self-regulated, controlled, rational processes that can be learned and where expertise can be acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261429412440647">Kozbelt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0261429412440647">Weisberg, 2006</xref>). Although the chance and control perspectives have been starkly contrasted, they can be compatible through the application of the following principles:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>When the problem arises, first use System 1 while using System 2 for evaluating the solution. If it works ‘you win’ with almost no investment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If it does not work start System 2 using the suggested stages.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In each stage you can stop and use System 1 processing. If it does not work, continue with System 2.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Within System 2 a number of mental processes should be used such as analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, transformation, analogical transfer, mental imagery, and categorical reduction (i.e. mentally reducing objects or elements to more primitive categorical descriptions).</p>

<title>Enhancing transfer and creativity</title>
<p>Studies on the development of creativity suggest that successful programmes were likely to focus on the development of cognitive skills and the heuristics involved in skill application, using realistic exercises appropriate to specific domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429412440647">Hennessey and Amabile, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429412440647">Kaufman and Baer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429412440647">Madjar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429412440647">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). The literature on transfer shows that the transfer of schooled knowledge and procedures occurs far less often than educators would hope. Organizations invest substantial time and money in training. But training transfer is usually regarded as problematic, and it is assumed that a substantial part of the training results is not actually put into work practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429412440647">Holton et al., 2007</xref>). When studies have demonstrated success in producing transfer, it was far more likely to have been close transfer rather than far transfer and was limited to the relative levels of investment and expectation. The results have appeared mostly in laboratory studies, with little evidence of maintenance over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429412440647">Barnett and Ceci, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429412440647">Burke and Hutchins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429412440647">Chen and Mo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261429412440647">Roth-van der et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the somewhat specific nature of transfer and creativity, the most effective training programmes will be those tailored to enhance creativity in a specific domain, and even better in a specific task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429412440647">Kaufman and Baer, 2006</xref>). In order to enhance transfer and creativity, intervention programmes should focus on two goals: (1) being expert in the domain in which both transfer and creativity operate as both depend on the acquisition of domain-relevant expertise (e.g. facts, concepts, procedural and declarative knowledge, etc.); (2) being expert in the optimal processes as suggested in this article. Namely, people should learn to move from System 1 to System 2 processing and regulate the processes according to the stages described earlier.</p>
<p>Several factors will help in developing transfer and creativity as the main goals: (1) a well-organized and reasonable curricula with appropriate tasks; (2) meta-cognitive teaching emphasizing processes, integration, feedback, differential instruction and efficiency; (3) creating environments that enhance transfer and creativity, such as autonomy, accepting different ideas, respect for autonomy and resources, project management, feedback, no time pressure, no competition, collaborative (group) and active learning, and advanced technology; and, finally, (4) training teachers how to regulate optimal transfer and creativity and to model it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429412440647">Cropley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429412440647">Maciejovsky and Budescu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261429412440647">Shalley et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The main contribution of this article lies in identifying the same underlying optimal processes involved in transfer and creativity, and therefore making this approach more tractable to further empirical and theoretical work. The processes of transfer and creativity suggested by this article are not single acts performed at a given moment in time, but rather continual processes with a number of stages. It is not algorithmic, that is it does not proceed step by step, like a computer program. Nor is it heuristic (solution by sudden insight, a shortcut based on experience). The process, like a spiral, is both circular and progressive, in that it makes great strides but also returns from time to time to check or repeat previous steps.</p>
<p>Creativity and transfer processes are worthy end goals for their own sake, regardless of how the products may be reviewed or received by a larger population. To achieve effective teaching for regulating transfer and creativity, within and between domains, an effective syllabus must have transfer and creativity as its essence and the nucleus of its goals. Creativity and transfer are like playing the piano. First, one has to follow the rules and practise them, and only then can one play from one’s heart.</p>
<p>Creativity and transfer are novel and useful solutions from two different points of view: the observer’s and the inner subjective. Every time people are either transferring or creating the novel ideas become old ones. As such, being creative or transferring is moving each time to new unknown frontiers. The complexity of our world is increasing and will continue to do so. The information boom is not slowing down, and technological advances are occurring more often. All of this implies that transfer and creativity are more important now than ever before. Both will give people the capacity to cope with the advances, opportunities, technologies and changes that are a part of our current day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>Sadly, <bold>Dr. Yifat Harpaz-Itay</bold> passed away late last year just before the publication of her paper with Professor Shlomo Kaniel. She received her B.A. from Bar Ilan University in 1999 (cum laude), with a major in Education (Administration and Policy), and a minor in Hebrew and Comparative Literature. She received her teaching certificate (cum laude) in 2000. She was awarded the Bar Ilan University President’s scholarship and completed her PhD. in 2009. Yifat was a lecturer at Orot College in Elkana and her article with Shlomo represents a step beyond her Phd, which dealt with optimism as part of the psychological world of attitudes.</p>
<p>Yifat proved to be an excellent researcher who thoughtfully and independently carried out very complicated research using advanced statistical methods. The optimism which she researched helped her through her illness. She was filled with faith, confidence and courage until her last days and projected these qualities on to her young children and devoted husband. Her children and husband have lost a mother and a spouse, while we all have lost a superb researcher.</p>
