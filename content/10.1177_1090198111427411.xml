<abstract>
<p>This study examines the impact of past experience with influenza and the influenza vaccine on four categories of the Health Belief Model: beliefs about susceptibility to contracting influenza, severity of illness, perceived benefits of the vaccine in preventing influenza, and perceived barriers to getting vaccinated. The study population comprised employees at different workplaces in Israel. The results indicate that individuals who took flu shots in the past perceived higher levels of benefits from the vaccine and lower barriers to getting the vaccine than those who had not been vaccinated. In addition, those who had influenza over the last 2 years exhibited higher levels of perceived susceptibility and lower levels of perceived benefits from the vaccine. These results imply that an individual’s health beliefs regarding the flu vaccine can be changed as a result of accumulated experience with the illness and the vaccine. Therefore, recommendations for first-time vaccination may have implications on decisions to be vaccinated over the long run.</p>

<p>The Health Belief Model (HBM), developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111427411">Rosenstock (1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111427411">1974</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111427411">Rosenstock, Strecher, and Becker (1988)</xref>, is a systematic method to explain preventive health behavior in terms of certain belief patterns. It focuses on the relationship between health behaviors and utilization of health services. The HBM is defined in terms of four categories representing perceived threat and net benefits: (a) perceived <italic>susceptibility</italic>, an individual’s opinion of the chances of contracting a condition; (b) perceived <italic>severity</italic>, an individual’s opinion of the severity of a condition and its consequences; (c) perceived <italic>benefits</italic>, an individual’s belief in the efficacy of an advised action to reduce risk or seriousness of impact; and (d) perceived <italic>barriers</italic>, an individual’s opinion of the tangible and psychological costs of an advised action. These concepts were proposed as accounting for people’s “readiness to act” in terms of preventive health behavior.</p>
<p>Although the HBM is not the only model frequently used to explain health behavior, it is the one that is most often applied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427411">Assari (2011)</xref> stated that on April 2011, a simple search in PubMed for HBM yielded around 3,800 articles, considerably more than for any other behavior theory, including Social Cognitive Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior. This is because the HBM has proven to be applicable for a variety of health behaviors, ranging from vaccination compliance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111427411">Blue &amp; Valley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111427411">Nexoe, Kragstrup, &amp; Sogaard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>) to surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111427411">Armstrong, Anderson, Le, &amp; Nguyen, 2009</xref>) to many other health behaviors. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not focused on the factors affecting the health beliefs and attitudes of individuals toward influenza and the influenza vaccine. Our study fills this void.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined factors affecting the decision to get the flu vaccine using the HBM as a conceptual framework for examining the preventive behavior of vaccination. According to the HBM, the decision to be vaccinated against influenza depends on the following predictors: perceived susceptibility to influenza, beliefs about severity of influenza, perceived benefits of the vaccine in preventing influenza, and perceived barriers to getting vaccinated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111427411">Blue &amp; Valley, 2002</xref>). In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>), we found that, on average, vaccinated individuals (and those who planned to be vaccinated) perceived influenza as a more serious illness, felt they were more susceptible to illness, perceived more benefits from vaccination, and had fewer barriers to getting flu shots than did nonvaccinated individuals (and those who did not intend to be vaccinated). In addition, our previous study results show that the significant factors affecting vaccination compliance among Israeli employees include vaccination programs at workplaces, past vaccination, higher levels of vaccine’s perceived benefits, and lower levels of barriers to getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>The current study is based on the same data as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani and Benzion (2010)</xref>. This study, however, focuses on examining the factors affecting people’s health beliefs with respect to influenza and influenza vaccination in the framework of HBM.</p>
<p>In his seminal original proposal for the HBM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111427411">Rosenstock (1966)</xref> argued that cognitive dissonance theory would predict that perceptions of HBM variables would change after behavior is changed. He explained that once individuals have adopted a particular behavior, they are likely to change their beliefs to be consistent with that behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111427411">Janz and Becker (1984)</xref>, however, argued the opposite pattern of results could occur. They suggested that after having adopted a prevention measure, individuals should logically perceive themselves as being less susceptible to the negative health outcome. This process could cause a negative relationship between susceptibility and the likelihood of adopting that behavior. They note the same could be true for severity if the target behavior reduces the severity of the illness. Barriers may also seem to be lessened once an individual has adopted a behavior if said behavior was easier than originally perceived. Alternatively, an individual could discover that the barriers were stronger than originally perceived before having adopted the behavior.</p>
<p>In accordance with discussions regarding the impact of target behavior (such as preventive behavior) on individuals’ health beliefs, the current study adds to the extant literature by empirically examining the impact of experience with flu vaccination and experience with the flu on the health belief variables as mediators, which in turn affect the decision to be vaccinated. Moreover, we examine the impact not only of self-experience but also of family experience with the illness and with the vaccine on an individual’s health beliefs. We are not aware of any previous studies that examined the impact of experience on HBM predictors in the context of influenza vaccination. Understanding the interplay between beliefs and experience is an important component in understanding how people construct their models of the world and in turn how these models affect their decision making with respect to preventive behavior.</p>
<p>In psychology and other fields, experimental evidence has been collected on experienced-based beliefs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111427411">Holt-Reynolds, 1992</xref>). The impact of experience on beliefs and in turn on behavior in the context of health was examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111427411">Leventhal, Diefenbach, and Leventhal (1992)</xref> in the framework of the self-regulation model. This self-regulation model of illness suggests that people’s understanding of illness is based on their rationalizations about its causes, consequences, timeline, trajectory, prognosis, and about the ability of themselves or others to successfully treat (control or cure) the condition. These cognitions are acquired from people’s beliefs, experiences, and information gleaned from family, friends, health care practitioners, and the media. Importantly, the self-regulation model is malleable, so positive or negative experiences and information can alter people’s illness beliefs, coping strategies, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111427411">Leventhal et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current study, our general hypothesis is that past experience with the illness, past experience with the vaccine, and other factors may shape individuals’ attitudes and beliefs toward the illness and the vaccine. The results of this study will enable us to understand the sources of attitudes and belief patterns with respect to influenza and the vaccine and as a result improve ways to convince people to get flu shots.</p>

<title>The Model</title>
<p>Using regression equations as the analytical model, we examined the factors affecting individuals’ attitudes and beliefs concerning influenza vaccination. More specifically, we chose to focus on the effect of past experience with the illness, past experience with the vaccine, and conditional risks of contracting the illness (with and without flu shot), as well as on sociodemographic characteristics as explanatory variables for the four HBM categories: perceived susceptibility to contracting the illness, perceived seriousness of illness, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and perceived barriers to taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>The analytical model examines the effect of each of the explanatory variables on the dependent variables, controlling for all other variables.</p>
<p>The dependent variables are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1090198111427411" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>HBM<sub>1</sub>—Perceived <italic>susceptibility to influenza</italic>: Individuals at the lower end of the susceptibility spectrum deny the possibility of contracting the illness, whereas those at the higher end feel they are in real danger of contracting influenza.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HBM<sub>2</sub>—Perceived <italic>severity of influenza</italic>: This category describes the level of an individual’s beliefs concerning the potential difficulties caused by influenza, such as pain and discomfort.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HBM<sub>3</sub>—Perceived <italic>benefits of the vaccine</italic>: This category describes the level of an individual’s beliefs concerning what he or she stands to gain by getting a flu shot.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HBM<sub>4</sub>—Perceived <italic>barriers to getting vaccinated</italic>: This category describes the level of an individual’s beliefs concerning potential difficulties caused by the vaccine, such as inconvenience and unpleasantness.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The explanatory variables in the regressions include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1090198111427411" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Self-influenza—Whether or not the individual had influenza in the last 2 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Family influenza—Whether or not a member of the individual’s family had influenza in the last 2 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Self-vaccination—Whether or not the individual has been vaccinated in the last 5 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Family vaccination—Whether or not a member of the individual’s family has been vaccinated in the last year.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Health status—Perceived health status (bad, good).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Smoking—Whether or not the individual smokes.</p></list-item></list>
<p><italic>Sociodemographic factors</italic> included age, education (highest diploma or degree), nationality (Jew or non-Jew), and family status (married or not married). In addition, for three categories of HBM (seriousness, benefits, and barriers), we added the following independent variables: perceived risk of infection if <italic>not</italic> vaccinated and perceived risk of infection if vaccinated.</p>
<p>Our hypotheses are the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1090198111427411" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Past experience with the illness (self and family) and past experience with the vaccine (self-vaccination and vaccination of family members) may affect health beliefs regarding influenza (susceptibility and seriousness categories) and beliefs regarding the vaccine against influenza (benefits and barriers categories).</p></list-item></list>
<p>This hypothesis is based on the self-regulation model, which predicts that positive or negative experiences and information can alter people’s illness beliefs, coping strategies, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111427411">Leventhal et al., 1992</xref>). In particular, we expect that a negative experience with the illness (self or family) will increase perceived susceptibility, perceived severity of illness, and perceived benefits from the vaccine, and in addition will decrease the perceived barriers to vaccination. In addition, a positive experience with the vaccine (self-vaccination and vaccination of family members) will lower the perceived susceptibility and severity of the illness, since people may feel more protected after having the vaccine and may expect that contracting the illness after vaccination will be less serious than otherwise. In addition, past experience with the vaccine will increase perceived levels of benefits from the vaccine and decrease the level of perceived barriers.</p>
<list id="list4-1090198111427411" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Those who perceived higher risk probabilities of contracting the illness may have higher levels of perceived severity of illness, higher levels of perceived benefits from the vaccine, and lower levels of perceived barriers to vaccinate.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Perceived risk has been found to predict an array of health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111427411">Brewer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111427411">Van der Pligt, 1998</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111427411">Chapman and Coups (2006)</xref> argued that it is the emotional side of risk that appears to drive preventive health behavior, consistent with the risk-as-feelings hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111427411">Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, &amp; Welch, 2001</xref>). The risk-as-feelings hypothesis posits that people infer risk directly from their emotions not from cognitive evaluation of consequences. People perceive risks on the basis of the dread (i.e., anxiety and lack of control) they feel when contemplating hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111427411">Slovic, 1987</xref>). For example, in the context of terror attacks and other calamities, previous empirical studies have shown that fearful people became more <italic>pessimistic</italic> and were willing to take more precautionary actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427411">Benzion, Shahrabani, &amp; Shavit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111427411">Johnson &amp; Tversky, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111427411">Klar, Zakay, &amp; Sharvit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111427411">Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, &amp; Fischhoff, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the perceived susceptibility to illness and perceived risk by itself are directly weaker predictors of preventive behavior than are the perceived benefits and barrier predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111427411">Carpenter, 2010</xref>), it may be that perceived risk <italic>indirectly</italic> affects behavior through other health belief predicators.</p>
<list id="list5-1090198111427411" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: People from different nationalities may have different health beliefs with respect to influenza and the vaccine against it.</p></list-item></list>
<p>This hypothesis is based on previous studies that found that nationality is a factor affecting intention to get a flu shot, since the intentions of Arabs to be vaccinated were significantly lower than those of Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111427411">Shahrabani, Benzion, &amp; Yom Din, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111427411">Velan, Kaplan, Ziv, Boyko, &amp; Lerner-Geva, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that differences between Jews and Arabs in intention to be vaccinated stem from differences in their health beliefs with respect to the illness and the vaccine against it.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>In the current study, we used the raw data from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>). Here, we briefly describe the methods we used. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Max Stern Academic College of Emek Yezreel.</p>
<p>A cross-sectional design research methodology was adopted, covering the period from November 2007 to March 2008. The study population included 616 employees at various workplaces in Israel, ranging in age from 18 to 65 years. We chose 13 organizations from various industries in Israel. The organizations were the following: (a) five traditional industrial plants, including the oil refinery complex and the petrochemical complex, the electric company, and a petrol and energy company; (b) four service organizations, including an institution of higher education, two engineering services firms, and an industrial supply services firm; (c) two large international high-tech organizations, an optical products company and an information technologies company.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090198111427411">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The research questionnaire was based partially on the questionnaire developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111427411">Blue and Valley (2002)</xref> and on its Hebrew version implemented for health care employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111427411">Shahrabani et al., 2009</xref>). The questionnaire was finalized after analyzing data from a pilot questionnaire distributed at two workplaces.</p>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of the following parts: (a) items requesting sociodemographic information, including age, marital status, education, nationality, experience at work, and membership in a particular health maintenance organization (HMO); (b) the intention to be vaccinated in the next 12 months, on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Certainly I will get the vaccine in the next year</italic>) to 5 (<italic>I will definitely not get the vaccine in the next year</italic>); (c) past flu vaccination history (1 = <italic>the individual has been vaccinated in the last 5 years</italic> and 0 = <italic>the individual has not been vaccinated in the last 5 years</italic>), and perceived health status (ranging from 1 = <italic>very good</italic> to 4 = <italic>poor</italic>); (d) perceived probability of contracting influenza without the vaccine and after getting the vaccine (5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>very high</italic> to 5 = <italic>very low</italic>); (e) items measuring the HBM variables, including the four categories of susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers (the items in each category are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111427411">Table 1</xref>). Items in the HBM predictor categories were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with the following possible responses: <italic>strongly agree</italic> (1), <italic>agree</italic> (2), <italic>neither agree nor disagree</italic> (3), <italic>disagree</italic> (4), and <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (5). Each of the HBM scales was a sum of answers for several questions. The scores on each of the scales were averaged to form the dependent variables. The constructs of the HBM categories were tested for reliability and validity in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>). In particular, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the HBM categories were perceived susceptibility (HBM<sub>1</sub>) −.654, perceived seriousness (HBM<sub>2</sub>) −.628, perceived benefits (HBM<sub>3</sub>) −.686, and perceived barriers (HBM<sub>4</sub>) −.723.</p>

<title>Data Collection Procedure</title>
<p>The envelopes with the questionnaires and cover letters were randomly distributed among several departments. This procedure was carried out only after we asked the human resources department of each company to construct a sample comprising administrative as well as production employees, both genders, and a range of ages.</p>
<p>A cover letter was attached to the self-administered questionnaire form explaining the purpose of the study. In addition, the cover letter explained that participation in the study was voluntary and provided details of the researchers as well as instructions to return the completed questionnaire in the enclosed envelope to the human resource department via interoffice mail. (At each workplace, the human resources department gave formal permission to distribute the questionnaires to the employees on a voluntary basis.) Two weeks later, we contacted the companies and collected the completed questionnaires. In addition, to increase the number of participants from the high-tech industries, we distributed questionnaires (with cover letters) to 81 high-tech workers studying in an MBA program at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. A total of 879 questionnaires were distributed in the study, and 616 questionnaires were returned by the respondents, representing a response rate of 70.07%.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>HBM<sub>1</sub></italic>: The factors that significantly increase perceived susceptibility of illness include self-experience with the illness in the last 2 years (compatible with Hypothesis 1), poor health status, and smoking. A possible reason for the impact of smoking on perceived susceptibility may be that those who smoke are aware of their poor health condition and therefore are not optimistic regarding their chances of contracting the illness. In addition, the results indicate that the factors that significantly decrease perceived susceptibility of illness include vaccination in the family in last year (compatible with Hypothesis 1) and influenza in the family in the last 2 years (incompatible with Hypothesis 1). A possible reason that influenza in the family is perceived to lower an individual’s susceptibility to contracting the illness could be that while family members came down with the flu, the individual did not catch it (as a positive experience). This may strengthen the individual’s belief that he or she has lower chances of being infected.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><italic>HBM<sub>3</sub></italic>: The factors that significantly increase the perceived benefits of vaccination include self-experience with the vaccine in the last 5 years, high level of perceived infection risk without vaccination, and low level of perceived infection risk after vaccination (which indicates a belief that the vaccine is effective). These results are compatible with our hypotheses. We also found that self-experience with the illness reduces the perceived benefits of vaccine, incompatible with our hypothesis. One explanation may be that people who had a mild case of the illness may not perceive the vaccine as necessary.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>HBM<sub>4</sub></italic>: The factors that significantly <italic>decrease</italic> the perceived barriers to getting vaccinated are self-experience with the vaccine in the last 5 years (compatible with our hypothesis) and education.

<list-item><p>We did not find any significant effect of nationality on any of the HBM categories, incompatible with Hypothesis 3. This result may suggest that there is no difference in attitudes and beliefs toward influenza and the vaccine against it among people from different nationalities.

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>The current research examines the factors affecting people’s health beliefs and attitudes with respect to influenza and the vaccine against it. In particular, we focused on the impact of past experience with the illness and past experience with the vaccine on the HBM categories: beliefs about susceptibility of contracting the influenza, severity of influenza, perceived benefits of the vaccine in preventing influenza, and perceived barriers to getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that those who had family experience with the vaccine perceived lower risk of contracting the illness. In addition, past self-experience with the vaccine (in the last 5 years) has a significant impact on two categories of HBM: perceived benefits and perceived barriers. In particular, we found that those who took the vaccine in the past perceived higher levels of benefits from the vaccine and lower barriers to getting the vaccine. A possible explanation may be that a “positive” experience with the vaccine (e.g., individuals were not infected after they took the vaccine and did not have significant side effects from the vaccine) helps them appreciate the benefit of the vaccine, and in addition lowers their perceived barriers to vaccination (such as reducing their concerns about the vaccine’s side effects). This result may have implications for subsequent vaccination decisions since those who have lower perceived barriers and higher perceived benefits may intend to take the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111427411">Blue &amp; Valley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111427411">Shahrabani et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have shown that on average those who got flu shots perceived the flu to be a more serious illness, perceived a higher risk of infection, perceived more benefits from vaccination, and had fewer barriers to getting the flu shot than those who did not get the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>). In addition, previous studies have found that past experience with influenza vaccination is a predictor of willingness to get vaccinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111427411">Sendi, Locher, Bucheli, &amp; Battegay, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111427411">Setbon &amp; Raude, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>). The current study adds to the previous findings by showing that experience with the vaccine has an impact on an individual’s perceived benefits and perceived barriers to get vaccinated, which in turn affect the intention to get vaccinated, as was found by the previous studies mentioned above.</p>
<p>Our results also show that past experience with influenza (in the last 2 years) has a significant negative effect on an individual’s perceived susceptibility to contracting the illness and perceived benefits of the vaccine. Those who had influenza in the last 2 years exhibited higher levels of susceptibility to the illness as well as lower levels of perceived benefits from the vaccine. One explanation may be that people who experienced influenza once feel they are more susceptible to the chance of contracting the illness again. Yet if they perceived the illness they experienced as mild, they may now perceive the vaccine as less necessary. Another explanation, which may be a limitation of the study, is that people do not distinguish between influenza and other flu-like illnesses.</p>
<p>Another result indicates that a high level of perceived risk of infection without vaccination significantly increases the perceived seriousness of the illness and the perceived benefits of the vaccine. Perceived risk has been found to predict an array of health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111427411">Van der Pligt, 1998</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111427411">Chapman and Coups (2006)</xref> argued that it is the emotional side of risk that appears to drive preventive health behavior, consistent with the risk-as-feelings hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111427411">Loewenstein et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, in line with these findings, it is possible that individuals with high levels of perceived risk of infection tend to be more worried about the illness, which in turn leads to higher perceived seriousness of illness and higher levels of perceived benefits from the vaccine. Higher levels of perceived benefits in turn affect the decision to get a flu shot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111427411">Blue &amp; Valley, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the current study indicates that an individual’s health beliefs and attitudes toward the vaccine against influenza are not rigid and are subject to changes over time as a result of accumulated experience with the illness and with the vaccine. This result is important, since flu vaccination must be repeated annually, thus requiring repeated decision making. Each decision is followed by feedback (getting the flu or not) prior to the next decision. Those who have a “good” experience with the vaccine (e.g., they did not catch the flu after vaccination) will tend to perceive increased benefits from the vaccine and at the same time lower their perceptions of the barriers. This result is also important for policy makers, since it implies that a <italic>first time</italic> recommendation to be vaccinated has implications on individual’s attitudes, which in turn may affect not only his/her immediate decision to get a flu shot but also the long-term decisions to get vaccinated. In other words, a recommendation to vaccinate may instigate a positive experience with the vaccine, which in turn will increase positive attitudes toward the vaccine and may contribute to routine vaccination each year. Moreover, offering the vaccine at workplaces, found effective in increasing compliance rates in the year the vaccine was offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427411">Shahrabani &amp; Benzion, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111427411">Strunk, 2005</xref>), can have a long-term impact on employees’ willingness to get the vaccine in the future, since they may change their attitude toward the vaccine after their first flu shot.</p>
<p>Another important implication of the current results is that vaccination could be promoted <italic>indirectly</italic> by changing people’s health beliefs with respect to illness and vaccination. For example, the media can be used to address targeted groups, to tailor health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111427411">Strecher, 1999</xref>) to these groups, and to explain the severity of influenza and the risks of catching the illness for a specific group. This information will serve as mediating factors affecting beliefs of perceived benefits and barriers of vaccination, which in turn may increase vaccination compliance rates.</p>
<p>To conclude, the results of the study enable us to understand the sources of attitudes and beliefs patterns to improve ways of convincing people to take preventive health actions.</p>
