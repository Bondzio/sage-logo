<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetes is now the leading etiology of Charcot joints in the developed world,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012449037">1</xref></sup> surpassing syphilis, syringomyelia, and leprosy. It was first described in syphilis patients with tabes dorsalis in 1868 by French neurologist, Jean Martin Charcot, and later described in the setting of diabetes by William Riely Jordan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012449037">2</xref></sup> Charcot neuroarthropathy usually occurs in patients who have diabetes for more than 10 years. Approximately 40% of the diabetic population has neuropathy; however, only 1% to 3.5% of these patients eventually develop Charcot neuroarthropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012449037">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Charcot neuroarthropathy is a complex disease encompassing disorders of the peripheral nervous and vascular systems leading to fractures and dislocations primarily of the foot and ankle. The disease involves rapid onset of painless and severe joint destruction associated with fractures and dislocations. The resulting gross deformity of the foot can progressively worsen, leading to collapse and subsequent development of ulceration, infection, amputation, or premature death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012449037">4</xref></sup> Understanding the pathophysiology, natural history, and anatomic patterns of this disease can greatly enhance patient outcomes, as early recognition and timely treatment will often improve the desired outcome of maintaining a plantigrade foot. Foot ulcerations are a common problem associated with Charcot and this can increase the incidence of osteomyelitis. At this point, efforts to manage the disease become focused on limb salvage. Healing Charcot-related neuropathic ulcerations prior to the development of osteomyelitis is imperative to decrease the incidences of both osteomyelitis and subsequent amputation. The ultimate goal is to have a functional, plantigrade foot and avoid nontraumatic, lower extremity ulceration.</p>
<p>A novel acellular collagen matrix derived from fetal bovine dermis (PriMatrix, TEI Biosciences, Boston, MA) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for a variety of wound etiologies, including diabetic, venous, and pressure ulcers, surgical wounds, and traumatic wounds. PriMatrix is composed of type I collagen fibers, which are processed to preserve their native fetal collagen biochemistry and structure, as well as a high percentage of fibrillar type III collagen, which is associated with healing and developing tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012449037">5</xref></sup> The acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix has been processed to remove all lipids, fats, carbohydrates, and noncollagenous proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012449037">5</xref></sup> leaving primarily collagen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012449037">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012449037">7</xref></sup> a natural substrate for cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012449037">8</xref></sup> When the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix is applied to the wound bed, the porous matrix soaks with blood and, within minutes, a fibrin provisional matrix forms in the interstices of the collagen fiber matrix. Vascular endothelial growth factor binds to the collagen, and CD34+ circulating cells have been found sequestered in the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012449037">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the effects of acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix (PriMatrix) on healing of midfoot ulcerations in the setting of Charcot neuroarthropathy.</p>

<title>Patient Selection and Treatment Setting</title>
<p>In this retrospective analysis, 20 patients with ulcerations of the midfoot associated with Charcot neuroarthropathy were treated with either the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix in addition to standard of wound care (PriMatrix group) or standard of wound care alone (control group).</p>
<p>All study patients were treated in the Mayo Clinic, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, and Section of Vascular Medicine, Gonda Vascular Wound Healing Center between January 2009 and December 2010. The study protocol was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>All patients had chronic, nonhealing foot ulcerations of at least 30 days duration and a minimum ulcer volume of 2500 mm<sup>3</sup>. All foot ulcerations were full thickness with subcutaneous involvement. Study patients had multiple comorbidities associated with their chronic foot ulcerations, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and renal disease. Doppler arterial studies and transcutaneous oximetry (TcPo<sub>2</sub>) were performed to evaluate potential limb ischemia. Ankle brachial index ≥0.90 and/or TcPo<sub>2</sub> ≥ 40 mm Hg at the periulcer site was required for inclusion in the study. Patients were excluded if they had acute or chronic osteomyelitis of the foot. Standard radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and indium nuclear bone scans were used for imaging as indicated.</p>
<p>Offloading the neuropathic ulcer was accomplished with provisional footwear (DARCO Med/Surg Shoe, DARCO International, Huntington, WV). The provisional footwear was worn with either the patient’s custom foot orthoses or a piece of Plastizote 1.25 cm in thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012449037">10</xref></sup> If the midfoot deformity was severe, a CROW (Charcot restraint orthotic walker) boot was used for offloading.</p>

<title>Ulcer Care</title>
<p>The acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix was placed in the wound bed with a hydrogel dressing applied as a secondary dressing to keep the PriMatrix hydrated. The dressing was changed with reapplication of hydrogel after 1 week. The acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix was reapplied if the previously applied material had been integrated into the wound and further wound healing was still indicated. Ulcers in the control group were dressed with a hydrogel and nonadherent petrolatum gauze with 3% bismuth tribromophenate (Xeroform, Kendall/Covidien, Mansfield, MA), which was changed once daily, with weekly routine wound care visits, including evaluation for infection. For all patients in both treatment groups, the wound bed was initially prepared with low-frequency ultrasound therapy (Arobella Qoustic Wound Therapy System, Minnetonka, MN). This was done to remove necrotic, dense fibrous and slough material from the wound base. Additionally, the Arobella low- frequency ultrasound debridement greatly assists in removing bioburden from the wound base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012449037">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data on patient medical history, wound characteristics and measurements, time to healing, and rate of healing were collected from patient medical records.</p>

<sec id="section6-1938640012449037">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the study data was performed with nonparametric statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012449037">12</xref></sup> The mean times to healing and mean rates of healing were compared between the PriMatrix and control groups. Quantitated paired data comparisons between the initial wound volume and end wound volume (ie, on completion of wound care) for control and PriMatrix values were conducted with the one-way analysis of variance test. Comparisons of quantitated nonpaired data for age, diabetes mellitus, Charcot arthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic renal failure between groups were conducted using the Mann–Whitney test. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the estimated median differences (Wilcoxon test), point estimate (Mann–Whitney test), and selected proportions are reported. Differences in proportion were assessed with the χ<sup>2</sup> test. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range.</p>

<title>Wound Healing Outcomes</title>
<p>Mean wound volume at baseline was 4078 mm<sup>3</sup> in the control group and 3737.5 mm<sup>3</sup> in the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix group (<italic>P</italic> = nonsignificant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012449037">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this series of 20 patients, large neuropathic ulcers treated with the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix as an adjunct to standard wound care healed at a faster rate and in a shorter period of time than neuropathic ulcers treated with standard wound care alone. The promise of healing neuropathic ulcerations more quickly, thereby reducing the risk of developing osteomyelitis and limb amputations associated with these bone infections, cannot be overstated. However, these findings must be considered in light of the study’s inherent limitations, including the small number of patients studied, retrospective design, and unblinded analysis. Nonetheless, this initial finding that the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix dressing may help expedite healing of neuropathic ulcers in the setting of Charcot neuroarthropathy warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>PriMatrix is composed of primarily collagen (types I and III), which is an optimal protein for cell attachment and proliferation because of its strong biochemical affinity for binding growth factors and angiogenic cytokines present in human plasma. When the porous collagen matrix comes in contact with the wound bed, it soaks up blood within minutes, sequestering and binding host cells and wound healing growth factors within a well-conserved dermal architecture. Through this process, the collagen matrix may work in concert with the host’s healing mechanisms to stimulate revascularization and dermal regeneration.</p>
<p>Management of the Charcot foot involves correcting the underlying deformity to prevent ulceration and healing any cutaneous ulcerations that do develop. Without ulceration, the Charcot foot is typically managed nonsurgically with immobilization (ie, total-contact cast or ankle–foot orthosis) and protected weight bearing and progressing to therapeutic footwear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012449037">1</xref></sup> Surgical management (ie, exostectomy, arthrodesis, internal or external fixation, amputation) is considered in the presence of recurrent ulceration, infection, unbraceable deformity, and acute fracture or dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012449037">1</xref></sup> Standard care for neuropathic ulcerations of the Charcot foot includes offloading and regular debridement to remove surrounding callus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012449037">13</xref></sup> In addition, a wide range of wound dressings may be used in an effort to hasten healing of neuropathic foot ulcerations and thereby prevent infection and avoid the need for exostectomy or amputation. Such topical therapies range from saline gauze or other simple moist dressings to living skin substitutes and dermal matrices.</p>
<p>It is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the various topical therapies available given that healing rates, even in patients receiving standard neuropathic ulcer care, vary widely across studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012449037">13</xref></sup> In a meta-analysis of control groups from clinical trials that evaluated a treatment for diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers, Margolis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012449037">14</xref></sup> estimated that 12- and 20-week healing rates were 24.2% and 30.7%, respectively. Other studies have reported 12-week healing rates in study groups receiving control or routine neuropathic ulcer care from as low as 18%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012449037">15</xref></sup> and 38%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012449037">16</xref></sup> to as high as 74% and 80%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012449037">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1938640012449037" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The significantly faster rate of healing and steeper slope of volume reduction associated with the acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix compared with standard wound care demonstrates the need to evaluate the effects of PriMatrix on healing of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcerations and the subsequent potential for maximizing limb salvage. Further investigation is warranted to study the effect of PriMatrix on the healing of chronic wounds in the settings of diabetic neuropathy and Charcot neuroarthropathy.</p>
