<p>There’s a lot of loose talk about science fiction. There is, however, a growing body of empirical work that takes a creative look beyond the flashy lights at the front of the cinema to realistically look at the topic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662512443727">David Kirby’s (2011)</xref> <italic>Lab Coats in Hollywood</italic> study of scientific consultants is one. Another is Megan Prelinger’s <italic>Another Science Fiction</italic>, an engrossing study of advertising in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the various hype and promise of science fiction. Here amongst the trade magazines of the mid-20th century (e.g. <italic>Aviation Week</italic>) Prelinger shows us that some of the most fascinating discourses of hope weren’t in pulp fiction, but were those aiming to cash in on the “new frontier” of space. It’s a study of a form of science fiction that I suspect fans of the sociology of expectations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512443727">Brown et al., 2000</xref>) will enjoy. It’s also a chocolate box of a book too; bursting with reproductions of these adverts. In many respects, it is a piece of art and design history as much as it is a history of the rhetorics of science technology.</p>
<p>The advertisement on page 174 of Prelinger’s book sums up her material very neatly. “Want to build a space motel?” a large banner title asks next to an image of floating spacemen and a tiny cap of the curve of the Earth in the background. A subheading informs: “Thompson Products can help.” The text continues
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s bound to happen in the not-too-distant future: an American space motel for rockets will be orbiting about the earth! While the U.S. Government may send it aloft, private enterprise will help build it. And right now, Thompson Products is ready to design and produce important components and assemblies for such a space station of tomorrow. Fantastically difficult? Perhaps … […] If you’re considering the development of an advanced product, let Thompson help get it into production.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Prelinger notes, many of the adverts were for recruitment. Similarly, this Thompson Products advert is not advertising actual products as much as a relationship with the company. The text I edited out with square brackets in that quote above is filled with blurb on their company’s history of work in the field. They are running a discourse of hope on reputation. These adverts are a fiction, but the fiction of advertising; the implication that they might be real is key. Arguably, all science fiction has a strong relationship with a sense of the real, but this is perhaps a different form of real; a monetisable one. Or at least one you are invited to bet on happening. This is very much a story of the commercial side of the space race. A story of companies that were engaged in not only making money from the process of dreaming about the future – as we might see in pulp fiction, a big budget sci fi movie, or indeed, much popular science – but a sense that these dreams might be made into tangible, sellable products.</p>
<p>To end on a pragmatic note, I can’t be the only science communication lecturer to note advertising as a graduate career path. As one ex-student put it: “those semiotics lectures were especially useful.” For all “the public understanding of science” movement’s lofty educational aims, a lot of science communication is about making money (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662512443727">Fyfe and Lightman, 2007</xref>, or simply the next paid-for touring exhibition you visit at your local natural history museum). Whatever our personal views on this, we’d do well to think about this more.</p>
