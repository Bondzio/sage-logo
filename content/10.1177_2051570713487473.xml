<abstract>
<p>In operational terms (cost, implementation), a virtual 3D laboratory store offers an attractive alternative to a physical laboratory store for testing in-store marketing initiatives (packaging, price or other). Comparing controlled samples, this study shows that declared attitudes to the product are the same but observes significant differences for in-store shopping behaviour and attention to price. These differences are moderated when the subject is a regular buyer of the brand.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The laboratory store or ‘pseudo-store’ methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2051570713487473">Payne, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487473">Pessemier, 1960</xref>) involves putting a target population in a controlled environment that realistically reproduces the normal shopping environment for the product, and observing simulated shopping behaviour. This technique is used to assess the commercial consequences of marketing initiatives being considered either by a manufacturer, e.g. a change to the range, packaging or price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>), or by a retailer, e.g. a new layout, merchandizing or signage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2051570713487473">Needel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2051570713487473">Vrechopoulos et al., 2004</xref>). It is part of the wide range of tests that combine the type of assessment (based on observation or declaration) with the environment (real or laboratory), ranging from shoppers’ declared level of interest in buying or purchase intent (cited in a questionnaire administered away from the point of purchase) to the recording of real shoppers in a test-zone store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2051570713487473">Wherry, 2006</xref>). The choice of test will depend on the nature and level of development of the marketing initiative itself as these factors influence the relative importance of internal and external validity. However, confidentiality requirements and available budget will also influence the decision.</p>
<p>Significant advances in virtual reality techniques have led to the development of a new type of shopping test using virtual laboratory stores (VLSs), which can now provide a very realistic on-screen representation of the physical store environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487473">Cohen and Gadd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051570713487473">Fox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2051570713487473">In-Store Marketing Institute, Advertising Research Foundation &amp; Kelley School of Business, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2051570713487473">Rosenberger and de Chernatony, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487473">Willke, 2002</xref>). This technique is already used by companies such as Kimberly Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051570713487473">Byron, 2007</xref>), and offers an attractive alternative to tests in physical laboratory stores (PLSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051570713487473">Berneburg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The virtual representation of the store in a VLS has several advantages over a PLS: as no products are physically present, there are fewer operational in-store management constraints (an image is ‘handled’ rather than the product itself), and it is possible to test initiatives that do not yet exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>) and to have more control over certain aspects of the study environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2051570713487473">Needel, 1998</xref>), not only as regards the shopping context and geographical sample selection but also for actual execution of the test (enhanced speed and flexibility). The virtual nature of the store environment and products significantly reduces the fixed costs associated with the study. However, the impact on overall cost remains fairly low because the data collection costs, which account for a large share of the total, are identical.</p>
<p>While the operational advantages are attractive, a VLS has several sources of potential bias associated either with the product supply (stocks never run out, non-realistic representation), or respondent behaviour. Comparative studies have already been conducted on the difference between behaviour in a real store and behaviour in the virtual world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487473">Campo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487473">Tjostheim and Saether-Larsen, 2005</xref>). After noting not only significant methodological limitations (different sample make-up, different product assortments), but also the effects of moderating variables that moderate the value of findings (such as relationship with the brand, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>), their conclusions emphasize the need for further research. Rapid advances in technology have considerably improved the quality of virtual representation, which is an important explanatory factor for the differences observed between virtual and real settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487473">Tjostheim and Saether-Larsen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This study uses an intergroup comparison for a consumer packaged goods category to assess the nature and extent of the bias introduced by use of a VLS compared to the results given by a PLS methodology, which is currently the standard method for testing marketing initiatives developed in-store (new packaging, display material, etc.). It adds to previous studies by eliminating two sources of significant unwanted effects: the difference in environment (by having a highly realistic virtual representation of the shopping environment); and the difference in sample composition (by using the same controlled recruitment method). Also, comparison is not restricted to observed assessments but extended to include declared assessments, taking into consideration the potential moderating effect of having previously purchased the target brand.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is structured as follows. The ‘Theoretical framework’ section describes laboratory store methodology and the hypotheses regarding the potential influence of this environment on shopping behaviour. The ‘Empirical study’ section then details the measures and data before presenting the analyses.</p>

<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>This section presents the principle of a laboratory store followed by a detailed description of the protocol applied in both environments (physical or virtual). The potential influence of these differences on behaviour is then examined before formulating hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section3-2051570713487473">
<title>The principle of a laboratory store</title>
<p>The purpose of a laboratory store is to understand and assess the effect of marketing variables that can influence the choice of a new product or a modified existing product (product, packaging, price) in a self-service store. This experimental set-up is founded on the following principles: (1) controlled recruitment of a sample of purchasers of the product category, who are asked (2) to simulate their shopping behaviour, putting products into a shopping basket and proceeding to check out without actually paying (3) by allowing them to freely move around a controlled environment that is the most faithful possible reproduction of an in-store shopping environment.</p>
<p>The advantage of the laboratory store technique is that information can be collected by non-intrusive observation of in-store behaviour (whether the product is handled, time spent, etc.) in addition to declared assessments (of perception, attitude, purchase intent). Shoppers’ declarations alone cannot fully explain in-store shopping behaviour because it results from simultaneous conscious and unconscious processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051570713487473">Fitzsimmons et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2051570713487473">Inman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2051570713487473">Puccinelli et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-2051570713487473">
<title>The physical and virtual environments</title>
<p>A PLS is a mock-up store containing multi-level shelving units arranged in aisles and a checkout space. It provides a similar ‘look and feel’ to a real store. The PLS used in our study (covering approximately 250 m<sup>2</sup>) displays 10 product categories, merchandized with the same number of bays and a similar product assortment to a large supermarket.</p>
<p>The VLS reproduces the product selection found in a PLS but in a digital setting. Its degree of realism depends on the level of virtuality and therefore the technology used (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2051570713487473">Appendix A</xref> for a general presentation of alternatives). This study uses a ‘3D subjective vision’ virtual environment, which offers an acceptable compromise between the required quality of reproduction and the cost of use. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051570713487473">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the PLS (1.a) and VLS (1.b) environments.</p>

</fig>
<p>Respondents are given access to the virtual store in a dedicated space containing a large-screen computer and mouse. The store’s interior is reproduced realistically (trolley, aisles, shelving and product display) and the product is represented by a digitalized 3D display version of its own packaging. The respondent moves around the virtual store by using the mouse or the keyboard’s arrow keys. The product can be enlarged by clicking on it, and then rotated. After moving up to the equivalent of an arm’s length from the shelf, the respondent can put the product in the trolley and go to the checkout (without paying).</p>
<p>In both types of store, the price is displayed on a label on the shelf. In the VLS, a specific action is required to enlarge this label. The alternative of ‘attaching’ the price to the product, with an automatic zoom on the price when the shopper clicks on the product, was rejected because it results in systematic overexposure to price information.</p>
<p>As in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487473">Tjostheim and Saether-Larsen, 2005</xref>), a researcher sits next to the respondent in a VLS, whereas the respondent visits the store alone in the PLS. The researcher’s role is to present the virtual store interface and ensure that the respondent understands how to use it before the store visit. This avoids situations in which poorly understood instructions or a respondent’s limited capabilities result in behaviour involving repetitive clicking (for instance, to explore the interface) that creates erroneous data. However, the presence of a researcher as an external observer can also create an experimental test effect and modify behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2051570713487473">Lewitt and List, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2051570713487473">
<title>Laboratory store protocol</title>
<p>Whether physical or virtual, a laboratory store is an experimental methodology and the results are potentially subject to the same limitations of external validity as any results obtained from simulated behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051570713487473">Chandon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2051570713487473">Lewitt and List, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2051570713487473">Lynch, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2051570713487473">Shimp et al., 1991</xref>). However, the extent of the experimental bias has yet to be determined because comparisons give contradictory results. For example, under-representation of private label purchases in a VLS compared to a PLS as a result of social desirability has not been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487473">Campo et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The protocols for both types of laboratory (VLS and PLS) are presented in detail in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2051570713487473">Appendix B</xref>, the aim being to make them as similar as possible in terms of shopper recruitment and briefing. Recruitment is identical and, to avoid self-selection bias effects, this is carried out in a public space (the street) rather than a real point-of-sale as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487473">Campo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487473">Tjostheim and Saether-Larsen, 2005</xref>), or over the internet. The instructions given to respondents are the same and concern purchases to be made in several product categories (to avoid an experimental contamination effect by target category identification). Both laboratory stores are accessible in a dedicated study space, disconnected from a real point-of-sale and with no other customers apart from the respondent.</p>
<p>In both cases, data collection takes place in three phases: (1) soliciting information about the respondents themselves (age, sex) and their purchasing habits; (2) when the respondent visits the store, observing in-store behaviour and purchasing behaviour (which are video recorded); (3) following the visit, the respondent answers additional questions in a computer-assisted interview (CAPI) about perception of and attitudes to a target brand.</p>

<sec id="section6-2051570713487473">
<title>Hypotheses concerning shopping behaviour</title>
<p>Many research studies have already highlighted the bias resulting from purchases in laboratory stores (see summary table in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2051570713487473">Appendix C</xref>). The aim is to determine whether the bias identified for PLSs is potentially increased or reduced for a VLS.</p>
<sec id="section7-2051570713487473">
<title>Purchases</title>
<p>Comparison of the results from a laboratory store (LS) and a real store (RS) show that sales results are comparable overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051570713487473">Gabor et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2051570713487473">Nevin, 1974</xref>). Similarly, VLS–PLS comparisons show that the predictive quality of consumer choices is fairly good as regards repeat purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487473">Campo et al., 1999</xref>), but much lower for a single purchase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2051570713487473">Tjostheim and Saether-Larsen, 2005</xref>). Significant differences have also been observed concerning heightened sensitivity to promotional offers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>), and a tendency to purchase larger quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487473">Campo et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, the choice dynamic is influenced by the disconnectedness between simulated visits, which leads to a lower incidence of brand change in a VLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>). Two sources of bias have been identified: the quality of the store’s visual representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>), and the effect of the potential difference in merchandizing between the virtual store and the shopper’s regular store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487473">Campo et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>This study aims to tackle two sources of bias identified in a virtual store by improving the quality of visual representation and controlling the product selection displayed in the store. Since the biases deriving from the laboratory situation are identical and the other sources of variation (protocol and recruitment) are controlled, we hypothesize that the bias observed in a virtual setting will be reduced and therefore that purchases by brand will show a good correlation between the VLS and the PLS.</p>

<sec id="section8-2051570713487473">
<title>In-store behaviour</title>
<p>In general, the store environment significantly influences the shopping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051570713487473">Baker et al., 1992</xref>). More specifically, moving around and looking for information in a virtual digital space are significantly different from the same actions in a physical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>). Apart from the fact that there is no actual physical movement (and therefore no effort is required), the virtual environment can only be explored in an intermediated way, using the mouse and the onscreen visual feedback. A visit to a virtual store has several key features:</p>
<list id="list2-2051570713487473" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- <bold>A more limited spectrum of sensorial stimulation:</bold> The VLS reproduces the real environment in a single sensorial dimension – that of sight (hearing is not involved). This deprives the consumer of other normal points of reference, related, for example, to smell or the haptic effect (touch) of handling the product, which can be decisive factors in certain purchasing acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2051570713487473">Jansson-Boyd, 2011</xref>). This means that a VLS is only appropriate for products for which the relevant information can be transmitted visually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2051570713487473">Suh and Lee, 2005</xref>). The product category studied will thus be in consumer packaged goods.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>An unfamiliar environment:</bold> The shopping experience in a virtual environment remains somewhat different from the usual in-store shopping experience. While the familiarity of the physical store environment leads consumers to reproduce their shopping routines in the PLS, the test effect associated with the laboratory context can be expected to be greater in a less familiar environment. The shopping process recorded in a VLS might therefore be less natural, less instinctive and more considered, with attention divided between the response to the researcher’s request to reproduce usual shopping habits and use of an unfamiliar interface that can lead to confirmation-seeking or explorative behaviour. We therefore expect the purchase act to last longer, with more frequent handling to find product information.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H2: Compared to the PLS, the VLS (1) increases purchasing time, (2) increases the number of products handled.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>Greater attention to the environment, to the detriment of price information:</bold> A shopper will tend to pay more attention to price in a PLS than in a real store, assigning more importance to the price factor and thus creating a bias that is greater when attention to price for a product category is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051570713487473">Gabor et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2051570713487473">Nevin, 1974</xref>). In a VLS, on the other hand, less attention to price is expected, initially because the shopping task in a VLS is perceived as less natural, less agreeable and more difficult than in a physical store. Greater attention is required to deal with the environment and search for products, to the detriment of paying attention to price, which requires a specific action. In addition, the perceived difficulty of the task could lead the shopper to simplify the choice process they are being asked to simulate, in order to concentrate on the information needed to execute the task required. The fact that there is no real payment reduces the importance of price information . It can thus be expected that a search for price information will be less frequent in VLSs.</p></list-item>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051570713487473">
<title>Attitude to the product</title>
<p>No major difference in attitude to the product and its features is expected between the two methodologies because for everyday products this attitude is mainly formed by past shopping experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487473">Leong, 1993</xref>). The introductory visit to the laboratory store should only have a limited effect on the measurement of attitude to the product and packaging dimensions, possibly with a slightly greater effect on price perception (e.g. expensiveness) because the price is not normally memorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2051570713487473">Kalyanaram and Winer, 1995</xref>).</p>
<list id="list3-2051570713487473" list-type="simple">

<sec id="section10-2051570713487473">
<title>The moderating effect of being a regular buyer of the brand</title>
<p>An in-store purchase of a consumer packaged good is very rapid (taking less than 20 seconds and often less than 5 seconds according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051570713487473">Dickson and Sawyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051570713487473">Hoyer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487473">Leong, 1993</xref>). This speed reflects a heuristic-based shopping process that mainly depends on simple information that is easily accessible in the store, such as the brand, the price and the promotional offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>), or information associated with the brand in the shopper’s memory. Consequently, the deliberate search for information at the point-of-sale is less frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487473">Leong, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The heuristic of choosing the shopper’s regular brand, which consumes fewer cognitive resources, should be activated more intensively in a virtual setting where less familiarity with the environment should lead the shopper to draw on those resources from the outset. Studies have shown, for example, that the shopper assigns more importance to brand information when shopping online than in a real store and that the combined effect of price and promotion is lower online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051570713487473">Dahlèn and Lange, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051570713487473">Degeratu et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that using this brand information without looking for any other information will result in better brand recognition and shorter purchasing time.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The individual variables collected were sex, age, purchase frequency for the product and most frequently purchased brand. The other measures concerned in-store shopping behaviour and attitudes. They were collected in two ways: by observation and by questionnaire, as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2051570713487473">Appendix B</xref>.</p>
<p>In-store shopping behaviour for the category concerns:</p>
<list id="list5-2051570713487473" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- purchasing time (observed): measured in seconds from a video recording;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- product handling (observed): this is binary coded (yes/no) and the number of products handled is counted;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- attention to price (declared): binary coded;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- post-visit recognition of the product’s presence on the shelf (declared recall), measured in binary form, prompted by photographs of the products;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- the purchase act per article (observed): this results from the product’s presence in the shopper’s trolley at checkout; the purchase rate is the percentage of purchases.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Attitudes to a product are measured based on declarations following in-store purchase and concern a specific brand:</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The product studied was ground arabica coffee, which has already been used in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2051570713487473">Nevin, 1974</xref>). This product offers several advantages: information about the habitual choice criteria (brand, price, format) is easily accessible in the store and the coffee’s affordable price (from the budget version at €1.53 a packet to €3.44 for Lavazza) means it has good penetration, which reduces the cost of sample recruitment. The product range is displayed along two bays and consists of 90 articles from 20 brands in various non-promotional formats. Additional questions about attitude relate to the leading brand in the category.</p>
<p>The two shopper samples were recruited in four laboratory stores. Recruitment was local and applied quotas corresponding to the segmentation criteria used in this market, namely sex (80% women) and age (50% of respondents aged 18–34, 50% aged over 34), plus a purchasing criterion (50% of regular buyers of the brand being tested). The samples, which are identical in size (<italic>n</italic> = 160), are treated as independent and paired based on the usual brand bought.</p>

<title>Shopping behaviour</title>
<p>Hypothesis H1, which posits that the PLS/VLS purchase rates are correlated, is only partly validated. Although a positive, significant correlation is noted between the purchase rates, there are substantial differences by brand that make the brand results difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>The purchase rates by article and by brand are compared on the three criteria used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al. (1992)</xref>.The purchase rate for the most popular articles (<italic>n</italic> = 40) shows a high correlation overall between the two environments (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.81; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), consistent with the findings of past studies (between 0.67 and 0.96, depending on the product categories, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487473">Burke et al., 1992</xref>). In terms of absolute value, the average difference between purchase rates is small (mean = 0.04%; standard deviation = 0.028) but this difference is substantial (more than five points) for two articles. The results are even less acceptable for the second criterion: the average relative difference (ratio of the difference to the market share in a PLS) is substantial (48% on average) and, in 85% of cases, lies outside the acceptable range of +/- 20% relative difference.</p>
<p>Finally, on the third criterion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051570713487473">Figure 2</xref> shows that, when articles are grouped by brand (n = 11), substantial differences appear between the PLS and VLS (e.g. +21% for the leading brand) and <italic>t</italic>-tests show that the purchase rate is significantly higher for the retailer’s private label (+110%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.010) and marginally significantly lower for a national brand (-51%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.069). However, the difference between store types as regards the number of products purchased in the product category studied is insignificant (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical/ virtual</sub> = 1.06 /1.10; Chi<sup>2</sup>= 1.96; <italic>p</italic> = 0.74).</p>

<title>In-store behaviour</title>
<p>The PLS/VLS comparison shows that the greater difficulty in reproducing in-store purchasing routines in a virtual environment is reflected in marked changes in in-store behaviour. The hypothesis that observed behaviours will be different (H2) is supported; the purchase time is significantly longer in the virtual environment (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical/virtual</sub> = 14.8/34.8 seconds; <italic>t</italic> = -5.65; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The percentage of shoppers who handled at least one product is higher in the virtual store (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 14%/24%; Chi<sup>2</sup> = 4.43; <italic>p</italic> = 0.035). However, the purpose of this additional handling appears to be verification rather than exploration because the percentage of people who handle more than one product is lower (<italic>M</italic><sub>real/virtual</sub> = 43%/21%; Chi<sup>2</sup> = 3.46; <italic>p</italic> = 0.062, marginally significant).</p>
<p>Hypothesis H3 positing less attention to price is also supported. There is a very large difference in the declared frequency of price consultation, which is very much lower in the virtual store (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 39%/9%; Chi<sup>2</sup> = 5.02; <italic>p</italic> = 0.025).</p>

Neither the declared purchase intent (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 2.20/2.02) nor the general level of appreciation of the brand store (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 7.22/6.95) differs significantly between the two store environments. Also, no systematic difference is identified in attitudes towards the packaging (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 6.67/ 6.79), the product (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 7.36/7.04) and the price (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 6.71/6.41).</p>

<sec id="section18-2051570713487473">
<title>The moderating effect of being a regular buyer of the brand</title>
<p>A logistic regression is used to examine the moderating effect on a binary variable. The fact of being a regular buyer of the brand significantly moderates the effect of the VLS (H5 is supported). The purchase rate for the brand studied is influenced (Chi<sup>2</sup> Wald = 82.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) both directly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and by a marginally significant interaction effect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.076). In a VLS the purchase rate for the brand is higher for regular buyers, at 74.5% compared to 56.6%, but lower for regular buyers of other brands (13.6% against 10.8%).</p>
<p>The effect of the store type on post-visit visual recall of packaging (binary, prompted) is also moderated by regular buying of the brand (Chi<sup>2</sup> Wald = 32.7; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Regular buyers of the target brand have a slightly higher recall rate in a PLS (<italic>M</italic><sub>regular/virtual</sub> = 87.9%; <italic>M</italic><sub>other/ physical</sub> = 81.8%), that is higher again in a VLS, whereas the recall rate for purchasers of other brands is very much lower in a VLS (<italic>M</italic><sub>regular/virtual</sub> = 98.3%; <italic>M</italic><sub>other/ physical</sub> = 57.6%).</p>
<p>The effect of the store type (nominal variable) on the purchase intent (ordinal measure) is studied using Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel statistics to measure the score difference between the lines (CMH<sup>2</sup>). The slightly higher purchase intent in a virtual environment (<italic>M</italic><sub>real/virtual</sub> = 2.20/2.02; CMH<sup>2</sup> = 2.02; <italic>p</italic> = 0.15) results from an interaction effect with being a regular buyer of the brand. This is illustrated by the fact that the purchase intent is significantly higher for regular buyers (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 1.85 /1.51; CMH<sup>2</sup> = 4.77; <italic>p</italic> = 0.029), but identical for purchasers of other brands (<italic>M</italic><sub>physical /virtual</sub> = 2.55/2.51; CMH<sup>2</sup> = 0.03; <italic>p</italic> = 0.85).</p>
<p>The main results are thus as follows: the VLS gives comparable results to a PLS for post-visit assessment of attitudes to a brand (H4 supported) but significant differences exist in behavioural measures, with shoppers at a virtual store taking longer, handling products more often (H2 supported) and paying less attention to price (H3 supported). Also, the difference created by the VLS depends on the shopper being a regular buyer of the brand (H5 supported).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to assess the bias created by using a virtual rather than a physical laboratory store. The study controls the sources of potential variances identified in the literature (recruitment, realism of visual representation) and covers several measures, not only purchases but also observed variables on purchase behaviour and declared variables on attitude to a brand. Following presentation of the main results and their managerial implications, the study concludes with a discussion of the limitations and opens up avenues for further research.</p>
<sec id="section20-2051570713487473">
<title>Main results and contributions</title>
<p>Four principal contributions should be noted, suggesting that the real, in-store decision-making process is less successfully simulated in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>First, the results indicate that the final principal measure (the purchase rate) is influenced by the type of laboratory store. Although the general structure of the purchase rate correlates for all brands presented, as in previous studies, the results must be treated with more caution for a specific brand in view of the size of the differences observed.</p>
<p>Second, as regards declared attitudes to the product, results in a VLS are not biased and are similar to results from a PLS. This may be either because the information used to answer the questions is provided in the same way by both environments or because the type of store visited has a low overall effect on memorized information for the type of product tested.</p>
<p>Third, significant differences exist in in-store behaviour. In a VLS, the purchase time is longer and visual recall of the products’ presence on the shelves is lower. A shopper in a virtual environment gives considerable priority to brand information and strongly limits exploration behaviour, even for information as important as the price payable.</p>
<p>Fourth, one individual feature, brand loyalty, has a significant influence on the differences induced by the VLS and could distort analysis of the aggregate results. Regular buyers of the tested brand are more likely to recognize and purchase their habitual product in a virtual environment. The effect of being a regular buyer of the brand, which was already an important segmentation criterion in a PLS, is amplified further in the virtual environment.</p>
<p>These results show that the purchaser’s decision-making process is structurally affected by the context of the store visit. The lessons learned from tests in a PLS are not therefore directly transposable to a VLS, and vice versa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-2051570713487473">
<title>Managerial implications</title>
<p>This study provides no additional answer to the question of the predictive validity of the results found in a VLS compared to a PLS, which is considered generally acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487473">Burke, 1996</xref>). This helps to explain a manufacturer’s decision to use a VLS instead of a PLS when testing a marketing initiative that influences the choices made in-store.</p>
<p>The choice of a type of laboratory store must depend on the level of development of the marketing initiative under examination (comparison of concepts or validation of potential) and the key results expected (attitude or behaviour), because the differences observed vary in scale depending on what is being measured (behaviour, purchase, attitude and perceptions). In pre-development process testing, when attitudinal measures are necessary to define a hierarchy of options consumers know little about, both methodologies give similar results. The advantages in terms of cost, and above all implementation, argue in favour of using a VLS. This is consistent with the recommendation of using virtual reality for other analytical study techniques such as conjoint analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051570713487473">Berneburg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2051570713487473">Treiber and Needel, 2000</xref>). But for more advanced product initiative testing, where the aim is to evaluate the purchase rate in a more realistic context to decide whether to continue the project, or for testing in-store operations such as merchandizing and promotion, the PLS is a better choice because it provides a more realistic setting and more accurate reproduction of purchasing routines.</p>
<p>The differences observed also depend on the role played by consumer experience in the purchase. The virtual environment appears to be ill-suited to studying purchasing behaviour regarding staple, frequently purchased products where loyalty and purchase habits play an important role. This is because the moderating effect of being a regular buyer of the brand indicates that the consumer processes less information in a virtual environment and uses memory more. The VLS might instead be better suited to product categories with low purchase frequency, which involve a more analytical purchasing process (drugs, durable or luxury goods, etc.).</p>
<p>Finally, the lesser role of price in the purchase process simulated in a VLS must be considered in light of the fact that the internet is used extensively for price comparison and best price searches. In the situation studied (everyday food shopping), price sensitivity thus appears to be lower.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-2051570713487473">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The results presented have several limitations. The first derives from the emphasis on internal validity, which results in lower external validity as a result of specific choices concerning the product (a staple consumer product on a mature market), its newness (a non-innovative product), the communication context (no special offers), retail channel (sale in a supermarket, self-service) and the status of the brand tested (the leading brand, very well-known). A second limitation concerns the bias introduced by the learning phase prior to the visit to the virtual store and by the presence of a researcher during the store visit. This learning should become less necessary as technological advances make navigation more intuitive and people become more accustomed to virtual online visits (already widely used in the real estate and tourism sectors) and online shopping. A third limitation concerns the current inability to present sensorial dimensions such as touch and smell in virtual representation that is confined to sight. This context relates primarily to the products themselves, for which the choice criteria can require input from the other senses to assess quality and freshness (in the case of fresh products, bodycare products, etc.). It can also be related to a mode of in-store presentation that may enhance the shopping experience or, on the contrary, merely highlight the objective information associated with a simplified choice process (such as prices in a hard discount store).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-2051570713487473">
<title>Research areas for exploration</title>
<p>Study of the purchasing process in a virtual environment offers many areas for research.</p>
<p>The first concerns examination of the effects of marketing initiatives that change the habitual context of a purchase, for example the launch of a new product or promotion campaign, which are important levers for self-service sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051570713487473">Breugelmans and Campo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2051570713487473">Inman et al., 2009</xref>). How does the shopper approach new information in a virtual environment where the visit is chiefly utilitarian?</p>
<p>A second avenue for research concerns comparison of the bias introduced by visiting a virtual environment online. Through face-to-face recruitment and interviews, a laboratory store offers good control of the respondent’s behaviour but is more costly because of the researcher’s physical presence. It would be interesting to study the bias created by non-controlled, internet-based recruitment and a remote virtual store visit; these align with a practice that is spreading because of its low cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051570713487473">Dahan and Srinivasan, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the influence of social, emotional and sensorial dimensions on the purchase process in a virtual environment merits a specific analysis in a theoretical and methodological framework that is yet to be defined. The social dimension (presence of several shoppers, with the possibility of interaction) could be introduced through virtual social environments such as <italic>Second Life</italic><sup>©</sup>.</p>
<p>A fourth area for exploration is the interaction between the context and decision-making process. This could be clarified by understanding how visual attention works and its role in assimilating and interpreting the information present in the environment. Could observation techniques, e.g. automated eye tracking, lead us to understanding of how the environment helps to shape the need fulfilled by a purchase act?</p>
<p>Lastly, this study is limited to understanding comparison of laboratory methods that aim to further the understanding of <italic>in-store</italic> decisions and purchasing behaviour. Yet purchasing behaviour for staple consumer products is changing rapidly, particularly given the growth of ‘drive-in’ channels that allow the consumer to order shopping online and collect it from a pick-up point without having to go to the store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051570713487473">Heitz et al., 2001</xref>). VLSs, with online data collection, are an appropriate solution to the specificity of online purchasing behaviour for e-commerce sites for selling consumer goods.</p>
