<p>To a large degree journal editors are bound by the manuscripts submitted to them. Researchers write about the projects and ideas that interest them and that they are committed to sharing with the field through peer-reviewed publications. In this “marketplace of ideas” certain topics may go overlooked in the pages of the journal – not because they are unimportant or unworthy of attention but because they are crowded out by scholarly attention to other topics no less vital or pressing. It is difficult, though certainly not impossible, to alter the breadth of journal coverage through mission statements and editorial policy, as well as changes to these elements, and like measures.</p>
<p>Another means to broaden coverage is to license and publish symposia on crucial topics that may not have received recent treatment in the journal. Our policy as Editors-in-Chief is that symposia should emanate from the interests of the readership, and that the articles contained within them must meet NVSQ standards for peer-review, just as the other articles published in the journal. In this issue of <italic>Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly</italic> we continue our tradition of publishing symposia on important topics not recently examined in the journal.</p>
<p>Guest Editor Jo Anne Schneider has assembled an excellent set of articles for the Symposium addressing “Faith Based Organizations in Context.” Most articles in the Symposium define FBOs as nonprofits founded by religious institutions with a primary function separate from worship and, thus, exclude congregations. In her Introduction to the Symposium, Schneider observes that the last special issue of NVSQ to deal with this topic appeared in 1997. She explains that because the relevant literature does not usually examine the larger religious context for faith-based nonprofits or the role of specific religions in FBO strategies, the Symposium focuses on the policy and religious contexts that influence FBO behavior, with the goal of illuminating relationships among governments, communities, and FBOs. Schneider provides a useful analysis of the history of U.S. church/state relationships, which helps to set the context of FBOs for the articles that follow.</p>
<p>The Symposium grew out of the <italic>Faith and Organizations Project</italic>, a national research/practice initiative organized by religious and FBO leaders focusing on the relationship between faith communities and their associated nonprofits in comparative perspective. Three articles emanate from the Project. Patricia A. Wittberg discusses FBO umbrella organizations, and Jill Witmer Sinha describes the combined impact of the policy and religious context on U.S. FBOs following the faith-based initiative of President Bush. Schneider treats religious support systems.</p>
<p>These articles have been supplemented to create a more significant and encompassing Symposium. In her article Ipek Göçmen extends the analysis of faith-based organizations beyond the United States to Europe. Göçmen’s comparative article explores how the important relationship between church and state influences the role of FBOs in particular national contexts. The Symposium also presents two research review essays by Wolfgang Bielefeld and William Suhs Cleveland, which deal with the major topics in the literature on FBOs. Bielefeld and Cleveland first describe the scope of recent nonprofit literature on FBOs in the United States, including definitions of FBOs, FBO typologies regarding the role of religious tradition in these organizations, and methodological tensions and issues. Their second research review article provides an overview of the literature comparing FBOs to secular providers and discusses the literature on the dynamics between government and FBOs.</p>
<p>Apart from the Symposium, this issue of NVSQ includes two additional articles. In “Hands in The Pockets of Mercurial Donors: NGO Response To Shifting Funding Priorities,” Khaldoun AbouAssi explores the NGO-donor relationship, particularly when donors revise funding priorities and partner NGOs try to adapt. Utilizing qualitative research to examine the decisions of four NGOs in response to shifts in donor funding, the analysis reveals variation in NGO responses to such shifts. Building on Albert O. Hirschman’s (1970) typology in <italic>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States</italic>, the article identifies four modes of NGOs’ response: exit, voice, loyalty, and, a newly proposed mode, adjustment.</p>
<p>Joanne Carman and Rebecca Nesbit address the question, “Founding New Nonprofit Organizations: Syndrome or Symptom?” Based on in-depth, qualitative interviews with 31 nonprofit organizations, they find that although these start-ups tend to meet our expectations of new nonprofits in some ways (small, with few staff members and small budgets), the extent to which they rely on volunteers and are connected to the community vary considerably. In addition, many founders had little experience volunteering or working in the nonprofit sector. Although the sample is limited, the findings have implications for the professional development of nonprofit staff, leaders, and volunteers through educational programs, and they shed new light on how we think about the founders of nonprofit organizations.</p>
