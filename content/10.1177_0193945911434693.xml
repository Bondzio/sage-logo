<p><bold><italic>The Midwest Nursing Research Society Advances Science to Improve Health</italic></bold></p>
<p>MNRS 36th Annual Research Conference</p>
<p>April 12-15, 2012</p>
<p>Hyatt Regency Dearborn</p>
<p>600 Town Center Drive</p>
<p>Dearborn, MI 48126-2793</p>
<p>Phone: 313-593-1234</p>
<p>We are grateful for the collaborative efforts of our host schools in Michigan whose faculty, students, and staff have worked closely with the MNRS Program Planning Committee to make this upcoming conference a huge success. These include Michigan State University, University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Eastern Michigan University, Grand Valley State University, Oakland University, Saginaw State University, and Western Michigan University.</p>
<p>Two distinguished speakers will present opening and closing keynote addresses at the 2012 MNRS Annual Research Conference consistent with our theme “Innovative Transition Care Models.” You will not want to miss the opportunities to hear these accomplished nurse colleagues.</p>
<p><bold>Jennie Chin Hansen, RN, MSN, FAAN</bold>, will present the opening keynote address titled “Health Care and Nursing: System Leadership Need and Opportunity” on Friday, April 13th, at 8:45 a.m. Ms. Hansen is CEO of the American Geriatrics Society, the leading professional association in geriatrics. She served as President of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) from 2008 to 2010 and was a member of the nursing faculties at two California state universities. She holds an appointment as Senior Fellow at the University of California, San Francisco’s Center for the Health Professions, and consults with various foundations. She transitioned to teaching in 2005 after nearly 25 years as Executive Director of On Lok, Inc., a nonprofit family of organizations providing integrated and comprehensive primary and long-term care community-based services in San Francisco. On Lok was the prototype for PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), which was signed into federal legislation in 1997, making this Medicare/Medicaid program available to all 50 states.</p>
<p>Ms. Hansen serves in various leadership roles that include Commissioner of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and Board Member of the National Academy of Social Insurance and of the Robert Wood Johnson Executive Nurse Fellows Program. She is also on the boards of Lumetra (California’s Quality Improvement Organization) and the California Regional Health Information Organization (CalRHIO). Ms. Hansen serves as a national juror for the Purpose Prize sponsored by Civic Ventures. She is a past President of the American Society on Aging.</p>
<p>Among Ms. Hansen’s awards are the 2005 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator’s Achievement Award, the 2002 Gerontological Society of America’s Maxwell Pollack Award for Productive Living, the Women’s Healthcare Executive Woman of the Year of Northern California in 2000, and the 1997 “Women Who Could Be President” Honoree from the League of Women Voters of San Francisco. She is a Fellow in the American Academy of Nursing. She has received several alumni awards from the University of California, San Francisco, and Boston College, including an honorary doctorate from Boston College in 2008.</p>
<p><bold>Donna L. Torrisi, MSN</bold>, will present the closing keynote address titled “Conquering Health Disparities in a Multidisciplinary Model” on Sunday, April 15th, at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Ms. Torrisi is the Executive Director of the Family Practice and Counseling Network (FPCN) in Philadelphia and was recognized for her groundbreaking work by the American Academy of Nursing, being named an AAN Edgerunner. In 1991, Ms. Torrisi cowrote a National Bureau of Primary Health Care/Health Resources Service Administration (HRSA) grant to provide health care to residents of public housing. She became the director of this project and opened a nurse-managed health center in the Abbottsford Public Housing Development in Philadelphia. The FPCN has since grown into a system of three nurse-run health centers located in or near public housing communities in Philadelphia. The FPCN brings care directly to public housing residents in a cost-effective manner through nurse-managed clinics comprising an interdisciplinary health team that has been specially trained to address residents’ needs. The clinics are based on a “one-stop shopping” model where patients can see a nurse practitioner, behavioral health therapist, podiatrist, optometrist, and dentist all on the same day. Prescriptions can be filled at the pharmacy or dispensary, and patients can be transported to and from the health center via the health center van. Centers are accessible by means of location, ease of appointment, and acceptance of all patients regardless of ability to pay, and by creating a warm, inviting, and friendly atmosphere. The primary care visit is charged on a sliding scale, based on federal poverty guidelines for patients who are uninsured, and lab work is included in that fee.</p>
<p>The FPCN has received multiple awards including the HRSA National Models That Work Award and the Smith Kline Beecham Community Impact Award. Ms. Torrisi received the Villanova University Leadership in Nursing Award, the University of Pennsylvania Lillian Brunner Sholstis Award for Excellence in Nursing Practice, the Pennsylvania Nurses Association Leadership Award for Innovative Practice, and the National Alliance for Resident Services in Affordable and Assisted Housing, Practitioner of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Ms. Torrisi was a key leader of efforts in the state of Pennsylvania that culminated in legislative change redefining primary care provider to include nurse practitioners. This gave nurse practitioners entrée into managed care as participating providers. She has published and lectured on the nurse-managed model, the art of negotiating with managed care organizations, and on integrating behavioral health and primary care. She is a founding member and the first chairperson of the National Nursing Centers Consortium, and has been a faculty member for the Institute for Health Improvement Depression Collaborative. Her book, “<italic>Community and Nurse Managed Health Centers, Getting Them Started and Keeping Them Going</italic>,” was published in May 2005. Donna is a 2005 graduate of the Robert Wood Johnson Executive Nurse Fellowship Program.</p>
<p><bold>Your Favorite Funding Panels Are Back!</bold> It will be well worth your while to stay through Sunday morning to hear updates and get advice from representatives of federal funding agencies and private foundations. Four private foundations that fund research will participate in one panel discussion scheduled for Sunday, April 15th, at 8:00 a.m. These foundations include the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the John Hartford Foundation, Aetna, and the American Hospital Association.</p>
<p>Four federal agencies will participate in a second panel discussion on Sunday, April 15th, at 9:30 a.m. These agencies include the National Institute for Nursing Research (NINR), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Veterans’ Administration Office of Research and Development (VA R&amp;D), and the Tri-Service Nursing Research Program (TSNRP). Getting updates and tips for success from these funding sources will be essential to the continued success of your research programs.</p>

<title>The FUNdraiser</title>
<p>Last month’s issue described the Foundation’s activities planned for the MNRS 2012 Conference, including our new plan for the FUNdraiser. We have been asked, “What is the purpose of the Talent Show/FUNdraiser anyway?” First and foremost, its purpose is to raise money to fund the research grants (Dissertation and Seed Grants) awarded by MNRS. To continue to award the same number of grants each year, the Foundation must raise at least US$22,500. MNRS provides the other US$22,500 from income from dues and the Annual Conference. If the Foundation does not raise its share of the funds needed for the grants program through activities and donations, some grants will no longer be available.</p>
<p>Each year, we strive to develop an activity that will allow attendees to have fun while they are supporting the grants program, the second purpose of the FUNdraiser. Many have attended and enjoyed the evenings, but we do receive some inquiries about the format of this event. Two common inquiries are:</p>
<list id="list1-0193945911434693" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>QUESTION 1</italic>: Why don’t we get a full dinner for our US$50 ticket?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>RESPONSE:</italic> If a full dinner was served, the hotel would charge more than the price of the ticket to provide it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>QUESTION 2</italic>: Why don’t we serve better food?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>RESPONSE</italic>: Even appetizers are very expensive when provided by the hotel, and if the event is held in the hotel, they must provide the food. Most of us are not aware that <italic>one</italic> single piece of cheese with a cracker can cost more than US$4.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>So . . . back to the purpose of this event. The FUNdraiser is designed to raise funds, and we cannot make any money for grants if we spend too much on the event. However, we do hope to host a fun evening for all and welcome all ideas for better ways to raise funds to support the important grants that facilitate our members’ research programs and careers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0193945911434693">
<title>Costs of Fund-Raising</title>
<p>This past year, we learned of a new federal law that requires all nonprofit organizations that solicit funds to register in each state in which they seek donations. This means that we must comply with this law and register in all 13 states in the MNRS region. Naturally, there is considerable paperwork involved that we must pay to have filed each year, costing about US$2,000. While the Foundation is already working hard to raise the needed funds to provide its share of the costs of awarding grants, this adds to the amount we need to raise to achieve our bottom line. This law makes it even more important for each member to give as much as she or he can to support nursing science in the Midwest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945911434693">
<title>Manuscript and Grant Reviewer Fund-Raiser</title>
<p>In a previous issue, we described this new program in which reviewers agree to donate their fees for one review per year to the Foundation. Volunteers were asked to complete a form so that this information could be made available to all via a roster in our website. Implementation has been considerably delayed due to the transition in management companies and the revisions in the website. Now you can access the form to volunteer to provide this annual donation, if requested to do a review. We need to have reviewers with diverse backgrounds and experience. <bold>Please, all seasoned researchers, writers, and editors, submit your form now</bold>.</p>
<p>Because this roster will list each person’s areas of expertise, it will be very helpful to those seeking a consultant, mentor, or a collaborator. Several of the nursing specialty organizations have indicated an interest in using such a tool to assist their members in finding researchers to assist with their projects. Thus, it can facilitate collaboration between nurses in the clinical settings and those in academic settings.</p>

<title>Communication With the Foundation’s Board of Trustees</title>
<p>If you are not able to attend the 2012 Conference, the President and the Trustees welcome your emails and phone calls to discuss our programs, have questions answered, and to share your suggestions and advice. At the Conference, members of the Board of Trustees will be present in the booth in the Exhibit Hall and near the Registration Desk. We look forward to your input. See you in Dearborn!</p>
