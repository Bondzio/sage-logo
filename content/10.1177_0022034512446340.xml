<abstract>
<p>This study compared the jaw-muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity during sleep in patients with craniofacial pain (n = 63) or no painful conditions (n = 52) and between patients with tension-type headache (TTH: n = 30) and healthy control individuals (n = 30). All participants used a portable single-channel EMG device (Medotech A/S) for four nights. There was no significant difference in EMG activity between craniofacial pain (24.5 ± 17.9 events/hr) and no painful conditions (19.7 ± 14.5), or between TTH (20.8 ± 15.0) and healthy control individuals (15.2 ± 11.6, p &gt;.050). There were positive correlations between EMG activity and number of painful muscles (r = 0.188; p = 0.044), characteristic pain intensity (r = 0.187; p = 0.046), McGill Pain Questionnaire (r = 0.251; p = 0.008), and depression scores (r = 0.291; p = 0.002). Patients with painful conditions had significantly higher night-to-night variability compared with pain-free individuals (p &lt; 0.050). This short-term observational study suggests that there are no major differences between patients with different craniofacial pain conditions and pain-free individuals in terms of jaw-muscle EMG activity recorded with a single-channel EMG device during sleep. However, some associations may exist between the level of EMG activity and various parameters of craniofacial pain. Longitudinal studies are warranted to further explore the relationship between sleep bruxism and craniofacial pain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and headache are frequent craniofacial pain conditions in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512446340">LeResche, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512446340">Jensen and Stovner, 2008</xref>). Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common primary headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512446340">Scher <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Sleep bruxism (SB) has been considered to be a risk factor for both TMD and TTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512446340">Bailey, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512446340">Baba <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512446340">Rossetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034512446340">Vendrame <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and is defined as a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by grinding/clenching of the teeth during sleep and is associated with excessive arousal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512446340">AASM, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Portable single-channel electromyograhic (EMG) recordings have been used to measure SB activity, because this method facilitates multiple-night recording in participants’ homes at relatively low costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512446340">Rugh and Solberg, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512446340">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512446340">Pierce and Gale, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512446340">Gallo <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). To understand SB and its potential consequences on oral function and health, a better description of jaw-muscle activity in different craniofacial pain conditions will be needed. Some studies reported the characteristics of jaw-muscle EMG activity in individuals with SB and TMD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512446340">Camparis <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022034512446340">van Selms <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, the relationship between SB and TMD/TTH is still controversial and remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512446340">Svensson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034512446340">Vendrame et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512446340">Manfredini and Lobbezoo, 2010</xref>). Further, some researchers have reported a substantial night-to-night variability of SB activity during polysomnography (PSG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512446340">Lavigne <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022034512446340">Van Der Zaag <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Thus, repeated (multiple nights) recordings of jaw-muscle activity in both painful conditions and healthy control individuals are necessary to assess the dynamics of SB activity.</p>
<p>The main aim of this short-term observational study was to compare the jaw-muscle EMG activity during sleep between patients with or without painful TMD or TTH and in healthy control individuals. We also aimed to explore the correlation between EMG activity and clinical parameters related to physical status, quality of pain, and psychological status. Finally, we tested the night-to-night variability of EMG activity during sleep between the different craniofacial pain conditions.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512446340">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>In total, 115 individuals—39 men (mean age ± SD: 36.8 ± 14.0 yrs) and 76 women (32.8 ± 10.2 yrs)—participated in this study. All participants were generally healthy and more than 18 yrs old. Exclusion criteria were: current illness; history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders; sleep disorders (<italic>e.g</italic>., snoring, sleep apnea, and periodic limb movement); use of prescription medicine or drugs; smoking, alcohol abuse, and addiction to coffee; electrode gel allergy; simultaneous participation in another trial with medicine or in trials of medical devices; and user of pacemaker. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
<p>We recruited the following types of participants: 30 healthy individuals (16 men, 25.3 ± 4.1 yrs; and 14 women, 27.2 ± 3.6 yrs) who were among students and staff at Aarhus University, Denmark; 55 self-reported SB individuals (16 men, 46.4 ± 14.6 yrs; and 39 women, 36.0 ± 11.5 yrs) who responded to flyers and newspaper advertisement and from patients at Aarhus University, Denmark; and 30 TTH patients (7 men, 41.1 ± 7.4 yrs; and 23 women, 31.0 ± 9.0 yrs) from the Danish Headache Center, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark.</p>
<p>All healthy participants were without TMD in accordance with the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512446340">Dworkin and LeResche, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, we examined healthy individuals for clinical signs or symptoms related to SB: (1) self-report or report by a bed partner of tooth-grinding or clenching habits during sleep; (2) jaw-muscle fatigue/pain upon awakening; (3) masseter muscle hypertrophy on voluntary contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512446340">Lavigne <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>); (4) moderate to severe hyperkeratosis of cheeks/lips/tongue; (5) advanced tooth wear (≥ grade 1c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512446340">Lobbezoo and Naeije, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022034512446340">Wetselaar <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>); (6) loss of cuspid protection; and (7) frequent non-iatrogenic/non-material-related fractures and failures of teeth/restorations/implants. No healthy individual reported (1) or (2), nor did any of them meet the other criteria. Self-reported SB individuals answered “yes” to RDC/TMD questionnaire 15c, which is about self-awareness of SB (“Have you been told, or do you notice that you grind your teeth or clench your jaw while sleeping at night?”).</p>
<p>TTH patients were diagnosed as having frequent or chronic TTH, according to the diagnostic criteria of the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512446340">Headache Classification, 2004</xref>), using headache diaries in addition to the RDC/TMD examination and questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512446340">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>On the first day, all participants were asked to complete a Danish translation of the RDC/TMD questionnaire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rdc-tmdinternational.org">http://www.rdc-tmdinternational.org</ext-link>) and a Danish version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512446340">Drewes <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). The RDC/TMD clinical examination was performed by three calibrated examiners (WY, EC, PS). Prior to the study, training and calibration sessions had been performed with the RDC/TMD clinical examination and with PS as the ‘gold standard’ examiner. Although no formal calculation of inter-examiner reliability was provided, previous studies have shown that calibration and re-calibration provide acceptable to excellent inter-examiner reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512446340">List <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Each participant was examined by one examiner. Six self-reported SB participants did not complete the MPQ. All participants used a portable EMG device (GrindCare3™, Medotech A/S, Herlev, Denmark) during sleep for at least 4 nights during 1 wk to measure jaw-muscle activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512446340">
<title>EMG Recordings</title>
<p>The GrindCare3™ has a single-electrode assembly, with three electrode contacts. The electrode was placed at the anterior temporalis muscle, which generally will provide the same information as EMG recordings from the masseter muscle during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512446340">Koyano <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The EMG activity was amplified (x 800) and filtered (250 Hz-610 Hz) in the device and further analyzed for events of EMG activity, according to the Signal Recognition Algorithm described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512446340">Jadidi <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref>. The algorithm is based on a Fast Fourier Transformation analysis and threshold comparison. To determine the individual parameters, the following set-up procedure was performed every night: Participants were asked to relax their jaw muscles for 10 sec. Then they made a grimace for 10 sec, then clenched their teeth around 60% of the maximum voluntary contraction for 10 sec. All participants received careful instruction and training by the examiners in the use of EMG device. The algorithm counts an event when the EMG activity exceeds the signal level at rest, plus 20% of the maximum EMG level during the 60% contraction. The total number of EMG events, the number of EMG events <italic>per</italic> hour, and the number of measurement hours were registered. After 1 wk of measurement had finished, the data were transferred and saved in a PC equipped with commercial software (GrindCare Manager, Medotech A/S, Herlev, Denmark).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512446340">
<title>Clinical Parameters</title>
<p>Four variables from the RDC/TMD questionnaire and clinical examination—maximum pain-free jaw opening, number of painful muscles (0-20), characteristic pain intensity (CPI: 0-100) and depression score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512446340">Dworkin <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>)—were selected as secondary outcome clinical parameters. The MPQ was also used to assess the sensory, affective, evaluative, and miscellaneous dimensions of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512446340">Melzack, 1975</xref>). The total pain rating index (PRI) was used in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512446340">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All participants were divided into ‘with’ and ‘without’ craniofacial pain (painful TMD or TTH) groups according to the RDC/TMD and IHCD-II criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512446340">Fig. 1A</xref>). Those with painful TMD were diagnosed as having myofascial pain (RDC/TMD group 1ab) or arthralgia (RDC/TMD group 3a). Individuals “without TMD” could have a diagnosis of disc displacement (RDC/TMD group 2abc; without any co-occurrence of painful RDC/TMD diagnoses) or osteoarthrosis (RDC/TMD group 3c). The two groups (with or without craniofacial pain) were divided into subgroups with or without self-reported SB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512446340">Fig. 1B</xref>). Then, we compared the EMG data in each group to see the influence of craniofacial pain or self-reported SB on EMG activity. Further, we compared EMG activity between TTH and healthy individuals. Then, we divided TTH subjects into subgroups with or without self-reported SB and compared the EMG activity between groups. The coefficient of variation from the multiple night recordings (CV: SD/mean) was calculated for all individuals in each group to examine the night-to-night variability in EMG activity.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022034512446340">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). We used unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests to analyze EMG data and CV between groups with and without craniofacial pain. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effects of craniofacial pain and self-reported SB on EMG activity and CV. When appropriate, <italic>post hoc</italic> tests were performed with Tukey tests (with correction for multiple comparisons). We also used unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests to analyze EMG activity and CV between TTH and healthy individuals and between subgroups of TTH with and without self-reported SB. Spearman correlation tests were used to test the association between EMG activity and clinical parameters. The level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.050.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding in this study was the lack of significant differences in EMG activity during sleep between patients with craniofacial pain conditions (painful TMD, TTH) and pain-free individuals. In a previous PSG study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512446340">Rossetti <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> reported that rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) during sleep was weakly associated with myofascial pain (n = 60). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022034512446340">van Selms <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref>, using an ambulatory EMG device, reported no relationship between masticatory muscle activity during sleep and muscle pain (n = 4). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512446340">Rompre <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> noted in their PSG study that participants with low frequencies of SB were more likely to report craniofacial pain than those with more frequent SB. In the present study, there was no significant difference in EMG activity between patients with painful conditions and pain-free participants. However, there was a significant correlation between EMG activity and CPI, and painful TMD and TTH patients had higher CV compared with pain-free participants. Perhaps certain types or characteristics of muscle activities (intensity, duration, frequency, direction of forces) may be associated with craniofacial pain conditions and increased variability. The causal relationship between SB and painful conditions is still a matter of discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512446340">Svensson <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512446340">Manfredini and Lobbezoo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512446340">Svensson and Lavigne, 2012</xref>), and the present study design does not allow for any definitive conclusions on the causal relationships between SB and craniofacial pain. Another important result was that EMG activity during sleep was strongly influenced by self-reports of SB in the entire study group, but not specifically in TTH patients. We suggest that TTH could reduce the reliability of self-awareness of SB. The reliability of self-reports of SB is generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512446340">Koyano <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and may have influenced our findings. Further research would be needed to reveal the extent to which painful conditions affect self-reports of SB.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512446340">Lavigne <italic>et al</italic>. (2001)</xref> reported that the CV was 25.3% for the number of EMG episodes <italic>per</italic> hour of sleep in individuals with SB, based on PSG recordings. Our study showed higher CV in all groups compared with previous data. This difference could be due to the different way of measurement and analyses, but strongly indicates that there is a significant and substantial night-to-night variability in EMG recordings which needs to be taken into consideration when SB is evaluated.</p>
<p>In their review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512446340">Manfredini and Lobbezoo (2009)</xref> concluded that there was no strong evidence to relate SB with psychosocial factors; however, the present findings suggested weak, but significant, correlations between EMG activity and depression and MPQ scores. For further exploration of the relationships between psychosocial function and SB, longitudinal study designs will be needed with repeated assessments.</p>
<p>Some methodological issues need to be addressed. The classification of healthy participants was based on the absence of self-reported SB and potential consequences of SB, such as attrition and hypertrophic masseter muscles. Although attrition can be reliably assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512446340">Lobbezoo and Naeije, 2001</xref>), the relationship between attrition and SB remains weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512446340">Abe <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). By definition, only PSG with audio-video recordings can be used to establish a “true” diagnosis of SB, leaving self-reports and clinical findings “as proxies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512446340">Svensson and Lavigne, 2012</xref>). Future studies need to test the validity of such proxies, but so far no published information on sensitivity and specificity is available for self-reported measures and clinical examination. Single-channel EMG devices may have the advantage of repeated night recordings but are sensitive to participant compliance; for example, the set-up procedure for EMG recordings requires relaxation and clenching, which cannot be controlled as in a PSG study. Furthermore, EMG electrode placement may vary between repeated recordings, although no significant difference can be observed in maximal EMG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512446340">Arima <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In the present study, all participants were carefully instructed and trained in the use of the ambulatory EMG device for 1 wk, but, because of technical problems (<italic>e.g</italic>., lost electrodes) or compliance issues (participants forgot or could not use the EMG device), only four nights of recordings were obtained from all participants. Nevertheless, this is sufficient to obtain an estimate of the night-to-night variation, which was considerable. Future studies may need to have at least seven nights’ recordings to establish a proper baseline before intervention is started.</p>
<p>Within the limitations of this short-term observational study, there are no major differences between patients with different craniofacial pain conditions and pain-free individuals in jaw-muscle EMG activity recorded with a single-channel EMG device during sleep. However, some associations may exist between the level of EMG activity and various parameters of craniofacial pain. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to enhance the understanding of SB and painful conditions.</p>
