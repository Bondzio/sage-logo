<p>This is a simply excellent collection of feminist essays written in a refreshingly conversational style, which is, at one and the same time, reflexive and reflective and thus clearly well theorized. I found many of the essays so easy to read that it was more like reading a novel or journalistic accounts than a heavily theorized academic albeit feminist tome. The cover of the book is itself an intriguing and enticing offer, providing exactly the right example of ‘transatlantic conversations’. It is a picture of Michelle Obama standing with her arm around the Queen’s back and gazing down into her eyes, which are hidden from our view. To me it conveys the easy confidence of a tall Black American ‘poppy’ contrasted with the quiet controlled English matriarch: the essence of transatlantic feminist conversations? I was certainly lured into wanting to read this book quickly and it fulfilled its promise of providing a clear and lucid account of contemporary feminist thought.</p>
<p>The editors are extremely well-known feminist sociologists and as co-editor and previous co-editor of the <italic>European Journal of Women’s Studies</italic> are able to apply theories, like the air they breathe. Their aim in this volume, as they explain at the outset of their introduction, is to consider whether there are ways of talking and thinking about ‘European feminist scholarship’ which are distinctive from US feminist scholarship. They acknowledge the difficulty and complexity of the task, given the enormous impact that US texts had on the development of women’s and gender studies, becoming ‘undisputed classics’ alongside some British texts which questioned the form and nature of the disciplines within the academy. Whilst it is clear that the editors see themselves as ‘second-wave feminists’, they do not use the term here, but allude to it throughout their consideration of the developments of academic feminist theories, contrasting the US with Europe. And they also acknowledge the limitations of only considering the so-called ‘global north’, with its specific exclusionary practices with regard to the ‘global south’ despite the complexities of contrasting the US and Europe.</p>
<p>As a feminist sociologist of education embarking upon interviews for my collective reflective biography of second-wave feminism in the academy especially in the social sciences and education, when I heard of this book I was eager to read it to ensure that my themes remained relevant to my developing situated feminist knowledge. One of the contributors to Part 2 which is on ‘Activism: inside and outside the Academy’, Dr Kelly Coate, sent me a copy of her chapter to elaborate upon her interview with me. Her chapter, entitled ‘Writing in the dark: Reflections on becoming a feminist’, addressed precisely the question of whether or not she was of a distinctive generation or ‘wave’ from that of the ‘founding academic mothers’, whether US or in her case UK. Interestingly Kelly whilst American by birth and upbringing did not encounter feminism until she moved to the UK after graduation. She therefore addresses questions of time and space for reading and reviewing how she came to her peculiarly British brand of feminism through immersion first in academic administration, later to become a doctoral student, and then able to reflect upon this only when she left the UK for Ireland. And this is precisely the question that the editors asked their contributors to address in their autobiographical essays.</p>
<p>What has been the impact of US feminist theory on the intellectual and situated practices of feminists on both sides of the Atlantic? They have carefully chosen contributors from across the generations and geographical as well as disciplinary locations to consider these complexities through personal reflections, ‘intellectual biographies’ or journeys into and through feminism. In keeping with this ambition, both editors provide what they call a narrative about their own longstanding conversations about feminism and its travels, hence the title.</p>
<p>Mary, a longstanding friend whom I had also questioned for my book, provides her quintessentially culturally crisp resume of her travels into feminism from her white middle-class British family-household, with all its ‘behind closed doors’ forms of patriarchal control and constraint. She addresses the contradictions between traditional male public power and the rise of female public power, through the prism of Margaret Thatcher. As a profoundly anti-feminist woman, as Mary argues, Thatcher opened up the possibilities of reconsidering the roots of postwar feminism through the challenges of women’s liberation and the wider ‘cultural horizon of the US’. The personal did indeed become political, a second-wave feminist slogan, through engagement with the then Conservative politics in the UK.</p>
<p>Kathy Davis provides an interesting contrast to Mary in that she came of age as a feminist in the US, through her college education, but this immediately led her to Europe on a scholarship to Germany to study. Her initial introduction however was to Marxist rather than feminist politics, and it was she who became heavily involved in initiating women’s groups. However, she quickly found that the then popular consciousness-raising groups of early second-wave feminism in the US and UK did not travel easily to a more intellectually rigorous student population in Germany. She also asserts that the linguistic imperialism of American English has led to a kind of cultural imperialism within feminism, especially that from the US and it has meant that European feminists have taken up US feminist theories, more than vice versa. She neatly argues that ‘topics and debates have emerged around the edges of this US feminist canon, which have often rearticulated US feminist concerns in specifically European ways’: from race and racism to issues around welfare, care and poverty (p. 7). Like Mary, she too argues for transnational dialogue.</p>
<p>Kathy and Mary organize the contributory essays into three overlapping parts: one on <italic>becoming a feminist in a transatlantic context</italic> to consider the diversity of how feminist practices emerged; a second is about, as already noted, forms of <italic>activism within and outside the academy</italic> and the third is on <italic>theoretical engagements</italic>. Each part contains short dialogues or conversations, so that there are another four chapters in Part 1; six in part 2 of which Kelly Coate’s is one; and another six on theoretical engagements. With 16 substantive essays, in addition to the introduction, I shall not be able to do justice in this review to the rich diversity of the offerings all illustrating the complexities of the development of digressions from the ‘feminist canon’, US-style. All the essays pose fascinating challenges about transatlantic feminist theories and thought, drawing on a diversity of countries and fields.</p>
<p>Those with particular resonance for my own theoretical engagement and consideration of the particular emergence of academic feminism in education and higher education especially are also women whom I have interviewed and questioned about their development of women’s studies or feminist critiques of the disciplines within the humanities and social science. Ann Phoenix, yet another of my interviewees, has written a particularly engaging and typically trenchant account of how she, as a black British feminist, has engaged in transatlantic conversations, developing a revised narrative from the vantage point of the 21st century. She wants to ensure that the conflicts and contradictions between and amongst black and other feminists are not written out of the story, however painful and difficult they may have been. She especially mentions how ‘intersectionality’ as a theory has now become a ‘buzzword’ but was not commonplace when she started out in the late 1970s, although she was clearly aware of her blackness, and race, as much as her class and gender. She carefully and painstakingly elaborates upon how these concepts influenced both activism and developing theories within the academy, through her various transatlantic conversations and especially consciousness-raising groups towards that end of developing a theoretical framing for this work. She pleads for a continuation of these debates for ensuring a rich flavour to the situated feminist theoretical developments across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Similarly, Gabriele Griffin, yet another interviewee of mine, in her contribution to the section on theoretical engagements considers race, ethnicity and gender in reading women’s writing. Whilst her feminist theories have been developed through her academic feminist writing courses in the UK, she mentions her patriarchal origins being from a peculiar conjuncture of displaced parents from East Germany, and their joint desire to recreate families that they had never fully had. She argues that anti-patriarchalism was at its height in the 1970s when she began to emerge as a feminist, but that it was based on a particular white conception, rather than one rooted in race and ethnicity. In other words, she argues that ‘we did not notice that these wronged women were all white’ (p. 158) and goes on to argue for a much more rigorously situated feminist thought, rooted in the ethnic and racial contexts of both the US and UK and taking account of the rapidly changing sociopolitical context.</p>
<p>These essays are good exemplars of the richness of the writing and the contributions from across Europe and from American ‘ex-pats’ in Europe or the UK. In the epilogue Kathy and Mary argue that ‘the unity of difference’ versus ‘the reality of difference’ come together in shared traditions and a common humanity – what is often forgotten in the rush to research. They argue for sustaining the transatlantic dialogue however difficult and challenging it may be around the paradoxes of gender equality in a new 21st-century age of austerity. For me, the promise of women’s liberation has morphed into an individualized neoliberal academy with all the obstacles to feminist creativity and knowledge that we struggled so hard against in feminism’s long journey. This book provides an excellent route map and travel guide.</p>
