<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although the laparoscopic procedure significantly benefits patients in terms of decreased recovery times and improved outcomes, it contributes to mental fatigue and musculoskeletal problems among surgeons. The stress surgeons experience beyond that which they experience during open surgery is a finding that emerged in the early years of the laparoscopic revolution and continues to develop today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812451046">Berguer, Smith, &amp; Chung, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812451046">Kant, de Jong, van Rijssen-Moll, &amp; Borm, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers are working to improve occupational conditions for surgeons, specifically reducing the musculoskeletal disorder risk factors associated with the laparoscopic technique. These risk factors include static muscle loading, awkward body posture and technique, handling frequency and repetitive handling, and working duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812451046">Mital, 1997</xref>). Ergonomic research, fundamental principles, and posture analyses of surgeons’ axial skeletal and upper extremity movements have led to multiple interventions to mediate these risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812451046">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>). Examples of these interventions include improving the surgeon–instrument interface; ensuring imaging and equipment adjustability; and introducing robotics, exoskeletal support, and integrated hand controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812451046">Patkin &amp; Isabel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812451046">Vereczkel, Bubb, &amp; Feussner, 2003</xref>). Operating room checklists and detailed guidelines have been established to help hospitals address specific concerns regarding table height, monitor placement, instrument design, and foot pedal use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451046">Patkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812451046">Wauben, van Veelen, Gossot, &amp; Goossens, 2006</xref>). Additional research targets cognitive components including teamwork and leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812451046">Catchpole, Mishra, Handa, &amp; McCulloch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812451046">Parker, Yule, Flin, &amp; McKinley, 2010</xref>). Although there are many interventions and applications, there is a gap in knowledge regarding a surgeon’s individual assessment of the operating room, an assessment that, in turn, would prompt any of the aforementioned interventions.</p>
<p>This study investigated the prevalence of self-reported surgeon injury/illness symptoms and evaluated the correlation between these symptoms and the ergonomics of the operating room. This research investigated the relevance of awareness, knowledge, and utilization of ergonomic principles in the operating room. The purpose of this brief report is to describe ergonomic principles in the operating room, specific to laparoscopic surgery and surgeon injury/illness symptoms.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0018720812451046">
<title>Study Design and Population</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study recruited laparoscopic surgeons from the Central Texas area. Brazos County and the surrounding 100-mile radius were chosen because they satisfied criteria such as proximity to the research team, distribution of both rural- and urban-designated counties, and an adequate sample size representation of Texas general surgeons. To qualify for inclusion, surgeons had to have annually performed more than 15% of their surgeries laparoscopically. This criterion excludes those surgeons whose surgical techniques do not reflect the risk factors of interest to the research team. Following approval by the Texas A&amp;M University Institutional Review Board Human Subjects’ Protection Program, the research team recruited participants and obtained informed consent from each participant. Response was voluntary, and administration techniques included hand delivery at the surgical centers, in-person interviews, and mail surveys. Surgeons had the option of returning the surveys via mail or researcher pick-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720812451046">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>A questionnaire was developed for the purposes of this study with sections based in part on the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Task Force on Ergonomics Questionnaire and the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ). The SAGES questionnaire on ergonomic problems associated with laparoscopic surgery was initially distributed at the Annual Scientific Session in 1997 and has been used in similar studies ever since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451046">Berguer, 1998</xref>). The SAQ was derived from the Flights Management Attitudes Questionnaire, a popular human factors tool adapted for health care–related use by researchers at Johns Hopkins University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451046">Sexton et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Questions structured after the SAGES questionnaire addressed self-reported symptoms of injury/illness experienced during or immediately following performing laparoscopy. These included physical symptoms (neck pain, neck stiffness, shoulder/arm pain, shoulder/arm stiffness, hand/wrist pain, hand/wrist stiffness, hand/wrist numbness, back pain, back stiffness, leg pain, leg stiffness) and indicators of surgeon fatigue (headache, mental fatigue, irritability). Symptoms of injury/illness were reported based on frequency, with the options <italic>never, occasionally</italic>, or <italic>frequently</italic>. In addition, in the first section of the distributed questionnaire, there were 11 questions structured after the SAQ that pertained to surgeons’ perceptions of the safety, function, and ergonomics of the operating room. Surgeons were asked to indicate their level of agreement with different statements, based on a 5-point Likert-type scale with the following anchors: <italic>strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree</italic>, and <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018720812451046">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Collected survey data were analyzed using the data analysis and statistical software Stata/IC 11.0 (Stata, College Station, Texas). Categorical data analysis was conducted using Fisher’s exact test and exact logistic regression. Based on an examination of data prior to analysis, there were no outliers or missing observations. Continuous data were reported as mean ± standard deviation or median with range. The significance level for all analyses was <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Respondents were a convenience sample of 61 surgeons. Respondents included general surgeons (32), bariatric specialists (6), obstetricians/gynecologists (21), 1 gastroenterologist, and 1 urologist. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812451046">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Sixty-one laparoscopic surgeons (100%) reported experiencing at least 1 injury/illness symptom as a result of performing laparoscopic surgery. The average number of self-reported symptomatic areas was 8.4. The most prevalent injury/illness symptoms reported as <italic>frequently</italic> were neck stiffness (26%), back stiffness (26%), and back pain (23%). Symptoms most reported as <italic>occasionally</italic> included neck stiffness (66%), irritability (64%), back pain (64%), and back stiffness (61%). Symptoms most frequently reported as <italic>never</italic> included leg stiffness (66%), hand/wrist numbness (64%), and leg pain (62%). The most prevalent symptoms included neck stiffness, back stiffness, back pain, neck pain, and irritability.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Surgeons responded to questions addressing safety, ergonomics, and fatigue in the operating room, using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The responses were analyzed in three ways. The first analysis compared all five responses, the second collapsed categories and analyzed <italic>agree</italic> versus <italic>disagree</italic>, and the third analyzed <italic>undecided</italic> versus any other response. Tabulation of response frequencies for questions of surgeon perception revealed a pattern between a surgeon response of <italic>undecided</italic> and the likelihood of injury/illness symptoms. Responses were collapsed into <italic>undecided</italic> and <italic>decided</italic>, with <italic>decided</italic> referring to any answer other than <italic>undecided</italic>. This analysis is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812451046">Table 2</xref>. Regarding agreement with the statement “The equipment and overall layout of my operating room is designed for and encourages surgeon comfort,” respondents who were decided in their answer were less likely to experience neck pain (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.92]), shoulder/arm pain (OR = 0.07, 95% CI [0.00, 0.30]), and shoulder/arm stiffness (OR = 0.13, 95% CI [0.02, 0.54]). Regarding agreement with the statement “The equipment and overall layout of my operating room reduces my occupational risk of cumulative injury,” respondents who were decided in the answer were less likely to experience shoulder/arm pain (OR = 0.06, 95% CI [0.00, 0.49]), shoulder/arm stiffness (OR = 0.07, 95% CI [0.00, 0.50]), and headaches (OR = 0.09, 95% CI [0.00, 0.47]). In addition, there was an association between less shoulder/arm pain and respondents who were able to assess fatigue and the ergonomic conditions of their operating rooms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Comparisons drawn from previous studies and labor statistics suggest that the demographics of the study population are representative of general surgeons nationwide based on age, gender, height, and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451046">Park, Lee, Seagull, Meenaghan, &amp; Dexter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812451046">Wauben et al., 2006</xref>). Respondent self-reported injury/illness symptoms were higher than expected based on previous use of the SAGES questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451046">Berguer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451046">Berguer, Forkey, &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>). In this study, 100% of respondents reported at least one injury/illness symptom perceived to be a result of performing laparoscopic surgery. This is similar to a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451046">Park et al. (2010)</xref> that found 86.9% of injuries related to laparoscopic performance, a noted disparity from other recent surveys suggesting that 40% to 60% of surgeons performing minimally invasive surgery experience occupational injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451046">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451046">Reyes, Tang, &amp; Cuschieri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812451046">van Veelen, Nederlof, Goossens, Schot, &amp; Jakimowicz, 2003</xref>). Injury/illness symptom results support the theory that surgeons are suffering increased levels of symptoms as a result of performing laparoscopic surgery, causing an impending epidemic. More research should be conducted to determine if these results represent varying survey tools, a trend over time, or changes in technique and practice.</p>
<p>Based on previous ergonomic interventions and knowledge concerning the benefits of equipment adjustment, an inverse relationship was expected between the frequency of equipment adjustments and the frequency of injury/illness symptoms. This expectation was found only with respondents who made frequent adjustments to the monitor for height, as they were less likely to experience neck pain. These observations suggest that more research is necessary in determining the role that equipment adjustment plays in reducing injury/illness symptoms, specifically considering multiple components interacting upon each other.</p>
<p>After collapsing assessment observations into the <italic>undecided</italic> and <italic>decided</italic> categories, an inverse association between decided statements and symptoms was revealed. The most striking findings of the study were that respondents who were able to assess their operating room conditions, regardless of the response, were less likely to experience injury/illness symptoms than respondents who were undecided about their operating room conditions. The results imply that, in comparison with respondents who are undecided, those who are aware of the risks of their operating rooms are protected against experiencing injury/illness symptoms. The data suggest that it may not be surgeon perception but rather surgeon awareness that predicts injury/illness. Thus, educational awareness for surgeons could be useful in preventing injury/illness.</p>
<p>The sample size of the study population was relatively small. Surgeons’ busy schedules, a lack of resources, and difficulty contacting surgeons posed considerable logistic challenges. Furthermore, the survey is a subjective tool used to assess self-reported surgeon injury/illness symptoms and has not been validated. There is traditionally an underreporting of symptoms in the surgical community, and this respondent bias may have affected the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451046">Reyes et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the survey did not address predictors of injury.</p>
<p>Surveying surgeons across Central Texas has created awareness of the public health concern that laparoscopic surgeons are at increased risk of occupational cumulative trauma injury, and its findings warrant interventions to mitigate occupational risk. This study determined that awareness, knowledge, and utilization of ergonomic principles are associated with surgeon’s risk of injury/illness symptoms during laparoscopic surgery. Applied research should focus on strengthening surgeons’ assessment skills to prevent the development of musculoskeletal disorders associated with laparoscopy.</p>
