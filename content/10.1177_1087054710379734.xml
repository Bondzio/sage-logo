<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold> : Inattention is typically associated with ADHD, but less research has been done to examine the correlates of self-reported inattention in youth in a community sample. <bold>Method</bold>: Associations among self-reported inattention, parent-reported inattention, and self-reported psychopathology in children aged 10 to 11 years are examined. Self-reported inattention is also examined as a predictor of outcomes in peer relationships and victimization at ages 10 and 11 and in peer relationships at ages 14 and 15. <bold>Results</bold>: Children’s self-reports of inattention correlate with parental reports and are associated with self-reports of hyperactivity-impulsivity, depression, anxiety, and conduct problems. Participants in the high-inattention group are at greater risk for victimization and poor peer relationships at ages 10 and 11 years after covarying for psychopathology ratings. Self-reported inattention uniquely predicts poor peer relationships longitudinally at age 14 and 15 years. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: This study highlights the importance of examining children’s self-report of inattention and identifies inattention as a risk factor for current and later outcomes.</p>

<p>Inattention is increasingly recognized as a problem that affects both malestal and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710379734">Burke, Loeber, &amp; Lahey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710379734">Burke, Loeber, White, Stouthamer-Loeber, &amp; Pardini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710379734">Neyens, &amp; Boyle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710379734">Tercyak, Lerman, &amp; Audrain, 2002</xref>). Inattention defines a set of behaviors, including distractibility, failure in sustained attention, and forgetfulness (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Malestal Disorders</italic>, 4th edition, Text Revision; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710379734">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>). In one self-report study spanning 24 countries, distractability was one of the most common problems reported by adolescents in general population, nonclinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710379734">Rescorla et al., 2007</xref>). Inattentive symptoms have also been associated with executive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710379734">Chhabildas, Pennington, &amp; Willcutt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710379734">Nigg et al., 2005</xref>). Inattention has been typically linked with the diagnosis of ADHD (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710379734">APA, 2000</xref>). Some have argued that inattention in ADHD is uniquely important from the hyperactive and impulsive symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710379734">Diamond, 2005</xref>). Developmalest may also be an important consideration in the study of inattention, as it has been noted that that the hyperactivity and impulsivity may decrease during the developmalestal transition into adolescence, whereas inattention may increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710379734">Robin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this research was to investigate self-reported inattention in a community sample of youth aged 10 to 11 years. Inattention has traditionally only been regarded within the context of ADHD and has rarely been studied separately from the hyperactivity and impulsivity combined types (having a combination of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) of ADHD. Also, very little research has examined correlates of self-reported inattention and longitudinal follow-up studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710379734">Barkley, 2006</xref>). We suggest that inattention should be examined on a continuum to better understand normative and clinical levels of attention, as has been done in the depression literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710379734">Compas, Ey, &amp; Grant, 1993</xref>). Use of a community sample permits such continuous analyses, and thus, inattention was treated as a dimalessional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710379734">Kraemer, 2007</xref>) in the current study. This research contributes to our understanding of whether self-reported inattention in youth is a significant risk factor in developmalest. The main goal of this study was to examine self-reported inattention in a community sample as a risk factor for predicting outcomes in victimization and peer relationships in youth aged 10 and 11 and in peer relationships longitudinally when youth were aged between 14 and 15 years. Associations among self-reported inattention, parent-reported inattention, and self-reported psychopathology in children aged 10 to 11 years were also examined.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054710379734">
<title>Inattention as a Risk Factor for Psychosocial Maladjustmalest</title>
<p>Children with ADHD reportedly have more comorbid conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and conduct problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710379734">Barkley, 2006</xref>). However, inattention is commonly associated with other childhood psychopathologies, such as anxiety and depression (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710379734">APA, 2000</xref>). In an epidemiological study, self-reported inattention was found to be correlated with self-reports of conduct disorder, anxiety, and depression for adolescent boys and girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710379734">Schaughency, McGee, Nada Raja, Feehan, &amp; Silva, 1994</xref>). Although there is a body of work to suggest associations between inattention and psychopathology, the unique contributions of inattention to youth problems have received little attention.</p>
<p>Inattention has traditionally been examined in conjunction with hyperactivity-impulsivity in the diagnosis of ADHD, but there is limited work examining negative outcomes for inattention alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710379734">Wheeler Maedgen and Carlson (2000)</xref> compared children with ADHD Combined Subtype (ADHD-C) and children with ADHD Predominantly Inattentive Subtype (ADHD-I) in psychosocial functioning. The authors reported that along with the ADHD-C children, the predominantly inattentive children also experienced difficulties in social functioning in comparison to controls. However, the nature of difficulty differed depending on ADHD subtype. The children with ADHD-C showed more aggressive behavior and emotional dysregulation, whereas the children with ADHD-I displayed social passivity and deficits in social knowledge, but did not show the problems in emotional regulation. These types of studies illustrate the challenge of examining the unique contribution of inattention in the study of ADHD, as most samples are composed of children with inattention and combined inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Studies with community samples provide an opportunity to understand the unique contributions of inattention.</p>
<p>Studies in community samples have shown that inattention has been linked to problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710379734">Bellanti, Bierman, &amp; the Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710379734">Hill, Degnan, Calkins, &amp; Keane, 2006</xref>). One longitudinal study examining early problems of inattention found that inattention at age 2 predicted membership in a chronic clinical profile, such as externalizing behaviors, for both boys and girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710379734">Hill et al., 2006</xref>). Another study reported that inattention was found to predict aggressive and prosocial behavior, such that inattention was associated with increased rates of disruptive and aggressive behavior and deficits in social skills. The inattentive group was also reported to be significantly less well liked by peers than the nonproblem comparison group (Bellanti et al., 2000). In the current study, we examined whether self-reported inattention would be uniquely associated with peer relationship problems at ages 10 to 11 and longitudinally at ages 14 to 15 in a community sample of 10- to 11-year-old children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1087054710379734">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>Developmalestally, it has been shown that females tend to report more internalizing symptoms whereas males tend to report more externalizing symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710379734">Rescorla et al., 2007</xref>). Studies from ADHD studies suggest that females with inattention may be at higher risk than males. Females with ADHD have been shown to report more depression, anxiety, and distress than do females in the control group or males with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710379734">Rucklidge &amp; Tannock, 2001</xref>). Females with inattention and hyperactivity have also been reported as being at higher risk for smoking and alcohol use than are males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710379734">Galera, Fombonne, Chastang, &amp; Bouvard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710379734">Whalen, Jamner, Henker, Delfino, &amp; Lozano, 2002</xref>). Thus, we examined gender differences in self-reported inattention and other behavioral ratings in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1087054710379734">
<title>Self-Report and Inattention</title>
<p>Conventionally, caregivers and teachers are typical informants for childhood behavior, as children’s reports have not been considered diagnostic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710379734">Bierman, 1983</xref>). This trend is particularly evident in ADHD. In contrast, more reliance is placed on child or adolescent report in internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710379734">Loeber, Green, &amp; Lahey, 1990</xref>). Children as young as 4 have been found to provide useful self-reports on basic symptoms of internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710379734">Luby, Belden, Sullivan, &amp; Spitznagel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of multiple informants in the reporting of child and adolescent symptomology and behavior is endorsed clinically. This is evidenced by increased use of checklists and self-reports completed by older children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710379734">W. M. Reynolds, 1993</xref>) and the availability of self-report scales for youth and children as young as age eight (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710379734">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710379734">Conners, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710379734">C. R. Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>). The psychometric data for these scales demonstrate significant moderate correlations between self- and parent-report scales. However, the demonstrated use and validity of child and adolescent self-report is debated, as the evidence with respect to concurrence between youth and parent report of behavior and symptoms has been mixed. Some research has shown that adolescent and parent reports often show minor agreemalest surrounding problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710379734">Jensen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710379734">Seiffge-Krenke &amp; Kollmar, 1998</xref>). Other studies have reported that young adolescents report significantly more internalizing and externalizing symptoms than their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710379734">Rescorla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710379734">Seiffge-Krenke &amp; Kollmar, 1998</xref>). Some studies have suggested a greater degree of concurrence between parent and youth reports, including a study of examining child, parent, and teacher report in a sample of 6- to 14-year-old children and adolescents with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710379734">Klimkeit et al., 2006</xref>), and between 15-year-old adolescents and parent reports of inattention in a community sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710379734">Schaughency et al., 1994</xref>). Overall, mixed findings have been reported with respect to the degree of concurrence between parent and youth reports of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. Differences have also been found in symptom reporting between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710379734">Rescorla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710379734">Rucklidge &amp; Tannock, 2001</xref>). Thus, self-report of inattention was examined in this study, in relation to other self-reported measures of behavior and psychosocial maladjustmalest.</p>
<p>In the current study, we examined whether self-reported inattention is a unique risk factor for both current outcomes of victimization and peer relationships and longitudinal outcomes in peer relationship problems 4 years later in a community sample. This study also examined the association between self-reported inattention with parent report and other self-reported behavior. It was expected that inattention would be a unique risk factor for victimization at ages 10 to 11, peer relationships at ages 10 to 11, and longitudinally in peer relationships 4 years later when youth were aged between 14 and 15 years. Females were hypothesized to demonstrate a stronger correlation between self-reported inattention and internalizing behavior ratings than were males. It was also expected that self-reported inattention would be significantly associated with parent-reported inattention.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1087054710379734">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The data analyzed were part of a national longitudinal study being conducted by Statistics Canada called the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). The NLSCY is a longitudinal study following the developmalest of Canadian children from birth to early adulthood. Information is collected on environmalestal, biological, economic, and social topics as well as risk and protective factors in developmalest. The current study focused on the self-complete portion (participants aged 10-17 answer questions about themselves) and included some variables from the adult portion (questions are asked to the “person most knowledgeable” [PMK] about the child).</p>
<p>Participants in the original cohort of the NLSCY were selected as part of the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS collects labor market data from approximately 54,000 dwellings in Canada. It is representative of civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 15 and more in the 10 Canadian provinces. Sampling for the LFS was based on a stratified, multistage design employing probability sampling at all stages of the design. Stratification is determined through a multistep process consisting of dividing provinces into economic regions, type of area (e.g., remote, urban, rural), housing type (e.g., apartmalest or area frame), as well as by income when possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710379734">Statistics Canada, 2006</xref>). The data used in the current analyses, therefore, represent a diverse and representative Canadian community sample.</p>
<p>Overall, data in the NLSCY are divided into six cycles, with the first cycle beginning in 1994 and sampling children aged 0 to 11 years. The survey was readministered every 2 years; thus, the sixth cycle was composed of children aged 10 to 21 years. In the current study, data from the fourth cycle (collected in 2000-2001) and the sixth cycle (collected in 2004-2005) were used. Participants who were between 10 and 11 years of age were selected as the target age group, as we were interested in their self-report of behavior and because parent ratings were also available for this age. These two cycles were selected to have a more powerful test of the longitudinal questions (4-year gap as opposed to a 2-year gap), and selection of these two cycles maximized sample size. The available data included 1,974 parent reports and 1,532 self-reports. The sample demographics at the fourth cycle were as follows: The mean age of the sample was 10.49 years (<italic>SD</italic> = .50), with males constituting 49.5% of the sample. The PMK was most often the biological mother (89.7%), of which 74.8% reported marital status as “married.” Then, 73.1% of the children lived with both biological parents, a biological mother and no father (13.8%), the biological mother and stepfather (7.5%), or some other arrangemalest (5.6%). Median family income ranged from Cdn$60,000 to Cdn$79,000.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1087054710379734">
<title>Inattention</title>
<p>Inattention was measured using a composite composed of 3 items: “I am easily distracted”; “I can’t concentrate/can’t pay attention”; and “I am inattentive.” Each item was scored on a 3-point scale, where 1 = <italic>never or not true</italic>, 2 = <italic>sometimes or somewhat true</italic>, and 3 = <italic>often or always true</italic>. Interitem correlations ranged from .42 to .51 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710379734">Table 1</xref> displays the interitem correlations within the composite. An inattention score was calculated for each participant, on the basis of the mean value of the three inattention questions. A higher score indicated more inattention. A parent report of inattention composite was based on the same questionnaire items.</p>

<p>Inattention remained a unique predictor of victimization after accounting for gender, depression, conduct problems, and anxiety, which were also entered as significant predictors.

<p>Gender and behavioral ratings (depression and conduct-problem ratings) that had emerged as significant covariates in the ANCOVAs were entered at Step 1, and inattention was entered at Step 2 in a hierarchical regression. Inattention remained a unique predictor of peer relationships at ages 10 and 11, after gender, depression, and conduct-problem ratings were entered, each of which entered as significant covariates.

<title>Inattention predicting peer relationships longitudinally</title>
<p>A longitudinal regression was conducted to examine inattention at ages 10 and 11 as a risk factor for peer relationships at ages 14 and 15. In this analysis, gender, depression, conduct problems, and peer relationships at ages 10 and 11 were entered first, and inattention was entered as the second step to predict peer relationships at ages 14 and 15. Inattention at ages 10 and 11 was a significant predictor of peer relationships at ages 14 and 15, even after controlling for the other variables entered. Peer relationships at ages 10 and 11 and depression were also significant predictors, but gender and conduct-disorder ratings were not. These results indicate that self-reported inattention was a robust and unique predictor of peer relationships longitudinally, even after controlling for other self-report behavioral ratings.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we examined the correlates of self-reported inattention with parent report, associations with other self-report behavioral ratings, and with indices of psychosocial maladjustmalest. Gender differences were also examined. Inattention was found to be a significant and unique predictor of current victimization and current and future quality of peer relationships. Gender did not interact with inattention on either victimization or peer relationships. Self-reported inattention was significantly but modestly associated with parent-reported inattention, supporting the validity of self-report of inattention in 10- and 11-year-olds. Self-reported inattention was also significantly correlated with self-reports of hyperactivity-impulsivity, depression, anxiety, and conduct-problem ratings, with the largest association between inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity ratings.</p>
<sec id="section23-1087054710379734">
<title>Inattention as a Risk Factor</title>
<p>To situate the inattention ratings in the community sample used in this study, the ratings of inattention by the youth and parents suggest relatively low levels of inattention, which is typical in a community sample. Participants in the high-inattention group, according to parent and self-reports, may have been at risk for ADHD; 8% of self-reporters and 11% of parent reporters indicated high inattention, which is comparable to the prevalence rate of ADHD in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710379734">APA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>On the basis of the self-report measures, we found that males in particular and participants in the high-inattention group reported more victimization than did females or participants in the low- or moderate-inattention groups. Interestingly, hyperactivity-impulsivity did not emerge as a significant covariate; however, depression, anxiety, and conduct-problem ratings were significant covariates. The main effects of inattention and gender remained significant after covarying for the other behavioral ratings. Self-reported inattention was also found to be a significant predictor of victimization and peer relationships in the regression analyses. Furthermore, self-reported inattention was also a unique predictor of peer relationships 4 years later, even after controlling for the presence of peer relationships at ages 10 and 11 and other behavioral ratings. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710379734">Bellanti et al. (2000)</xref>, who reported that inattentive children were significantly less well-liked by peers than the nonproblem comparison group. Peer relationships play a critical role in childhood and adolescent developmalest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710379734">Rubin, Bukowski, &amp; Parker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054710379734">Santrock, 2005</xref>) and are important for the developmalest of social competence and socioemotional adjustmalest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710379734">Deater-Deckard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710379734">Ladd, 1999</xref>). Poor peer relationships have been associated with antisocial behavior, social anxiety, an increased need for malestal health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710379734">Parker &amp; Asher, 1987</xref>), and healthy friendships have been found to be important and protective against internalizing and externalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710379734">Brett, Bukowski, Aunola, &amp; Nurmi, 2007</xref>). The results of this study support the unique role of self-reported inattention in early adolescence as a predictor of difficulties in peer relationships in later adolescence. The current findings on psychosocial maladjustmalest contribute to an emerging literature highlighting the unique predictive role of inattention as a risk factor for later developmalest. Inattention has been found to be a risk factor for later achievemalest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710379734">Frazier, Demaree, &amp; Youngstrom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710379734">Greenfield Spira &amp; Fischel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710379734">Massetti et al., 2008</xref>) and developmalest of executive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710379734">Friedman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section24-1087054710379734">
<title>Gender and Inattention</title>
<p>There was a significant main effect of gender, such that males reported more victimization and poorer peer relationships. There was no gender by inattention interaction, suggesting that both males and females did not report greater peer difficulties on the basis of different levels of inattention. Reporting high inattention was a risk factor for these outcomes, regardless of gender. The overall gender effect may be partly explained by the fact that the measure of victimization may have characterized more overt forms of aggression, which is more typical of male victimization. Females tend to experience more relational and overt forms of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710379734">Zalecki &amp; Hinshaw, 2004</xref>), such as gossiping and exclusion, which were not captured in the measure of victimization used in this study.</p>
<p>The prevalence of self- and parent-reported inattention was of particular interest in males and females. According to self-reports of inattention, 9% of males and 7% of females fell into the high-inattention group. In contrast, parent-reported inattention resulted in 16% of males and 7% of females meeting criteria for the high-inattention group. This discrepancy between self- and parent report of highly inattentive males are consistent with prevalence characteristics of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710379734">APA, 2000</xref>). It has been suggested that males and females are treated differently at home and have differing behavioral expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710379734">Rucklidge &amp; Tannock, 2001</xref>). Males have been reported to exhibit more visible externalizing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710379734">Gershon, 2002</xref>), which tend to co-occur highly with inattention (also shown in this study), accounting for the elevated levels of parent-reported inattention in males. Another possible explanation for this difference is that the 10- to 11-year-old boys may be underreporting inattention, suggesting that they may not yet have the same degree of insight into their behavior as compared to girls of same age. This is consistent with findings reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710379734">Schaughency et al. (1994)</xref>. No gender differences were obtained in self-reported inattention, which is consistent with other studies that have used community-based samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710379734">Rescorla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710379734">Schaughency et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section25-1087054710379734">
<title>Self-Report and Inattention in Youth</title>
<p>Self-reported inattention was modestly related to parent-reported inattention, both in the overall sample and for males and females separately. This indicates some concurrence between the informants. The sizes of these correlations are consistent with other literature reporting low to moderate correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710379734">Achenbach, McConaughy, &amp; Howell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710379734">Fischer, Barkley, Fletcher, &amp; Smallish, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710379734">Luby et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710379734">Schaughency et al., 1994</xref>). These results suggest that 10- and 11-year-olds have some insight into inattention problems, which gives some validation to commonly used self-report instrumalests for youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710379734">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710379734">Conners, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section26-1087054710379734">
<title>Associations With Hyperactivity, Impulsivity, Anxiety, Depression, and Conduct Problems</title>
<p>Inattention was most highly correlated with hyperactivity-impulsivity ratings. Correlations between inattention and depression, anxiety, and conduct problem ratings were significantly smaller but were significant. These results are similar to findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710379734">Schaughency et al. (1994)</xref>. Correlations between inattention and the other behavioral ratings did not differ significantly between males and females. Thus, this finding suggestions that, in this sample, inattention was not more strongly related to depression and anxiety ratings in females than it did with hyperactivity and impulsivity. Notably, this may have been partly attributable to the developmalestal period of preadolescence sampled in this study, as others have suggested that girls with ADHD experience more internalizing symptoms in adolescent samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710379734">Rucklidge &amp; Tannock, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Some limitations of this work include the limited number of items in the composite ratings, with 3 items for each inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity composite. Although interitem correlations were significant and of adequate size, future work should examine inattention and increase the number of items comprising each rating to more closely reflect the number of symptoms in the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710379734">APA, 2000</xref>). As parent report was only available at ages 10 and 11, future work should also collect parent report and self-report data longitudinally to examine associations between self- and parent-reported inattention over time.</p>
<p>There have not been many studies examining self-reported inattention uniquely. These findings from a community sample do support the unique role of self-reported inattention that may place youth at risk in their social relationships. This was demonstrated most profoundly in the longitudinal analyses, which indicated that self-reported inattention at 10 to 11 years of age was a unique predictor of peer relationships when participants were between 14 and 15 years of age, even after controlling for peer relationships between the ages 10 and 11 and controlling for other behavioral ratings. This finding has significant implications, as social relationships become increasingly important as youth become adolescents. This study also provides supporting evidence for the diagnosticity of self-reported inattention and other behavioral ratings at ages 10 and 11 years.</p>
