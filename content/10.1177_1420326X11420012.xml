<abstract>
<p>Windows in a building is an essential element in creating comfortable, energy-efficient and healthy indoor environment. However, the actual performance of a building depends highly on the ways of using the windows by occupants. An understanding of window use patterns is thus of importance in the design and evaluation of buildings. This study aims to extend the understanding of window control behaviour by occupants in offices. A field campaign has been conducted from March 12, 2010, to January 31, 2011, in four offices, located in Suwon, South Korea, to demonstrate the close link between carbon dioxide concentrations, prevailing internal and external temperatures, occupancy schedules and window control patterns; and to predict window use as a function of thermal and non-thermal stimuli. The research reveals that there could be large and significant seasonal effects on window control patterns, which provided main stimuli for the use of windows in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Finally, the influences of different window control patterns on indoor thermal environment and air quality have been analysed in detail.</p></abstract>

<p>How occupants use their buildings and environmental controls is a key in determining building performance. Existing studies show that occupants can alter the energy use of similar buildings by a factor of 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11420012">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11420012">4</xref>]. Yun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11420012">5</xref>] reveals the occupancy and air-conditioner use patterns in open plan offices and shows that occupant behaviour could be a key element in determining cooling energy use.</p>
<p>Windows in a building is an essential element in creating comfortable, energy-efficient and healthy indoor environment. Previous research shows that the performance of natural ventilation would depend highly on the ways of using the windows by occupants and reveals a close relationship between window use patterns and indoor temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11420012">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11420012">8</xref>]. Based on previous research this study aims to extend the understanding of window control behaviour by occupants in offices and to reveal thermal and non-thermal stimuli for the use of windows.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1420326X11420012"><title>Investigated Offices</title>
<p>Four investigated offices were located in the college of engineering building at K University in the Republic of Korea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11420012">Figure 1</xref>). Each office had one external wall with a double glazed window and was located along double loaded corridors of the building. Thus, single-sided natural ventilation was possible by the opening of the window. Occupants rarely opened the door due to privacy. The azimuth of the main façade was 4° for office A, 274° for office B and 94° for offices C and D.

<p>A field survey was conducted from February 4, 2010, to January 7, 2011, in order to measure indoor and outdoor temperatures, carbon dioxide concentrations (CO<sub>2</sub>) and window use patterns. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11420012">Table 2</xref> shows the monitoring parameters and equipment used in this survey. Internal temperature and relative humidity was measured with HOBO U12-012 at a 10-min interval positioned at the top of the each desk partition. HOBO U23-002 with a radiation shield was installed at the top of the building in order to measure external temperature and humidity. The state of a window, that is whether the window is closed or open, was monitored with HOBO U9-001. HOBO U9-001 checked whether the window is closed or open at a half-second interval. Internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was recorded with TEL-7001.

<p>It was found that the average indoor temperatures in each office would be different with the time of the year. In office A, for example, the mean temperature was 23.4°C (Standard Deviation, SD = 1.8°C) in spring, 26.1°C (SD = 1.4°C) in summer, and 22.9°C in winter (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,3114)</sub><italic> = </italic>418.836, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001).

<p>A daily occupied period of the office C was 14 h and 5 min, which was the longest among the observed offices. A daily occupancy of the office C started at 9:09 am (SD = 1:16) and ended at 23:59 pm (SD = 2:54). On the other hand, in the office D, the administrative staffs had the shortest occupied period of 10 h and 32 min.</p>
<p>Seasonal effects on daily occupancy patterns of the monitored offices were less clear. In the office A, the start of daily occupancy was from 8:25 am (SD = 1:21) in summer to 8:53 am (SD = 1:31) in the autumn, resulting in a difference of 28 min. However, the differences of the start of daily occupancy with seasons were not statistically significant (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,220)</sub> = 2.288, <italic>p = </italic>0.079). The end of daily occupancy of the office C in spring was 1 h and 40 min behind that in winter, however this was not statistically significant (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,223)</sub> = 3.931, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11420012"><title>Window Use Patterns</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11420012">Figure 5</xref> shows how occupants used windows on their first arrival to offices, during subsequent occupied period, and on departure when the last occupant left the office. The window use patterns of occupants differed greatly with the time of the day. The window control activities happened mainly on the first arrival to the office. In spring, for example, when the window had been closed on the first arrival, the proportion of time that a window was opened was 43%. On the other hand, the proportion reduced to 7% during the subsequent occupation period and no previously closed window was opened on departure in spring.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11420012" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Transition probability of window state from opened to closed and from closed to open: (a) spring, (b) summer, (c) autumn and (d) winter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420012-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The change of window states from opened to closed or from closed to open was a rather rare event during the subsequent occupied period and on departure. In autumn, for example, previously closed window was never opened on departure and the transition of window state from closed to open was only 8% during the subsequent occupation period.</p>
<p>There was a clear seasonal variation in window use patterns. On arrival, the proportion of a window state from closed to open was 36% in summer and the proportion was only 8% in winter. On departure, the transition probability of a window state from closed to open was 3% proportion of the time in summer and 0% in winter.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11420012">Figure 6</xref> shows the average proportion of time that windows were opened as a function of time of the day. In spring, the proportion of windows being opened was lowest at 8 am and increased after occupants arrived at the offices. The proportion fluctuated from 59% to 64% during the subsequent occupation period. The monitoring data showed that a window remained slightly being opened even after all occupants had left the offices. The average proportion of windows being opened was 42% in spring.
<fig id="fig6-1420326X11420012" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Hourly window use patterns: (a) spring, (b) summer, (c) autumn and (d) winter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11420012-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In summer, the proportion of time that windows being opened at 8 am was 33%, which was the lowest. The proportion was drastically increased to 64% at 9 am. The average percentage of the window being opened during the subsequent occupancy period in summer was 68%. In winter, our observation revealed that the window was slightly opened during most of the time. This was confirmed by the monitoring data. The hourly proportion of time that windows being opened was 32% at 9 am and this gradually increased during the subsequent occupied period.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X11420012"><title>Logistic Models of Window-Use</title>
<p>This study has selected logistic models as regression methods to derive links between environmental stimuli and occupant behavioural responses with regard to window-control. The logistic models were successfully used to derive stimulus–response or behaviour models to describe and quantify the relationship between the values of stimulus and subject response variations. In particularly, many of the existing window control models have been constructed using the logistic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11420012">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11420012">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11420012">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The logistic models of a window state transition from opened to closed and from closed to open have been obtained, having considered the effects of the time of day. To reflect the time of day effects, separate models for the start, subsequent and end of the occupied period were established. Separate models for spring, summer, autumn and winter were created to reflect seasonal effects. Environmental variables considered in the models were indoor temperature and relative humidity, external temperature and relative humidity, and internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p>
<p>The logistic models of a window state transition are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1420326X11420012">Table 6</xref>. To evaluate the regression models, χ<sup>2</sup> test was used for the overall model test and Wald statistic for independent variable test. When a <italic>p</italic> value of the test is less than 0.05, it is considered to be statistically significant. When <italic>p</italic> value from the Wald statistic for a variable tested was over 0.05, the variable was removed from the logistic model.

<p>In spring, when the window had been opened before the first arrival, the probability of a window remained being opened increased with indoor and outdoor temperature. However, when the window was closed, the transition probability of a window state from closed to open increased with external temperature and relative humidity. On departure, the statistically significant regression model was not established. This was because changing window state on departure was a very rare event. The monitoring data reveals that the probability of a window state from opened to closed was less than 1%.</p>
<p>In summer, the regression models for the window state from opened to closed on arrival and for the window state from closed to open on departure were not established because the changes of window state were very rare. When the window had been closed, the probability of window being opened increased as indoor temperature and relative humidity become greater. However, the probability decreases with an increase of external temperature and relative humidity.</p>
<p>In autumn, the monitoring data indicates that the occupants did not open the previously closed window on departure. Thus, the regression model was not created for this case. Indoor temperature was a key factor affecting the use of window. The probability of a window being opened increases with an increase in indoor temperature at the start of the period of occupancy and during the subsequent occupied period.</p>
<p>In winter, all the derived models were not statistically significant as the <italic>p</italic> values were over 0.1. This indicates that the use of windows in winter cannot be explained by variables considered in this study.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11420012" sec-type="discussion and conclusions"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that there are statistically significant relationships between the use of windows by the occupants and indoor environmental parameters (i.e. indoor thermal stimuli and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations) and also a current window state, whether it is opened or closed, which is a crucial factor in those relationships. For example, when a window is already opened in the summer, the use of the window is not related to thermal factors, but is influenced by CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. As the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations rise, the probability of a window being opened increases. This implies that perceived indoor air quality by occupants is a key non-thermal stimulus affecting the use of the window.</p>
<p>However, when a window is closed in summer, the use of a window is explained by thermal stimuli and the level of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration being irrelevant. On arrival, the transition probability of a window state from closed to open rises drastically with an increase in both indoor temperature and relative humidity, but falls sharply with an increase in both outdoor temperature and relative humidity. This suggests that the occupants would realize that opening a window when the outside temperature is high would increase indoor temperature from their past thermal experiences of hot summer in Korea.</p>
<p>This study also finds that there are large seasonal effects on window use patterns and drivers for the use of windows would differ with seasons. For example, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is the only factor affecting the transition probability of a window from closed to open in spring, however, the transition probability is explained by thermal stimuli in summer. Also, our study implies that thermal stimuli and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are not related to the use of windows in winter.</p>
<p>The potential factors influencing window use patterns not covered in this study are odour and air movement, which could affect the perceived indoor air quality by occupants. Further research will elaborate the influence of indoor air quality on window use patterns. Also, windows monitored in this study are equipped with internal vertical or external blinds. The use of the window can be potentially influenced by the use of blinds, view from the window, and daylight illuminance falling on the window and direct sunlight penetrated through the window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11420012">12</xref>]. Further studies are required to deepen how the above factors could affect the use of windows by occupants and as consequences of the window-control behaviour.</p>
<p>This paper provides also the evidence that there can be large variations in occupancy schedules (i.e. the start and end of daily occupancy) with the type of occupants. When the occupants of the office were post-graduate students, the daily-occupied hours were significantly longer than the daily-occupied period of administrative workers. The occupancy schedule identified in this study is also different from the occupancy pattern of the office workers revealed in the previous field study in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11420012">5</xref>]. As Yun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11420012">5</xref>] has shown, the occupancy pattern is a key factor that can affect both energy use in buildings and the use of windows. Further research is required on how occupants would use their offices, how occupancy rates would differ with the type of occupants, and how occupant behaviour could vary in relation to environmental controls and how these are influenced by occupancy patterns.</p></sec></body>
