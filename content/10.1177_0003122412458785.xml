<p>Weber argued that human suffering creates the demand for <italic>theodicies</italic>: cultural vocabularies, religious or secular, that explain perceived injustices. This article combines an interpretive analysis of rhetoric commemorating the events of September 11, 2001 with an effort to construct generalizable cultural theory, demonstrating how the Weberian concept of theodicy adds to our understanding of commemorative rhetoric. In the case of September 11 commemorations, the theodicies deployed exhibit a clear fracture. Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, have taken a <italic>dualistic</italic> approach to the problem of theodicy, while speakers in Manhattan have taken a <italic>tragic</italic> approach. This variation can be explained through a four-part model that argues theodicies are structured by (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3) audiences, and (4) genre memory. More broadly, I argue for explicit attention to theodicy in cultural sociology, demonstrating that the quest for theodicy is a crucial driving force behind the impulse to commemorate in the first place.</p>

<p>At 8:46 a.m. on September 11, 2001, a commercial flight crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. Another plane followed shortly, crashing into the south tower at 9:03. At 9:30, the U.S. President, Republican George W. Bush, spoke briefly at Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, where he was visiting. That morning, his speech was halting. The United States, he explained, had experienced “a national tragedy,” “an apparent terrorist attack” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412458785">Bush 2001c</xref>:1300). He promised a swift response in the form of an FBI investigation “to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412458785">Bush 2001c</xref>:1300). The demonstrative pronoun “this” (“this act”) took the place of a clear definition of the event, and Bush promised a bureaucratic—rather than military—response.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it is all too easy to forget those first uncertain moments—moments when observers the world over, even U.S. political leaders, grasped for an interpretive frame. The ambiguity of the events themselves—which existed in the liminal space between crime and war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412458785">Calhoun, Price, and Timmer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 2010</xref>)—further confused the task. But before long, Bush and other public officials faced a social imperative to address the enduring human question that inevitably arises in the wake of such calamities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber (1922</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0003122412458785">1946</xref>) referred to this question as the problem of theodicy. The term “theodicy” originated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122412458785">Leibniz’s ([1710] 1998)</xref> efforts to reconcile belief in a just, benevolent, and omnipotent God with the grim reality of suffering. Weber, however, used the term in an analytic and sociological sense: to describe interpretive vocabularies, religious or secular, that explain evil and suffering. As Berger and his colleagues later put it, theodicy in the sociological sense “means any explanation of human events that bestows meaning upon the experiences of suffering and evil” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412458785">Berger, Berger, and Kellner 1974</xref>:185). This is the sense in which I use the concept here.</p>
<p>This article is an effort to understand sociologically the theodicies through which 9/11 is interpreted in U.S. commemorative culture—and in so doing, to shed light on the importance of theodicy for sociological inquiry more generally. First, I interpret presidential rhetoric from the immediate aftermath of 9/11 as providing an official state theodicy. In turn, I examine speeches from ceremonies commemorating September 11 at each of the three crash sites over the ensuing decade to understand how official theodicies have developed over time. The analysis reveals a clear fracture in theodicies of September 11—a divergence between <italic>dualistic</italic> and <italic>tragic</italic> modes. The fracture between these distinct ideal-typical forms takes shape across the three 9/11 crash sites in theoretically generative ways. Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, carried forward a <italic>dualistic</italic> theodicy that quickly coalesced in presidential rhetoric. Dualism is one of the three ideal-typical forms of theodicy originally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber (1922)</xref>. As Weber explained, dualism understands worldly events as part of a continual struggle between good and evil that drives inexorably toward the triumph of the good. The events of 9/11 represent a single chapter in this larger struggle, and the deaths become sacrifices helping to ensure that good will triumph. In contrast, speakers in Manhattan elaborated a <italic>tragic</italic> approach. Relying on multivocal texts—primarily poetry and literature—rather than original speechmaking, the tragic commemorations focused on themes of grief and loss. They gave voice to suffering and offered meaning and hope in a more oblique or ambiguous manner. Like the tragic social dramas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici (1986</xref>:283) describes, these commemorations “inspire introspection” and “weave together, however temporarily, diverse sectors of a heterogeneous population” through “an overt focus on points of ambiguity.”</p>
<p>The fractured theodicies of 9/11 raise crucial sociological questions. When, how, and why are different rhetorics deployed in explaining the day’s events? How does understanding these rhetorics as theodical advance our understanding? My interpretive analysis of September 11 commemorations is part of an effort to construct generalizable cultural theory: namely, to advance an argument for bringing theodicy back into our understandings of how and why people—especially political leaders—commemorate in the first place. After providing an overview of theodicy in sociological theory and making the case for reincorporating it more explicitly into cultural sociology, I provide a detailed interpretive analysis of 9/11 commemorative rhetoric, describing the process through which the dualistic and tragic vocabularies solidified. To account for the differences described, I develop a model arguing that theodicies are structured by, though ultimately not reducible to, (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3) audiences, and (4) genre memory. This model draws on and extends similar models in the literature, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412458785">Fine (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122412458785">Griswold (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122412458785">Olick (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">2007</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0003122412458785">Vinitzky-Seroussi (2002)</xref>.</p>

<title>History of Theodicy in Sociology</title>
<p>The concept of theodicy has a long history in sociological theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber (1922</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0003122412458785">1946</xref>) initially developed it within his analyses of what he termed the world religions, where he identified three ideal-typical forms of theodicy: karma, dualism, and predestination. Karma attributes present suffering to past conduct, arguing that misfortunes result from moral shortcomings in previous incarnations. Dualism understands suffering through a teleological worldview: the “world process,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber (1922</xref>:144) put it, is “full of inevitable suffering,” but it drives toward the “continuous purification of the light from the contamination of darkness” and thus the ultimate triumph of the good. Suffering is co-opted into this triumphant march. Finally, predestination represents the logical outcome of a messianic eschatology. Messianism opens “an unimaginably great ethical chasm between the transcendental god and the human being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber 1922</xref>:142). God is perceived as omnipotent—God’s “determination has decreed” both “human fate on earth” and “human destiny after death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber 1922</xref>:143)—but ultimately is believed to be inscrutable. Suffering is connected to a divine plan although its precise meaning is beyond human comprehension, and indeed adherents often search vigorously for signs of God’s favor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0003122412458785">Weber 1958</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122412458785">1</xref></sup> Each of these ideal-typical forms provides a template for assimilating suffering into a coherent view of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122412458785">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following Weber, sociologists of religion have occasionally addressed theodicy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122412458785">Hunter (1982)</xref> examines how evangelical Christian theodicies have responded to the ascendancy of the therapeutic ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0003122412458785">Rieff 1966</xref>). Once confined to questions of grief, suffering, and death, evangelical theodicies now address issues such as psychological balance and emotional maturity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412458785">Musick (2000)</xref> explores the relationship between sin theodicy—the belief that suffering results from human sinfulness—and life satisfaction. The effects are mediated by race; sin theodicies are associated with lower levels of life satisfaction among white, but not black, Americans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412458785">Campbell (2007)</xref> argues that as Judeo-Christian theodicies have become less plausible in the West, people have increasingly turned to Eastern traditions, hence the rise of new age vocabularies.</p>
<p>Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412458785">Berger (1967)</xref> argues, theodicy is not just a theological problem. It is, instead, a more general <italic>cultural</italic> problem that is fundamental to the human condition—driven, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber (1922</xref>:117) put it, by “an inner compulsion to understand the world as a meaningful cosmos and to take a position toward it.” This compulsion persists regardless of the role that religion—and the theodicies it offers—plays in social life. In fact, the quest for theodicy would endure even if religion disappeared entirely: “Whatever the fate of any historical religion, or that of religion as such, we can be certain that the necessity of this attempt [to formulate theodicies] will persist as long as men die and have to make sense of that fact” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412458785">Berger 1967</xref>:80). There is an underlying philosophical anthropology here: theodicy, in the broad sociological sense, is an anthropological necessity, a perennial human need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412458785">Campbell 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0003122412458785">Tenbruck 1980</xref>). Theodicies provide a crucial bulwark against anomie by restoring a sense of ontological security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122412458785">Giddens 1991</xref>) in the face of suffering.</p>
<p>Religion, of course, never disappeared. Indeed, it continues to play a vital role in both private and public life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122412458785">Berger et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122412458785">Casanova 1994</xref>). Yet functional differentiation and growing cultural pluralism expand both the range of institutions that bear responsibility for addressing the problem of theodicy and the particular solutions they offer. Religious institutions are no longer the preeminent cultural authority, and the religious vocabularies Weber identified are joined by additional possibilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, scholarly work has itself become a crucial source for theodicies in the modern world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412458785">Elster (1985</xref>) argues that the Darwinian account of evolution provided an initial alternative to traditional religious theodicies. Darwinism also laid the groundwork for <italic>sociodicies</italic>—sociologically informed responses to the problem of theodicy—that are often rooted in organic analogies. Several sociologists have developed this theme. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122412458785">Vidich and Lyman (1985)</xref> argue that the sociological tradition in the United States is itself a response to the declining plausibility of traditional religious theodicies and an attempt to fill the void. American sociology, they suggest, began as a search for “explanations of . . . what appears in worldly terms to be the irrational condition that the good suffer while the evil often prosper” and ultimately formulated “sociodicies” that “[justified] the ways of society to its members” by interpreting social problems as “instrumentalities for the creation of a more perfect society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0003122412458785">Vidich and Lyman 1985</xref>:281–82). British sociologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412458785">Morgan and Wilkinson (2001</xref>:210) advance a similar interpretation of sociological theory but articulate a more critical vision: rather than justifying the status quo, sociodicies ought to offer “a self-conscious critique of the disparity between the millennial aspirations of modernity and the reality in which we live.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122412458785">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Theodicy in the broad sociological sense has clearly become the province of secular as well as religious institutions. The desire for theodicy, these authors illustrate, is not diminished in the modern world. However, sociologists have yet to examine how the full range of modern institutions responds to the demand for theodicy. Rather than seeking to identify theodicies within sociology, this article turns an analytic lens on a key arena where the problem of theodicy frequently—and forcefully—arises: political culture and collective memory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122412458785">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are three key reasons for theodicy’s growing salience in political culture. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412458785">Anderson (1991)</xref> argues, the nation has become, in many ways, a substitute for religion as a basis for collective solidarity in the pluralistic modern age. In the United States, religious metaphors often play a central role in political rhetoric, but they are manifestations of a broad “civil religion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122412458785">Bellah 1967</xref>) rather than references to a more narrow tradition. Second, government institutions are now widely perceived as responsible for protecting citizens’ security and livelihood. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122412458785">Rozario (2007)</xref> documents, events that would have been attributed to God in early U.S. history now require alternate explanations. Even when religious vocabularies remain salient, the burden for providing explanations frequently shifts from clergy to public officials (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122412458785">Campbell and Jamieson 2008</xref>). In the aftermath of calamity, theodicies are central in shoring up the legitimacy of government institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122412458785">Schwartz (1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122412458785">2009</xref>), for instance, documents how Abraham Lincoln’s words and memory were deployed to provide theodicies to the U.S. public as the death toll mounted during WWII. Finally, suffering has a particular public resonance in the present age. Numerous scholars note that trauma and atrocity have increasingly replaced heroism and triumph as the central problematics of collective memory and the linchpins of collective identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122412458785">Alexander et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412458785">Giesen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122412458785">Rivera 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122412458785">Saito 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122412458785">Schwartz 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0003122412458785">Teeger and Vinitzky-Seroussi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0003122412458785">Vinitzky-Seroussi 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0003122412458785">Wagner- Pacifici and Schwartz 1991</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412458785">Giesen’s (2004</xref>:3) succinct phrase, “victims assume the place that was, before, the place of heroes.” When public commemorations focus on suffering—as they increasingly do—they raise the question of theodicy. Did the suffering endured have any meaning or purpose? How can the event, and the suffering it unleashed, be assimilated into collective narratives?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0003122412458785">
<title>Why Theodicy? Considering Alternative Approaches</title>
<p>The Weberian concept of theodicy differs fundamentally from concepts such as “accounts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0003122412458785">Scott and Lyman 1968</xref>) and “modes of justification” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122412458785">Boltanski and Thévenot 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122412458785">2006</xref>) that are more prevalent today. The accounts tradition originated in now-classic articles by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122412458785">Mills (1940)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0003122412458785">Sykes and Matza (1957)</xref>, but was more explicitly inaugurated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0003122412458785">Scott and Lyman (1968)</xref>. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122412458785">Orbuch (1997)</xref> documents, early accounts research was situated primarily within the symbolic interactionist tradition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122412458785">Goffman 1959</xref>) and investigated the social conventions deployed to rationalize or justify deviance and overcome social predicaments or failure events (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122412458785">Prus 1975</xref>). Subsequently, researchers extended the accounts tradition in a social psychological direction, asking how people incorporate major life events and transitions—including marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0003122412458785">Orbuch, Veroff, and Holmberg 1993</xref>); divorce, separation, and interpersonal conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122412458785">Harvey, Orbuch, and Weber 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0003122412458785">Weiss 1975</xref>); and sexual assault or abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122412458785">Orbuch et al. 1994</xref>)—into coherent self-identities. Individuals do so, this literature argues, through story-like constructions (i.e., accounts) linking new events with past experiences and an anticipated future. These two traditions exhibit clear differences: the former focuses on interactional flows and the latter focuses on cognitive coherence. Yet both are ultimately concerned with vocabularies deployed instrumentally to maintain the status quo (an exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122412458785">Davis [2005]</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122412458785">Boltanski and Thévenot’s (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122412458785">2006</xref>) work on modes of justification exhibits a similar emphasis. They focus on critical moments—that is, when interactions begin to break down—and the social process through which actors reestablish a common definition of a situation. Actors do so by invoking distinct orders of worth by which persons and objects can be evaluated. Once a common order of worth is reestablished, interaction flows smoothly again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122412458785">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accounts and modes of justification are cultural vocabularies used either in an outer-directed manner to avert interactional breakdown or in an inner-directed manner to maintain coherent self-narratives following failure events. Yet neither captures the existential and emotional force associated with theodicy. When theodicies fail, the consequences are far greater than interactional breakdown or loss of face. Berger and his colleagues highlighted the possibility for anomie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412458785">Berger 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412458785">Berger et al. 1974</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick (2007)</xref> argues that when suffering cannot be explained—when there is no adequate theodicy—victims develop the deep-seated and incurable hatred that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0003122412458785">Nietzsche (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0003122412458785">Weber (1946)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122412458785">Scheler (1994)</xref> described as <italic>ressentiment</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122412458785">6</xref></sup> My intent is not to take a normative position on the desirability of theodicy—indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick (2007)</xref> suggests that in certain situations, <italic>ressentiment</italic> may confront suffering victims as the only morally tenable position—but to underscore what is at stake when the question of theodicy arises. The problem of suffering threatens collective narratives that ordinarily provide the unquestioned background sustaining social, cultural, and political orders. Moments when the question of theodicy throws these narratives into relief represent rare ruptures—the most unsettled of times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0003122412458785">Swidler 1986</xref>)—and evoke powerful emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412458785">Eyerman 2011</xref>). Such ruptures raise several empirical possibilities: collective narratives might be revised, reoriented, or replaced.

<title>Theodicy and Contemporary Cultural Sociology</title>
<p>In the following analysis, I illustrate how more explicitly integrating the Weberian concept of theodicy into contemporary cultural sociology enhances our understanding of memory, commemoration, and meaning-making in general. First, in keeping with cultural sociology’s commitment to combine close interpretive analysis with an effort to construct general theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412458785">Alexander 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122412458785">Griswold 1987</xref>), I examine how theodicies are sociologically structured. Variations in explanations uttered during September 11 commemorations become evident in the interpretive analysis and are rendered comprehensible through the model outlined here. Second, on the basis of the 9/11 case, I argue that analytic attention to theodicy helps highlight the constitutive role that culture and meaning play in social life (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412458785">Alexander 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122412458785">Alexander and Breese 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122412458785">Alexander and Smith 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412458785">Kane 1991</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici (2010</xref>:1354) puts it, “the business of event framing is part and parcel of the continuing effect flow of events.” Theodicy, I suggest, is a vital analytic tool for grasping how event framings influence event trajectories. Different genres of response direct the effect flow of events in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412458785">Alexander 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122412458785">Jacobs 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412458785">Jacobs and Smith 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122412458785">Olick 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 1986</xref>). In the case of 9/11, the dualistic framing that predominated at the state level directed the event’s effect flow in a vastly different manner than would have the alternative, tragic framing.</p>
<p>Finally, I advance the broader argument that more explicit attention to theodicy demonstrates the importance of meaning-making in its own terms, not only in reference to its sources (e.g., carrier groups) or its consequences (e.g., policy). This point is as old as the discipline itself, rooted in Weber’s underlying anthropology. Geertz, one of Weber’s key legatees, articulated the argument compellingly. Responding to Marxists and strain theorists who characterized ideology as a source of bias and distortion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412458785">Geertz (1973</xref>:220) wrote: “Whatever else ideologies may be—projections of unacknowledged fears, disguises for ulterior motives, phatic expressions of group solidarity—they are, most distinctively, maps of problematic social reality and matrices for the creation of collective conscience.” The intent, as Geertz explains, is not to deny that meanings have myriad consequences, including “material” consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122412458785">Alexander and Breese 2011</xref>: xxx–xxxii) and latent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122412458785">Merton 1968</xref>). Indeed, I highlight these consequences explicitly. Instead, the intent is to claim that meanings are also, and indeed most distinctively, responses to the human quest for orientation in an uncertain world. As such, analyses ought to attend to meaning as a human need sui generis.</p>
<p>In recent decades, this perspective has gained ground within political culture analysis, where scholars have increasingly turned away from instrumentalism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122412458785">Edelman 1964</xref>) to conceptualize meaning as an end of politics in and of itself (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412458785">Hunt 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick (2007</xref>:109) puts it, “collective memory is . . . not just the cause or product of what is really going on, but part of the self-definition process that is at the very heart of politics, even when politics appears to be about some more tangible result.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412458785">Eyerman (2011</xref>:25), the “meaning struggles” that unfold in the wake of cultural crises are not animated only by instrumental imperatives, but are “also a response to deeply felt emotions . . . which implies an expressive and communicative aspect” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0003122412458785">Sewell [1996</xref>:865–66] on emotion in historical events). Such meaning struggles are not only grabs for power, but also grasps for sense and significance.</p>
<p>Building on these insights, I suggest that analytic attention to theodicy can shed light on the quintessential task of meaning-making in an especially powerful manner. Theodicy throws the process of meaning-making into relief in an unparalleled way. Theodicies represent attempts to articulate meaning under the most difficult conditions, when expectations about how the world ought to operate are deeply threatened. Indeed, a close analysis of 9/11 commemorative rhetoric suggests that the desire to imbue suffering with meaning—to develop theodicies—is a crucial driving force behind efforts to commemorate calamity in the first place.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Below, I describe the process through which the two contrasting theodicies developed in September 11 commemorations. I then draw on the case to elaborate the arguments outlined earlier. In so doing, I rely on analyses of (1) presidential addresses to the nation from September 2001 and (2) addresses delivered during official commemorations at each of the three crash sites from 2002 to 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122412458785">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In coding addresses, I asked the following: Does the speaker offer an explanation for September 11? If so, what explanation? If not, what themes are addressed instead? I discovered an overall contrast between dualistic and tragic modes, and I develop a “thick description” of each mode, drawing on close readings of representative texts. To verify that commemorations varied systematically, I also identified the subthemes most commonly associated with each ideal type—the key concepts, terms, and tropes deployed to support each theodicy—and analyzed their prevalence across all addresses. Results from this analysis (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122412458785">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122412458785">2</xref>) demonstrate that commemorations differed significantly, supporting and amplifying the thick descriptions I develop. For instance, I observed that “sacrifice” was a major subtheme used to articulate the dualistic theodicy. Systematically coding addresses that refer to “sacrifice” or “laying down one’s life” at all three sites revealed that this subtheme was indeed vastly more prevalent in Arlington and Shanksville than in Manhattan. As I note, all addresses combine multiple subthemes (e.g., sacrifice is often combined with references to heroism). Full definitions for coding categories, along with examples of each, are available in Table S1 in the online supplement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122412458785">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Theodicies of September 11</title>
<sec id="section7-0003122412458785">
<title>Dualistic Theodicy of the State</title>
<p>Theodicies always have carrier groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122412458785">Alexander et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412458785">Eyerman 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber 1922</xref>). In the modern nation-state, where mediated images of suffering can quickly transform calamities into national crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412458785">Eyerman 2011</xref>), it is increasingly incumbent upon federal officials—especially heads of state—to deliver national eulogies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122412458785">Campbell and Jamieson 2008</xref>). Such speeches call most centrally for theodicies. Heads of state thus have a privileged role as carriers, including privileged access to mass media.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the 9/11 case, the dualistic theodicy takes its cue from the interpretation that President Bush quickly began to articulate. At 8:30 p.m.—in view of the four crashes that ultimately took place—he addressed the nation from the Oval Office. His rhetoric no longer halting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122412458785">Bush (2001b</xref>:1301) offered the following explanation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist attacks. . . . Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. . . . America was targeted for this attack because we’re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. Today our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature. And we responded with the best of America.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By 8:30 p.m. on September 11, Bush had established the moral oppositions that run throughout the dualistic theodicy: the nation, and indeed freedom writ large, had been attacked. And America had been attacked precisely for its goodness: because it is a beacon for freedom and opportunity. Consonant with the dualistic theodicy as Weber described it, Bush provided a framework for explaining suffering as a single moment in the inexorable movement toward the triumph of the good. Within this framework, the event can ultimately be portrayed as a sacrifice toward a noble goal whose eventual attainment is ensured.</p>
<p>This dualistic framing rapidly strengthened and solidified. Bush’s rhetoric during his address to the Joint Congress on September 20 is emblematic: “The course of this conflict is not yet known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know God is not neutral between them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412458785">Bush 2001a</xref>:1351). This statement bears all the hallmarks of a dualistic theodicy: present events are but a fleeting moment in an enduring cosmic battle between good and evil; although there may be setbacks, good will prevail; ultimately, God is in control and will ensure justice is restored.</p>
<p>Scholarly research concerning interpretations of September 11 overwhelmingly emphasizes the moral opposition between good and evil that quickly coalesced in political and media cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122412458785">Anker 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412458785">Bernstein 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122412458785">Loseke 2009</xref>). Commentators drew a sharp binary distinction between America—coded “innocent” and “good,” the pinnacle of the “civilized” world—and the forces of “evil” that attacked on September 11.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122412458785">9</xref></sup> Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412458785">Bush’s (2001a</xref>:1349) September 20 address sought to divide the globe unambiguously into good and evil: “Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” Such rhetoric asserts a strong symbolic boundary, encouraging “similar conceptions of the sacred and profane, and similar reactions to symbolic violators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122412458785">Lamont 1992</xref>:12) among the United States and its allies. Yet, as I will demonstrate, the ways this rhetoric is brought to bear on the problem of theodicy illuminate a far more complex “meaning struggle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412458785">Eyerman 2011</xref>:13).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0003122412458785">
<title>Dualistic Commemorations: Arlington and Shanksville</title>
<p>Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, have relied on two distinct rhetorical strategies in articulating the dualistic theodicy. The first is to cast the events of 9/11 as early battles in a war. The crash sites become battlefields, and the 9/11 dead become combatants who heroically sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom. This interpretation hinges on the claim that those who perished had some agency over their deaths. So, the passengers on Flight 93 become “America’s first defenders,” “heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice,” as the Pennsylvania governor, Republican Mark Schweiker, put it in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122412458785">PBS 2002</xref>). As Homeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge claimed—also in 2002—the Flight 93 passengers and crew, “America’s twenty-first century patriots, were armed with . . . a big idea: Freedom is something worth defending” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2002b</xref>). Similarly, at the Pentagon in 2003, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers referred to the dead as “heroes” who “gave their lives,” and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld placed them within a lineage of “patriots” who remind the nation that “freedom will triumph over tyranny” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2003</xref>). Historical analogies underwrite these claims. At the Pentagon, references to the struggle for “freedom” in the American Revolution and the struggle against “tyranny” in WWII were the most common; in Shanksville, speakers emphasized pivotal battles such as Lexington and Concord and Gettysburg that paved the way for eventual victories. In their last moments, this interpretation suggests, the dead were active agents who gave their lives selflessly, who died so that others might live.</p>
<p>The second rhetorical strategy—which was more common at the Pentagon—emphasizes the fundamental opposition between “evil” perpetrators and “innocents” murdered. Speakers acknowledged the pain mourners felt, but pledged that the sacrifices of U.S. service members since 9/11 would ensure that those who perished “did not die in vain,” as Bush put it at the Pentagon in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2002a</xref>). The 9/11 dead may not have made conscious sacrifices, but—Bush continued—their loss “moved a nation to action in a cause to defend innocent lives around the world,” and “set in motion the first great struggle of a new century.” Winning the War on Terror, then, becomes the only way to adequately honor the 9/11 dead. Defense Secretary Robert Gates sounded this theme clearly in Arlington in 2007: “We . . . will stop at nothing to defend this nation, its citizens, and our values. . . . It is a duty to those who perished here six years ago” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2007</xref>). The 9/11 deaths have meaning because they inaugurated this great struggle: a struggle that must now be won in their honor.</p>
<p>Both rhetorical strategies frequently incorporate language of American exceptionalism, and speakers continually “flag” the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412458785">Billig 1995</xref>:35). In 2011, Republican Tom Corbett, the Pennsylvania governor, claimed that the “uprising” on Flight 93 “marks the moment in history when Americans showed what makes us different. . . . We know that there are things more important than our own lives, and chief among them is freedom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412458785">C-SPAN 2011</xref>). The crash site, he said, “whispers of an unfinished agenda, one of freedom at home and abroad, of faraway people free of the yoke of dictators and bigots.” At the Pentagon in 2011, Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, hailed the valor of service members in the “9/11 generation” and encouraged onlookers to remember that “courage lies deepest . . . and beats loudest in the heart of Americans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The fit between the events of 9/11 and dualistic theodicy is occasionally uneasy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici (1994</xref>:8) argues, uneasy fit comes to light in moments of slippage, or “discourse contamination,” when speakers shift from one code to another. Perhaps the most profound such moment came when Bush spoke at the Pentagon in 2002. “The murder of innocents cannot be explained, only endured,” he said—acknowledging, in a rare moment, the challenges of providing an adequate theodicy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2002a</xref>). He rapidly shifted back to the dualistic frame: “And though they died in tragedy, they did not die in vain. Their loss has moved a nation to action in a cause to defend innocent lives around the world.” Bush’s slippage was brief but telling. As Wagner-Pacifici argues, such moments reveal the partiality of a given code and illuminate dimensions of the event that the predominant code obscures: in this case, considerable civilian losses.</p>
<p>Occasional slippages also occurred in Shanksville. In 2005, for instance, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales fleetingly acknowledged that claims about the values motivating the uprising were speculative: “It’s comforting to remember those terrifying moments in the context of things that make America such a wonderful place to live. After all, it’s the protection of those cherished ideals—<italic>I imagine</italic>—that provided the courage necessary to overtake the cockpit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2005</xref>, emphasis added). Here, Gonzales granted—though only in passing—that it is uncertain whether nationalistic sentiments inspired passengers and crew aboard the plane. In 2011, Gordon Felt, whose brother died in Shanksville, broke with the predominant portrayal of the Flight 93 deaths as willing sacrifices, noting that family members still ask: “Why . . . was this battle forced upon the forty passengers and crew of Flight 93, who were taken from us with such violence that morning?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412458785">C-SPAN 2011</xref>). Yet this slippage was brief; he went on to laud the “heroic actions” of Flight 93, claiming that although they “lost their lives,” they nonetheless “won the battle.”</p>
<p>The dualistic frame has been robust to shifting political winds. In speeches at the Pentagon in 2009 and 2010, Bush’s successor, Democrat Barack Obama, remained firmly within the dualistic universe. In 2010, he said:
<disp-quote>
<p>The perpetrators of this evil act didn’t simply attack America, they attacked the very idea of America itself. . . . Those who attacked us sought to demoralize us, divide us, to deprive us of the very unity, the very ideals that make America, America—those qualities that have made us a beacon of freedom and hope to billions around the world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2010b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this excerpt illustrates, Obama echoed not only the dualistic theodicy, but also the more specific imagery Bush employed: the nation as a “beacon” for “freedom,” attacked by forces of “evil.” Similarly, in 2010, First Lady Michelle Obama expressed “awe at the heroism of my fellow citizens” in Shanksville, noting that those aboard Flight 93 “never met the people whose lives they would save, yet they willingly made the sacrifice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2010a</xref>). Obama’s approach to the anniversaries exhibited politically significant differences—most notably, he changed the name from “Patriot Day” to the “National Day of Service and Remembrance,” and he pointed to community service in addition to military victories as an avenue for honoring the dead. Yet the dualistic theodicy remained intact in Arlington and Shanksville.</p>

<sec id="section9-0003122412458785">
<title>Tragic Commemorations: Manhattan</title>
<p>The Manhattan commemorations present a striking contrast. Perhaps the best way to begin examining the differences is with reference to a text that has provided inspiration for rhetoric at all three sites: Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.</p>
<p>Themes from the Gettysburg Address have been woven throughout the dualistic commemorations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122412458785">Bellah (1967</xref>:11) argues, it was during the Lincoln years that “the theme of sacrifice”—which is so salient at these sites—“was indelibly written into the [American] civil religion.” At times, Lincoln’s words played an explicit role. For instance, in Shanksville in 2009, former Secretary of State Colin Powell wove direct quotations into a speech that co-opted Flight 93 into the legacy of the Union soldiers:
<disp-quote>
<p>One hundred forty-six years ago . . . in another field in Pennsylvania, President Abraham Lincoln addressed a similar gathering. . . . They were assembled to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in battle. The scale and scope of that loss was far greater than Flight 93, but the scale and scope of the courage of those heroes and the courage of our heroes . . . was equal. . . . Let us never forget Lincoln’s closing sentence: “ . . . that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Powell closed with a pledge that embodies the dualistic spirit: “We will prevail over the forces of darkness and remain faithful to all that Abraham Lincoln said this nation stood for” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The first anniversary commemoration in Manhattan began with a reading of the Gettysburg Address. Yet Lincoln’s words played a vastly different role here than in Shanksville. Mayor Michael Bloomberg<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122412458785">10</xref></sup> offered a brief but revealing preface: “One hundred and thirty-nine years ago, President Abraham Lincoln looked out on his nation as he stood on a field that became the largest burial ground. Then, it was Gettysburg; today, it is the World Trade Center where we gather on native soil to share our common creed.”</p>
<p>In Arlington and Shanksville, Gettysburg is a <italic>battlefield</italic>. In Manhattan, Gettysburg is a <italic>burial ground</italic>. “Gettysburg,” of course, may refer to either: to Gettysburg battlefield or to Gettysburg national cemetery, where Lincoln spoke. The term itself—like Lincoln’s address—is polysemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122412458785">Schwartz 1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0003122412458785">2005</xref>). But while Powell used Lincoln’s words to explicitly transform the 9/11 deaths into sacrifices, onlookers in Manhattan were largely left to posit meaning privately.</p>
<p>Over time, the predominant rhetoric in Manhattan shifted further from the dualistic frame. Participants occasionally read political texts, but speakers—including public officials and family members—relied primarily on poetry and literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122412458785">11</xref></sup> The texts delivered were multivocal—they sustain a wide range of interpretations—and, crucially, the speakers offered little interpretive analysis of their own. Perhaps most strikingly, the Manhattan commemorations were virtually devoid of the moral oppositions that pervaded the dualistic commemorations: they included no references to evil or its synonyms (e.g., barbarism or villainy). Speakers did not even mention terrorism or an enemy. The texts delivered gave voice to grief and loss but rarely invoked heroism or sacrifice or even underlined victims’ innocence. When speakers offered consolation, they generally did so through open-ended references to hope, resilience, and meaning. When describing how the living might honor the dead, they typically invoked kindness, compassion, and service. In contrast to the nationalistic focus in Arlington and Shanksville, organizers reached outside U.S. political and literary canons in selecting texts. Here, a <italic>tragic</italic> mode of commemoration solidified, engaging the problem of theodicy in a far more oblique and ambiguous manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122412458785">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122412458785">2</xref> illustrate the contrast, displaying the most prominent subthemes and their prevalence across the three sites. Again, multiple subthemes can, and indeed do, occur in any given address; for instance, speakers at the Pentagon frequently referred to both the innocence of the dead and the evil of the perpetrators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122412458785">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tragic mode exhibits a subtle temporal structure: in the early years, speakers focused on giving voice to suffering without attributing meaning to loss. Over time, the commemorations more frequently incorporated texts positing that suffering has meaning and encouraging hope or healing. Yet these texts never fully defined what that meaning might be. Neither did the speakers who read them.</p>
<p>Consider representative texts from early commemorations. In 2003, Bloomberg read lines from former U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins lamenting the sheer scope of the losses:
<disp-quote>
<p>Names etched on the head of a pin, one name spanning a bridge, another undergoing a tunnel. A blue name needled into the skin, names of citizens, workers, mothers and fathers, the bright-eyed daughter, the quick son; alphabet of names in a green field, names in the small tracks of birds, names lifted from a hat or balanced on the tip of the tongue, names wheeled into the dim warehouse of memory. So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the heart. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122412458785">ABC 2003</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Collins’s words do not imbue the deaths with any larger meaning: they simply give voice to loss. In 2004, the New York governor, Republican George Pataki, spoke about the pain of losing a child: “Even after the victories of World War II, Dwight Eisenhower, who saw too many young sons die, wrote ‘There’s no tragedy in life like the death of a child. Things never get back to the way they were’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412458785">CNN 2004</xref>). Pataki’s framing is especially striking: even as he referred to combat deaths associated with a celebrated victory, he invoked the language of tragedy—and the notion of indelible loss—rather than heroism or sacrifice. During these early years, even religious references generally stopped short of positing meaning or offering explicit consolation. For instance, in 2004, Bloomberg read a lament from 2 Samuel, in which King David mourns the death of his son: “Oh my son, Absalom; my son, my son, Absalom, would I have died for thee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412458785">CNN 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In later years, speakers engaged the question of meaning more overtly, but nonetheless through multivocal texts. For instance, in 2008, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff read Rumi’s poem “The Guest House”: “This being human is a guest house. Every morning, a new arrival, a joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. . . . Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from the beyond” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412458785">Federal News Service 2008</xref>). Also in 2008, Pataki articulated similar sentiments with lines from Aeschylus: “He who learns must suffer, and even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart. And in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122412458785"><italic>Congressional Quarterly</italic> 2008</xref>). Both texts suggest that human sorrows have purpose without ever explicitly defining the purpose itself. They engage the problem of theodicy, and imply that it has a solution, without defining that solution in specific terms. Religious references, too, shifted toward themes of comfort and healing. In 2011, former mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, read lines from Ecclesiastes: “To every thing there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122412458785">NBC 2011b</xref>)—intimating, but not proclaiming, that the 10th anniversary might mark a shift in “seasons.” When discussing how to honor the dead, speakers emphasized service and everyday acts of kindness. For instance, in 2009, New Jersey governor Jon Corzine, a Democrat, read lines from Emily Dickinson: “If I can ease one life the aching, / Or cool one pain, / Or help one fainting robin / Unto his nest again, / I shall not live in vain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412458785">City of New York 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Family members echoed these themes, although taking a more personal tone. In 2004, Mike Low, whose daughter was a flight attendant, reflected on a visit to the family room set aside for those who lost loved ones in Manhattan: “When I go into the room and look all around it, the photographs of smiling faces, of the young, beautiful, talented lives that were lost, their promises unfulfilled, their dreams burnt away. I think of a line from a 9/11 poem by an American Airlines pilot that simply states, ‘My God, what a wrenching loss’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412458785">CNN 2004</xref>). For Low, three years after 9/11, the deaths were still senseless and wrenching. Low conveyed no sense that they were for a cause. In 2010, Debra Epps, who lost her brother, discussed her own long struggle for meaning. At the commemoration, she read a poem that explained her brother’s death by invoking his exceptional personal qualities: “I said to myself, I know why. God was looking for a captain of a ship, someone who qualifies as a Jedi. . . . Oh, how I want to cry because when God had chosen you, he truly chose a Jedi” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122412458785">CNN 2010</xref>). While Epps’s theodicy certainly glorified her brother’s memory, she made no mention of sacrifice or personal agency: he was <italic>chosen</italic> by God.</p>
<p>Although tragedy is clearly the predominant genre, here, too, there were moments of slippage. Political texts in particular gestured toward the dualistic mode. For instance, in 2011 Bush read Lincoln’s Bixby letter, which served as a crucial “secular theodicy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122412458785">Schwartz 2009</xref>:80) in the United States during WWII.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0003122412458785">13</xref></sup> Bush’s brief preface to the reading, like the text itself, intermingled themes of grief and loss with references to sacrifice: “President Lincoln not only understood the heartbreak of his country, he also understood the cost of sacrifice and reached out to console those in sorrow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412458785">NBC 2011a</xref>). Yet even Bush was constrained by the tragic mode. He delivered only this brief preface to frame the text; in keeping with the commemorative genre, he offered no explicit comparison between the 9/11 dead and fallen soldiers. Tragedy remains predominant, and tragedy accommodates—even thematizes—complexity and ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 1986</xref>). Here, solutions to the problem of theodicy may be sought—and even found, as Epps’s reflections attest—but they are hard-won.</p>

<title>Toward a Sociology of Theodicy: A Four-Part Model</title>
<p>Beyond the obvious importance of engaging with this key event in recent history, the complexity and multiplicity of September 11 make it an ideal case for building cultural theory, for combining close interpretive analysis with an effort to generalize from the case at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122412458785">Griswold 1987</xref>). Methodologically, this requires examining all four points of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122412458785">Griswold’s (1986</xref>:7–8) “cultural diamond”: the cultural object, the social world, the artist or agent, and the audience. Guided by Griswold and drawing on analogous efforts in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412458785">Fine 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122412458785">Olick 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0003122412458785">Vinitzky-Seroussi 2002</xref>), I identify key sociological features that help structure the contrasting theodicies: (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3) audiences, and (4) genre memory. The analysis addresses both fissures between sites and moments of discourse contamination within sites.</p>
<p>In developing this account, I address instrumental, expressive, and historical features that coalesced in shaping the theodicies of 9/11. Such analysis is crucial for understanding 9/11 commemorations and for drawing cross-case comparisons. Ultimately, however, I approach commemorations as “figurations of memory—developing relationships between past and present—where images, contexts, traditions, and interests come together in fluid, though not necessarily harmonious, ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick 2007</xref>:91). Such “figurations” should not be reduced to “an independent or dependent variable, a thing determined or determining” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412458785">Olick 2007</xref>:91). They are instead dynamic “meaning struggles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412458785">Eyerman 2011</xref>:13) featuring an intricate interplay among these factors over time and across distinct commemorative spaces.</p>
<sec id="section11-0003122412458785">
<title>Events</title>
<p>The past is not infinitely malleable. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412458785">Fine (1996</xref>:1186) emphasizes, images of the past must possess a “narrative resonance” with concrete events (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412458785">Olick and Levy 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122412458785">Schwartz 1991</xref>). Although September 11 is generally understood as a single event, there are substantial differences in the occurrences that transpired across the three sites. These differences shape the theodicies of 9/11 in important ways.</p>
<p>Events in Arlington and Shanksville are more readily amenable to the dualistic theodicy of the state than are the events in Manhattan. The Pentagon is a military building and thus invites a war frame and the discourse of heroism and sacrifice intimately associated with it. As the symbolic center of U.S. military power, the space itself veils the diversity of the 184 victims, 129 of whom were civilians. Much as the Pentagon’s symbolic meaning bolsters the dualistic theodicy, the significant civilian losses help account for moments of contamination—for instance, when Bush fleetingly acknowledged an alternative, tragic framing.</p>
<p>Precise details concerning the events that occurred aboard Flight 93 will forever remain inaccessible, yet the available evidence is amenable to the dualistic theodicy in crucial ways. Because Flight 93 departed late from Newark airport, passengers and crew learned from contacts on the ground that the hijacking was likely a suicide mission. After the crash, investigators recovered a recorder that captured the sounds that were audible from the cockpit during the final 30 minutes of the flight. According to the <italic>9/11 Commission Report</italic>, people aboard mounted an “assault” on the cockpit during those final moments. In response, the hijacker at the controls rolled the aircraft from side to side, then up and down, and instructed another hijacker to block the cockpit door. During the struggle, someone involved in the assault said: “In the cockpit. If we don’t we’ll die!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122412458785">National Commission on Terrorist Attacks 2004</xref>:14). The sounds of an assault continued as the aircraft crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>The passengers and crew acted bravely in mounting the assault, and it is almost certain they prevented further loss of life. The evidence thus bolsters references to heroism. Yet references to sacrifice and efforts to equate the Flight 93 dead with fallen soldiers occasionally stumble on the reality of the events. So, too, do claims—such as that of Gonzales—that passengers were motivated by patriotism. The passengers and crew did not consciously choose to enter combat or fight for national ideals. Instead, they strove under unanticipated circumstances, using the information available, to preserve their own lives (“If we don’t we’ll die!”) as well as untold lives on the ground.</p>
<p>The events that transpired in Manhattan differ substantially. The space itself, for one, does nothing to evoke images of war. The World Trade Center was a civilian building, a symbol of U.S. economic dominance and global capitalism. Moreover, none of those who died in New York possessed the vital information available to Flight 93. Passengers aboard the three earlier flights had no reason to suspect the hijackings were suicide missions. The scope of losses in Manhattan was also broader in two ways. First, Manhattan sustained by far the greatest number of losses. Second, although foreign citizens perished at each site, the vast majority died in Manhattan, making the nationalistic claims that underpin the dualistic theodicy more problematic. Perhaps it would be possible to sustain the dualistic theodicy in the Manhattan commemorations, but the events themselves seem to invite alternatives.</p>
<p>The tendency to aggregate the events of September 11 and assimilate them under a single referent obscures the divergence and multiplicity illuminated here. That the unifying referent is a date—and thus reveals little of the event’s (or, rather, events’) nature—fosters even greater ambiguity. Speakers who refer generically to “September 11” can rather easily draw on iconic moments in particular locations to represent a far more complicated series of incidents over several sites. In contrast, the physical separation of commemorations prompts speakers to address more specific, delimited sets of occurrences that references to “9/11” typically conflate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0003122412458785">
<title>Carrier Groups</title>
<p>Events are crucial but not decisive: it is carrier groups, pursuing both material and ideal interests, who seek to establish fit between events and interpretive frames. Such carrier groups are analogous to “agents of memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0003122412458785">Vinitzky-Seroussi 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0003122412458785">Vinitzky-Seroussi and Teeger 2010</xref>) and “moral” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici and Schwartz 1991</xref>) or “reputational” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412458785">Fine 1996</xref>) entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Pentagon commemorations are firmly under state control. They are Department of Defense events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122412458785">Goldberg et al. 2007</xref>) that feature remarks from the Secretary of Defense and frequently include speeches by the president or vice president. State leaders have clear reasons—both instrumental and expressive—to articulate the dualistic theodicy given the space’s significance as a symbol of U.S. military dominance. State legitimacy depends on leaders’ ability to restore the triumphant exceptionalist narrative at the heart of U.S. national identity after a potentially devastating blow. Thus the predominant analogies—to the American Revolution and WWII—call forth the memory of glorious pasts to foreshadow inevitable victory in the future.</p>
<p>Although strikingly similar rhetoric prevails in Shanksville, these commemorations are shaped by an intricate and evolving interplay of carrier groups who share an interest in advancing the dualistic theodicy: families of the dead, the local community, Pennsylvania state politicians, and federal officials. The earliest accounts of Flight 93—which powerfully shaped the prevailing theodicy before the cockpit recorder was recovered—came from family members, filtered through mass media outlets. After learning about the earlier hijackings, a few passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 told contacts on the ground that they were planning an attempt to take control of the cockpit. In a nation reeling with shock and thirsty for heroic narratives, Flight 93 families had significant access to the means of symbolic production. Some conducted interviews on major news networks as early as September 12, and, in tandem with their interviewers, began portraying their loved ones as heroes. Their stories fit neatly with Bush’s dualistic theodicy. Indeed, Bush invited Flight 93 widow Lisa Beamer to attend the September 20 session of Joint Congress, where he hailed “the courage of passengers” such as her husband “who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412458785">Bush 2001a</xref>:1347). Congress acknowledged Beamer with a standing ovation, and Bush frequently invoked Flight 93 in his post-9/11 speechmaking.</p>
<p>Moves to bring the Shanksville crash site (and thus the commemorations) under federal jurisdiction occurred quickly. In the interim, however, another key carrier group—the local community—held the site in stewardship. Somerset County, where Shanksville is located, appointed local public relations consultant Susan Hankinson as overseer for Flight 93 events. She planned the first anniversary events in consultation with the families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122412458785">Gibb 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122412458785">Levin 2002</xref>). In general, Shanksville embraced its unwitting role as a national landmark and portrayed its rural landscape as deeply patriotic, even quintessentially American. “People all across the country just really relate to rural America,” Hankinson reflected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122412458785">Levin 2002</xref>). In 2003, Somerset County obtained the trademark for the slogan “America’s County,” inspired by “people around the country who’d complimented Somerset County for demonstrating ‘the American way’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122412458785">Lash 2003</xref>). In using the slogan, County Commissioner Jim Marker said, Somerset “will try to stress that the war on terrorism began here” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122412458785">Lash 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In September 2002, federal jurisdiction became official. Bush signed legislation—shepherded through Congress by members of the Pennsylvania delegation—authorizing a national memorial in Shanksville and designating the site as a unit of the National Park System. In the ensuing years, federal officials, Pennsylvania politicians, family members, and locals have come together to commemorate 9/11 in the dualistic mode—a mode consonant with the interests of each group, although for distinct reasons.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, there is one clear carrier at the helm whose interests support a vastly different commemorative mode: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who took office in 2002 and was serving his third four-year term as of the 10th anniversary. From the outset, Bloomberg worked with the families to plan the commemorations, appointing a 9/11 widow as a liaison. Ultimately, however, decisions are filtered through his office. Bloomberg issues invitations to speakers, and overseeing the words uttered has been his chief concern. The space itself is owned by the Port Authority, not the federal government, facilitating more localized control.</p>
<p>Just before the first anniversary, Bloomberg explained that the “most important” element of the ceremony was that there be “no political speeches. The families said that a lot, but I think independently I couldn’t agree more” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122412458785"><italic>New York Times</italic> 2002</xref>). Even federal officials at the highest levels have exhibited remarkable deference to the mayor. For instance, Vice President Dick Cheney was scheduled to attend the 2003 commemoration. From the outset, Bloomberg promised that the city would continue “doing everything we can to keep it from being a political event” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412458785">Hu 2003</xref>). However, when it became clear that Cheney’s security needs would represent a significant inconvenience to families, Cheney altered his plans at Bloomberg’s request, and instead attended a Port Authority memorial service later that day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412458785">Barron 2003</xref>). Over time, Bloomberg has continually emphasized that the readings remain strictly within the city’s control. Asked about the planning process in 2007, a Bloomberg spokesman explained that “City Hall organizers found ‘a small pool of readings around a certain theme’” and gave each speaker “‘an option or two’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122412458785">Haberman 2007</xref>). In 2011, Bloomberg responded forcefully to reports that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sought more influence over the ceremony and—in Cuomo’s case—the opportunity to deliver extended remarks. “Nobody is going to give a political speech. This is too much of a solemn event,” he said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122412458785">NY1 News 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0003122412458785">
<title>Audience</title>
<p>Intertwined with—although analytically distinct from—carrier groups are their audiences, both actual and imagined. When public officials speak, their audiences are structured by the constituencies they serve. State-sponsored commemorations, most of all those that address an assault on a national symbol, must therefore first and foremost “reconstitute the nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122412458785">Campbell and Jamieson 2008</xref>:75). When federal officials speak, they inevitably address the national public. In so doing, they must remain attentive to larger political projects, advancing particular policies and evoking a particular image of the nation. In Arlington, the commemoration is a state-sponsored event dominated by federal officials. Here, 100 percent of addresses “flag the nation”: the “we” that speakers address is the national public writ large. Standing alongside a symbol of U.S. military might humbled on September 11, state leaders are compelled to offer the citizenry reassurance that their nation remains—as Bush and Obama have put it—a “beacon” to the world. Evoking a legacy of past military sacrifice enables officials to co-opt the 9/11 deaths and subsequent combat losses into an inexorable march toward freedom’s ultimate triumph.</p>
<p>The scenario in Shanksville is once again more complex. Federal officials and Pennsylvania state politicians play a major role in these ceremonies and speak with an eye to wider constituencies. Furthermore, family members and the local community are simultaneously carrier groups and the immediate audience. Their expectations—as I noted earlier—coincide with the imperative officials face to reconstitute the nation. Indeed, family members often express the perception that their loved ones’ actions did just this. For instance, Flight 93 widow Lyz Glick writes in her memoir that her husband’s actions “convert[ed] a national trauma that might have been unendurable . . . into a moment of sustenance and comfort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412458785">Glick and Zegart 2004</xref>:62). For its part, Somerset County has actively cultivated an image of itself as emblematic of the nation that Flight 93 helped to reconstitute: “America’s County.” In Shanksville, 97 percent of addresses “flag the nation,” demonstrating that distinct carrier groups share common assumptions concerning their audience: again, the national public, which—they claim—Flight 93 fought to protect.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, the audience is simultaneously more delimited and more expansive. On the one hand, Bloomberg has continually emphasized that the commemoration is “about the deceased” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122412458785"><italic>New York Times</italic> 2002</xref>) and thus focused on families’ desires and concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0003122412458785">14</xref></sup> Foremost among these concerns, he claims, is excluding politics. Controversy that erupted in 2007 over Giuliani’s participation supports Bloomberg’s claim. Giuliani, who was mayor on September 11, had participated in previous commemorations, but in 2007, he was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Families, and New Yorkers generally, expressed concern that the commemoration would become a campaign platform—even after Bloomberg emphasized that Giuliani would read a prepared text, not make an original speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122412458785">Haberman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122412458785"><italic>New York Times</italic> 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0003122412458785">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>As city mayor, Bloomberg does not bear a state leader’s responsibility to reconstitute the nation, and he is thus able to attend to this more delimited audience. Yet, interestingly, focusing on mourners broadens the audience beyond the nation’s citizenry. The Manhattan commemorations overtly acknowledge that not all who perished on September 11 were Americans. For instance, in 2008, organizers recruited local students to represent foreign nations that lost citizens. Each representative helped read names of the dead and, afterward, identified the nation they represented. Most of the prepared texts—seven of nine—came from foreign sources whose diversity was explicitly highlighted, and the texts evoked a human, rather than national, collectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0003122412458785">16</xref></sup> More generally, the multivocal texts associated with the tragic mode are responsive to this pluralistic audience. Only rarely do these texts suggest that the 9/11 dead served the cause of freedom. Even when they do, the claim remains an implication. Milestone anniversaries—the first and the 10th—are subtly responsive to the particular national significance they hold. Speakers more frequently flag the nation and read canonical political texts. Yet the predominant focus is the numerically smaller but far more pluralistic group of mourners. Overall, only 22 percent of addresses flag the nation.</p>

<title>Genre Memory</title>
<p>Finally, there are cultural dynamics that operate in a relatively autonomous manner to influence commemorative rhetoric. Examining a decade’s worth of commemorations illuminates these dynamics—what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0003122412458785">Olick (1999</xref>), building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412458785">Bakhtin (1986)</xref>, calls “genre memory”—and how they structure theodicies. Commemorative genres coalesce and then, over time, solidify. These genres may exhibit subtle temporal structures. For instance, in Manhattan, texts positing that suffering has meaning became more common in later years. But each commemoration is structured by earlier moments in the genre.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, for instance, the dualistic theodicy remained remarkably stable even after a change in administrations. Despite profound political differences between Obama and his predecessor, Obama not only remained squarely within the dualistic universe, but even drew on specific rhetorical tropes from the Bush years. Once losses are imbued with the powerful significance that the dualistic theodicy imparts—transformed into sacrifices in an ultimate cause—abandoning the prevailing genre would threaten not only ongoing political projects, but also the <italic>meanings</italic> that reconstitute the nation by assimilating profound suffering into a triumphant narrative. To break with the genre would be to reawaken existential and emotional anxieties generated by this powerful threat to foundational American narratives. The same is true in Shanksville.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, genre memory more frequently conflicts with federal officials’ interests, and the constraints that impinge on even the highest-level officials testify to the power of genre memory. Bush pushed the bounds of the tragic mode, yet onlookers were still left to interpret his reading privately. When Obama spoke in 2011, he read Psalm 46 without offering even basic prefatory remarks. Today, the site itself seems to subdue triumphant political speechmaking and instead elicit polysemic expressions of sorrow. Obama’s visit in May 2011, shortly after Osama bin Laden’s death, offers a powerful illustration. Although freed from the constraints of the formal commemorations, Obama made no remarks. Instead, he simply laid a wreath and bowed his head in silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122412458785">Landler 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Why should sociologists study such rhetorics as theodicy, and through the lens of the issues that the term implies in the sociological tradition? I have offered a threefold rationale for constructing a body of cultural research around the Weberian concept of theodicy. In conclusion, I elaborate how the 9/11 case demonstrates the value that such scholarship offers.</p>
<p>First, sociology provides the tools to understand how explanations deployed in response to the problem of theodicy are patterned and structured. This study highlights how events, carrier groups, and audiences help shape theodicies, and how genre memory structures theodicies over time. In so doing, it provides a richer understanding of September 11—by identifying and accounting for divergent commemorative modes—and a theoretical foundation for cross-case comparison that builds on analogous efforts in the literature.</p>
<p>Second, and in line with literature emphasizing the constitutive role that culture plays in social life, I argue that theodicies may have profound consequences, both symbolic and political. The dualistic theodicy, which so quickly predominated at the federal level, helped direct the American response to an ambiguous event in particular ways. From the dualistic perspective, the appropriate response to September 11 was to wage war—indeed, to wage war not only against a particular delimited enemy, a clear perpetrator, but against “terror,” even “evil,” writ large. The claim that the U.S. response to 9/11 would eradicate evil itself helped to legitimate not only war in Afghanistan but also preemptive strike in Iraq.</p>
<p>Yet the dualistic theodicy was not—and <italic>is</italic> not—the only interpretive possibility. The tragic mode prevalent in Manhattan represents an enduring alternative. While dualism divides the world unambiguously into good and evil—portraying a blameless victim and an irredeemable perpetrator—and drives teleologically toward the triumph of the good, tragedy thematizes ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 1986</xref>). Tragedy “eludes the antithesis between good and evil” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412458785">Frye 2006</xref>:211), the very antithesis that forms the backbone for dualism. It invites reflection, and remains open to discussion and debate. Tragedies recognize that heroes have foibles and that even villains are human, rendering their motives comprehensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 1986</xref>). The dualistic theodicy was probably crucial to the “moral revivification” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122412458785">Alexander 2004</xref>:103) that took place immediately after September 11. Yet interpretations that conceive events strictly in binary terms have a tendency to inhibit compromise, foster insularity, and prolong violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412458785">Alexander 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412458785">Jacobs and Smith 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 1986</xref>). In the long run, the tragic mode established in Manhattan may prove a valuable interpretive resource for reorienting the “effect flow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0003122412458785">Wagner-Pacifici 2010</xref>:1354) of September 11.</p>
<p>Finally, attention to theodicy illustrates why it is ultimately worthwhile and important to study commemoration, memorialization, and similar efforts at meaning-making in the first place: as manifestations of this quintessential human task. The desire for meaning in the face of events that powerfully threaten existing collective narratives, evoke acute emotional responses, and unsettle people’s sense of ontological security is the very impulse behind such rituals. In other words, the question of theodicy is a, if not <italic>the</italic>, central reason why collectivities commemorate traumas and atrocities at all. And this quest for meaning must be understood in its own terms, not only in reference to its political consequences.</p>
<p>The foregoing analysis illustrates this point empirically. The rhetoric uttered during September 11 commemorations is—at its core—directed toward the task of meaning-making. Whether speakers attempt to sacralize the 9/11 deaths and transform the crash sites into the Gettysburgs of the present epoch, or frame the losses as tragedies whose meaning is revealed only with time, their remarks are oriented toward the fundamental problem Weber identified. It is worth remembering that even presidents are constrained by the tragic frame established in Manhattan, where the established genre powerfully conflicts with the dualistic theodicy of the state. It is in this spirit that I advocate reviving the Weberian concept of theodicy as distinct from accounts or modes of justification—to emphasize not just the <italic>functions</italic> of meaning but also the <italic>pursuit</italic> of meaning and the existential and expressive imperatives that animate it.</p>

<p>Although both dualism and predestination view the future as divinely ordained, they differ sharply on the issue of whether ultimate outcomes are accessible to humans. Under dualism, the faithful can be sure they will ultimately triumph. Under predestination, believers can never be certain—hence the anxious striving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0003122412458785">Weber (1958)</xref> observed.</p>

<p>Although Weber focused on theodicies of suffering and “disprivilege,” he noted that people also develop theodicies of “good fortune” that legitimate success: “When a man who is happy compares his position with that of one who is unhappy, he is not content with the fact of his happiness, but desires . . . the right to this happiness, the consciousness that he has earned his good fortune” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0003122412458785">Weber 1922</xref>:107). Suffering, Weber’s discussion suggests, raises the question of theodicy most forcefully, but theodicies also emerge out of a more general impulse to develop a coherent view of the world.</p>
