<abstract>
<p>The politics of African democracies is marked by a curious disjuncture: in spite of severe social diversity and proportional electoral arrangements, dominant parties abound. This peculiarity frustrates the design of constitutional experts, who expect proportional electoral arrangements to translate social cleavages into discrete political parties. In such cases, it follows that the dominant political party – rather than parliament – becomes the primary site of accommodation between competing social formations. Little, however, is known of how groups vie for power within Africa’s dominant political parties; electoral law is largely silent on the subject of intraparty democracy. Under what conditions do dominant parties – understood as coalitions of social formations – remain cohesive? We address this question by looking at the process of candidate selection, often considered ‘one of the best points at which to observe the distribution of power within the party’ (Schattschneider, 1970 [1942]: 64). We conduct a comparative case study of two dominant parties in South Africa and Namibia, using evidence drawn from primary party documentation and interviews with party leaders, officials, candidates and members. We find that inclusive candidate selection mechanisms can stabilize factional competition, while exclusive mechanisms, conversely, can presage elite rupture within the dominant party.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article is about how dominant political parties, competing in divided societies, select parliamentary candidates, and whether variation in such candidate selection mechanisms influences party cohesion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354068811407599">1</xref>
</sup> The subject of our investigation, then, is quite specific, but it is joined at the hip with a bigger question in comparative politics – the conditions under which democracy can survive in ‘plural [divided] societies' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068811407599">Lewis, 1965</xref>: 64). Such countries face a stern test: ‘free institutions', according to J.S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068811407599">Mill (1958</xref> [1861]: 230), ‘are next to impossible in a country made up of different nationalities'. Considering such hard cases, consociational theorists have argued that carefully designed institutional structures – particularly proportional electoral systems – can dampen the destabilizing influences of social and ethnic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068811407599">Andeweg, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Proportional electoral systems are deeply attractive to reformers in new, socially diverse societies for two reasons. First, proportional electoral systems do not punish small parties at the expense of electoral front-runners; instead, group representatives that seek power constitutionally are treated in a ‘completely equal and even-handed fashion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068811407599">Lijphart, 2004</xref>: 100). Proportional electoral systems, according to this view, diffuse political support by providing discrete ethnic groups with proportional parliamentary representation. Second, proportional electoral systems (particularly the Closed-List variant) are expected to ‘encourage the formation and maintenance of strong and cohesive political parties' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068811407599">Lijphart, 2004</xref>: 101). Strong parties, in turn, are thought to provide stability in an environment of uncertainty by shielding party elites from radical elements within their party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068811407599">Andeweg, 2006</xref>: 529).</p>
<p>In Africa’s new ‘electoral democracies', however, this putative relationship between electoral system and party fragmentation, on one hand, and internal party cohesion, on the other, is less than clear. First, it is rarely (if ever) the case that each ethnic group can support its own political party. In the 12 African countries that have conformed to minimal standards of electoral democracy in the past 20 years,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354068811407599">2</xref>
</sup> half of these contain a ‘dominant’ political party irrespective of either the degree of social diversity or type of electoral system. Second, there is scant evidence that PR ‘upholds centralized and strong parties' in new African democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354068811407599">Sartori, 2001</xref>: 102). While Closed-List PR might seem hard-wired for centralized control, there is no <italic>a priori</italic> reason to preclude broad-based involvement by the party membership in the affairs of the party. This assumption, however, is often taken for granted in the literature on electoral system design, which seems puzzling – particularly when extended to dominant parties in divided societies, where ruling parties almost inevitably have a multi-ethnic, or congress-like, character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068811407599">Diamond and Gunther, 2003</xref>: 184–5).</p>
<p>In this article, we examine a small part of the second puzzle by focusing on the relationship between candidate selection procedures and the cohesion of dominant parties in two new African democracies. In the first section, we develop a typology of candidate selection procedures, and suggest how varying ‘selection systems' might influence the cohesion of dominant parties. Our descriptive typology is based on the well-developed literature on candidate selection in western European democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407599">Hazan and Rahat, 2006</xref>). We draw our expectations about how different selection systems might affect party cohesion from the ‘consociational’ literature on party cohesion in divided societies outside Europe, relying heavily on the Indian case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068811407599">Chandra, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068811407599">Lijphart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354068811407599">Weiner, 1967</xref>). In the second section of the article, we describe how the African National Congress (ANC) and SWAPO selected candidates to compete in the 2004 parliamentary elections in South Africa and Namibia, respectively. We explore how constituent factions competed for prized positions on the party electoral list, and evaluate whether systemic differences in the selection of candidates influenced the decisions by faction leaders to remain within, or defect, from the dominant party.</p>
<p>Our argument is that candidate selection mechanisms can alter the likelihood that faction leaders remain loyal to, or defect from, dominant political parties. We contend that two types of candidate selection system (classified as ‘inclusive/decentralized’ and ‘exclusive/centralized’) can provide an incentive to faction leaders to remain within the dominant party, thus exerting a stabilizing effect on the cohesion of the party. We develop the mechanism which links candidate selection with party cohesion in two side-by-side case studies of dominant parties that compete in divided societies under Closed-List PR. In these in-depth studies, we draw evidence from interviews with party candidates, officials, faction leaders and ordinary members – and use a range of documentary material from party sources and media archives. In our conclusion, we make a cautious case for the importance of candidate selection systems as an important determinant of dominant party cohesion, though we underline the limits of this claim, which is based on a method ill-suited to theory-testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068811407599">Gerring, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>How do political parties select parliamentary candidates?</title>
<p>In this section, we develop a typology of candidate selection systems. In addition to its usefulness to our empirical research (imposing a measure of order on an otherwise muddled process), a typology allows us to describe exactly what we mean by ‘inclusive/decentralized’, ‘exclusive/centralized’ selection systems – while also telling our reader about what we have chosen <italic>not</italic> to examine. In this sense, a typology is an essential first step in the process of theorizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068811407599">Bailey, 1992</xref>). In general, candidate selection systems can vary according to a range of dimensions, including the centralization of selection procedures; the degree of inclusiveness at the site of decision-making; candidate characteristics considered helpful, or even necessary, by party selectorates; the formality of the process; and whether selection decisions are taken by popular vote or appointment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407599">Hazan and Rahat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407599">Norris and Lovenduski, 1995</xref>). In our categorization of candidate selection systems, we classify system types according to the <italic>centralization</italic> and <italic>inclusiveness</italic> of candidate selection procedures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068811407599">4</xref>
</sup> 
</p>
<p>The defining feature of candidate selection systems, according to virtually all authors that address the subject, relates to the territorial site within the party that exerts ‘effective control’ over the selection of candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068811407599">Bille, 2001</xref>: 367; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher, 1988</xref>: 4–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407599">Hazan and Rahat, 2006</xref>: 112; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068811407599">Ranney, 1981</xref>: 77–80).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068811407599">5</xref>
</sup> In our typology, we use a basic scale to capture the centralization of selection systems which ranges from highly centralized (selection at the national level) to highly decentralized (selection at the constituency level). Selection of candidates by provincial party structures represents an intermediate category. There are two slight differences between this and other classifications of the centralization measure. First, we do not use ‘membership ballot’ as the epitome of a decentralized selection system. Strictly speaking, the number of party members involved in the selection decision has nothing to do with the territorial organization of the selection contest – a ‘common error’ in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407599">Hazan and Rahat, 2006</xref>: 112). Second, we describe selection systems in plural rather than singular terms. If, for instance, a third of party candidates are chosen by a national party committee, a third by provincial electoral colleges, and a further third by the party bosses within each constituency, we categorize the selection system as three discrete units in our typology. This revision is intended to deal with the astute observation that the locus of selection ‘may not only vary between parties, but may also vary <italic>within</italic> them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher, 1988</xref>: 4).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068811407599">6</xref>
</sup> 
</p>
<p>The inclusiveness of the process provides the second defining characteristic of candidate selection systems. Inclusiveness, understood as the degree and nature of participation at each site of selection, can be divided into four discrete sections. We consider selection by a ballot of party members as the most inclusive way to select candidates; the most exclusive, in contrast, involves selection by a single party leader. Intermediate categories – nomination by an assembly of branch-level delegates and a non-elected committee – are borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811407599">Hazan and Rahat (2006</xref>: 110). To summarize, then, candidate selection systems can vary according to their site within party structures. The site of selection mirrors, ideally, the territorial organization of the party. Participation at each site, in turn, can range from selection by party leader alone to selection by all eligible voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068811407599">Rahat, 2007</xref>). Taken together, these two dimensions of candidate selection procedures (centralization and inclusivity) provide the twelve principal categories of our typology (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068811407599">Figure 1</xref>
).</p>

<title>How do candidate selection systems affect party cohesion?</title>
<p>In western European democracies, research on the impact of candidate selection on party cohesion is ‘in its early stages' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068811407599">Rahat, 2007</xref>: 165). To the extent that an accumulation of knowledge has occurred in ‘old’ democracies, it has centred on the background of parliamentarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher, 1988</xref>: 12–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068811407599">Katz, 2001</xref>: 277; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068811407599">Norris and Lovenduski, 1995</xref>; Rahat and Hazan, 2002: 316) and the behaviour of parliamentarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354068811407599">Siavelis and Morgenstern, 2008</xref>). There is relatively little work, in contrast, which explores the effect of candidate selection procedures on the cohesion of parties (as distinct from the discipline of parliamentarians; see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068811407599">Bowler et al., 1999</xref>). In most new democracies, moreover, the study of candidate selection represents virgin territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407599">Field and Siavelis, 2008</xref>: 626). There is, however, some evidence from new democracies – particularly the Indian case – that indicates how organizational dysfunction can presage the decline of the dominant party (on India, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407599">Kothari, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354068811407599">Weiner, 1967</xref>; on Mexico and Taiwan, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068811407599">Langston, 2006</xref>: 57; on Paraguay, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811407599">Abente-Brun, 2009</xref>). In the following section, we review this literature and summarize two candidate selection systems which might independently reduce the likelihood of elite rupture within dominant parties, thus exerting a stabilizing effect on the cohesion of dominant parties.</p>
<sec id="section4-1354068811407599">
<title>Stabilizing Mechanism I: Inclusive selection systems (Types 1–6)</title>
<p>Our first expectation is that candidate selection mechanisms with a significantly inclusive component – at any territorial site of the party – can exert a stabilizing effect on the dominant party. Our prioritization of the inclusiveness of candidate selection systems marks an important break with the existing (western European) literature, which tends to view centralization as the most important defining feature of candidate selection. Our expectation is based on the literature that treats party dominance in India, where both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811407599">Kothari (1964)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354068811407599">Weiner (1967)</xref> viewed inclusive candidate selection procedures as a crucial accommodative mechanism which reduced the likelihood of elite rupture within the dominant party. In our typology, inclusive selection mechanisms are set out in the top half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068811407599">Figure 1</xref> (Types 1–6).</p>
<p>How does an inclusive selection mechanism exert a stabilizing effect on factional competition? If a successful candidacy is contingent on support from the membership (either directly [Types 1, 3, 5], or indirectly [Types 2, 4, 6]), all candidates have an easily-understood, open and predictable route to access power with the political party. Successful candidates can rely on the legitimacy of a democratic mandate; unsuccessful candidates have a realistic prospect to return to power through mobilization of support among the party grass-roots. ‘Rational’ faction leaders, too, have the opportunity to maximize their representation using a clear intra-party electoral strategy which, in turn, can act as a stable mechanism to ‘mute’ discord among competing factions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068811407599">Chandra (2004</xref>: 102), also writing on the Indian experience, provides a precise account of the mechanism which links inclusive candidate selection systems with party cohesion:<disp-quote>
<p>Competitive rules of intraparty advancement induce elite incorporation by forcing those elites already entrenched in the party apparatus to recruit new elites if they are to safeguard their own positions. At the same time they prevent the displacement of old elites by creating a system of alternation, so that those displaced have a stable expectation of returning.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>An inclusive system of candidate selection, then, can provide all candidates, winners and losers alike, with a strong incentive to remain within the party fold. Losing candidates are more likely to accept defeat if they have a stable expectation of winning office in the future, while successful candidates experience a reliable method to secure elective office.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354068811407599">7</xref>
</sup> 
</p>
<p>Is there any difference between ‘inclusive/centralized’ (Type 1 and 2) and ‘inclusive/decentralized’ (Types 3–6) candidate selection systems? Does it matter if candidates muster support from members or their delegates in national party structures, or lower down the territorial ladder at provincial and constituency venues? If there is a level playing field, we do not expect a significant difference, but if the party leader or dominant faction uses patronage to rally intra-party electoral support, we expect such a mobilizing strategy to be more effective at the national level. Where competition for support takes place at the provincial and constituency levels, in contrast, we expect that provincial and local elites can inoculate themselves from the siren-call of the patronage-rich party leadership. This is particularly the case where state power is devolved: provincial and local elites can use control of provincial state structures to buttress their support within the party. We expect, then, that ‘inclusive/decentralized’ selection systems (Types 3–6) are more conducive to party cohesion than ‘inclusive/centralized’ systems.</p>
<p>Finally, inclusive selection systems can deliver a cohesive outcome in dominant political parties, but only if accompanied by two antecedent conditions. First, each politicized group must have the capacity to mobilize adequate popular support at the relevant territorial site within the party. In resource-poor countries, this capacity is hardly a given; politically relevant groups must overcome a considerable collective action problem, which requires both motivation and organizational capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354068811407599">Toft, 2003</xref>). If groups cannot translate numerical strength into institutional influence within parties – and this applies, in particular, to groups with geographically dispersed support – the inclusiveness of candidate selection procedures will not matter. Second, we expect that the electoral rules used at selection conventions will modify (and, potentially, negate) the stabilizing effect of inclusive selection systems. If, for instance, parties use a highly disproportionate set of electoral rules to select a slate of candidates at the national-level, we would expect to see a higher rate of defection from minority faction leaders who cannot expect to translate their popular support into a proportional number of candidacies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1354068811407599">
<title>Stabilizing Mechanism II: Exclusive/centralized selection systems (Type 7)</title>
<p>In a divided society, group membership is an important determinant of electoral preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068811407599">Horowitz, 1985</xref>). In such countries, party dominance is often based on a broad ‘multi-ethnic’ or ‘congress-like’ character. We contend that the maintenance of such a character does not happen by accident; instead, specific candidate selection systems can help regulate factional competition by providing a mechanism which encourages (rational) faction elites to remain within the party. The accommodation of leading ethnopolitical elites within the ranks of a single party can yield a valuable prize: an ‘ends-against-the-centre’ electoral appeal which keeps opposition parties stuck at the poles of the political spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354068811407599">Riker, 1976</xref>). Indeed, such is the effectiveness of this ‘catch-all’ strategy, it is sometimes considered to be a defining feature of the dominant party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068811407599">Luebbert, 1986</xref>: 80).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068811407599">8</xref>
</sup> 
</p>
<p>In the previous section, we argued that ‘inclusive’ candidate selection systems can provide a reliable method to accommodate competing factions inside dominant political parties. We also noted an important shortcoming of ‘inclusive’ selection systems, which can (according to a recent review of the literature) ‘make it hard to present balanced candidate slates that include representation of women, ethnic minorities or other social groups' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068811407599">Rahat, 2007</xref>: 166). In this section, we argue that an ‘exclusive/centralized’ selection system (Type 7) might produce a balanced party list, which could discourage defection from party factions. The rationale is straightforward: a small cartel of leaders at the national level can behave less myopically <italic>and</italic> coordinate their activities more effectively than a larger, more dispersed group at the provincial and constituency levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068811407599">Axelrod, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068811407599">Olson, 1965</xref>). A grand coalition of faction leaders, then, might provide a stable mechanism to overcome deep-seated group inequalities, thus reinforcing the multi-ethnic/catch-all/congress-like character of the dominant party.</p>
<p>The stabilizing effect of selection by a cartel of senior faction leader is conditional on the composition and behaviour of members of non-elected committees, which convene at the national-level (Type 7). First, the constituent leaders of a Type 7 selection system must approximate the grand coalition (of consociational fame). A grand coalition, in this sense, is a ‘national political elite who are committed to reconciling differences through bargaining amongst themselves' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354068811407599">Young, 1976</xref>: 314). Proportional representation of faction leaders at the site of selection is an important guarantor of a stable (consociational) outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068811407599">Lijphart, 1977</xref>). Under such systems where a party leader alone controls candidate selection (Types 10–12), we do not imagine such an arrangement can deliver a consistent stabilizing effect. Second, if faction leaders do not behave in an inclusive manner – respecting the equivalence of individual <italic>and</italic> group rights – the concentration of power in the hands of a small camarilla of party leaders can degenerate into unpredictable despotism and have severe implications for the cohesion of a dominant party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068811407599">Langston, 2006</xref>: 57).</p>
<p>Finally, we do not expect that ‘exclusive/decentralized’ systems (Types 8 and 9) can deliver an equivalent effect to the ‘exclusive/centralized’ system (Type 7). According to the logic of consociational theory, a single convocation of elites who gather at the territorial apex of the political system is an important (perhaps necessary) component of a stable power-sharing dispensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068811407599">Andeweg, 2000</xref>). If control over candidate selection is devolved to a range of territorially-dispersed sub-national elites, it is considerably less likely (though certainly not impossible) that such bodies could coordinate the construction of a balanced electoral list. Many small consociational parties, in other words, might not add up to a single large consociational party.</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>In this section, we outline a hybrid research strategy which helps us identify whether and how candidate selection <italic>mechanisms</italic> influence the cohesion of dominant parties, and whether varying selection systems exert a causal <italic>effect</italic> on the cohesion of dominant parties. In our first, mainly descriptive task, we seek to lay bare the putative causal mechanism which links candidate selection with party cohesion. We provide a thick description of a sequential process (the selection of parliamentary candidates) inside two political parties over a short period of time, which provides an opportunity to establish whether and how the incentives offered by candidate selection systems influenced the behaviour of faction leaders. In our second task, we consider whether a comparison of the ANC and SWAPO can help shed light on the relative causal <italic>effect</italic> that different selection systems exert on the cohesion of dominant parties. In order to control for competing variables which might also account for varying levels of dominant party cohesion, we select cases that differ according to the independent variable of interest (candidate selection system), but are similar in all other relevant respects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354068811407599">Van Evera, 1997</xref>: 77). While such a combination of within- and cross-case analysis is a recommended method of evaluating theoretical propositions, we are at pains to underline that our approach is based primarily on within-case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068811407599">George and Bennett, 2005</xref>: 153–6).</p>
<p>The first strand of our empirical research involves in in-depth examination of the 2004 ANC and SWAPO parliamentary candidate selection process. Such an approach is driven by the informal, and often muddled, nature of intra-party decision-making. In his seminal study of candidate selection in western Europe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811407599">Gallagher (1988</xref>: 6) recommends ‘in-depth interviews with all those involved in the process: central party officers, deputies, selected candidates, unsuccessful aspirants, local party elites, ordinary branch members and so on.’ In the African context, such a ‘labour-intensive approach’ is particularly useful: little is known about candidate selection in new African democracies, and there may be an important disjuncture between formal party rules and the actual practice of candidate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068811407599">Ohman, 2004</xref>). The warning of an early student of African parties is worth relaying in its entirety:<disp-quote>
<p>It is always difficult to move from discussing the formal constitution of a political party to a realistic account of how it works; this difficulty is increased in countries (like those in Africa) in which the formal constitution of the party is derived from foreign models and is silent about vital factors in party formation and activity which are derived from the social and cultural environment of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354068811407599">Zolberg, 1966</xref>: 11).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thick description, then, should yield a high analytical dividend, allowing us to locate more or less accurately the locus and inclusiveness of candidate selection. An ‘under-the-bonnet’ case study, in addition, can help identify any mechanistic link between candidate selection with party cohesion. If our putative explanation is at work inside dominant political parties, we can expect to find appropriate evidence that factional elites consider the systemic incentives of candidate selection regimes in their calculation of how to further the interests of their respective factions. In interviews with over seventy-five faction leaders, successful and unsuccessful parliamentary candidates, party officials and members – as well as close reading of media reports of the process and its aftermath – we sought to examine the <italic>intentions</italic> of key party actors during the process of candidate selection. The bulk of our fieldwork was carried out in Cape Town and Windhoek in October–December 2005.</p>
<p>In addition to our within-case analysis, we also consider whether cross-case comparison might tell us anything about the relationship between candidate selection and party cohesion. In order to isolate and evaluate a causal effect, it is advisable to investigate whether any alternative factors might account for the cohesion of dominant parties. Factors that help shape the behaviour of faction leaders (specifically, the decision to remain within or defect from the dominant party) can be classified as either long-range <italic>structural</italic> variables or mid-range <italic>intervening</italic> variables. In the first category, we expect that faction leaders are more likely to exit ruling alliances when electoral systems are permissive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068811407599">Amorim Neto and Cox, 1997</xref>); federal devolution of state power is extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068811407599">Chhibber and Kollmann, 1998</xref>); ethnic fragmentation and concentration is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068811407599">Horowitz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068811407599">Mozaffar et al., 2003</xref>); and party system institutionalization is weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068811407599">Birch, 2002</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068811407599">9</xref>
</sup> The rationale, in essence, is that any structural characteristic that lowers the cost of entry to parliament – and, in turn, provides disgruntled faction leaders with an easier exit option – can have a causal effect on the cohesion of dominant parties.</p>
<p>In the second category, we list party characteristics that might have a bearing on the cohesion of dominant parties. First, and most importantly, the existence of institutionalized patronage networks – based, often, on the inflation and politicization of the public sector – can allow the party leadership to skew the electoral playing field, thus altering the incentives felt by faction leaders to defect or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068811407599">Acemoglu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068811407599">Magaloni, 2006</xref>). In Africa’s new democracies, where there is a strong suspicion that ethnic patronage sustains fragile ethnic coalition in office, the potential impact of this variable is acute (Erdmann, 2007: 46; Horowitz, 2000: 164–6). Second, strong partisan loyalty might offset the ‘rationality’ of the option to exit the party. In some political parties, most notably parties of the left, the faithfulness of party stalwarts might make defection unthinkable – and, as a consequence, negate the influence of candidate selection. Third, the locus of control over party finance might influence the decision to defect. In parties that centralize financial resources, factions might struggle to launch an independent electoral effort. Equally, ready access to new sources of funding might lower the barrier to defection from the dominant party. In short, there are many variables which might influence the cohesion of dominant parties.</p>
<p>The ANC and SWAPO are good – though certainly not perfect – candidates for comparison. There two parties differ in important respects, which limits considerably any inference based on cross-case analysis of the two parties. South Africa is a large, industrialized state with a salient class-based political cleavage, while Namibia is an agrarian society rich in mineral resources. In the ANC, the basis of party factions is quite different: unlike SWAPO, the ANC has two important class-based groups (the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the Communist Party). In SWAPO, conversely, ethnoregional identity is the building block of factional competition. SWAPO, in fact, is more similar to other multi-ethnic, congress-like ruling coalitions that lie north of the Limpopo. Finally, the organizational density of SWAPO is fundamentally different to the ANC – the former has a minimal bureaucratic presence outside Windhoek; the ANC, in contrast, bears many of the hallmarks of the mass-based party (of west European provenance) and is perhaps evolving towards an ‘electoralist’ party structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068811407599">Lodge, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Given these important differences, then, we are loath to claim that our cross-case comparison can offer a strong test of the causal relationship between candidate selection systems and party cohesion. But we are willing to claim such a comparison offers at least a weak test. The ANC and SWAPO, after all, share many important characteristics. Potential party ‘splitters' face similar structural incentives: in both countries, the cost of a parliamentary seat is low (South Africa and Namibia employ a highly proportionate version of Closed-List PR to elect members of the lower house of parliament);<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354068811407599">10</xref>
</sup> there is a moderately high number of ethnic groups that might act as a platform to a breakaway party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354068811407599">Posner, 2004</xref>: 856); both countries are unitary in nature; and both countries have a highly institutionalized party system. Both parties shared similar parliamentary majorities in the run-up to the 2004 parliamentary elections. In cultural terms, too, a less dissimilar pair of dominant parties would be difficult to find. Finally, the ANC and SWAPO selected candidates in radically different ways.</p>

<title>Candidate selection and party cohesion in the ANC and SWAPO</title>
<p>Our argument is that ‘inclusive/decentralized’ (Types 1–6) and ‘exclusive/centralized’ (Type 7) selection systems exert a stabilizing effect on (factionalized) dominant parties. In this section, we develop these propositions through in-depth analysis of the 2004 candidate selection process in the ANC and SWAPO. As a first step, we describe briefly the different factions within each party, which should provide an idea of the axes of intraparty competition. The factional basis of each party is quite different. The ANC is, in fact, a ‘tripartite alliance’, which comprises three discrete organizations with constituent membership, professional bureaucracy, and hierarchical organizational structures (the Congress of South African Trade Unions; The South African Communist Party; and the ANC). The ANC is also a multi-ethnic alliance with a wide range of politicized ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354068811407599">McKinley, 1997</xref>: 66). In their review of ‘ethnopolitical’ groups, Scarritt and Mozaffar list a national dichotomy (‘Africans' and ‘Whites'), with further distinction within the two families, including Afrikaans- and English-speakers, Zulu, Xhosa, Sepedi, Setswana and Sesotho.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354068811407599">11</xref>
</sup> There are two additional, though separate, entities with political relevance: the ‘Coloured’ and ‘Indian’ groups.</p>
<p>Factions within SWAPO are based on the country’s ethnopolitical groups. The Ovambo ethnic bloc, which is the core constituency of SWAPO, resides in the four most populous regions of the country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1354068811407599">12</xref>
</sup> This ‘Ovambo-centric tilt’, as it has been termed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068811407599">Leys and Saul, 1995</xref>: 42), has provided SWAPO with an in-built electoral majority: just under 40 percent of the electorate is based in four of the country’s most northerly regions. Although there are a number of other important ethnopolitical groups in the country, the key factions within SWAPO revolve around the principal ‘tribal’ division within the Ovambo ethnic group: between the Kwanyama-speaking residents of Ohangwena and the Ndonga-speaking residents of Oshana, Oshikoto and Omusati. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068811407599">Table 2</xref>

<title>The African National Congress: Hybrid selection system (Type 4 and Type 7)</title>
<p>The 2003–4 ANC ‘list process' was a (highly formalized) hybrid of a decentralized delegate-based selection system (Type 4) and a centralized, committee-based selection system (Type 7).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1354068811407599">13</xref>
</sup> In order to qualify for candidacy, aspirant candidates within the ANC were required to have paid their membership dues and demonstrated a ‘track record of commitment’ to the movement; no criminal record (with the exception of political crimes before April 1994), and no history of corruption, ill-discipline or any other breach of the ANC Code of Conduct. In a document entitled, ‘Through the Eye of the Needle’, the ANC lists gender, age, geographic representivity, and continuity as core criteria of a balanced list – and intervention by list committees is couched in these terms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1354068811407599">14</xref>
</sup> The only hard-and-fast rule that the ANC has with respect to the qualities of the candidates, however, is that every third candidate on the electoral list is female.</p>
<p>The Type 4 component was used to construct a list – comprising, in total, 200 names – in each of South Africa’s nine provinces. (In each province, lists contained approximately twice as many candidates as hoped-for seats.<sup>15</sup> The crucial stage of selection took place at an electoral college, where 90 percent of delegates were drawn from branch-level structures. The remaining delegates were sent from party affiliates such as the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the South African National Civic Association. In each province, delegates were presented with a ballot paper that contained all eligible candidates that had secured nomination from at least five branches in the province. Delegates rank-ordered aspirant candidates using a version of the (highly disproportionate) ‘approval’ vote mechanism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1354068811407599">16</xref>
</sup> The final list is then sent to the provincial executive of the ANC for approval who intervene, in theory, only if the list is unbalanced according to set criteria.</p>
<p>The system, on paper, is clearly highly inclusive: there is a heavy onus on candidates to rally support from branch-level delegates. In reality, too, participants – senior party officials, ordinary members, and both successful and unsuccessful candidates – confirm the open nature of the internal selection process. It is branch-level delegates, according to a member of a provincial executive, that ‘decide what happens in the ANC’, while another well-known ANC stalwart (who was ‘saved’ through central party intervention on the Type 7 section of the list process) argues that ‘if you’re popular [among branch members], you’ll get in; if you’re more borderline, you might get displaced’ but the provincial executive committee only intervenes if there’s a ‘skewed result’. According to one senior ANC parliamentarian, it is ‘very difficult to engineer a [candidate’s] presence [on the electoral list] if there is not significant ANC branch level support’. Broadly, this claim can be supported empirically by comparing the 2003 draft list of Western Cape provincial-national candidates before and after intervention by the list committee – the identity of candidates that occupied all safe seats was exactly the same, with minor changes to rank-ordering (on grounds of sex). This Type 4 selection system, then, is based on a fundamental inclusivity, which prioritized the role of ordinary members and their delegates. This finding rebuts the prevailing wisdom that ‘[ANC party] leaders determine who the candidates will be and where their names are put on the list’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068811407599">Gouws and Mitchell, 2005</xref>: 366; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068811407599">Reynolds, 1999</xref>: 128). Our evidence, in contrast, concurs with the observation of a participant that this section of the list process, though ‘unwieldy and cumbersome’, is also ‘profoundly democratic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068811407599">Feinstein, 2007</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>The national list process of the ANC, in contrast, is both a good deal more centralized and less inclusive. As in the provincial processes, an assembly of branch-level ANC delegates from across the country met to deliberate upon the construction of the national list. Unlike the provincial processes, however, the delegates did not rank-order the list through a competitive vote. Instead, the national list committee – a group of nine senior ANC figures appointed by the party’s highest national organ – determined the order of placement of each candidate. The assembly of delegates, in turn, ratified the list presented by the committee. The long list of candidates numbered approximately 1000 names, and the short list needed to be reduced to 200. This reduction, in the first instance, was based on the strength of support from branches who nominated candidates to the national list. The crucial rank-ordering – particularly among marginal candidates – was carried out within the committee. In the national list process, the role of the party ‘bosses', to use Reynolds's term, was quite significant – but it is noteworthy that the composition of the national list committee included representatives of diverse ANC factions. When we place these types of committee-to-convention system alongside their European counterparts, there are some marked parallels: in each German province a small number of senior party figures in German parties propose a list of suitable candidates, which is then sent to lower echelons of party delegates for approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354068811407599">Roberts, 1988</xref>: 94–119). In Norway, as well, a similar process takes place with delegates meeting to adopt or modify a list prepared by a selection committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1354068811407599">Valen et al., 2002</xref>: 169–215).</p>

<title>SWAPO: Hybrid selection system (Type 2 and Type 10)</title>
<p>The 2004 list process in SWAPO can be categorized as a relatively formalized hybrid system that contains two constituent parts: a centralized delegate-based system (Type 2), and a centralized party leader-based system (Type 10). The majority of candidates were selected at a national electoral college, although this body did not allow decisive participation from branch-based delegates, while the party president selected just under 20 percent of candidates. (The party secretary-general and deputy secretary-general are placed automatically at the head of the list.) Candidacy requirements were similar to the ANC: according to the SWAPO election guidelines, any candidate that seeks nomination to the National Assembly must be a ‘loyal, committed, reliable, capable, and suitable’ member of SWAPO in ‘good standing’ (paid-up and registered). Aspirant candidates had to be financially solvent and have no criminal record. The process, in addition, was less formalized than in the ANC. The selection process in SWAPO, in contrast, was not laid down in a comprehensive document – though a party document with some nominal information exists; instead, convention and a careful informal understanding among key actors directed the selection process.</p>
<p>Of the 55 candidates that won seats in the election, 47 were selected at the national electoral college. Just under half of the 187 delegates that attended the 2004 SWAPO electoral college were either incumbent candidates or members of the party national executive (49%); a further third or so of delegates were sent by SWAPO branches (35%); while the remaining delegates were taken from the party youth, women and elder’s wings (14%) and the trade union movement (2%). The ballot sheet listed all 119 candidates – incumbents, national executive committee members and 26 provincial nominees (two from each province) – in alphabetical order. The voting method was more or less identical to the limited vote system used at the provincial electoral colleges of the ANC; each delegate was able to cast seventy-two votes, one for each position on the electoral list to be filled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1354068811407599">18</xref>
</sup> The party ‘Politburo’ – the highest elected committee in the party structure – approved formally the electoral list.</p>
<p>Given the marginal role of party delegates, the electoral college component of the system is difficult to categorize. It was patently not an exclusive system: delegates held a competitive vote to select approximately four-fifths of the parliamentary caucus. But the principle of inclusivity, nonetheless, was diluted significantly. In the 2004 SWAPO electoral college, approximately one-in-two delegates, and four-in-five candidates, were either incumbents or members of the national executive committee, while approximately a third of delegates were drawn from party branches. The role of the party leader, in contrast, is clear-cut example of a Type 10 selection system. In 2004, the party leader placed ten candidates in safe electoral seats; nor did he need to draw his appointees from among electoral college candidates. The discretion of the party leader, however, was not absolute: in 2004, there was a clear though informal expectation that the president should consider how his choice might influence the overall balance of the electoral list.<sup>

<p>Candidate selection in SWAPO, then, was highly centralized – the party leader had a strong hand in the shaping of the parliamentary party – but also contained an inclusive component that allowed participants to rank-order prospective candidates through a competitive election. Compared to other emerging democracies, such a centralized system is not unusual – few parties in such countries devolve control over selection to lower tiers of party structures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811407599">Field and Siavelis, 2008</xref>). Evidence from Latin America, in particular, points to highly centralized selection mechanisms among parties. In a study of thirteen ‘parties of the left’, only one used some form of primary to select candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354068811407599">Wuhs, 2006</xref>). Nor is extensive involvement by the party leader unheard of in other democracies. In Mexico, for instance, the leader of the Institutional Ruling Party selected all candidates for senate elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354068811407599">Wuhs, 2006</xref>: 33). In fact, the ANC system – which allows decisive input from branch-level delegates in the selection of at least half the parliamentary party – provides the exception to the rule.</p>

<title>Candidate selection and party cohesion in the African National Congress</title>
<p>The cohesion of the ANC rests, in the first instance, on continued cooperation among the partners of the tripartite alliance (the ANC, COSATU and the SACP). The stress on this alliance, which reached its apogee in the early-to-mid 2000s, was considerable (Gevisser, 2007: 767). Many trade unionists and Party figures disagreed vehemently with the increasingly centralized nature of decision-making under President Mbeki. But critics to the left of the president also railed against the policy decisions of successive ANC governments, which have been described as ‘technocratic liberalism combined with patronage-inflected resource flows from the state’s numerous white-elephant projects and Black Economic Empowerment deals' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068811407599">Bond, 2009</xref>: 81; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811407599">Habib and Taylor, 2001</xref>).<sup>

</p>
<p>Our evidence suggests that the tripartite alliance maintained its cohesion because those left-wing factions, who might have split from the party, considered they stood a better chance of enacting policy change from <italic>within</italic> the ANC by taking advantage of the openness of the system. The parliamentary candidate selection system, of course, was not the only route through which factions could pursue their interests – the race for the presidential nomination was pivotal – but it is fair to say that the presidential and parliamentary races represents two sides of the same coin. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068811407599">Cherry and Southall (2006</xref>: 77) concur, finding that, rather than choose exit, the COSATU leadership preferred to ‘encourage trade unionists to challenge for elections [inside the ANC] and to encourage ordinary trade unionists to swell the ranks of the ANC’. Support, in turn, among the COSATU membership for continued partnership with the ANC remains high and, in fact, grew between 1999 and 2004. In 1999, only 10 percent of respondents (to a representative survey of COSATU members) felt that the trade union federation should form its own worker’s party; in 2004, this figure has decreased to 7 percent.</p>
<p>The second key (and, arguably, unhappier) faction within the tripartite alliance, the SACP, also faced a similar set of choices to COSATU. The likelihood of a SACP break from the alliance, however, was greater than the chances of COSATU pulling away from the ANC. The SACP, is a ready-made political party – complete with all the organs and infrastructure of a political party – and could contest elections at reasonably short notice. They also have quite a few high-profile ANC members with executive and legislative experience. The strategic decision by the SACP to remain within the alliance was quite reversible. According to senior party figures, the SACP considered three options: maintaining the status quo, lobbying for a formal quota of SACP members on the ANC list or running a completely independent SACP slate of candidates. This choice, according to a member of the party steering committee, was the ‘burning issue’ in debates held on the executive committee of the SACP in the early 2000s. Interestingly, the SACP leadership rejected running their own slate of candidates in elections. Running as an independent party, according to one figure, was a ‘highly risky strategy’. Internal party research suggested that support for an independent SACP was unpredictable: support among the electorate for a ‘left-wing workers party’, by this account, varied from 5–18 percent. This uncertainty gave elites a strong disincentive to split from the tripartite alliance. The SACP leadership, in addition, wanted to avoid at all costs the prospects of going into direct electoral competition with the ANC for the ‘core constituency … in the squatter camps'.</p>
<p>The second option – a formal quota of SACP candidates on an ANC list – was the more seriously mooted alternative, most notably suggested by then deputy-president of the ANC, Jacob Zuma. The logic behind this position was that a ‘block’ of SACP MPs could ‘pull the debate to the left and allow the ANC to offer a Marxist response to the free-market capitalism of Tony Leon and the DA’. Again, the decision to reject the second option can be traced to rational, self-interested motives. According to one figure, ‘although one can talk of a gentleman’s pact between the ANC and the SACP the fact is that … if we were part of the ANC list as a quota, we would end up with far fewer [MPs] than we have got.’ Ultimately, the decision of the SACP to retain the status quo rested (by the accounts of our interviewees) on two factors. First, the SACP leadership valued greatly, and took advantage of, the strength of ANC branch-level support for SACP candidates who ‘have established themselves as ANC members and have a popular base there’. It is this support, according to a member of the SACP steering committee, that has helped give the SACP approximately 75 members of the ANC caucus. The party leadership, furthermore, were ‘confident’ that the process of candidate selection within the ANC is sufficiently competitive to allow ‘SACP members, as active members of the ANC, [to] be elected … in sufficient numbers not to cause undue concern. This decentralized nature (or ‘openness', to use another interviewee’s words) of the candidate selection process, then, was directly related to the continued cohesiveness of the tripartite alliance. The ‘overriding concern’ of the SACP, indeed, was to ‘ensure the list process was as democratic as possible’.</p>
<p>The continued satisfaction of the SACP to retain the status quo, moreover, is bolstered at the upper levels of the selection process by a ‘tacit presence’ and ‘sensitivity [among the ANC leadership] to ensuring that there are some senior SACP personalities playing an active role in ANC list [process]’. The SACP have had demonstrably high levels of success in exerting an informal influence over the selection of candidates – away from the electoral colleges and in the ‘smoke-filled’ backrooms of the alliance. Another senior leader pointed out that they had ‘eight or nine people we thought should be moved to a safe position on the list…with one or two exceptions, we were successful with that.’ The openness of the ANC list process, then, seems to have encouraged the left-wing component of the alliance – disgruntled with government policy – to further their interests by competing for positions of influence inside the alliance.</p>

<title>Candidate selection and party cohesion in SWAPO</title>
<p>The cohesion of SWAPO rested on continued acquiescence of its constituent ethnoregional groups. In this respect, the 2004 selection process was distinctly unsuccessful: following a selection contest fraught with ill-feeling, a faction based largely in Ohangwena split from the party. The root of this decision to quit the alliance can be traced, in part at least, to the group’s disastrous showing in the electoral college ranking of candidates. The scale of the defeat was considerable: of the 72 names on the electoral list, 55 candidates were elected – a figure which tallied, more or less, with pre-election Swapo predictions. Of the 18 candidates that were ranked outside the top-55, however, ten hailed from Ohangwena. Indeed, only two candidates from Ohangwena made it to parliament. All other groups, in contrast, secured safe seats in approximate proportion to their size. The question, then, is what factors can account for this sizeable defeat suffered by the Kwanyama-speaking ethnopolitical group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068811407599">Table 2</xref>)?</p>
<p>There were, we contend, two factors which led to the defeat. First, the Kwanyama-speaking faction had to contend with the trenchant opposition of the (patronage-rich) dominant faction, led by the party president (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068811407599">Hopwood, 2004</xref>: 4). This opposition was formidable – and it is not unthinkable to argue that delegates within the electoral college did not exercise their franchise with a free will.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1354068811407599">21</xref>
</sup> In a clientelistic party, moreover, the balance of power is tilted away from delegate to elite. The weak position of the Kwanyama-speaking faction was further compounded by the electoral system used at the electoral convention: of all electoral systems, the ‘block vote’ is the ‘least proportional of all [which] enables a majority, or even the strongest minority, to take all the seats in a constituency’ (Gallagher, 2005: 593). During the course of the electoral college to select parliamentary candidates, the party president had taken care to signal clearly the identity of the candidates associated with the rival faction – a ‘blacklist’ of 35 faction members was announced from the podium and later circulated by supporters among delegates. Such is the nature of the ‘block vote’ electoral system, that a readily-identifiable minority, if voted against consistently, could not expect to perform well. The highly majoritarian voting system used at the electoral college placed the minority faction at a marked disadvantage. The selection role of the president (Type 10) also deepened the rupture between rival factions. In his nomination of ten candidates, the scale of the Kwanyama loss was ignored by the party president – of the ten nominees, the president included representatives from all ethnic groups <italic>except</italic> the Kwanyama. Ndonga-speakers, in contrast, received disproportionate support.</p>
<p>The series of intra-party electoral defeats (the Kwanyama-speaking faction had also lost the preceding presidential selection contest) led directly to the formation of a breakaway party, the Rally for Democracy and Progress. Over the course of 12–18 months, a raft of high-profile party members were either expelled or resigned from the party. Within six months, they were joined by a number of other senior party figures, including the leader of the Kwanyama faction, to launch a new political party. The question, of course, is whether a different type of selection system – a system which contained a significantly inclusive component – would have discouraged the Kwanyama-speaking faction leader from launching the new party. None of the leading faction leaders was willing to speak to us at the time of our initial investigations – we carried out interviews at, more or less, precisely the same time the ‘plotters' were making their first moves – but we do have some indirect evidence. One high-profile defector, in a press interview shortly after his expulsion, pointed to the selection convention as key factor in this destabilization process, alleging that at the electoral college the party president ‘led a group of strategically placed people from the Omusati region with the aim of destroying anyone who questions his leadership – especially the Kwanyamas' (Nyamu, cited in <italic>The Namibian</italic> December 14, 2005). The leading defector, too, referred to the ‘autocratic’ nature of Swapo’s internal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811407599">EIU, 2006</xref>: 14), while a prominent academic supports Nyamu’s analysis, pointing to the ‘authoritarian mindset of the Nujoma faction’ (Melber in <italic>The Namibian</italic> November 9, 2007). The editor of the country’s only privately-owned newspaper daily also argued that ‘the heart of the issue is the autocratic leadership style of Nujoma himself’ (Lister in <italic>The Namibian</italic> February 9, 2007). Even one of the individuals on the winning side agreed, when interviewed, that the parliamentary selection process ‘very destabilising.’</p>
<p>Is it not unreasonable to suggest, then, that had the party leader governed in a more consensual manner things might have worked out differently. Beyond the (generally unpredictable) actions of the party leader, however, we can also make some inferences about the structure of the candidate selection contest. First, had a proportional electoral system been used inside the electoral college, the scale of the Kwanyama defeat would not have been so severe. Second, and more importantly, had the number of delegates from Ohangwena been proportional to the size of its population, the calculations of their representatives might have been quite different.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have sought to describe how candidates were selected in two dominant parties in southern Africa, and whether variation in the selection system influenced party cohesion. What can we say, then, about this neglected aspect of political competition in new African democracies? The stand-out finding is descriptive. In the ANC, party rank-and-file played an important role in the selection of parliamentary candidates in 2004, though popular participation was carefully circumscribed by backroom negotiation among faction elites at the national-level. In SWAPO, conversely, party members (and their delegates) played second-fiddle to a relatively small coterie of party notables, including the powerful party leader. Such description is valuable: the inclusiveness of candidate selection is a useful barometer of party democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068811407599">Rahat, 2007</xref>: 158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068811407599">Ranney, 1981</xref>: 103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354068811407599">Schattschneider, 1942</xref>: 64). The ANC, in this respect, is a highly democratic political party. The democratic stock of SWAPO, on the other hand, is extremely low.</p>
<p>The ferocity of the contest for placement on the party list also yields an insight into the nature of democratic competition in Africa’s new (divided) democracies. In both South Africa and Namibia, politicized groups (in the form of factions) competed fiercely within the two dominant parties to secure access to the spoils of office. The stakes were high: under Closed-List PR, prominent placement on the electoral list of the dominant ruling party is tantamount to election to high office. In both countries, the opposition was a deeply unattractive vehicle for ambitious politicians; opposition parties suffered from a severe crisis of legitimacy. In the ANC, however, the power of party factions to determine party candidacies suggests an interesting line of inquiry: in the absence of a viable opposition, to what extent might factional competition within dominant parties offer an alternative to group competition between parties? In this sense, political competition in South African and Namibia is certainly ‘uncommon’ (by western standards), but it is not necessarily without democratic content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068811407599">Giliomee and Simkins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354068811407599">Pempel, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we contend that factional competition for prized parliamentary candidacies left an indelible mark on the cohesion of dominant parties in South Africa and Namibia. In the ANC, we found evidence that a carefully designed hybrid selection system (which combined an ‘inclusive’ and ‘exclusive’ component) offered disgruntled faction leaders a stable, predictable means to further their group interests inside the ranks of the dominant party. It is, however, difficult to untangle the relative effect of each component of the system. Inclusivity clearly mattered to left-wing faction leaders, who were able to mobilize a disciplined cadre of party members to support faction candidacies. Faction leaders also made good use of the small, exclusive committee system that dictated candidate selection at the national-level. It may well be that the latter structure provided faction leaders with an opportunity to enforce discipline, but it clearly played an important role in the maintenance of party cohesion. In the latter forum, certainly, we find a parallel with the Indian National Congress which maintained its dominance, in part at least, through ‘intraorganizational democracy that, however, imperfect, allowed all significant voices to be heard, facilitated internal bargaining and conflict resolution, and accommodated the demands of various groups' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354068811407599">Sridharan and Varshney, 2001</xref>: 218–9).</p>
<p>Candidate selection was quite different in SWAPO, where a bitterly-contested (and deeply undemocratic) struggle to control the construction of the party list led to the defection of an important faction. Our evidence suggests that the inclusivity of the electoral college process mattered little: the dominant faction (directed by the party leader) took full advantage of the disproportionate voting rules of the electoral college to marginalize the (largely) Kwanyama-speaking group. Had the process been decentralized, it is likely the Kwanyama would have been able to win more candidacies. This finding suggests it would be useful in future studies to take a closer look at the rules used to translate votes into seats at internal party elections. It may not be enough that party selection procedures are inclusive: stable regulation among factional elites may also require proportional voting rules at electoral colleges. The overriding lesson from SWAPO, however, points to the uneasy relationship between democracy and clientelism in African political parties, and the danger associated with the concentration of power in the hands of the party leader.</p>
<p>Finally, can we say anything about the usefulness of (Closed-List) PR in new (divided) democracies? Do proportional electoral systems produce, invariably, cast-iron ‘accommodative’ incentives to elites? What variables might intervene to condition this relationship? A proportional electoral system is ‘the cardinal mechanism’ of the consociational approach to institutional design in divided societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068811407599">Diamond and Plattner, 2006</xref>: xiii). Yet, the palliative effect of PR is uncertain: in new African democracies, there is no firm association between PR and stable, multi-party electoral competition. In this article, we suggest that candidate selection inside dominant parties is an important variable, which mediates the accommodative incentives offered by proportional electoral systems. In our two case studies, we gather strong evidence to support the causal relationship between candidate selection and party cohesion, while cross-case analysis suggests this finding might be felt beyond the immediate confines of our individual cases.</p>

<p>Candidate selection is ‘the predominately extralegal process by which a political party decides which of the persons legally eligible to hold an elective public office will be designated on the ballot and in elections communication as its recommended and supported candidate or list of candidates' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068811407599">Ranney, 1981</xref>: 75). A party that experiences a (negative) change in its cohesion suffers from a high level of resignations, defections, splits and, in the worst case, the complete breakdown or collapse of the party. A cohesive party, it is worth underlining, is not necessarily highly ‘disciplined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068811407599">Bowler et al., 1999</xref>: 5). The latter comprises ‘followers who regularly accept and act upon the commands of the leader or leaders', as well as a leadership that can compel such responsiveness from followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354068811407599">Ozbudun, 1970</xref>: 305).</p>
