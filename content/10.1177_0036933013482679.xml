<sec id="sec2-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The survival of very preterm neonates has dramatically improved, but survival may be at the cost of neurodisability, chronic pulmonary disease and increased adult morbidity. The link between neonatal growth and neurodevelopmental outcome has led to an interest in aggressive early nutrition. However, rapid neonatal growth in preterm infants has also been linked with the development of features of the metabolic syndrome, but the relationship between neonatal growth and childhood body habitus have not been well studied in this population. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To describe (1) neonatal growth and body habitus at follow-up (FU) in very preterm infants and (2) the relationship between these two. <bold>Subjects and methods:</bold> Babies born at 25–32 weeks gestation without major congenital abnormality between January 2003 and May 2007 were included if weight measurements were available at birth (BW), at discharge at more than 3 weeks postnatal age (DW), and anthropometric measurements at 1.5–2.5 years corrected age. 307 out of a total of 540 babies admitted at this gestation were included. Data was extracted from neonatal and follow-up patient databases. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS v18. Weights were expressed as a z-score (sds), and the pattern of neonatal growth expressed as change in weight z-score (ΔWsds) between birth and discharge from the unit. The relationship between neonatal measurements/neonatal growth pattern and follow-up growth status was studied using correlation analysis. <bold>Results:</bold> Gestational age was (median [range]) 29 [23–31] weeks, BW was 1.18 [0.41–2.05] kg, and BWsds −0.02 [−2.74 to +2.77]. Age at discharge was 57 [21–217] days, and DWsds −1.22 [−5.73 to +1.94]. ΔWsds was −1.08 [−5.50 to +0.92]. At follow-up, children were seen at 2.03 [1.5–2.5] years, and had a FUWsds of −0.04 [−6.14 to +4.17], a FU height sds of −0.77 [−6.6 to +5.36], and a FU BMIsds of +4.7 [−3.82 to +5.54]. There was no correlation between BW, DW or their SDS, or ΔWtSDS and FU weight, BMI, or their SDS. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is a fall in weight centile from birth to discharge overall in very preterm infants. This is regained by in early childhood, but there is a relative height deficit at this stage, leading to a BMI centile distribution above that of the normal population. This distinctive pattern of growth might be a marker for cardiovascular and metabolic morbidities in this group and might be useful as a short-term endpoint for interventions to modify these outcomes.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The UK Department of Health states that prophylaxis against Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) is indicated in children born at 35 weeks or less gestation and under 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV season. In practice, this advice is not taken. The aims of the present study were to compare bronchiolitis morbidity in this category of infants and to determine the cost incurred in preventing one bronchiolitis admission by using RSV prophylaxis. <bold>Methods:</bold> Infants aged ≤6 months who were admitted to our hospital with bronchiolitis between 2004 and 2011 were identified and case notes reviewed. The number of infants born at term and prematurely in our region who would have been aged ≤6 months during these winters was obtained. <bold>Results:</bold> There were 402 infants admitted including 52 born prematurely (none with bronchopulmonary dysplasia). RSV was identified in 94% of premature infants and 85% of term infant. The prevalence of bronchiolitis requiring hospitalisation by 6 months of age was 1.2% for term infants and 1.7% for those born prematurely. Infants born prematurely were at increased risk for all indices of severe bronchiolitis including the need for ventilatory support (odds ratio 7.0 [95% CI 2.9, 16.5]), nasogastric feeding (OR 2.2 [1.2, 4.1]), supplemental oxygen (OR 3.0 [1.5, 6.5]) and a longer median duration of stay (89 hours versus 63, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Assuming a 78% reduction in an individual’s risk for hospitalisation and a winter’s treatment costs £6000, 74 premature infants would require treatment to prevent one admission, at a cost of £444,000. Assuming a 5% reduction in admissions for the whole population, 1008 premature infants would require treatment to prevent one admission at a cost of £6 million. The cost of a 4-day admission to Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital is approximately £2500. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Infants born prematurely but without bronchopulmonary dysplasia are at increased risk for hospitalisation and appear to have greater morbidity associated with bronchiolitis. However, after considering the cost analysis, prophylaxis with RSV-Ig does not appear to be justified.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health issued ‘Facing the Future: Standards for Paediatric Services’ in 2010 and in this 10 minimum standards were recommended. RCPCH standard 5 is that at least one medical handover in every 24 hours is led by a paediatric consultant (or equivalent) Also in 2010 the Scottish Paediatric Patient Safety Programme recommended that handover was communicated using the SBAR format. The purpose of this audit was to assess compliance with these standards. Our aim locally was to achieve 95% compliance with handover recording and completion. <bold>Population:</bold> The subjects involved were Specialty Trainees, Advanced Paediatric/Neonatal nurse practitioners and paediatric consultants. <bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed 19 months of saved handover and patient safety briefing sheets. This was done in a 3 audit cycles with measurement of progress. They were assessed for: presence of sheet, actual versus possible, and completion of key variables, record of safety briefing and record of consultant presence. On re-audit we included SBAR, patient safety briefing and introduced some automated functions, e.g. date and consultant of the week. The sheets were manually reviewed and entered onto excel spreadsheet. All data was analysed in MS excel. <bold>Results:</bold> 4483 patient entries were audited.

<p><bold>JD Symonds, A Forster, A Shah and M Kirkpatrick</bold></p>
<p>Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital, UK</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> EEG is very useful adjunct in the classification of the epilepsies, but is widely recognised as a poor diagnostic test for epilepsy on its own. SIGN and NICE guidance advise against its use as such. People without epilepsy can have epileptic features on EEG, and people with epilepsy frequently have normal interictal EEGs. Multiple studies have attempted to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of EEG, but none has previously investigated the extent to which EEG findings specifically <italic>alter</italic> the degree of certainty in a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the extent to which EEG findings alter the degree of certainty in the diagnosis of epilepsy. <bold>Population:</bold> All children receiving a first EEG at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary between 1 August 2009 and 31 January 2010. Exclusion criteria: EEG done for clear reasons other than suspected epilepsy; managed by the adult services; seen privately. This left 126 children. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patient notes were carefully scrutinised. Information on the nature of the episode(s) that prompted each EEG request was gathered. Based on the most senior opinion documented in the notes, the degree of certainty about the diagnosis <italic>before</italic> EEG was categorised into the following five groups: (i) definite epilepsy, (ii) probable epilepsy, (iii) uncertain, (iv) probable not epilepsy, and (v) not epilepsy. EEG reports were reviewed and categorised into the following three groups: (i) clearly epileptic features, (ii) non-specific abnormalities, (iii) normal. The notes were then searched to find out what diagnosis had been made at least 6 months after EEG – this was categorised into three groups: (i) epilepsy, (ii) uncertain, and (ii) not epilepsy. The positive and negative predictive values of an epileptic EEG were calculated, as was the degree of correlation between EEG findings and ultimate diagnosis. Results were analysed by EEG indication and pre-EEG certainty. <bold>Results:</bold> Overall, an epileptic EEG had a positive predictive value of 83%. The negative predictive value of a normal or non-specific EEG was 84%. EEG findings correlated most accurately with the ultimate diagnosis when the pre-EEG certainty was ‘uncertain’ and when the indication for EEG was ‘suspected absence episodes.’ The EEG findings never altered the diagnosis when the pre-EEG certainty was either ‘epilepsy,’ or ‘not epilepsy.’ <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The diagnostic usefulness of EEG depends on the degree of certainty in the diagnosis prior to the test, and on the specific indication. EEG should be avoided if epilepsy has been confidently excluded clinically.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Depression in children is associated with poor school performance, low self-esteem and suicide. Currently fluoxetine is the only antidepressant licensed for this indication. The extent of antidepressant prescribing and associated adverse drug reactions in childhood and early adolescence are poorly documented. <bold>Aims:</bold> To identify anti-depressant utilisation in Scottish children and the potential for drug discontinuation, as an indicator of possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs). <bold>Methods:</bold> Prescribing data held within the Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit Research (PCCIUR) database, which holds information on approximately 1 million patients, was used to assess prescribing and discontinuation of anti-depressant in children aged 16 years and younger, for the period 2006–2009. <bold>Results:</bold> During the study period 464 of 448,154 registered children were initiated on an anti-depressant, an exposure incidence of 0.1%. Fluoxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 210) was the most frequently prescribed followed by amitriptyline (<italic>n</italic> = 149) and citalopram (<italic>n</italic> = 67) with remainder (<italic>n</italic> = 38) encompassing a variety of other antidepressants including imipramine, sertraline, nortriptyline and doxepin. Females formed the majority of recipients, 65.8% for amytriptyline, 67.6% for fluoxetine and 68.7% for citalopram. Compared to the other antidepressants, amitriptyline was prescribed to both young children and adolescent (median age was 15, IQR 12–16 years old) whereas fluoxetine and citalopram were more commonly used in older children (median age 16, IQR 15–16 years). Children prescribed amitriptyline discontinued the prescription significantly earlier (<italic>p</italic> =  0.002 at 1 month) compared to the other antidepressants, with 53.7% discontinue within 1 month and 69.1% by 3 months, in comparison to discontinuation rates of 34.8% within 1 month and 52.4% by 3 months for fluoxetine and 41.8% at 1 month and 56.7% by 3 months for citalopram. Once the index prescription was discontinued, switching to another anti-depressant occurred in 5.7% of patients prescribed fluoxetine, 11.9% of patients prescribed citalopram and 2% of patients prescribed amitriptyline. Using routinely collected healthcare data permitted the identification of children prescribed anti-depressants, the discontinuation rate, assessment of age, gender and co-prescribing patterns. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Routinely acquired primary care healthcare data can be used to assess medication prescribing profiles and drug discontinuations in children. The high discontinuations for antidepressants observed in the present study are similar to those reported in clinical trials and observational studies. Further analysis including linkage with other routinely acquired data sets and/or direct enquiry to prescribers would be required in order to assess the reasons for discontinuation and switching and in the identification of unreported ADRs.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Children with severe neurodevelopmental problems are susceptible to nutritional problems. They also tend to have unusual body proportions which make it difficult to assess nutritional status using anthropometry and body mass index. Measures of body composition are potentially more useful for assessing nutritional status, but are not routinely used in this group. We aimed to use measures of body composition to find out the proportion of children with special needs who are under or overnourished and how this relates to mobility levels and type of disability <bold>Population:</bold> Cross-sectional study involving children (4–16 years) who attended complex needs and physical disability special needs schools in Greater Glasgow. <bold>Methods:</bold> Weight, height/recumbent length, skinfolds (subscapular and triceps) and arm-to-leg bioelectrical impedance (BIA) were measured. Measurements were converted into standard deviation scores (SDS). Fat and lean indices were derived from BIA measurements. Classification of a child’s nutritional status was based on mean skinfolds SDS (undernourished (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> centile), overnourished (&gt;95<sup>th</sup> centile)). Information regarding mobility levels, feeding ability and type of disability (developmental or physical) were gathered from a parentally completed questionnaire. <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 151 children studied 76 (50.3%) were non ambulant. Only 16 (10.6%) were artificially fed. On the basis of skinfolds, 4 (2.6%) were undernourished, but 20 (13.2%) were overnourished. When skinfolds were adjusted for height, 30 (19.9%) children were overnourished. BIA measurements found that these children had a very low lean mass (mean (s.d.) −2.00 (2.34)) and above average fat mass (1.46 (1.47)) and were short (−1.17 (2.11)) for their age. Children with cerebral palsy (25.2% of total) had very low lean mass (−3.25 (1.67)); below average BMI (−0.65 (2.37)) but above average fat levels (1.56 (0.99)). In contrast, children with Down syndrome (12% of total) had above average lean (0.72 (1.22)), fat (0.85 (1.95)) and BMI (0.92 (1.91)). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Children with neurodevelopmental problems are now more likely to be overnourished than undernourished and tend to have very low lean mass, so a low BMI in this group does not usually imply low fat stores.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The autoimmune encephalitides (AE) are a group of conditions with marked neuropsychiatric features, which have been increasingly recognised in childhood research within the last 5 years. Unlike adults, they are not often associated with malignancy in childhood. Nonetheless, they carry significant morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and aggressive treatment with immunotherapy may improve outcome. <bold>Method:</bold> We describe a case series of 5 children aged 2–14 years, presenting to a tertiary paediatric neurology service with AE within the last 2 years. We discuss the presenting features, time to diagnosis, severity, treatments and outcomes. <bold>Results:</bold> Case 1 – A 2-year-old female with encephalopathy, following gastroenteritis. She had a cluster of atypical seizures associated with autonomic instability. Her speech was reduced and slurred, and she was ataxic. Anti-voltage gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies were positive. Following first-line immunotherapy, she made full recovery. Case 2 – A 7-year-old female with a history of focal seizures and personality change, initially diagnosed with a seizure disorder. She deteriorated rapidly, with onset of agitation, insomnia, oro-facial dyskinesia and memory disturbance. A diagnosis of anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis was made. After a course of steroids and rituximab, seizures stopped. She showed marked improvement in behaviour and cognition. Case 3 – A 14-year-old female with a cluster of generalised seizures and aphasia, preceded by behavioural changes. She developed progressive encephalopathy, with fluctuating periods of agitation and facial dystonia. Despite early initiation of steroids, her condition progressed and she required PICU support, plasmapharesis and rituximab. Anti-NMDA antibodies were raised. Memory difficulties persist, but she is now seizure-free. Case 4 – A 14-year-old female with collapse and short focal seizures, on a background fatigue and reduced appetite. She developed an expressive dysphasia and was commenced on first-line immunotherapy. She required admission to PICU. Anti-VGKC antibodies were positive. There were no further seizures, but short-term memory continues to be a problem. Case 5 – A 12-year-old female admitted to PICU with a prolonged focal seizure. She was encephalopathic with expressive aphasia. A diagnosis of Hashimoto’s encephalitis was made based on markedly raised anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. She was treated with first-line immunotherapy. She is now seizure free, with some short-term memory difficulties. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> AE are a group of aggressive conditions, with associated morbidity and mortality. High index of suspicion and prompt treatment improves outcome. Early discussion with tertiary neurology services is recommended.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Case presentation:</bold> We present the case of a male neonate noted at 24-hour check to have mild dysmorphic features, including a prominent forehead, small anterior fontanelle, raised nasal bridge, recessed chin and hypoplastic scrotum with impalpable testes. The infant also had difficulty feeding, with evidence of a poor suck. Following admission to the Neonatal Unit, feeding gradually improved and he was discharged home on day 8. <bold>Genetic diagnosis:</bold> Genetic investigations including array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (array CGH) revealed a complex unbalanced XY translocation with duplication of the distal long arm of the X chromosome. The MECP2 gene is amongst the many genes duplicated in the affected region. Our patient was diagnosed at around 2 weeks of age. <bold>MECP2 duplication syndrome:</bold> Deletion mutations in MECP2 gene on chromosome xp28 are known to cause Rett syndrome in females. More recently however, it has been found that duplication of MECP2 gene is associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype in males, which is 100% penetrant in affected boys. MECP2 duplications are often inherited, although can also arise de novo. MECP2 Duplication Syndrome is characterised by infantile hypotonia, moderate to severe learning disability, delayed or absent speech, epilepsy and recurrent respiratory infections. Affected individuals may also develop stereotyped movements and Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Approximately 120 individuals are known to be affected worldwide. Long-term outlook is unfortunately poor, with less than 50% of affected individuals anticipated to survive beyond their 25th birthday. Female carriers are usually asymptomatic due to X-inactivation. <bold>Discussion:</bold> With increasing availability of array CGH, duplications of MECP2 gene can be identified which may not otherwise have been detected on conventional cytogenetics and this has implications for older children who currently have undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders. Array analysis may potentially provide an answer for these children and their families. We must also be aware, however, that, as in our case, early diagnosis will provide the family with a definitive diagnosis which is both unexpected and catastrophic. With advancing genetic techniques, we must therefore be aware of the implications of very early diagnosis and the consequences this has for families.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0036933013482679"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The worldwide incidence of tuberculosis is increasing.<sup>1</sup> It is estimated that between the years 2000 and 2020 nearly 1 billion people will be newly infected, 200 million people will develop the disease, and 35 million people will die from tuberculosis.<sup>1</sup> The World Health Organisation estimates around 6% of incident cases occur in children.<sup>1</sup> Tuberculosis in a child suggests recent transmission, most commonly from an infectious adult with pulmonary or cavitary tuberculosis.<sup>2</sup> Therefore, accurate diagnosis is important both in respect to overall tuberculosis control in a population, and to instigate early treatment for affected children. However, tuberculosis can often go undiagnosed in children, whether due to lack of access to medical care, or due to a lack of recognition of signs and symptoms. Children show a higher predisposition to extrapulmonary tuberculosis.<sup>3</sup> Around 35% of cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis affect the musculoskeletal system, most commonly the spine and weight-bearing joints.<sup>4</sup> <bold>Case presentation:</bold> We describe a case of tuberculous dactylitis in a 12-year-old Scottish male patient who presented with swelling of two digits. He had no pulmonary symptoms and a chest X-ray conducted at this stage was normal. Blood tests were also within normal limits, except for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 7. The patient was Mantoux and Elispot positive. Tuberculosis was subsequently confirmed from bone biopsies of the affected digits. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case highlights the need to consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with joint swelling, even when they do not describe pulmonary symptoms. Detailed history is also always important, as it transpired the patient had a previous TB contact four years previously. Formal diagnosis can be made by surgical biopsy with cultures for AAFB.</p>

<p>WH was born at 28 weeks gestation and discharged at 36 weeks corrected gestational age. Mum had been breast feeding her 2-year-old child up to the day of delivery of WH then expressed breast milk for WH. At 2 weeks corrected age, she developed a scaly, erythematous rash on the scalp, neck and cheeks suggestive of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Treatment with increasing potency topical steroids and anti-yeast preparations led to no improvement. Oral flucloxacillin was started for suspected infection and the baby was admitted. The rash consisted of large well demarcated, erythematous ulcers with superficial crusting, periorally cheeks, neck and perineum. She was irritable and had loose stools but was afebrile and breastfeeding well. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome was suspected and intravenous antibiotics commenced. After 5 days of continuing rash, a dermatology opinion was requested and the striking clinical appearance allowed the diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica to be established. Serum zinc levels of 2.2 µmol/L (normal 10–18 µmol/L) confirmed this. Oral zinc supplements at 2 mg/kg resulted in dramatic improvement in the rash and irritability within 4 days. Symptoms recurred when zinc was decreased and resolved when increased again. Zinc deficiency may be due to inadequate intake or excessive zinc loss. Mum was zinc-deficient herself from poor dietary intake and prolonged breast feeding of her first child. Mother’s breast milk had zinc levels 50% of the average. WH was also on thiazide diuretics which increases zinc excretion. The cause of the zinc deficiency was therefore thought to be multifactorial, due to poor intake in WH rather than excessive excretion. Acrodermatitis enteropathica can be an autosomal recessive disorder of zinc metabolism or acquired secondary to zinc deficiency. The most common genetic cause is mutation of the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 8q24.3. This encodes the human protein zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein (hZIP4) involved in ionised zinc uptake across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. A second cause is a missense mutation in the SLC30A2 gene. This encodes for a protein, ZnT-2, which when defective reduces the transfer of zinc from serum to breast milk. A typical case presents with the rash, irritability, diarrhoea and failure to thrive. Untreated patients may continue to display neurological and behavioural changes and severe growth retardation and classically die within the first few years of life. These symptoms are usually reversible if treated early with zinc supplementation, resulting in a survival rate of 100%.</p>

<p><bold>Background:</bold> Viral meningitis is usually a self-limiting, mild disease in comparison to the potentially life-threatening bacterial meningitis. Viruses known to cause meningitis include herpes simplex 1 and 2, varicella zoster and mumps, human parechoviruses (HPeV) and enteroviruses including poliovirus. Parechovirus assays have been available since the 1990s; but a link between parechovirus type 3 and CNS-associated infection was not established until 2008. An HPeV assay has been available locally since the beginning of 2011. There is increasing concern that HPeV3 meningitis is a significant illness in infants, and may be associated with long-term neurological deficit. A 5-day-old term infant was admitted to RHSC Edinburgh in May 2012, with irritability, poor feeding, an erythematous rash and subsequent apnoeas and seizures. He required resuscitation with 100 mL/kg of fluid within the first 24 hours, inotropic support, ventilation and anti-epileptic medication. His only positive result was HPeV3 identified in his CSF. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To highlight the severity of parechovirus meningitis in a neonate with detailed presentation of a recent clinical case. To review the clinical course of other infants shown to have parechovirus meningitis at RHSC Edinburgh in last 18 months. <bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed the clinical details of all children admitted to RHSC Edinburgh with HPeV detected in CSF from January 2011 to June 2012. All HPeV samples were typed. <bold>Results:</bold> Totally 14 patients were admitted during the 18-month period (6 female and 8 male). The mean age of patients was 29 days (range 3–84 days). Three infants presented with a maculopapular rash and 3 developed apnoeas. Other complications included coagulation defects (<italic>n</italic> = 3), hypotension (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and seizures (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Both children with seizures had normal cranial ultrasounds with no radiological evidence of encephalitis. 1 in 5 children admitted required intensive/high dependency care. We did not have any patients with concurrent pneumonia, encephalitis or hepatitis as documented in other HPeV case reports. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Previous studies have highlighted the severity of HPeV3 infection; up to 40% of patients with meningoencephalitis have developed neurodevelopmental sequelae and mortality has also been reported. Interestingly, and in line with our data, HPeV3 CSF infection has only been documented in infants less than 3 months old. In view of the severe nature of this disease, we propose collecting data on HPeV3 CNS-infections from other centres to review further the potential severe nature of this disease and develop guidance for the long-term follow-up.</p>

<p>An active 14-year-old girl who was a competitive swimmer developed bilateral foot drop during the course of a charity walk. A diagnosis of Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies (HNNP) was made on the basis of family history and HNNP genetic mutation. Her foot drop resolved after 48 hours but with residual stocking anaesthesia of both feet up to her ankles. This progressed over 2 months to fixed inversion of both feet followed by fixed flexion of the fingers of both hands. A diagnosis of a functional (psychogenic) dystonia was made but a programme of intensive out-patient physiotherapy failed to produce improvement and she remained confined to a wheelchair with profoundly limited hand function. Six months after symptom onset, in-patient rehabilitation began with an attempt to demonstrate to her that her disabilities were potentially reversible using controlled Propofol infusion under anaesthetic supervision. This was done with full informed consent. After obtaining sedated sleep, the infusion was weaned slowly over an hour and, as her sedation lightened, improvement in range of movement was demonstrated to her and that this could be voluntarily replicated by her as she woke. This initial progress was successfully built upon with a 2-week intensive graded rehabilitation programme with physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology support. At follow-up in her local hospital 4 months following discharge, she had regained voluntary movement of her hands and was walking independently without support albeit with some persisting inversion of her ankles. This video presentation will demonstrate how Propofol, allowing controlled lightening of sedation, may be a useful tool to use at the beginning of a programme of rehabilitation in the management of functional (psychogenic) dystonia. It requires full consent, a good doctor–patient relationship with confidence on both sides in the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder and appropriate anaesthetic support.</p>
