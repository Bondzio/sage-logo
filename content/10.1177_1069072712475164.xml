<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to better understand the roles of social status and family support in the career decision making of young adults in college. We tested a path model predicting career decision self-efficacy and career-related outcome expectations in a sample of 270 male and female undergraduate students. Predictor variables included family of origin socioeconomic status, perceived social status, perceived family support, and intentional family career-related interactions. The sample was randomly split into a calibration sample and a validation sample. Based on a path analysis with the calibration sample, the hypothesized model was modified, and a multiple group analysis was used to test for model invariance for the revised model. The results of this study suggest that both family status and family support are associated with social cognitive career development outcomes. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>The family of origin has been identified as an important influence on career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072712475164">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>). Families provide the environment in which work roles, values, expectations, and aspirations are transmitted to and formed by the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1069072712475164">Vondracek, Lerner, &amp; Schulenberg, 1986</xref>). Researchers have found the family of origin to be an essential part of the context within which career decisions are made and enacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072712475164">Blustein, Phillips, Jobin-Davis, Finkelberg, &amp; Roarke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1069072712475164">Young &amp; Friesen, 1992</xref>). A host of family context variables have been found to be related to the vocational behavior of youth, including socioeconomic status (SES), family structure (e.g., single parent status), parent occupational and educational attainment, role modeling, support, family interaction style, and parent expectations for achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1069072712475164">Penick &amp; Jepsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1069072712475164">Schultheiss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1069072712475164">Schultheiss, Kress, Manzi, &amp; Glasscock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>). In the present study, we focus on the role of and interaction between social status and family support.</p>

<title>Social Status</title>
<p>Family SES is linked to a number of career development variables and outcomes. Individuals from lower SES backgrounds tend to have lower occupational and educational aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1069072712475164">Rojewski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1069072712475164">Rojewski &amp; Yang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1069072712475164">Solorzano, 1992</xref>), and SES is well documented to have a powerful influence on occupational and educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1069072712475164">Rehberg &amp; Hotchkiss, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1069072712475164">Schulenberg, Vondracek, &amp; Crouter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1069072712475164">Trusty, 2004</xref>). Growing up in a low SES family is also associated with higher levels of perceived barriers to educational and career attainment, lower levels of career-related self-efficacy, and lowered expectations for educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072712475164">Ali, McWhirter, &amp; Chronister, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072712475164">Lauver &amp; Jones, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072712475164">McWhirter, Hackett, &amp; Bandalos, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In response to critiques within the vocational psychology literature that social status has in the past been treated as a sociological variable (focusing on objective measurement of education level, income, and occupational status) instead of a psychological one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072712475164">Brown, Fukunaga, Umemoto, &amp; Wicker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072712475164">Liu et al., 2004</xref>), recent research has focused on subjective experiences of social status and its impact on personal identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072712475164">Fouad and Brown (2000</xref>) intended the concept of differential status identity (DSI) to help explain the influence of both race and class on psychological and identity development, based on the recognition that these two contributors to social standing are inextricably intertwined. Fouad and Brown assert that, rather than directly influencing development, race and class are manifest in perceived differences in social standing and that it is these perceived differences that impact psychosocial development. One’s social context and groups of membership are contained within an overall social hierarchy, whereby different individuals and groups have differential access to resources and levels of influence in the larger social system. The experience of one’s social standing across multiple dimensions of oneself or groups of membership affects psychological development and behavior. According to the DSI model, social status is defined as representing relation and access to three dimensions: economic resources (income, wealth, economic security), prestige (social valuation in the forms of occupational prestige, group association, consumption habits), and power (control over social values in the forms of political participation, ability to influence public policy, access to government benefits). An individual may have different levels of access to each of these three dimensions, and each contributes to his or her relative social standing, highlighting the multidimensional nature of social status.</p>
<p>A number of studies have established a relationship between DSI and career-related outcome variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1069072712475164">Thompson &amp; Dahling, 2010</xref>), using the Differential Status Identity scale (DSIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072712475164">Brown et al., 2002</xref>). Relevant here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1069072712475164">Thompson and Subich (2006</xref>) found that higher perceived access to economic and social resources (DSI) was associated with higher levels of career decision self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1069072712475164">Thompson and Subich (2011</xref>) explored both contributing factors to social status perceptions and vocational outcomes. They found a significant positive effect on DSI for both self-reported social class and primary caregiver support. DSI was positively related to career decision self-efficacy and negatively related to career indecisiveness.</p>
<p>In contrast, some studies have suggested the possibility that awareness of disadvantaged status and differential access to resources may act as a motivating force rather than as a barrier. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072712475164">Diemer (2009</xref>) found that among poor youth of color, consciousness of and motivation to change or challenge social inequity was associated with occupational expectations and subsequent adult occupational attainment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1069072712475164">Lindstrom, Doren, Metheny, Johnson, and Zane (2007</xref>) found that family economic background influenced initial career-related choices of low-SES participants via a perceived or real pressure to contribute to the family financially, and via an expressed motivation to achieve greater financial stability and status than that of the family of origin. These findings, along with the emergent research utilizing the concept of DSI, suggest that perceptions of social status are an important target of further research.</p>

<title>Family Support</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston and Keller (2004</xref>) concluded that family process variables (e.g., family relationships, parental aspirations and expectations, family support and advocacy) play a more important role in career development than either family structural variables (e.g., parents’ education and occupation, single parent status) or family background (i.e., social class or SES). When parents are perceived as supportive, adolescents are more likely to report higher expectations for their futures and more advanced educational plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072712475164">McWhirter et al., 1998</xref>), greater career certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072712475164">Constantine, Wallace, &amp; Kindaichi, 2005</xref>), higher career aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072712475164">Flores &amp; O’Brien, 2002</xref>), and greater career-related and educational self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072712475164">Gushue &amp; Whitson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1069072712475164">Raymund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1069072712475164">Turner, Steward, &amp; Lapan, 2004</xref>). Social support emerges as a critical factor in the career choice process for college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1069072712475164">Schultheiss et al., 2001</xref>), particularly in enabling them to overcome barriers to implementing that choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1069072712475164">Lent et al., 2002</xref>). Dimensions of family support, specifically informational support and high expectations, have been associated with career decision self-efficacy among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072712475164">Fouad et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, adolescents rank the support of their mothers and fathers as a greater source of influence on their own career expectations than teachers, peers, or school counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1069072712475164">Paa &amp; McWhirter, 2000</xref>). It has been suggested that social support may even act to assist an individual in overcoming the impact of perceived and encountered barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072712475164">Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1069072712475164">Kenny, Blustein, Chaves, Grossman, &amp; Gallagher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072712475164">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1069072712475164">Young and colleagues (2001</xref>) have proposed conceptualizing parent–child interactions around career development as a family project. Using qualitative methods, Young has catalogued the intentional actions of parents attempting to influence the career development of their children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1069072712475164">Young &amp; Friesen, 1992</xref>). Such findings, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072712475164">Barerra’s (1986)</xref> distinction between perceived and enacted support, led us to examine the influence of both intentional family career-related interactions and perceptions of family support on career-related outcomes. Given weak correlations between adolescent self-reports of support with reports by the source of support (i.e., parents, teachers), as well as the stronger predictive power of adolescent self-reports with developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069072712475164">Feldman, Wentzel, &amp; Gehring, 1989</xref>), we focus here on participant self-reports of family support behaviors.</p>

<sec id="section3-1069072712475164">
<title>Interaction of Status and Process</title>
<p>In attempting to understand the relationship between social status and career-related outcomes, researchers have suggested a host of possible contributing variables which might explain the role of family social status in the formation of vocational attitudes and decisions. Possible explanations have ranged from differences in child-rearing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1069072712475164">Roe &amp; Lunneborg, 1990</xref>) to a lack of available role models in low-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1069072712475164">Schulenberg et al., 1984</xref>). However, the deleterious impacts of poverty on child developmental outcomes—including cognitive functioning, academic achievement, and socioemotional functioning—have been shown to persist even after controlling for individual differences in family and parenting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072712475164">McLoyd, 1998</xref>). There have been only a handful of studies examining the dynamic interplay of social status in the family of origin and family process factors (e.g., parenting behaviors and relational styles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One theme in existing studies is that the influence of SES diminishes when family process is taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072712475164">Ali &amp; Saunders, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1069072712475164">Way &amp; Rossmann, 1996</xref>) and that family process variables are the stronger influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1069072712475164">Penick &amp; Jepsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1069072712475164">Poole, Langan-Fox, Ciavarella, &amp; Omodei, 1991</xref>). It has been suggested that SES may be linked to family support behaviors, with less support being perceived and received within low SES families; however, few career-related studies have included quantitative measures of both to allow for exploration of this hypothesis. Therefore, more research is warranted in order to replicate and extend existing findings. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston and Keller (2004</xref>) conclude their extensive review of the literature with recommendations for a return to the examination of family structural variables (e.g., SES), new investment in determining particular parent behaviors influential for vocational development, and further exploration of the influence of social status and how it interacts with other family variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1069072712475164">
<title>Career Decision-Making Outcomes</title>
<p>The vocational outcomes of career decision self-efficacy and outcome expectations were chosen for this study. According to social cognitive career theory (SCCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072712475164">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072712475164">2000</xref>), these two cognitive variables provide the basis for the formation of career interests and goals. Research supports self-efficacy and outcome expectations as important contributors to the career development process for young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072712475164">Lent &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1069072712475164">Swanson &amp; Gore, 2000</xref>) and specifically links levels of self-efficacy related to career decision making to career-related behavior (e.g., career exploration activities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072712475164">Gushue, Scanlan, Pantzer, &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>). While self-efficacy beliefs are believed to be the stronger predictor of behavior and have been more extensively researched, outcome expectations are theorized to provide a unique contribution to the likelihood of attempting a given behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069072712475164">Gore &amp; Leuwerke, 2000</xref>), leading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069072712475164">Fouad and Guillen (2006</xref>) to call for additional research on career-related outcome expectations. Within SCCT, SES is considered a distal contextual variable that influences career related self-efficacy and outcome expectations via its effects on the learning experiences to which individuals are exposed.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the relationships among family of origin SES, perceived social status, family support for career development, intentional family career-related interactions, and the social cognitive variables of career decision self-efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations. We proposed the following hypotheses based on prior research, SCCT, and the concept of DSI as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072712475164">Fouad and Brown (2000</xref>):</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants for the study were solicited in two ways. First, college-age students were solicited via fliers and department e-mails at a Pacific Northwest university campus and at both an East Coast university campus and community college campus. Second, snowball sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072712475164">Gall, Gall, &amp; Borg, 2003</xref>) was utilized; individuals at five institutions of higher education were contacted and invited to post invitations to participate on undergraduate student listservs. Potential participants received a brief description of the study and a web-based link to the informed consent statement. Participants could opt to separately submit contact information and receive a $5 Starbucks gift card.</p>
<p>Participants were 270 male and female undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 22 (<italic>M </italic>= 19.9, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.4) attending 4-year colleges or universities. 83% of the sample identified as female, 17% as male, and less than 1% as transgender. The self-reported ethnicity of participants was 79% Euro American, 7% Asian or Asian American, 7% multiethnic, 3% Latino/Latina, 1% Middle Eastern, and less than 1% each for Native American, African American, Pacific Islander, and “other.” Participants identified their U.S. area of residence as follows: 81% Northwest, 9% Southeast, 4% Northeast, 2% Southwest, 2% South, 1% Midwest, and 1% “other.” Half of the participants (50%) reported being currently “partially financially dependent upon one or more of my parents/guardians,” whereas 38% reported being fully financially dependent, 9% identified as financially independent, and 3% endorsed currently being in “a relationship in which I share financial responsibility or my partner provides for me (romantic partnership or marriage).”</p>

<title>Demographic Information and SES</title>
<p>Participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire with questions regarding their age, race/ethnicity, sex, financial status, and parental occupation. The Nakao-Treas Socioeconomic Index (SEI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1069072712475164">Nakao &amp; Treas, 1994</xref>) assigns scores to occupational titles based on updated occupational data obtained by the 1989 National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey (GSS). Scores range from 17 (e.g., sewing machine operator) to 97 (e.g., physician), with a mean score of 52.5. Because we expected that the social standing of the family of origin would still exert considerable influence on participants’ current attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072712475164">Brown et al., 1996</xref>), we used parent occupational titles to calculate SEI scores. Consistent with prior research, if two or more SEI scores were available for a participant, the highest score for the household was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072712475164">Blustein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072712475164">Lauver &amp; Jones, 1991</xref>). Scores were assigned independently by the first author and two research assistants, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus.</p>

<title>Subjective Social Status</title>
<p>Perceived social status was assessed using the DSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072712475164">Brown et al., 2002</xref>). The DSIS was constructed based on Fouad and Brown’s (2000) conceptualization of DSI, which outlines three dimensions of social status based on access to (a) economic resources (30 items), (b) prestige (15 items), and (c) power (15 items). The resulting 60-item scale has been subjected to several validation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1069072712475164">Thompson &amp; Subich, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1069072712475164">2007</xref>). For the purpose of this study, only full scale scores were utilized. Items prompt respondents to assess how they compare to the average U.S. citizen in terms of characteristics such as “ability to travel recreationally,” or “ability to afford prescription medicine,” perceptions of the extent to which society values aspects of their lives such as the “neighborhood in which you live,” and “ethnic/racial group,” and perceptions of their social power relative to the average citizen such as the ability to “receive a fair trial,” and to “contact people in high places for a job or position.” Response options are based on a 5-point, Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>very much below average</italic> (scored as −2) to <italic>very much above average</italic> (scored as +2; economic resources and social power items) or <italic>much less</italic> (scored as −2) to <italic>much more</italic> (scored as +2; social prestige items). Scores are converted to a 1 to 5 scale for analysis purposes, with higher scores indicating higher perceived status. Preliminary findings with several samples of college students provide support for reliability (α = .97 to .98; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1069072712475164">Metz, Fouad, &amp; Ihle-Helledy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1069072712475164">Thompson &amp; Dahling, 2010</xref>) as well as concurrent and discriminant validity for DSIS scores (M.

<title>Perceived Family Support</title>
<p>Perceptions of support for career development were assessed using a 5-item scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1069072712475164">Way and Rossmann (1996)</xref>. Respondents identify the extent to which the family they grew up in provided financial, emotional, and instrumental types of support, with response options of <italic>no support</italic> (scored as 1), <italic>a little support</italic> (scored as 2), or <italic>considerable support</italic> (scored as 3). Sample items include “To what extent has the family you grew up in given you financial support for your education and training?” Higher total scores reflect higher levels of perceived support from the family of origin. Evidence of adequate internal consistency and validity with adult students enrolled in 2-year colleges is reported by Way and Rossmann.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this study, 5 items were added to this measure. The original items focus on instrumental support (Items 1, 4, and 5), therefore the first author added items reflecting appraisal support (1 item), emotional support (2 items), and informational support (2 items) in order to reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1069072712475164">Tardy’s (1985)</xref> four types of support. The modified 10-item version of the scale yielded an α of .87 in this sample. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using maximum likelihood extraction, no rotation, and listwise deletion of missing values. The size of the eigenvalue for the first factor relative to that of the next largest factor was 5:1. Further, the variance of inter-item correlations was reasonably low (.016), suggesting adequate unidimensionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072712475164">Clark &amp; Watson, 1995</xref>).

<title>Family Interactions</title>
<p>Intentional career-related family interactions were assessed using a 10-item scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1069072712475164">Way and Rossmann (1996)</xref> based on the qualitative research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1069072712475164">Young and Friesen (1992</xref>). Young and Friesen examined intentional actions of parents attempting to influence the career development of their children, and Way and Rossmann’s scale assesses for the following types of interactions from Young and Friesen’s work: skill acquisition, facilitation of human relationships, increasing independent thinking and action, development of personal responsibility, enhancing self-image, and decreasing sex-role stereotyping. Respondents indicate the degree to which items reflect the family they grew up in. Response options range from <italic>very untrue for my parent(s)/guardian(s) or family</italic> (scored as 1) to <italic>very true for my parent(s)/guardian(s) or family</italic> (scored as 4). Sample items include “My family stressed that males and females have similar abilities and career alternatives.” Higher total scores reflect the presence of more intentional interactions on the part of the respondent’s parents. Evidence of adequate internal reliability consistency and concurrent validity of scores in a sample of 879 adults attending 2-year colleges is presented by Way and Rossmann.</p>

The 25-item CDSE-SF has been used extensively within the vocational psychology literature. Respondents rate confidence in their ability to engage in a series of career-related decision-making tasks on a 5-point, Likert-type scale with response options ranging from <italic>no confidence at all</italic> (scored as 1) to <italic>complete confidence</italic> (scored as 5). Sample tasks include “Determine what your ideal job would be,” and “Prepare a good resume.” Higher total mean scores reflect higher levels of self-efficacy in this domain.

<title>Career Outcome Expectations</title>
<p>Career outcome expectations were assessed using a modified version of the Vocational Outcome Expectations scale (VOE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072712475164">McWhirter, Rasheed, &amp; Crothers, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069072712475164">Bandura’s (1986)</xref> concept of outcome expectations involves the anticipated consequences of a course of action. In the measure, respondents indicate their degree of agreement with 6 statements on a 4-point, Likert-type scale with response options ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (scored as 1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (scored as 4). Item scores are averaged, with higher scores indicating more positive outcome expectations. Sample items from the scale include “I will be successful in my chosen career/occupation” and “My talents and skills will be used in my career/occupation.” Evidence of adequate internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and concurrent validity of scores among high school samples is reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072712475164">McWhirter and colleagues (2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the original measure’s brevity, the inclusion of items that are not specific to career-related choices, and Fouad and Guillen’s (2006) critique of the measurement of outcome expectations, 6 items were added to this measure for the purpose of this study. These items represent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069072712475164">Bandura’s (1986)</xref> three types of outcome expectations: self-evaluation or satisfaction (2 items), physical (2 items), and social (2 items).

An EFA was conducted using maximum likelihood extraction, no rotation, and listwise deletion of missing values. The size of the eigenvalue for the first factor relative to that of the next largest factor was 7:1.

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>There were one or more missing item responses for 58 (28%) of the 270 cases. Overall, less than 4% of the data was missing. Little’s missing completely at random (MCAR) test indicated that missing items were MCAR, χ<sup>2</sup>(6342) = 6410.54, <italic>p</italic> = .27. Therefore, in order to maximize sample size, expectation maximization (EM) imputation was used to calculate estimates for missing values in the data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1069072712475164">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>An examination of the data for outliers revealed six cases with large Mahalanobis D-squared values and <italic>p </italic>values less than .01. Visual inspection of these cases revealed that the respondent’s data contained little variability in responses on some measures, suggesting that the respondent may not have considered each item separately when answering. As a result, these cases were discarded, leaving a total of 264 cases in the final sample.</p>
<p>Data were examined for skewness and kurtosis statistics. Perceived family support was both negatively skewed (−1.39) and leptokurtic (1.61), but values did not exceed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1069072712475164">Kline’s (1998)</xref> identified threshold values for skew (±3.00) or kurtosis (±10.00), beyond which data are considered to seriously depart from normality.

<title>Path Analyses</title>
<p>Research questions regarding the relative strength of independent variables in influencing the outcome variables and the potential mediating role of family support were addressed via path analysis. The exogenous (independent) variable in the path model was family SES. The endogenous (dependent) variables in the path model were perceived family support, intentional family interactions, subjective status, career decision self-efficacy, and career outcome expectations. We used Amos 5.0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072712475164">Arbuckle, 2003</xref>) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to run the path analysis and to calculate path coefficients and model fit indices.</p>
<p>We randomly split the sample of 264 students into two samples: a calibration sample (<italic>n</italic> = 127) and a validation sample (<italic>n</italic> = 137). The calibration sample was used to test the hypothesized model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069072712475164">Figure 1</xref>). The validation sample was reserved to allow for cross-validation in the case that model revisions were required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072712475164">Klem, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069072712475164">Hu and Bentler’s (1999)</xref> recommended cutoff values for goodness of fit were utilized: Comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) values above .95, an standardized root-mean-squared residual (SRMR) value below .08, and an root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) value below .06. Goodness-of-fit indices for the hypothesized model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072712475164">Table 2</xref>.

<p>Given the lack of prior research examining the causal relationship among the variables under study, modifications to the hypothesized model were considered which might improve the fit. In order to minimize the risk of improving fit but constructing a substantively meaningless model (i.e., one that capitalizes on chance characteristics of this sample), only modifications consistent with theory and/or prior research were considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1069072712475164">MacCallum, Roznowski, &amp; Necowitz, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The modification indices suggested six additional possible paths that might improve the fit of the model. Of these, two paths met the criteria of being consistent with theory and/or prior research: (a) a path from intentional family interactions to perceived family support and (b) a path from perceived family support to subjective social status. The path from intentional family interactions to perceived family support was consistent with prior research finding a moderate, positive relationship between these variables (<italic>r </italic>= .53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1069072712475164">Way &amp; Rossmann, 1996</xref>). The hypothesis that intentional parent interactions related to career development impact an adolescent’s subjective experience of parental support for career development (i.e. perceived family support) is plausible. Adding a path from perceived family support to subjective social status was also consistent with theory and emergent research (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1069072712475164">Thompson &amp; Subich, 2011</xref>). The construct of DSI is meant to capture an individual’s understanding of his or her social standing in U.S. society, partly based on his or her access to social resources.</p>
<p>The path analysis was rerun with the revised model in the calibration sample. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072712475164">Table 2</xref>. The revised model fit the data significantly better than the hypothesized model, χ<sup>2</sup> difference (2, <italic>N</italic> = 127) = 87.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Goodness-of-fit indices for the revised model indicated good fit. To determine if the revised model could be replicated, the revised model was tested in the validation sample (<italic>n</italic> = 137). Again, the goodness-of-fit indices indicated a good fit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072712475164">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed a multiple group analysis to test for model invariance across the two sample groups. This analysis compares two models: one in which the parameters are allowed to vary across the groups and one in which the parameter values are constrained to be equal between the two groups. A statistically significant χ<sup>2</sup> value suggests that the parameter estimates vary across groups. The results of the multiple group analysis indicated that there were not any statistically significant differences in the path coefficients between the calibration sample and the validation sample, χ<sup>2</sup>(16, <italic>N</italic> = 274) = 20.70, <italic>p</italic> = .19. Therefore, as a final step, the revised model was run in the original, combined sample (<italic>n</italic> = 264). The goodness-of-fit indices indicated a good fit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072712475164">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The influence of SES on occupational and educational attainment is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072712475164">Brown et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1069072712475164">Trusty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>). Findings of the present study help shed more light on the possible mechanisms by which this influence is realized and add to the growing literature examining precursors and outcomes of perceived social status (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1069072712475164">Thompson &amp; Subich, 2011</xref>). Like other recent studies, support was provided for the importance of examining the influence of subjective perceptions of social status (i.e., DSI) in addition to more traditional measures of status (i.e., SES) as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072712475164">Liu et al. (2004</xref>) and others. The finding that perceived status provides a unique contribution to vocational outcome variables beyond traditional measures of status replicates prior research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1069072712475164">Thompson and Subich (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1069072712475164">2007</xref>). This study also attended to recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069072712475164">Fouad and Guillen (2006</xref>) that additional research be undertaken on the measurement of outcome expectations.</p>
<p>As expected, there was a direct, positive relationship between SES and DSI. However, the hypothesis that SES would have a direct, positive relationship with both vocational outcome variables was not supported. There was no statistically significant, direct relationship between SES and career decision self-efficacy. Additionally, the small, negative coefficient for the path between SES and career outcome expectations indicates that outcome expectations fell slightly as SES rose. While these results were somewhat surprising based on past research linking SES with vocational outcome variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072712475164">Huang &amp; Hsei, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1069072712475164">Rojewski, 1997</xref>), it may be that the influence of family SES diminishes with age, making it a less relevant factor for college students. It is also possible that participants from lower SES backgrounds expected better outcomes, given their proven ability to overcome barriers to educational advancement as evidenced by their college attendance. Entry into a college environment also—at least theoretically—equalizes access to some types of helping resources (e.g., career counseling or academic support services). Finally, the lack of direct effects may be due to a restricted range of SES in this college sample.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that higher perceived status (i.e., higher DSI) would be associated with higher career decision self-efficacy and career outcome expectations was partially supported. There was a statistically significant, positive, direct relationship between DSI and career decision self-efficacy. There was no direct relationship between DSI and career outcome expectations. However, there was a significant indirect effect on outcome expectations, with perceived status operating through self-efficacy. Given the results showing both direct and indirect influences on social-cognitive variables, this study provides further evidence for the relevance of examining DSI as a contributor to the career development process.</p>
<p>There was partial support for the hypothesis that family support and intentional career-related interactions would mediate the relationship between SES and the outcome variables. SES had a small, statistically significant, indirect effect on self-efficacy, operating through perceived family support and subjective social status. SES levels did not influence intentional family interaction levels, as reported by participants. Thus, there was no evidence that intentional family interactions mediated the relationship between SES and the outcome variables. The lack of differences in intentional family interactions by SES level affirms prior research findings showing that SES explains very little of the variance in parent involvement in the career development process of adolescents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1069072712475164">Trusty, Watts, &amp; Erdman, 1997</xref>). While the correlations between intentional family interactions and each outcome variable were moderate, the path coefficients in the final model were only weak. The weak nature of the relationships may be the result of the inclusion of other potentially important variables in the model—variables that have not previously been included in such studies (e.g., perceived status).</p>
<p>The finding that only perceived family support was influenced by SES level in the family of origin suggests that participants of different SES backgrounds did not experience different amounts of career-related interaction with their parents, but rather may have perceived less attitudinal or emotional support during the process. This finding is consistent with earlier research studies in which SES did not significantly influence career-related outcome variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072712475164">Ali &amp; Saunders, 2006</xref>) and in which SES exerted an indirect effect through variables related to family process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1069072712475164">Way &amp; Rossmann, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>While there were no direct relationships between perceptions of family support and either outcome variable, perceptions of greater support from the family were related to higher social status perceptions. This finding suggests that family has a role in shaping an individual’s perception of social standing and perceived relationship to the rest of the social hierarchy. It also suggests that family support may act as a protective factor for individuals who grow up with limited access to other types of resources.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to the present study which suggest that the results should be interpreted with caution. First, participants were college students from a somewhat limited range of socioeconomic backgrounds. There were few participants who were identified as belonging to very low or very high status families. The relationship among variables in the study may differ for these populations. Second, the sample was largely White and female, further limiting generalizability. Prior research has identified possible ethnic and sex differences for some of the variables under study, although these findings have been mixed. For example, ethnic differences in levels of career-related self-efficacy have been found in some studies, with students of color having lower self-efficacy levels than their White peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072712475164">Lauver &amp; Jones, 1991</xref>); however, other studies have found the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072712475164">Chung, 2002</xref>). It has also been suggested that family support may have a greater influence on the career development of ethnic minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072712475164">Fouad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>). Additional research will be necessary to explore whether the model produced in this study holds for other groups, such as Latino, Asian, or African Americans, and in samples with a greater proportion of male participants.</p>
<p>In addition, this study was exploratory in nature, and the original model was modified based on the results of the path analysis. While care was taken to ensure that only modifications consistent with prior research and theory were made, it is possible that the model has been shaped by chance characteristics of this particular sample and may not be replicable in a separate sample. Further, the design of the study does not allow for conclusions about causality. Replication with longitudinal data from a diverse sample and the inclusion of data from multiple sources (e.g., parent reports of support provided) would provide further insight into the mechanisms of action and increase the generalizability of the findings.</p>
<sec id="section19-1069072712475164">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that family of origin SES and family support influence career development outcome variables, partially operating through perceptions of social standing. While the objective SES (i.e., parent occupation, education, income) of students is not a viable focus of direct intervention for career counselors, family or parent support potentially is subject to modification. Efforts to enhance college students’ career-related self-efficacy and outcome expectations could focus on increasing both family support and access to the other types of resources implicated in shaping perceived status. Within the category of economic or material resources, this could include increasing universal student access to health or dental care, to the use of computers, or to quality education—as examples. Within the categories of prestige or power resources, this might include increasing student connection with contacts in positions of power, increasing student ability to influence their social context (e.g., via school government), or empowering students toward efforts to influence state or federal laws or policies. While these types of efforts are not typically linked to student career development, they are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072712475164">Blustein, McWhirter, and Perry’s (2005)</xref> recommendations for an emancipatory communitarian approach to vocational psychology, and attend to important elements of students’ microsystems, mesosystems, and exosystems.</p>

<sec id="section20-1069072712475164">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that both economic and social resources have a role in career decision making for college students. We recommend that future research explore each type of resource in greater depth. In particular, we concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1069072712475164">Whiston and Keller (2004</xref>) that greater information is needed on parent behaviors that foster positive career outcomes. We recommend examination of which types of support might be most impactful for youth across different levels of perceived status. This could include examining which of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1069072712475164">Tardy’s (1985)</xref> four types of support (i.e., instrumental, appraisal, emotional, and informational), which specific parent behaviors, and which specific aspects of the environment (in terms of economic, social, or power resources) contribute most to vocational outcomes. Recent research has begun to illuminate such linkages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072712475164">Fouad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1069072712475164">Keller &amp; Whiston, 2008</xref>). Given our findings, closer examination of the specific behaviors reflected in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1069072712475164">Way and Rossmann (1996)</xref> measure of parent support may be helpful.</p>
<p>The results of this study highlight the importance of perceived status in the career development process and as an area for further research. This research expands on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1069072712475164">Thompson and Subich (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1069072712475164">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1069072712475164">2011</xref>) exploring antecedents of DSI and examining the relationship of DSI with vocational outcome variables. The results of the present study identified not only family of origin SES but also perceived family support as shaping perceptions of social status. Future research should continue to explore what other environmental variables might contribute to the formation of DSI—particularly those variables that might be appropriate targets of prevention or intervention efforts.</p>
