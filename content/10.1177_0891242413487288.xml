<p>Jan K. Brueckner is one of the foremost researchers in urban economics in contemporary times. In addition, he served as the editor of the <italic>Journal of Urban Economics</italic> for many years. Given these two attributes, he is very well qualified to write the textbook on urban economics that is being reviewed here. Rather than provide a tedious chapter by chapter review, in what follows, I shall sample selectively from the book’s 11 chapters. This should give the reader an adequate flavor for the intellectual contributions of this tome.</p>
<p>Why do cities exist? Brueckner begins the proceedings by addressing this interesting question. After introducing the concepts of “scale economies” and “agglomeration economies,” he points out that scale economies can interact with transport costs to affect both the location of production and the formation of cities. Even so, we learn that the key point to grasp is that “agglomeration economies, which cause separate firms to locate near one another, are required for job concentrations substantial enough to generate a big city” (p. 20).</p>
<p>The central building block of this book, the so-called “urban model,” is introduced in chapter 2. Brueckner states the three key assumptions of this model and then uses this model to explain that “the price per square foot of housing, land rent, building heights, and population density fall moving away from the [central business district], while dwelling size increases” (p. 50). During the course of this discussion, Brueckner points out that there is a definite connection between commute costs and the size of a city. Specifically, higher commute costs lead city residents to move inward and this leads to a decline in the land area of the city.</p>
<p>Several criticisms have now been made about the notion of “urban sprawl.” Are these criticisms justified? On a related note, do cities take up too much place? These sorts of questions are discussed in chapter 4. The author first rightly points out that American cities in general have experienced noteworthy spatial growth because their populations have increased, household incomes of the people living in cities has grown, and governments at all levels have made substantial investments in improving the transport infrastructure by building freeways. He then goes on to point out that although there can be behavioral effects of urban sprawl, there is no merit to the criticism that suburban living causes obesity.</p>
<p>How might we deal with the problem of freeway congestion? This question is ably discussed by the author in the fifth chapter of this book. After commenting on congestion costs, the author explores the usefulness of congestion tolls in dealing with the aforementioned problem. This exploration is thoughtful although one can question the author’s contention that when a freeway is uncongested, “widening the freeway will have <italic>no effect</italic> [italics added] on the traffic speed and thus no effect on [the] commuting cost . . .” (pp. 110-111).</p>
<p>A popular subject, namely rent control laws, constitutes the subject matter of chapter 7. Using what he calls a “stock-flow model,” Brueckner argues that if the government wants to reduce housing costs for a deserving group in society then “it should provide direct subsidies to that group instead of relying on rent-control law, which distorts the housing market in addition to being poorly targeted” (p. 145). Moving on to housing subsidy programs, the author points out that the effects of these programs differ depending on the way in which the underlying subsidy is designed.</p>
<p>The ninth chapter on pollution contains a number of useful points about this external diseconomy in the context of urban economics. While discussing the ways in which one might deal with pollution generated by a single factory, Brueckner makes the very useful point that the socially optimal level of pollution is typically not zero. This is because reducing pollution damage to the members of a society is not the only consideration that society ought to take into account. The author’s discussion of pollution remedies when the marginal benefit and damage functions are stochastic is unfortunately the weakest part of this book. For instance, he says that when these functions are probabilistic, “the relevant analysis . . . isn’t easily illustrated in simple diagrams” (p. 196). This is untrue. Building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242413487288">Adar and Griffin (1976)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242413487288">Baumol and Oates (1988)</xref> showed more than two decades ago that simple diagrams can in fact be used to delineate the pros and cons of price versus quantity control regulation.</p>
<p>The economic theory of crime is the subject of the lucid chapter 10. When discussing optimal spending on crime prevention, Brueckner rightly points out that although less crime is desirable from the standpoint of potential victims, it is important to comprehend that reducing crime to zero requires large increases in police expenditures and that this may not be justified by the resulting benefits; therefore, “tolerating some crime is optimal for society” (p. 215).</p>
<p>I conclude this review with the following observations. First, some of the cited sources—such as the Sonstelie and Portney (1980) study—are missing in the References section. Second, there are numerous “small” problems with the text—see, for instance, pages 18, 68, 72, 95, 127, and 236—that a careful proofreading would have detected and addressed. These two points and my previous criticisms notwithstanding, I would like to point out that this is a sagacious text and a handy reference that does a great job of demonstrating how simple diagrams and well-reasoned economic logic can be carefully marshaled to shed valuable light on many issues in contemporary urban economics.</p>
