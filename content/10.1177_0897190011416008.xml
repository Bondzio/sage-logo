<abstract>
<p>This single-center retrospective pilot program’s objective was to utilize outpatient pharmacists to improve laboratory test adherence in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients overdue for thyroid function testing, thereby demonstrating the value of the outpatient pharmacist and justifying possible clinical role expansion. Thyroid disorders may contribute to CHF development, progression, and exacerbation. Testing is the standard of care in CHF patients per American Heart Association’s 2009 Guidelines. Delinquency was defined as labs not conducted within 1 year in patients with euthyroid history, within 6 months in patients with thyroid dysfunction, abnormal labs at any time without follow-up, or lab absence after thyroid medication initiation, adjustment, or discontinuation. Targeted 80 nonpregnant adult CHF patients with delinquent thyroid function tests were counseled to get thyroid labs at point of sale, via telephone, e-mail, or letter. In collaboration with physicians, pharmacists ordered thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (FT4) labs. For patients with abnormal laboratory results, pharmacists coordinated drug therapy and follow-up labs. Data were collected from November 1, 2009 to March 30, 2010. Seventy-two patients (90%) previously delinquent for thyroid function testing received relevant thyroid labs. Ten patients (12.5%) with abnormal thyroid function tests not on prior drug therapy received treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pharmacists are viewed as a respected, accessible, and trusted resource by both patients and health care professionals. Expanding the clinical role of the outpatient pharmacist is a well-established concept, with numerous studies demonstrating that both inpatient and outpatient pharmacist clinical interventions can produce a dramatic positive impact on improving patient outcomes in a wide variety of disease states, including heart failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011416008">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011416008"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011416008">5</xref>
</sup> This study illustrates that expanding outpatient pharmacists’ role to provide therapeutic interventions in an integrated health care system greatly improves thyroid function testing adherence in patients with heart failure. Heart failure was chosen as the model disease state because despite advances in medical treatment and pharmacotherapy, heart failure represents a large burden to society in regard to economic cost and decreased quality of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011416008">6</xref>
</sup> Outpatient pharmacists are in a prime position to assume a complementary role to physicians and nurses managing patients with heart failure in order to mitigate the impact of heart failure on the health care system and society.</p>
<p>Hospitalization rates for chronic heart failure (CHF) patients over the age of 65 have steadily been increasing from 1971 through 2006.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011416008">7</xref>
</sup> In 2006, approximately 5.8 million American patients (2%) carried a diagnosis of heart failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011416008">7</xref>
</sup> The Health Care Cost and Utilization Project of 2006 listed heart failure as one of the 2 leading causes of potentially preventable hospitalizations, with approximately 1 million admissions and a cost of $8.4 billion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011416008">6</xref>
</sup> Thyroid dysfunction is relatively common,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011416008">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011416008"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011416008">11</xref>
</sup> it is found in approximately 5% of the adult patient population and increases significantly in heart failure with an incidence between 15% and 40%. Nationally recognized guidelines recommend thyroid function testing and potential correction, if abnormal in patients with heart failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011416008">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011416008"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011416008">16</xref>
</sup> The link between thyroid dysfunction and heart failure is clearly established. Hypothyroidism is associated with decreased inotropy and cardiac output, reduced vascular compliance, and hyperlipidemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011416008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011416008">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011416008">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011416008"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190011416008">19</xref>
</sup> Conversely, hyperthyroidism may lead to right ventricular overload with 10% to 50% at increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190011416008">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011416008">17</xref>
</sup> Patients with heart failure and thyroid dysfunction tend to have poorer prognosis than patients with heart failure without thyroid dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011416008">9</xref>
</sup> Additionally, older patients with heart failure are at increased risk of developing thyroid dysfunction over time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190011416008">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190011416008">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Potential medication contribution to thyroid dysfunction is significant,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190011416008">22</xref>
</sup> and elderly patients are more likely to be on multiple medications, some of which may contribute to thyroid dysfunction (eg, amiodarone). Pharmacists are well equipped to serve as a resource to the health care team concerning medications and their effects on thyroid function. In 2008, approximately 324 million prescriptions were filled in California.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190011416008">23</xref>
</sup> The sheer number of prescriptions dispensed in the outpatient setting represents a unique opportunity for outpatient pharmacists to take a strong role in promoting patient awareness and guideline adherence due to their accessibility.</p>
<p>The study purpose was to utilize outpatient pharmacists’ clinical skills to promote thyroid function testing in patients overdue for laboratory testing in order to capture the patient population not already followed by the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento’s Heart Failure Program, improve guideline adherence, and enhance quality outcomes in patients with heart failure. The Heart Failure Program is an ambulatory care service coordinated by nurses that services approximately 130 patients and is an ever dynamic clinic with patients moving in and out consistently. Patients are referred by their physicians; however, not all patients are referred, and not all patients who are referred choose to enroll. As mostly all patients will require prescription medication for their condition, using the pharmacist as a “safety net” for patients not participating in the Heart Failure Program allows full representation of care for all patients with heart failure.</p>

<sec id="section2-0897190011416008">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The project was designed as a quality improvement, single-center retrospective study, between October 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010. Patients were included if they were adult members with heart failure receiving care at the study site and delinquent for thyroid function tests (TFTs), which included free T4 (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Overdue TFTs were defined as absent labs within 1 year in euthyroid patients, within 6 months in patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction, an abnormal TFT lab result at any time without follow-up, or absence of TFTs 6 to 8 weeks following thyroid medication initiation, adjustment, or discontinuation. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, enrollment in the Heart Failure Program, or per physician’s request. Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento services approximately 183 000 members. Based on population statistics, 2% or 3660 patients may be estimated to have heart failure and about 20%, or approximately 736 patients, may have thyroid dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011416008">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011416008"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011416008">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011416008">11</xref>
</sup> Electronic medical records were searched for TFT records back to 2005. Normal laboratory results were defined as FT4 between 0.8 and 1.7 ng/dL and TSH between 0.1 and 5.5 μIU/mL. Abnormal laboratory results were defined as results falling outside of the normal values.</p>
<p>The study was divided into 3 sections. The first occurred in October 2009, during which time proprietary software was utilized to pull patient data based on physician discipline (cardiologist, internal medicine, and family practice) and the presence in patients’ medication profile of a minimum of 2 medications out of 5 potential medication classes including a loop or thiazide-like diuretic, aldosterone antagonist, beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and digoxin. The purpose of this type of data gathering was to allow retail pharmacies to utilize this model, as they have access to patient medication lists and know the medical specialty of their patients’ prescribers. Utilizing this information, pharmacists infer whether a patient may have heart failure and may inquire during counseling about laboratory tests the patient may need.</p>
<p>A total of 3592 patients were returned in the data query. Of these, 383 patients (∽10%) were randomly chosen and their electronic medical record screened between October 1, 2009 and October 25, 2009 for heart failure diagnosis and overdue TSH and FT4. A total of 241 patients were found to have heart failure diagnosis, 83 of whom also had delinquent TFTs. In all, 3 patients were excluded, and 80 patients were ultimately selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190011416008">Figure 1</xref>
). The pharmacist then contacted the patient’s physician (either primary care or cardiologist) from October 26, 2009 through October 30, 2009 to discuss the relevance of the TSH and FT4 labs and place orders in the electronic medical record for each patient. Laboratory results were marked for routing to both physician and pharmacist so both practitioners could evaluate result and intervene if TFT results were abnormal. Four patients had thyroid function labs ordered prior to the study. These labs were discontinued and reentered so that patients could be followed by both the pharmacist and physician. For the 80 patients that were ultimately selected, a flag was then placed in the outpatient pharmacy computer system to alert outpatient pharmacists to counsel these patients when picking up any prescription medication or to contact them via phone to get relevant TFT blood tests. Outpatient pharmacists and technicians at the 4 pharmacies at the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento were in-serviced during October about the details of the study and their role. Pharmacies were provided with a patient list in a covered binder, a laminated instruction poster for the wall, and received one or more training sessions depending on the perceived need of each pharmacy.</p>

</fig>
<p>The second section took place during November 2009, at which time patients patronized the pharmacies if they required either a refill or new prescription. Patients visiting the pharmacy during the month of November were to be counseled or contacted by the pharmacist and encouraged to test. Technicians were given a telephone script and instructions to refer to the pharmacist in the event of patient questions with regard to drug therapy. The pharmacist monitored for TFT laboratory results and coordinated with the primary care physician, an endocrinologist, or cardiologist if abnormal results were returned to determine appropriate treatment. The pharmacist also contacted patients with information about medication initiation or adjustments and need for follow-up TFTs. Once a patient received their TFTs, the flag alerting the outpatient pharmacy staff was removed from the computer system. Data collection took place from November 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010.</p>
<p>Not all patients patronized a pharmacy during the month of November. Thus, during the third section of the project, starting in December 2009, a pharmacist or technician contacted these patients and advised them to have their TFTs drawn. Laboratory results were monitored through March 31, 2010. Some patients required reminder phone calls or secure e-mails. The pharmacist resident monitored for laboratory results and consulted with the patient’s physician/physicians as described above.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the screening process in October 2009, 80 patients were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190011416008">Figure 1</xref>). Two patients expired. Though the exact cause of death was undetermined, the first patient had a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The patient is included in the results because he had abnormal thyroid function upon testing for the study, and after discussion with his physician, the pharmacist had placed an order for thyroid medication. However, the patient passed away before he could pick up the medication. The second patient who expired did not have a thyroid condition. The patient’s cause of death was due to CHF exacerbation attributed to dilated cardiomyopathy. This patient is included in the results because he was noted to be delinquent for thyroid testing and was flagged for testing after discussion with his physician. However, this patient did not test, as he expired prior to testing.</p>
<p>In November 2009, 54 patients visited the pharmacy, and by the end of the study, all 54 (100%) received relevant TFTs. Two patients received TFTs prior to visiting the pharmacy. These patients visited the laboratory in early October for anticoagulation monitoring, and TFTs were performed concurrently. The patients are included in the study, as their physician had been contacted and approved the ordering of TFTs for these patients. Even though the patients did not receive counseling directly by a pharmacist, pharmacist intervention allowed these patients to come back into compliance with relevant thyroid laboratory tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0897190011416008">Figure 2</xref>

<p>As discussed above, 1 patient with abnormal thyroid function prior to the study did not have follow-up, as this patient expired (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011416008">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Three delinquent patients with abnormal thyroid function prior to the study were found to have normal thyroid studies during the study. Of these 3 patients, 2 were on thyroid medication prior to and after the study, and 1 patient was not on thyroid medication prior to or after the study. No medication adjustment was required for any of these patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011416008">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to the study beginning, 4 patients had TFTs that had been ordered by their physician. Of these, 3 patients had history of abnormal thyroid function and 1 did not. Of the 3 with abnormal thyroid function, 2 were on thyroid replacement prior to the study beginning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As Americans age and life expectancy increases, chronic disease management, is expected to become more prevalent. The first of the baby boomers will reach age 65 by 2011; and by 2030, Americans over the age of 65 are expected to reach 71 million, 20% of the population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190011416008">24</xref>
</sup> American needs and demands for health care are increasing while the health care force is drastically shrinking. The American Academy of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and The American Academy of Colleges of Nursing (AACN)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190011416008">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190011416008">26</xref>
</sup> estimate a physician shortage crisis of 124 000 to 159 000 and a registered nurse shortage of 260 000 by the year 2025.To compensate for these shortages, the AAMC calls for implementing new care models termed the “medical home” comprised of coordinated efforts of all health care professionals collaborating to improve health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and efficiency.</p>
<p>Outpatient pharmacists are well equipped clinically to allow for a paradigm shift from a primarily dispensary role to a more clinical role in order to assist their medical colleagues in the management of other chronic disease states as well, as previous studies have demonstrated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011416008">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011416008"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011416008"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011416008">5</xref>
</sup> As an indicator of this expanding role, dispensing functions of the retail pharmacist are expected to decline by 27% by the year 2020 in favor of more clinical responsibilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190011416008">27</xref>
</sup> By utilizing clinical outpatient pharmacists in managing chronic conditions of the baby boomer population, continued access to high-quality health care, direct contact with a health care provider, and improved quality of life are all within reach.</p>
<p>Our study supports the potential for outpatient pharmacists to positively impact patient adherence to guideline recommendations regarding thyroid function testing in CHF. A great majority, 72 (90%), of patients in this study received relevant testing after pharmacist intervention. Ten patients with abnormal TFTs who were not previously taking thyroid replacement or who required dose modification were all prescribed thyroid medication or had their dose adjusted by the end of the study.</p>
<p>Not all previously delinquent patients with abnormal thyroid function were on replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0897190011416008">Figure 3</xref>). However, drug therapy is not always indicated with abnormal thyroid laboratory results; for instance, whether or not to treat subclinical hypothyroidism remains ambiguous and is left to the physician’s professional discretion. In subclinical hypothyroidism, thyroid function levels are near normal. Data supporting a clear benefit to treating subclinical hypothyroidism are lacking, and therefore, the decision to treat is left with the clinician.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011416008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190011416008">28</xref>

</p>
<p>One patient was prescribed amiodarone. This patient had abnormal thyroid function both prior to and after the study and was on replacement therapy. Thyroid medication dose adjustment was made as a result of the abnormal laboratory results. It is important to remember that drug-induced thyroid dysfunction remains an area where pharmacist intervention can play significant roles in patient health and safety.</p>
<p>The study had several limitations, including the fact that it was a retrospective uncontrolled study that took place within a short time frame. The study was not designed to distinguish subclinical hypothyroidism, drug-induced thyroid dysfunction, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and other thyroid dysfunction etiologies from one another. All abnormal TFTs were grouped together regardless of diagnosis. Future studies may expand upon this model with further inquiry into specific thyroid diseases. Potential studies may also consider extending the time line and exploring other relevant laboratory results pertinent to heart failure—particularly anemia. Additional studies will be required to analyze patient hospitalization rates and outcomes when adhering to guideline recommendations, in addition to cost impact.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pharmacists have proven time and time again that they provide a significant clinical contribution to their colleagues, patients, and the health care system. As discussed above, pharmacist-led clinics and clinical interventions have been shown to cut costs, improve efficiency, reduce hospitalization rates, and enhance health outcomes. It is the authors’ belief that increased utilization of pharmacists in a more clinical capacity will allow for more robust patient care. Outpatient care models, such as the one described in this manuscript, must be utilized in the outpatient setting in order for pharmacists to continue providing high-quality services to our patients.</p>
