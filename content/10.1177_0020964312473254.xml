<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It verges on the oxymoronic to suggest that we can or should develop a “theology of silence” in the Hebrew Bible, but the presence in the canon of books like Lamentations requires this of us. God’s silence, in the aftermath of severe trauma and tragedy in particular, can be seen as confounding, frustrating, and infuriating. Understanding the form and function of God’s silence in the Book of Lamentations requires patience, creativity, good listening and reading skills, and a deep appreciation for so-called “negative spaces” of God’s silence in the book. This essay first listens for the sounds of lamentation preserved in its many dialogic facets in an effort to establish the “positive spaces”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020964312473254">1</xref></sup> against which we can contrast God’s deafening silence in the book, in a manner that is similar to the contrast of negative and positive spaces in artistic creations of many kinds. Once this loud and clamoring background is established, an inquiry into God’s eerie silence necessarily produces many options for interpreting and understanding God’s silence in the Book of Lamentations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020964312473254">
<title>The Dialogic Book of Lamentations</title>
<p>A brief evaluation of the dialogic aspects of the Book of Lamentations will lend a sharper contrast to this discussion of God’s silence in the book. Biblical scholars, borrowing from the work of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, use this term “dialogic” (and its variants: “dialogical” or “dialogism”) to describe both a process and a product. A dialogic conversation or composition is one that preserves multiple, diverse, unmerged perspectives. This is different than a monolog (a speech by a single person or many persons confined to a single perspective), because authentic dialogue introduces all of its participants to new ideas, experiences, and insights that are brought to the dialogue by the many different partners. Alternatively, a conversation between two people who agree on all their talking points will not stimulate growth in either person because nothing new has been introduced to them by the other party.</p>
<p>Dialogic products are a little trickier to cultivate. There is a funneling or filtering that often happens once an editor or author enters into the equation because of our common human tendency to fit our experiences into a framework that has meaning and importance for us as individuals. A collection of essays, for example, can be selected for publication in a single volume because of their uniformity of opinion on a given subject; this would result in a monologic product despite the collaboration of multiple partners. Alternatively, a collection of essays might be assembled specifically for their diversity of opinions (or outright contradictions) on a given subject; this would result in a more dialogic <italic>product</italic> even though the authors may not have ever met or interacted with one another. A reader’s interaction with this product would also constitute a dialogic <italic>process</italic> because of their own encounter with the differing perspectives. Much of Bakhtin’s most important work was on the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky who was one of the few authors, in Bakhtin’s opinion, that was able to author a work that genuinely preserved multiple, diverse, unmerged perspectives in the characters and story lines that he created. This means that a dialogic <italic>product</italic> does not necessarily have to come out of a dialogic process involving the input of multiple partners, but it must find a way to preserve or embody differing perspectives without forcing them into a monologic framework. Biblical scholars have embraced Bakhtin’s concepts as a response to the often constraining attempts in biblical theology to find the hermeneutic “center” of the HB. After decades of such attempts, many scholars feel liberated by the idea that the <italic>meaning</italic> of the Bible cannot be limited to any one organizing principle.</p>
<p>Now that dialogical processes and products have been explained, two primary facets of Lamentation’s dialogic nature will be highlighted.</p>
<list id="list1-0020964312473254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. <italic>Narration from Multiple Perspectives</italic>. The first dialogic feature of the book, as can be seen in each of the five chapters in the Book of Lamentations, is the consistent shifting back and forth between two (or more) different voices in the narration of the book. The voice that opens the book neither identifies itself nor refers to itself using first person “I” language. In reference to psalmic laments, this voice has been referred to as the Didactic Voice (DV) because it punctuates (or interrupts, or adds to) the supplicant’s lamentation with explanations about the relationships between humans, God, sin, and justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020964312473254">2</xref></sup> In Lamentations, the DV describes the actions committed by and against the various characters in the text (Daughter Zion, God, enemies, etc.) as can be seen in the following example:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper,</p>
<p>because the LORD has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020964312473254">3</xref></sup>;</p>
<p>her children have gone away, captives before the foe. (1:5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, the DV does not address God directly in a prayer-like posture, but rather speaks of God in descriptive terms. However, as can be seen in 1:21, there is another voice that speaks in first person discourse (“I” and “me”) and addresses God directly using mostly second person language (“You”):
<disp-quote>
<p>They heard how I was groaning, with no one to comfort me.</p>
<p>All my enemies heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it.</p>
<p>Bring on the day you have announced, and let them be as I am. (1:21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In chapter 1, this voice makes an appearance in vv. 9 and 11, but then takes over the narration for the second half of the chapter starting in v. 12. Thus, the DV gives the third person descriptions of Zion’s sufferings and God’s actions, and the second voice is a voice of supplication, of prayer, of protest, and of anger born out of personal experiences of suffering.</p>
<p>This second voice is the voice of Daughter Zion herself. In the HB and other ancient Near Eastern cultures, cities were often described in feminine terms or assigned a female persona.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020964312473254">4</xref></sup> The city of Jerusalem is called Daughter Zion here in the Book of Lamentations, and in many other parts of the HB as well (2 Kgs 19:21; Ps 9:15; Isa 1:8, 10:32, 16:1, 37:22, 52:2, 62:11; Jer 4:31, 6:2, 6:23; Mic 1:13, 4:8, 4:10, 4:13; Zeph 3:14; Zech 2:14, 9:9). God’s silent response to the cries of Daughter Zion is the primary subject of this evaluation.</p>
<list id="list2-0020964312473254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. <italic>Disputing the Prophets</italic>. The second dialogic facet of Lamentations is Daughter Zion’s disputation with or “talking back to”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020964312473254">5</xref></sup> the prophetic mode of linking political and social trauma to God’s divine punishment of Israel’s sins. Consider, for example, Jer 6:19–23 where God, speaking through the prophet, threatens to “bring disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not given heed to my words; and as for my teaching, they have rejected it.” Thus, the peoples’ rejection of God’s teaching brings about the destruction told of in the vv. 22–23 where “parents and children together, neighbor and friend shall perish. Therefore thus says the LORD: See, a people is coming from the land of the north . . . they ride on horses, equipped like a warrior for battle, against you, O daughter Zion!” Here, God’s punishment is the <italic>just</italic> consequence of the sins of the people. In the Book of Lamentations, Daughter Zion suggests that the horrible things happening to her are <italic>unjust</italic>, overreactions on the part of God to whatever far less offensive sins she may have committed.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were fastened together;</p>
<p>they weigh on my neck, sapping my strength;</p>
<p>the Lord handed me over to those whom I cannot withstand. (1:14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, her “sin” of seeking out other “friends” and “lovers”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0020964312473254">6</xref></sup> was motivated by starvation! Thus, the overly harsh actions attributed to God in the following verses from chapter 2 are a result of God forgetting, taking the role of the enemy, being unjust, or being angry:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Lord has become like an enemy; <underline>he</underline> has destroyed Israel;</p>
<p><underline>He</underline> has destroyed all its palaces, laid in ruins its strongholds,</p>
<p>and multiplied <underline>in daughter Judah</underline> mourning and lamentation. (2:5, <underline>DV</underline>)</p>
<p>The young and the old are lying on the ground in the streets;</p>
<p><underline>my</underline> young women and <underline>my</underline> young men have fallen by the sword;</p>
<p>in the day of <underline>your</underline> anger <underline>you</underline> have killed them, slaughtering without mercy. (2:21, <underline>Zion</underline>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through these images, Daughter Zion gives voice to a theological position that is both different from and critical of the positions espoused by the prophets. The focus here is not the sins of Daughter Zion bringing about God’s just punishment as it is in Jeremiah 6. Rather, God is being called out by <italic>both</italic> Daughter Zion <italic>and</italic> the DV<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0020964312473254">7</xref></sup> because of the extreme losses experienced by the people. This is a particularly striking fact because the DV, as represented in the psalms of lament, is often a theodic voice that defends God’s actions as right and just against the theological challenges born out of the supplicant’s experiences and complaints. The evidence that the DV has changed allegiances to the side of the supplicant (Daughter Zion, in this case) shows that this is a decidedly unique occasion for lamenting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0020964312473254">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now that the dialogical character of Lamentations has been laid out, one complicated portion of text near the end of chapter 3 deserves consideration because it may be an instance where God breaks the otherwise dominating silence maintained in the rest of the book.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020964312473254">
<title>Lamentations 3: Does God Break the Silence?</title>
<p>To be sure, God’s presence is never absent from the Book of Lamentations. God is perhaps overly active in the minds of the authors of the text, as was seen in the language of chapter 2 discussed above. As in Job 7:17–21, God’s presence is not always seen as comforting during times of great trauma. Moreover, perceiving God’s simultaneous presence <italic>and</italic> silence in the midst of profound suffering is torturous. So torturous that it appears as though another author or editor of Lamentations decided to place the decidedly “different” chapter 3 in the middle of the other four laments. <italic>If</italic> we hear God’s voice at all in the Book of Lamentations, it happens only once, and it happens in 3:57:
<disp-quote>
<p>I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit; (3:55)</p>
<p>you heard my plea, “Do not close your ear to my cry for help, but give me relief!” (3:56)</p>
<p>You came near when I called on you; you said, “Do not fear! (<italic>’al tira’</italic> )” (3:57)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are three good reasons to consider chapter 3 as related to, but ultimately different than, the other four chapters. First, the voice of the supplicant (the prayerful, first-person voice) is not the voice of a female, personified city as it is in chapters 1 and 2, and possibly in 4 and 5. Rather, it is narrated from the perspective of an explicitly male supplicant<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0020964312473254">9</xref></sup> who speaks in abstract terms about his own losses as opposed to the very specific, heart-wrenching images of starving children and violent attacks against <italic>all</italic> of the people of Jerusalem given in the rest of the book. Second, there is no mention of Zion, Judah, or Jerusalem (and their variants, “Daughter Zion” etc.) in the third chapter. There are a few references to a community (3:40–47 uses “us” rather than “I” like the rest of the chapter) but never to a city or place explicitly. This is markedly different than the other four chapters, which refer to the physical space of a city or the personified city with great frequency (Zion/Daughter Zion—1:4, 6, 17; 2:1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 18; 4:2, 11, 22; 5:11, 18. Judah/Daughter Judah—1:3, 15; 2:2, 5; 5:11. Jerusalem/Daughter Jerusalem—1:7, 8, 17; 2:10, 13, 15; 4:12. Jacob—2:2, 3. Israel—2:5. Sodom—4:6. Edom/Uz/Daughter Edom—4:21, 22. Egypt/ Assyria—5:6). Third, from 3:21 on there is a much greater confidence in God’s justice and faithfulness than can be seen anywhere in the other four chapters. This is odd when compared with the last few verses of chapter 5, the last words of the book as we have it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Why have you forgotten us completely? Why have you forsaken us these many days?</p>
<p>Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored; renew our days as of old—</p>
<p>unless you have utterly rejected us, and are angry with us beyond measure. (5:20–22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These are not words spoken out of a place of confidence. These words come from a place of doubt, anxiety, and frustration with a God once thought to be familiar and trustworthy.</p>
<p>In light of the overwhelming differences between chapter 3 and the other four chapters, the two words spoken in 3:57 might also take on a less than obvious interpretation. Perhaps what is often read as God speaking in the precise moment of Daughter Zion’s anguish is actually a reflection on <italic>past</italic> words of comfort and <italic>previous</italic> saving actions to which the community is looking for their future hope. The use of the perfect tense in Hebrew conveys a sense that this is an action that is fully complete—“you have said to me”—rather than an imperfect or participle that could be rendered in the present tense: “you say” or “you are saying to me.” Thus, these verses are not necessarily God speaking words of comfort to Israel but could be read as the traditions of Israel calling out to Daughter Zion.</p>
<p>To be clear, chapter 3 has a great deal of value in its own right. The suggestion that it should be read as both amid and distant from the other four chapters is not meant to suggest that these are not wise words or that these words should be ignored because they seek to give comfort to an ailing community. Rather, the presence of this odd chapter in the exact center of a five-part book leads one to inquire about <italic>how</italic> this chapter belongs to the other four. If chapter 3 was inserted by a later editor in an effort to relieve the utter hopelessness and anxiety impressed upon the reader by an intimate reading of the book, then it seems we ought first to try to experience the raw fear of God and enemies preserved in the other four chapters before we let ourselves hear those two small words spoken by God: <italic>’al tira’</italic> (“do not fear”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020964312473254">
<title>A God that Chooses Silence</title>
<p>Making meaning out of acute suffering is extremely complicated for any community, religious or otherwise. There is, however, a certain theological challenge that one faces in a religious setting where there is only one God. Especially when this is a God portrayed as the creator of all things <italic>and</italic> the one who grants power to leaders, judges, kings, and empires. So not only does God’s “oneness” require explanation in the face of evil,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0020964312473254">10</xref></sup> but also God’s frequent involvement in the life of Israel must give us pause in our effort to understand when and why such an active and powerful God chooses to keep silence. We have established a tortured, tumultuous background against which God’s silence in the Book of Lamentations can be contrasted. Now, a very brief look at two preliminary questions regarding God’s characterization in other parts of the HB will serve as another background against which we can compare God’s silent response to the suffering of Daughter Zion.</p>
<list id="list3-0020964312473254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. <italic>Who is this silent God?</italic> The long and tumultuous history of biblical theologians trying to attach one “signature” characteristic to the God of the HB is often thwarted by the Book of Lamentations. This is because God’s actions in the book do not conjure up images of God’s covenantal love, justice, or righteousness. The type of approach proposed in Walter Brueggemann’s work, <italic>An Unsettling God: The Heart of the Hebrew Bible</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0020964312473254">11</xref></sup> adapts well to complicated texts like Lamentations because it is founded on the principle that a dialogic God cannot ever truly be settled in one simplistic category or another if this God authentically engages with the ever-changing human community. This gets to the (intentional?) word play of the title of Brueggemann’s book. On the one hand, the God depicted in the HB is “unsettling” because the modes of divine communication, human interaction with God, and divinely appointed human leaders are constantly shifting throughout the biblical text. On the other hand, this God is “unsettling” because adaptation, even for a better or more intimate relationship between God and humans, is still adaptation. This is an unsettling thought because God, being unbound by anything but God’s own self, could choose something <italic>other</italic> than what is known. God’s absolute freedom sharpens the anxiety behind statements about God becoming an enemy (2:5) or God “utterly rejecting” Israel (5:22), even though these sentiments match neither the words that God spoke to Abraham in Gen 12:3 (in which case God would have to curse God’s self) nor the numerous iterations of God proclaiming that a remnant of Israel would be preserved (e.g., Gen 8:21; 2 Kgs 19:30 / Isa 37:31; Zech 8:6).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2. <italic>Why is this God silent?</italic> In their recent study <italic>The Silent God</italic>, Marjo Korpel and Johannes de Moor remind us that God speaks <italic>much</italic> more frequently in the HB than God explicitly keeps silent. By their count, there are 1,882 verbs and nouns denoting God’s speech, and only 29 verbs and nouns that explicitly mark God’s silence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0020964312473254">12</xref></sup> Their study first examines modern conceptions of the silent God in literature, media, philosophy, and theology. They then summarize and analyze how silence functions in the literatures of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia and Egypt especially) and the HB. They divide this second part of their study by the type of relationship in which silence plays a role: human silence toward other humans (ch. 3), human silence before God (chs. 4–5), and finally, God’s silence toward humans (ch. 6). For each of these three types of relationships, they recognize five common reasons why silence is kept: offence, awe or fear, forbearance or prudence, incapacity, and sleep. In God’s case, however, they suggest that the categories of “incapacity” and “sleep” are not really applicable, even though God is called to wake up, for example, in Ps 44:24 (25 in Hebrew): “Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever!” This is not equivalent to human incapacity or sleepiness because here the supplicant expects that God can still hear and respond to the call.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>More strongly, they suggest that while silence may have been kept because of fear or awe by the gods of the ancient Near East, “such feelings are rarely, if ever, attributed to God in the canonical books of the Bible.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0020964312473254">13</xref></sup> While this seems to be true on an explicit level, it will be proposed later that God could be keeping silent in the Book of Lamentations because God is baffled by the extent of Daughter Zion’s destruction at the hands of God’s Babylonian punishing rod. Korpel and de Moor recognize this idea in part when they suggest that God is left out of some of the more violent and horrendous scenes, of rape in particular, in the HB.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0020964312473254">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>That leaves two clear options in trying to determine the source of divine silence: offence and forbearance or prudence. For example, when the people offend God by demanding the installation of a king, Samuel declares in 1 Sam 8:18 that God will ignore any future complaints that Israel has concerning their king:
<disp-quote>
<p>And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the LORD will not answer you in that day.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other times, it is made clear that God kept silent because it was prudent for the life of the community. For example, in Jer 7:22–24, we read that God had no need to mention burnt offerings because the people were only instructed to be responsive to God’s voice:
<disp-quote>
<p>For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave them, “Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may be well with you.” Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but, in the stubbornness of their evil will, they walked in their own counsels, and looked backward rather than forward.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, God kept silent concerning some matters so that the people could focus on the matters about which God was speaking—namely to stay in right relationship with God by trusting in the new place toward which God was leading them rather than longing for that which was behind them. Occasions for God’s prudent or forbearing silence are rare, but they give us some insight into the <italic>telos</italic> or function of God’s silence in a way that other moments of silence cannot do with the same sort of clarity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020964312473254">
<title>Why Is God Silent in the Book of Lamentations?</title>
<p>It is time to turn back to Daughter Zion now that we have established both the dialogical character of the Book of Lamentations and the difficult and partially subjective nature of trying to determine why God chooses to remain silent in the HB.</p>
<list id="list4-0020964312473254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. <italic>Silence because of Daughter Zion’s sin or offence?</italic> Because Israel’s sin is a common reason for God’s silence in the HB, its relevance to the Book of Lamentations should be explored. Both Daughter Zion and the DV remember something that offended God in some way as can be seen in the following verses:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper,</p>
<p>because the LORD has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions (<italic>pes  a(</italic> );</p>
<p>her children have gone away, captives before the foe. (DV, 1:5)</p>
<p>The LORD is in the right, for I have rebelled (<italic>marah</italic>) against his word;</p>
<p>but hear, all you peoples, and behold my suffering;</p>
<p>my young women and young men have gone into captivity. (Zion, 1:18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The two words, <italic>peša<sup>(</sup></italic> and <italic>marah</italic>, do not necessarily signify the sinful or criminal applications of the English word “transgression” used by the NRSV translators. Rather, these verbs reflect Daughter Zion’s decision to “transgress” (with the sense of moving across a boundary) her relationship with the God of Israel by seeking comfort from other nations in the forms of food and protection. However, when reading these verses in their larger context of chapter 1 and the book as a whole, it appears that both Daughter Zion <italic>and</italic> the DV suggest that her rebellion and transgression were motivated by the annihilation and starvation of her people (1:3, 5, 11, 13, 18–20; 2:11–12, 20; 4:4–5, 9–10; 5:4, 9–10; see also Jer 44:15–19). In other words, the narration of the book as a whole minimizes whatever sins may have been committed by Israel and Daughter Zion in order to focus her agonizing lament on what has been lost rather than bothering too much with what she may or may not have done to bring about her destruction. Therefore, it is questionable whether God’s silence is <italic>caused</italic> by any sins or offences committed by Daughter Zion, because the book as a whole focuses on the severity of her suffering and the absence of God’s response.</p>
<list id="list5-0020964312473254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. <italic>Respectful Silence</italic>. There are two ways in which God perhaps shows respect for Daughter Zion by keeping silent. First, it shows that God is a good listener. There is no clear indication in the text that Daughter Zion wants God to respond to her plight in an audible fashion: “Unlike Job she does not even demand a response. Rather, self-expression seems to be both the function and <italic>telos</italic> of her discourses.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0020964312473254">15</xref></sup> Daughter Zion certainly shows a desire for her own restoration and the annihilation of other nations, but she never actually asks for God to speak.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Thus, if we are able just for a brief moment to overlook all of the violent deeds ascribed to God in the Book of Lamentations, we can actually see in God’s silence a moment of deep respect for Daughter Zion to pour out her full lament. This is a good lesson for teaching and pastoral communities today. Sometimes we need to rage uninterrupted. Silence is a pastoral tool that is underutilized in a society that values the noise of patches and “apps” over quietness, introspection, and silence. When hurting people come to their counselors, teachers, and pastors, there is too often the presumption that they desire an immediate response rather than a safe place to pour out their raw feelings and ideas without the interruptions of snap-judgments or cookie-cutter psychological or theological analysis.</p>
<p>Second, silence is often the only respectful response to the severe trauma. The Jewish tradition of <italic>shiv’ah</italic> sets aside seven days of mourning after the passing of a loved one. This is not necessarily a time of silence, but it is a way of quieting all other life duties for an appointed amount of time as a way of showing respect both for the deceased as well as the surviving family. In the psalms of lament, there is often some sort of praise, or vow of future praise, given for God’s actual or assumed intervention in the needs of the supplicant. The lack of such a vow at the end of Lamentations (except, perhaps, for the later insertion of chapter 3) is perhaps a sign that God is maintaining the space of mourning as a sign of respect for the destroyed city and her many deceased inhabitants before getting back to the business of being the warrior God who destroys their enemies and builds up nations.</p>

<list-item><p>3. <italic>Baffled silence</italic>. Because laments have such a typical form in which some kind of assurance from God is expected, one is left wondering, “Why not here?” As was mentioned above, there are some scenes that are too horrifying for God to be associated with them, and so God’s presence, actions, and even the divine name itself is totally missing from them—for example, the different scenes depicting rape in the HB. Although it would not be an unwarranted stretch to compare the horrendous things that happen to Daughter Zion in this book with other rape scenes in the HB, the presence of the divine name in numerous places in Lamentations requires that we formulate a slightly different question. If God is “on the scene” (unlike the rape narratives) but not speaking (unlike most other narratives when God is present), then what other reasons might God have for <italic>not</italic> breaking through the silence with a vow to destroy Daughter Zion’s enemies or restore her fortunes? One thought is that God is simply baffled—stunned into silence because God did not plan on the extensiveness of the devastation. Perhaps God is silently ashamed of letting things get out of hand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0020964312473254">16</xref></sup> There is even a hint in the first chapter that God’s attempt at keeping the enemies of Israel out simply failed:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Enemies have stretched out their hands over all her precious things;</p>
<p>she has even seen the nations invade her sanctuary,</p>
<p>those whom you forbade to enter your congregation. (1:10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If there were a time during the biblical period of Israel’s history where God would have kept silent because of God’s own bafflement, then it would very likely be here: amid the ruins of the destroyed temple and starved bodies of the people that God loves so dearly.</p>
<list id="list7-0020964312473254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. <italic>Pedagogic silence.</italic> Whether it is ultimately “right” or not (which can never be known, but can be suggested), the Book of Lamentations certainly avoids giving a simple, monologic solution by attaching God’s words to the book. This forces the supplicant and the modern reader to process, <italic>and be processed by</italic>, Daughter Zion’s words, her pain, and her anxiety without access to an easy answer. We see this done every time a parent abstains from responding to a child’s cry in order to help teach the child to take care of itself. Likewise, in the Book of Lamentations, God could be trying to lead Israel into a new place, theologically speaking, by allowing her the space to learn how to soothe herself uninterrupted.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As we can see from the example of the Dead Sea Scroll community, the time between the 5th and 1st centuries <sc>b.c.e.</sc> was a time of gathering and collecting Israel’s stories. Perhaps the Book of Lamentations reflects a move by the community to question whether they are living in the same situation as their forbearers. Imagine suffering the kinds of losses they did while being told the story of the exodus, where God sends plagues against Israel’s oppressors. Daughter Zion cries, “Where is that God, and why have we been forgotten?” Indeed, the author of Lamentations relays the shock of their situation compared with one of the stories of God’s very active presence in the Bible:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the chastisement of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, though no hand was laid on it. (4:6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps Lamentations denotes a shift in thinking away from a God who will swoop in at a moment’s notice to save the day (very much <italic>unlike</italic> Psalm 44, for example). The reality of living in a world of empires requires a thick skin to survive the constant battering of increasingly bigger and more brutal enemies. God’s silence in Lamentations might be a way of drawing Israel into a new place of understanding their relationship to God.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Communities that value the HB should be both grateful for and baffled by the Book of Lamentations. Silence from God pervades the typical religious experiences of most folks the world over. Even people with highly devoted spiritual and prayer lives go an extremely long time (or even their whole lives!) without experiencing the call of the divine voice. Lamentations, as a reflection on suffering amid God’s presence <italic>and</italic> silence, has many more applications to biblical theology, pastoral care, and engaged ethics than most communities are willing to audition. Interpreting God’s silence requires patience in thoroughly evaluating the evidence that we have before us; it requires creativity in exploring the “negative space” left behind from a God that sometimes (in the Bible) and oftentimes (in contemporary living) does not respond to human pain in an easily detectible manner; and it requires deep sensitivity and respect for the pained voices calling out to us from the text, from our own world, and from our future generations, in order to better understand what we might learn even and especially when God is silent.</p>

<p>To be clear, the use of “negative” and “positive” space is a quantitative usage of the terminology rather than a qualitative usage of these terms. In other words, God’s silence is not necessarily negative, as in “bad for you.” Likewise, the voicing and sounds of the Book of Lamentations are positive only insofar as they have substance that can be analyzed, not that they are “happy” or “hopeful.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the NRSV commitment to inclusive language obscures the Hebrew text of verse 1. The Hebrew text starts off saying <italic>’ănî haggeber rā’ă ’ănî</italic>. While it is not always obvious that the term <italic>geber</italic> refers only to men when referring to a large group (see Exod 12:37 for an unclear example) it is relatively certain that on an individual level that the term does refer to a man (see Job 3:3, where <italic>geber</italic> is rendered by the NRSV as “man-child”).</p>
