<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is common to start an article about educational leadership with the claim that the work is complex and changing at an increasingly rapid rate. Although such an opening now may be trite, it is indeed the case. Leaders in Canadian schools and systems, similar to many other Western nations, serve a population that is more diverse than ever before in the history of our nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112443438">Government of Alberta, 2009</xref>), with the associated challenges of integrating potentially clashing cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942775112443438">Lund, 2003</xref>). Provincial and national governments seek greater economic competitiveness and look to education systems to educate a citizenry with the capacity to compete successfully in the global village (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112443438">Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD], 2001</xref>). Information and communication technology (ICT) has reshaped virtually all of society and schools are no exception; students and teachers are expected to integrate technology into teaching and learning at all levels of schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1942775112443438">Webber, 2010</xref>). There are calls for greater coherence across teaching, learning, and assessment and, also, for accountability to policy makers and society as a whole for the quality of learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1942775112443438">Webber, Aitken, Lupart, &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>). As well, school leaders are required to establish strong linkages among community stakeholders for the purpose of promoting positive relationships and social cohesion through sound communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Mulford, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This article is a response to the challenges of educational leadership in increasingly complex communities and societies. An argument is presented that educational entrepreneurship is necessary in the context of a thriving civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1942775112443438">Webber, Scott, &amp; Lupart, 2012</xref>) and to explore how leadership development programs can nurture entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. A description and conceptual framework for educational entrepreneurship are offered using the Life Long Learning Leader (4L) leadership development framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>), which was developed from the findings of the International Study of the Preparation of Principals (ISPP). This is followed by a discussion of sociopolitical influences of yesterday and today that have led to a critical need to reconceptualize educational leadership so that it is more entrepreneurial in nature. Then a review is provided of the published findings of the ISPP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://people.ucalgary.ca/~cwebber/ISPP/pubs.htm">http://people.ucalgary.ca/~cwebber/ISPP/pubs.htm</ext-link>) that suggest that entrepreneurialism can be explored and utilized in a range of international settings. Subsequently, a profile of the manifestations of entrepreneurialism in Canada is offered in an attempt to advocate for and to demystify the dimensions of principled and socially responsible educational entrepreneurship needed by tomorrow’s leaders. The article closes with conclusions intended to inform leadership development in other cultural contexts.</p>

<title>A Description and Conceptual Framework for Educational Entrepreneurship</title>
<p>Several assumptions underpin the 4L framework and, therefore, this article. First, leadership development programs can be effective in nurturing sound leadership knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112443438">Dimmock &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112443438">Karstanje &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>). Second, high-quality teaching, learning, and assessment are the primary purposes of educational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112443438">Leithwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112443438">Leithwood &amp; Jantzi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112443438">Mulford, 2008</xref>). Third, leadership matters; without good leadership, it is not possible to have effective schools and educational systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112443438">Fullan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112443438">Hargreaves &amp; Goodson, 2006</xref>). Fourth, the leadership development needs of principals vary across career stages and leadership development must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate stage-related needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1942775112443438">Steffy, Wolfe, Pasch, &amp; Enz, 2000</xref>). Next, leadership occurs within all roles in educational communities and synergies can be achieved through cross-role collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112443438">Ballek, O’Rourke, Provenzano, &amp; Bellamy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112443438">Robertson &amp; Webber, 2002</xref>). In addition, leadership development should incorporate the principles of adult learning theory and encompass problem solving, reflection, active learning, career aspirations, and recognition of prior learning. Importantly, effective educational leaders are flexible and resilient, utilizing their social and political acumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112443438">McGinn, 2004</xref>) to meet the needs of their constituents. A final assumption that girds the 4L model is that educational leaders must demonstrate entrepreneurship in multidimensional and enterprising ways as they create and maintain quality educational environments that contribute to a civil democratic society.</p>
<p>In a previous article, we offered the following description of entrepreneurship in education:
<disp-quote>
<p>Educational entrepreneurship focuses strategically on creating short and long-term opportunities for learning that will make a significant difference for individuals and their societies. Financial return sufficient to ensure quality programming is an important consideration in educational entrepreneurship but not its raison d’etre. Rather, the primary purpose of educational entrepreneurship is the building of human and social capacity to lead responsible, constructive educational initiatives. Coupled with educational entrepreneurship is the necessary consideration of incorporating and structuring sustainability to ensure that the programs, teaching, and outcomes are of a consistently high standard. Therefore educational entrepreneurship can also include [teachers] as well as students as learners within the learning organization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our description above was accompanied by a framework that outlined the elements and attributes of educational entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942775112443438">Table 1</xref> highlights six central elements of entrepreneurship in educational organizations. The first element, <italic>innovative behavior</italic>, is presented as having four attributes: (a) the generation of knowledge and skills within the organization, (b) the imagining of possible futures or “possibilizing,” (c) the demonstration of social and political acumen whereby the leader has the ability to communicate effectively and to facilitate constructive relationships with the members of the organization and external communities, and (d) the technical skills needed to act as a change agent. The second element, <italic>networking</italic>, is characterized by two attributes, that is, information acquisition necessary to lead positive change, and successful adaptation to changing conditions through the manifestation of flexible and resilient behaviors. The third element, <italic>time–space communication framework</italic>, employs new technologies to communicate synchronously and asynchronously with local and distributed audiences in ways that reflect temporal variability, for example, intensive and paced time frames for communication. The fourth element, <italic>local–global perspective</italic>, requires entrepreneurs to develop cultural literacies and multidimensional perspectives that enable them to work responsibly with local, national, and global communities. Fifth, the conceptualization of <italic>educational organizations as knowledge centers</italic> encourages all members of organizations to create and mobilize knowledge in the best interests of learning communities. The sixth element, <italic>integrated face-to-face and Internet-based learning</italic>, recognizes the opportunities that the information age presents for educational organizations to succeed in a competitive international environment through the formation of strategic alliances.</p>

<p>The concept of entrepreneurship, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942775112443438">Table 1</xref>, is an expansion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942775112443438">Figure 1</xref>) of the boundary-breaking entrepreneurialism dimension contained in the 4L framework (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942775112443438">Table 2</xref>). The 4L framework comprised eight dimensions: career stage, career aspirations, visionary capacity, boundary-breaking entrepreneurialism, professional skills, instructional design and assessment literacy, crisis management, and approaches to leadership development. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942775112443438">Table 2</xref> portrays how each dimension consists of several key components which, in turn, can be broken into leadership knowledge and skills that can serve as the basis for leadership development programming. This article focuses primarily on the <italic>boundary-breaking entrepreneurialism dimension</italic> of the 4L framework and on how it may be demonstrated by educational leaders (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942775112443438">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The foundational principle of boundary-breaking entrepreneurialism is the concept of possibilizing which involves “pushing the edges of beliefs and practices . . . to create new possibilities for learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Robertson, 1998</xref>, p. 18). It also encompasses the capacity to challenge accepted knowledge, to “juxtapose the familiar and the foreign . . . [and] to embrace ambiguity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>, p. 770). Entrepreneurial leaders are comfortable with “reconsidering space, time, and practice” in their pursuit of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>, p. 770). Therefore, boundary breaking is the “capacity to move learning beyond the boundaries normally imposed by cultures, roles, institutions, economics, and national borders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Robertson, 1998</xref>, p. 13).</p>
<p>As part of our conceptual framework, we also argue that entrepreneurial leadership includes social and political acumen, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112443438">McGinn (2005)</xref>: “Political acumen [refers] to the ability to use the knowledge of structures and relationships. Social acumen [refers] to the ability to communicate and foster productive relationships” (p. np). Educational entrepreneurs also must have the technical skills associated with change management, such as conflict resolution, relationship building, time management, and the capacity to triage needs and set priorities.</p>
<p>For educational entrepreneurs to possibilize successfully within the parameters of educational, social, and political systems, they must understand the social and political events that have shaped and informed the development of their educational systems. In the case of Canadian educational entrepreneurs, it is essential that they are able to interpret the overt and covert influences of 19th- and 20th-century events on current directions and possibilities. The following section is a selective chronology of critical events in Canadian history that have helped to shape current educational policy and practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1942775112443438">
<title>Social and Political Influences in Canadian Education</title>
<p>English and French colonialism provided the framework for public and Catholic schooling across the nation. This was evident in the establishment of early schools for the children of settlers, fur traders, and First Nations. Much of the schooling was church oriented. A key figure during this period was Egerton Ryerson, superintendent of education in Upper Canada (now Ontario), who initiated a focus on free, compulsory education with a standardized curriculum as a means to promote national stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112443438">Nixon, 2006</xref>). During this period, mass education was never achieved and few young people progressed beyond basic literacies. However, teacher education emerged as a government-supported initiative in the form of Normal Schools, the first of which was the Toronto Normal School established in 1847 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1942775112443438">Stamp, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>First Nations children initially were enrolled in residential schools in the mid-19th century in Upper Canada and, subsequently, in the Canadian west. The negative impact of residential schools, some of which continued to operate till the 1980s, remains a legacy into the 21st century. This legacy includes First Nation memories of children being separated from their families and communities, forbidden to speak their languages, marginalized from their cultures, and, in some cases, physically and sexually abused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1942775112443438">Ottmann, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, during the last years of the 19th century, Canadians recognized the importance of schooling in the improvement of society. In the context of industrialization, child welfare laws, and the realization that education was a tool for upward social mobility, schooling throughout North America expanded, particularly at the secondary level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112443438">Murphy, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1942775112443438">Powell, Farrar, &amp; Cohen, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The early part of the 20th century was a period which defined Canada as a nation, an identity that continues today. The events of World War I, particularly battles such as those at Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele in 1917, united Canadians in unprecedented ways. This led in time to a greater focus on Canadian content in provincial curricula.</p>
<p>The Great Depression was a decade of social and educational deprivation across the nation but especially in the western provinces. School boards reduced the length of the school year, cut or eliminated teachers’ salaries, and were unable to provide more than basic educational resources. One cultural phenomenon to emerge from the Great Depression was a generation of Canadians who lived in ongoing fear of economic hardship and social instability. Another was the heightened perception, that continues today, that education is a means to a more prosperous and secure lifestyle.</p>
<p>World War II influenced education across Canada in major ways. Not only was there tragic loss of life but also controversy regarding conscription, which emerged in World War I, pitted English and French Canadians against one another. Post World War II, Canadians enjoyed the reemergence of economic prosperity, along with social changes such as the increase of women in the workforce, higher levels of education for women and men, and social stability that lasted into the 1960s.</p>
<p>The late 1950s through the mid-1970s saw the emergence in the United States of several social movements that also influenced Canadians. The American civil rights movement, in conjunction with what was called the youth movement, elicited a parallel interest among Canadians in the questioning of authority, equality for women and minorities, and environmental issues. In the United States, violent activism marred the social movements and resulted in events such as the Kent State University student shootings and the assassination of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Junior. Parallel violent activism incidents in Canada included the computer center riot at Sir George Williams University protesting perceived racism. As well, the 1970 kidnapping by the Front de Libération du Québec of the British Trade Commissioner in Montreal, James Cross, and the kidnapping and murder of Québec cabinet minister, Pierre Laporte, was a terrorist attempt to establish an independent socialist Québec. These incidents caused Canadian educators to reconsider the allocation of power and decision-making responsibilities throughout the educational system. The attention of educators in the United States and Canada was heightened further by the Soviet Union launch of an unmanned space vehicle, Sputnik. The subsequent fear of Soviet domination during the Cold War refocused educational curricula on math and science outcomes. It was during the resulting Space Race that computer technology emerged as a force that would significantly reshape education.</p>
<p>The last two decades of the 20th century saw exponential change. The U.S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112443438">National Commission on Excellence in Education (1983)</xref> report, “A Nation at Risk,” accused schools, curricula, and teachers of mismanagement, incompetence, and mediocrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112443438">Lupart &amp; Webber, 2002</xref>). The report, arguably the most influential educational document of the era, ushered in a period of Canadian school reform characterized by educational accountability, cutbacks in educational funding, and calls for increased educator professionalism.</p>
<p>The Canadian economic scene found that previously strong industries such as uranium mining in the Canadian Shield, the cod fishery in Atlantic Canada, and the west coast salmon industry no longer could support large employment. The environmental and political debate surrounding the seal hunt, a traditional part of northern culture and economy, reduced the international demand for seal skins. These and other shifts in industry and employment opportunities altered communities and frequently led to dislocation of large segments within the Canadian population. Along with concurrent social change, Canadian society evolved to include two working parents in intact families and a rise in the incidence of single parent, same sex, and blended families. All these economic issues had a subsequent influence on Canadian education.</p>
<p>From the 1980s through the present time, international migration of people, products, and information transformed societies and became known as globalization. The Internet facilitated the growth of the knowledge economy and demanded new skills and knowledge of students and their teachers. Ecological issues also came to the forefront of public awareness in Canada. All these social and political events influenced school curricula.</p>
<p>One of the late-20th-century shifts in the social fabric of Western nations resulted in the school reform movement. This was originated by the United Kingdom Thatcher Government’s application of business models to school operations, focusing on efficiency, cost effectiveness, and measurable achievement. In Canada, the impact of school reform was evident, particularly in the province of Alberta where the 1990s was a period of amalgamation of school districts, salary rollbacks, and the introduction of school-based management.</p>
<p>The first decade of the 21st century is a time when ICT is transforming the way society does business, plays, accesses information, collaborates, and learns. It is also a time of economic uncertainty across global markets and international terrorism fears. These and other global factors have altered student and community demographics, plus curriculum content. Furthermore, teachers’ perceptions of their work environment have changed, along with the ways that they facilitate learning.</p>
<p>In summary, Canadian educational leaders seeking to become entrepreneurs must deal with a wide range of expectations that their predecessors never encountered or, if they did, did not have to address. Today, educational leaders must comprehend and respond astutely to the collective impact of Canada’s legacy of English and French tension. They must collaborate with First Nations and other cultural groups to mediate educational approaches that are culturally respectful and appropriate. Leaders must grapple with the aftermath of economic cycles that have, in turn, devastated and rewarded individuals and groups of Canadians. Another requirement is the capacity to contribute to the nurturing of a collective Canadian multicultural identity. Social responsibility is another key dimension of the role of educational leaders as schools are elemental in facilitating positive social reconstruction. Similarly, the integration of ICT throughout educational communities is imperative as its impact on education has been well documented and educators have a responsibility to provide students with guidance in navigating the information age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112443438">Blackmore, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112443438">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The preceding outlines the shifts in the educational landscape over time and the current massive set of expectations on educational leaders. It is by no means a complete list but illustrates the imperative of reconceptualizing approaches to leadership development for contemporary leaders. The following section examines what we know about the learning needs of aspiring and novice principals that have emerged from a multicountry research study called the ISPP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ucalgary.ca/~cwebber/ISPP/">http://ucalgary.ca/~cwebber/ISPP/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Insights From the ISPP</title>
<p>The ISPP is a collaboration of educational researchers from 14 countries, including Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Jamaica, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, Tanzania, Turkey, the United States, and China. It was designed to gather information that will guide those who help to prepare principals and headteachers for their first appointments. It addresses the question, <italic>How useful are principal preparation programs to novice principals?</italic> The ISPP was conducted in each cultural setting in three stages: (a) the mapping of principal preparation initiatives, (b) case studies of 6 to 10 novice principals, and (c) a survey of a sample of 50 to 100 early career principals. Initially, the ISPP was focused on elementary and primary principals but now is being expanded to include secondary principals due to the differences in size and complexity of secondary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112443438">Gaskell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1942775112443438">Seashore Louis, Dretzke, &amp; Wahlstrom, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>More than two dozen publications have emerged from the ISPP. They include peer-reviewed articles written by researchers in individual countries and refereed reports that compare findings across cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112443438">Karstanje &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112443438">Mentz, Webber, &amp; van der Walt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112443438">Nelson, de la Colina, &amp; Boone, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112443438">Onguko, Abdalla, &amp; Webber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1942775112443438">Purvey &amp; Webber, 2011</xref>; Scott &amp; Rarieya, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112443438">Slater et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1942775112443438">Slater, Garcia, &amp; Gorosave, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Scott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Sherman, 2008</xref>). In addition, the ISPP research team has disseminated findings through individual paper presentations and symposia at a range of scholarly meetings, including those hosted by the American Educational Research Association; the Canadian Society for the Study of Education; the British Educational Leadership, Management, and Administration Society; the University Council for Educational Administration; and the European Educational Research Association. Recently, ISPP researchers collaborated on 14 chapters that appeared in an edited book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112443438">Cowie, 2011</xref>) that reported ISPP case studies conducted throughout Australasia, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Another edited book, <italic>Understanding the Principalship: An International Guide to Principal Preparation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1942775112443438">Slater &amp; Nelson, in press</xref>), comprising 13 chapters authored by the ISPP research team, is in preparation. The ISPP research team collaborations also have resulted in related publications, such as a special issue of <italic>International Studies in Educational Administration</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Lupart, 2011</xref>) that presented a series of comparative articles focusing on intercultural inclusive educational leadership development and practices.</p>
<p>The following account is a meta-analysis of the published articles of ISPP research reports. An inductive approach to analyzing the findings was employed. Each publication was deconstructed to determine main themes and compelling findings using data analysis software and an iterative coding approach. The emergent categories were grouped according to similarities. Relationships were explored within and across these categories. From this process, cross-cultural similarities and differences became evident. The main themes were cross-cultural insights, succession planning, reconceptualizing leadership development, and revisioning instructional leadership. These themes are described in terms of the findings as well as through a comparison with the 4L framework’s dimension of entrepreneurship with the view to exploring how leadership preparation can be enhanced.</p>
<sec id="section5-1942775112443438">
<title>Cross-Cultural Insights</title>
<p>An important understanding has emerged from the findings of the ISPP. That is, the research team has learned that there are more thematic similarities than differences across cultures (Scott &amp; Rarieya, 2010). That is not to say that there are no significant differences, but there is value in learning from and across other cultural contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112443438">Slater et al. (2007)</xref> referred to the merit of being a “cultural traveler” (p. 83) while attempting to learn about educational leadership in Mexico and Texas. Frequently, the tensions inherent in leading schools manifest differently in varied cultural settings but allow greater insight for cultural travelers. This is a valuable perspective, particularly if researchers avoid the pitfalls of the role “of the <italic>tourist</italic>, taking a perfunctory view of leadership in different cultures and contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112443438">Walker &amp; Dimmock, 2004</xref>, p. 275).</p>
<p>The need for leadership preparation pervades cultures. In countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Mexico, nations that are in the process of educational development and building the necessary infrastructures, there is an overreliance on a type of apprenticeship model with a heavy emphasis on experiential learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112443438">Onguko et al., 2012</xref>). Mexican principals, called directors in their context, also learn primarily on-the-job as they begin in rural schools and, as they gain experience, become eligible to move to “wealthier schools in a more central location” (p. 82). However, it is not only developing nations where the need for principal preparation has been highlighted. Writing from an American perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112443438">Nelson et al. (2008)</xref> described the insufficient preparation that new principals in Texas have for the technical aspects of school leadership, such as, “time management, lack of policy knowledge, timely completion of paperwork, curriculum knowledge, and budget management” (p. 698). Similarly, Australian principals felt that their formal preparation was inadequate and that there was a major gap between the expectations that they had for their jobs and the day-to-day reality that they encountered once appointed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112443438">Clarke, Wildy, &amp; Pepper, 2007</xref>). Despite the need for principal preparation identified across cultural contexts, there is too often a deficit in the infrastructure necessary to provide formalized principal preparation programming through universities and governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112443438">Onguko, Abdalla, &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112443438">2012</xref>; Scott &amp; Rarieya, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1942775112443438">Slater et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1942775112443438">Wildy &amp; Clarke, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1942775112443438">
<title>Succession Planning</title>
<p>Succession planning difficulties result from insufficient or inappropriate preparation infrastructures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112443438">Slater et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112443438">Onguko et al. (2008)</xref> noted the succession challenges in developing nations, where the criteria and processes for principal appointments frequently are unclear and influenced by corrupt practices. Even within a highly formalized educational system, such as Scotland’s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112443438">Cowie and Crawford (2007)</xref> identified the need for appropriate succession planning that addressed system needs for planning and quality assurance as well as the needs of individual principals who are in the process of forming their professional identities as school leaders. As principals form their professional identities, entrepreneurship should be explored as a means to enhance the overall quality of education systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1942775112443438">
<title>Professional Identity</title>
<p>Regardless of the cultural context, the formation of professional identity as a leader has emerged as a common challenge for new principals. It is accompanied frequently by discomfort and uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112443438">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>) that can be ameliorated, at least in part, by access to professional learning networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112443438">Cowie &amp; Crawford, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112443438">2009</xref>). In the East African and Mexican settings, problems with professional identity formation can be exacerbated by the lack of credibility, authority, and trust that is generated by inappropriate appointment procedures (Scott &amp; Rarieya, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112443438">Slater et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The formation of identity is made more difficult by the complexity of the role and expectations for school leaders. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1942775112443438">Slater et al. (2008)</xref> identified the burden of paperwork faced by school directors in Mexico. As well, the challenges associated with maintaining positive working relationships with colleagues, students, and community emerged across cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112443438">Nelson et al. (2008)</xref> reported the daunting challenges associated with establishing constructive relationships, particularly those resulting from student misbehavior and mediating conflict. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112443438">Slater et al. (2007)</xref> contrasted the Texan and Mexican settings, identifying differences in parental expectations and patterns of advocacy that are linked to the social capital of parents. In addition, they found that principals faced challenges in terms of managing conflict among teachers, students, and parents. Resistance from seasoned teachers to principal-initiated changes also was evident.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1942775112443438">
<title>Reconceptualizing Leadership Development</title>
<p>Drawing on the insights of the ISPP, it is clear that a conceptual and operational framework is needed to address the deficits in leadership development in and across cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112443438">Cowie and Crawford (2007)</xref> emphasized that one model of principal preparation is not appropriate in all settings. Indeed, cultural travelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112443438">Slater et al., 2007</xref>) understand that contextual nuances are important. Nonetheless, we can look to the 4L framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott and Webber (2008)</xref> that can inform leadership development across cultural settings while avoiding the imposition of practices borrowed inappropriately from dominant cultures. The 4L framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach in that it acknowledges the need for variability across career stages and aspirations, and recommends a range of formats, including role-embedded learning, mentoring, action research, networking, internships, integration with day-to-day responsibilities, and collaboration as well as formal study. The 4L framework attends to the time needed to nurture leadership skills; that is, the model acknowledges that leaders at all career stages require sufficient time to learn, reflect, collaborate, and grow. The 4L framework also contains a set of core knowledge and skills that are recommended for inclusion in leadership development programs. An example of the flexible application of the 4L framework to leadership development is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1942775112443438">Webber and Scott (2009)</xref> in their description of a leadership development initiative in Ukraine, an educational system that is very different from those found in Western countries.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the 4L framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott &amp; Webber, 2008</xref>) addressed the need for multiple formats for learning, as did the articles by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112443438">Cowie and Crawford (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1942775112443438">Wildy and Clarke (2008)</xref> in relation to networking, collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112443438">Onguko et al., 2012</xref>), technology-mediated professional development (Scott &amp; Rarieya, 2010), and action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1942775112443438">Wildy &amp; Clarke, 2008</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1942775112443438">Webber and Sherman (2008)</xref> posited the importance of leadership development that incorporates the perspectives of “insiders” (p. 71) who understand the particularities of context and “outsiders” (p. 67) or critical friends who can advise, teach, and model alternative approaches to leading and learning.</p>
<p>The 4L framework is one conceptualization of leadership development to emerge from the ISPP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1942775112443438">Wildy and Clarke (2008)</xref> have offered a complementary perspective. Their conceptual framework highlights the importance of understanding place. This point was supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112443438">Cowie and Crawford’s (2009)</xref> research findings in England and Scotland that emphasized the importance of “place identity” (p. 16) that includes knowing the physicality of personal territory, interpersonal relationships, and understanding of self. That is, leaders need to learn how to navigate local culture, that is, social and political acumen, which includes the interplay between “interpersonal” and “political dimensions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1942775112443438">Wildy &amp; Clarke, 2008</xref>, p. 730) that exist within and across the school and the community. Wildy and Clarke also noted the need to understand self, as manifested by the cultivation of personal resilience, self-efficacy, and the capacity to multitask.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1942775112443438">
<title>Revisioning Instructional Leadership</title>
<p>The ISPP findings highlight the importance of having a strong understanding of instructional leadership and administrative capacity, and the interplay between the two. New leaders report tensions between the demands of managerial duties and their desire to be instructional leaders in their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112443438">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112443438">Scott and Webber (2008)</xref> advocated for a reconceptualization of leadership so that tasks traditionally understood as managerial duties are understood in terms of their impact on teaching and learning. If this perspective is taken, then apparently mundane tasks such as timetabling, staffing, and school maintenance—often mistakenly considered to be time wasters—are understood in terms of their potentially powerful impact on teachers’ instructional practices, student achievement, school–community relations, the building of school culture, and professional development for teachers. Moreover, “<italic>today’s leaders</italic> are faced with the need to address issues, pressures and paradoxes in diverse, rapidly changing contexts, where boundaries are increasingly blurred and previous ways-of-knowing are challenged” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112443438">Robertson &amp; Webber, 2002</xref>, pp. 522-523). Therefore, leadership development for “tomorrow’s leaders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112443438">Robertson &amp; Webber, 2002</xref>, p. 524) must enhance the ability to apply theory to practice, identify and solve significant problems, and collaborate across roles to make appropriate group decisions. They must “be able to develop and maintain a positive, compassionate, inclusive working environment that facilitates the learning of all members of the educational community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112443438">Robertson &amp; Webber, 2002</xref>, p. 525). Therefore, sophisticated leadership development focuses concurrently on instructional, entrepreneurial, and inclusive approaches.</p>

<title>Profile of Canadian Educational Entrepreneurialism</title>
<p>There are additional lessons learned from the preceding description of ISPP research and from the chronology, albeit incomplete, of key events in Canadian history that have influenced the evolution of education. First, there are similarities in the learning needs for educational leaders across cultures but important differences in how they are manifested. Therefore, the emphases on various aspects of educational entrepreneurship must vary according to the unique features of each context. For example, the nuances in cultural attitudes toward power and authority, how they are distributed in the system, and how they are enacted vary and so must how educational entrepreneurs conduct their professional practices. Similarly, understandings of time and its use are different and entrepreneurs must respect those conceptions.</p>
<p>The following discussion explores examples of how educational entrepreneurship in Alberta, Canada, is enacted. It builds on the dimensions and attributes of educational entrepreneurship that we have outlined in a previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1942775112443438">Webber &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>) that emerged from our work in the ISPP, by exploring how they are manifested in the Canadian school context (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1942775112443438">Table 3</xref>). It is important to note that, unlike in most countries, education is almost exclusively under provincial and not federal jurisdiction in Canada. However, the examples used in the discussion below can be observed across the country and are not necessarily unique to any particular province. The cumulative outline of educational entrepreneurship is Canadian in its totality but does not preclude similar manifestations in other cultures and contexts. We invite others to consider entrepreneurship within the uniqueness of their contexts in an effort to inform educational leadership across all of our nations.</p>

<title>Innovators</title>
<p>Innovators in Canadian education have achieved a great deal. The very challenges associated with implementing and maintaining education systems across a huge geographic area with a relatively tiny population probably were daunting for early educational entrepreneurs. However, today’s innovators now face the equally challenging obstacles associated with possibilizing within an established system. For example, creators of alternative forms of schooling such as public charter schools and magnet schools for students interested in sports, the fine arts, or other specific disciplines have had to argue successfully for their place within the public education system. When those arguments have not been successful then some innovators have had to shift to the private sector. Examples of successful alternate schools established by innovators include the public charter schools in Alberta (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://education.alberta.ca/parents/choice.aspx">http://education.alberta.ca/parents/choice.aspx</ext-link>). Moreover, to reengage students who are disenfranchised from traditional school environments, innovators have turned to alternative or storefront formats for delivering educational programming, for example, the Calgary Alternative High School (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b863/">http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b863/</ext-link>), Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cssd.ab.ca/bishopcarroll/">http://www.cssd.ab.ca/bishopcarroll/</ext-link>), and the Siksika Storefront School on the Siksika First Nations Reserve (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://siksikaeducation.ca/storefront.html">http://siksikaeducation.ca/storefront.html</ext-link>). These alternative schools allow flexible timetabling and curriculum adaptation for students whose lifestyles are complex.</p>
<p>Educational entrepreneurs are aware of the advantages of continuing ongoing professional learning and seeking opportunities to do so. Examples of sites of professional development include the Regional Consortia found throughout Alberta (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arpdc.ab.ca/">http://arpdc.ab.ca/</ext-link>) and the Centre for Leadership in Learning at the University of Calgary (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://people.ucalgary.ca/~cll/">http://people.ucalgary.ca/~cll/</ext-link>). The Regional Consortia and the Centre for Leadership in Learning are strategic alliances formed by organizations representing teachers, principals, superintendents, school board members from public and private schools, plus department of education personnel, and university students and faculty members. The Centre, especially, provides opportunities for stakeholders to participate in constructive cross-role dialogue about important educational issues. Within school boards, mentoring programs are available to nurture entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Social and political acumen are requisite for entrepreneurship. They must be able to understand and respond to social nuances and navigate organizational politics. This is essential to the success of innovative initiatives. This does not mean that entrepreneurs need to aim to be popular and, in fact, the tenacity required to establish new projects may mean that innovators must weather more conflict than if they had been satisfied with the status quo.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1942775112443438">
<title>Networking</title>
<p>Participation in global initiatives can produce information useful for educational decision makers. For example, Canadians have participated in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement’s (IEA) international assessment initiative called Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).</p>
<p>International alliances are found in schools and districts across Canada. High schools in many Canadian cities offer courses accredited by the International Baccalaureate network. Many Canadian high schools also offer university-level courses accredited by the Advanced Placement program based in the United States. These alliances foster cross-cultural understandings among students and educators and are examples of innovative networks in schools.</p>
<p>Within the global context, entrepreneurs seek ongoing access to information from their own contexts and also from around the world. However, along with access to information is a corresponding need to be discerning consumers of information from different contexts. For example, Canada has had a proliferation of consultants coming from other contexts espousing policies and practices that may have worked in their contexts but are inappropriate for wholesale application in the Canadian context. Similarly, reports and policies such as, “A Nation at Risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112443438">National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983</xref>) and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112443438">“No Child Left Behind Act (2001)”</xref> emerged in the American context but have influenced Canadian educators and policy makers without adequate analysis of the reports’ relevance to their education systems. Another example of cross-cultural policy borrowing was the series of educational reforms adopted by the Alberta Government and modeled on the policies of Sir Roger Douglas from New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112443438">Douglas, 1993</xref>) which, in turn, were parallel to the educational reforms implemented by the Thatcher government in the United Kingdom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1942775112443438">
<title>Time–Space Communication Frameworks</title>
<p>Like many Western nations, Canadian educators have been implementing an increasing number of school-year formats that differ from that developed during the nation’s early agriculturally focused era. The traditional school year ran from September or October through May or June to allow children from farm families to be available during summer months to assist with farming tasks consistent with the Canadian climate. Although this school-year format continues to be common, many school districts are using modified instructional calendars to accommodate the urban lifestyle that now dominates Canadian society. New formats include year-round school calendars in regular communities, temporary schooling in hospitals, and continuous-admission online schools.</p>
<p>In addition to alternate school calendars, students and teachers from across Canada have the option of participating in technology-mediated international partnerships in which synchronous and/or asynchronous collaborative study is undertaken. This allows for cross-cultural understandings to be developed across time and space.</p>
<p>Online schools are commonplace within the Canadian educational scene. The opportunities afforded by newer ICTs have freed learners from some of the restrictions of traditional schooling formats. Unlike schools of the past, online programming facilitates participation by young people in activities that require a transient lifestyle, such as national and international competitive sports and the arts. As well, children of parents who serve overseas in the Canadian military and foreign services have the option of studying online in conjunction with full or partial attendance at local or international schools. In short, online schools allow young Canadians to challenge preexisting notions of how education occurs in particular time and space communication frameworks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1942775112443438">
<title>Local–Global Perspective</title>
<p>It is almost surprising that the Canadian education system works. The nation is characterized by national legislation concurrently mandating, for example, bilingualism, multiculturalism, First Nations rights, and constitutional rights to freedom of religion, conscience, expression, association, and peaceful assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112443438">Department of Justice, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, these laws are applied in a nation that has a small population living throughout the second-largest political jurisdiction in the world in one of the harshest possible climates. Nonetheless, Canadian society is recognized as a well-established civil democracy due, as we have stated elsewhere (Webber &amp; Scott, in press), in large part to the role of a strong education system. The strength of the education system over Canada’s history comes from the entrepreneurship demonstrated consistently by school and district leaders and policy makers.</p>
<p>Educational entrepreneurship is evident at local, national, and international levels. School councils and elected school boards contribute by implementing provincial standardized curricula within local communities. This assists with the creation and sustenance of a common Canadian identity and builds cohesion across a highly diverse society. A standardized curricula enables children and youth to be able to move towns, cities, and provinces and still have their educational level understood aiding a seamless transition. At the provincial level, cross-role stakeholder participation in policy making is a strong feature of the governance processes. Moreover, part of the Canadian identity to emerge from provincial school systems is a broad commitment to national compromise, often called the Great Canadian Compromise, and international peacekeeping, which facilitates the multidimensional problem solving needed to resolve competing political agendas.</p>
<p>Exploring intentional and unintentional consequences of past practices has enabled Canadian educational entrepreneurs to identify areas that need greater attention and support in local communities. For example, the negative legacy of Indian residential schools caused the federal government to return much of the power for governing band schools to First Nations community leaders. Although band-controlled schools have not alleviated all of the sociopolitical problems that exist on reservations, they are a more culturally sensitive step toward creating a better future for First Nations youth. The development of entrepreneurship within First Nations communities is necessary for further progress.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship occurs within regular schools where leaders look actively for opportunities to support students and their families by collaborating with other social and health services. This type of social safety net, a dominant feature of Canadian society, extends to the international arena through the work fostered by organizations such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). CIDA-sponsored initiatives link Canadian educators with their counterparts throughout developing and postconflict societies. Examples of CIDA projects include an inclusive education initiative in Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112443438">Canada Ukraine Research Team, 2008</xref>) and a teacher education project in Kosovo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112443438">CIDA, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, at the global level, student and teacher exchange programs are available throughout Canada. These programs are designed to facilitate more extensive cross-cultural understandings and collaborations. For example, provincial departments of education have a range of formal teacher exchange agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112443438">Government of Alberta, 2010</xref>) while the Rotary Youth Exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112443438">Rotary International, 2010</xref>) promotes international student visits for up to a year with a host family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1942775112443438">
<title>Educational Organizations as Knowledge Centers</title>
<p>Teachers throughout Canada are required by law to complete university-based undergraduate programs in education. The emphasis on teacher education is that it is a scholarly pursuit and ongoing professional learning is also an expectation. Provincial departments of education are responsible for curriculum development and classroom teachers serve on departmental curriculum committees. Entrepreneurial leadership is encouraged by professional associations who also support professional networks for leaders, such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112443438">College of Alberta School Superintendents (2010)</xref> through their provision of networking and professional development. Another example of entrepreneurship is that of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112443438">Association of Independent Schools and Colleges in Alberta (2010)</xref> which provides social, fiscal, and political support for leaders of independent (private) schools.</p>
<p>Another of the entrepreneurial ventures in Alberta has been the creation, by an inclusive set of educational stakeholders, of the Principal Quality Practice Guideline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112443438">Alberta Education, 2009</xref>). This document describes seven dimensions of leadership within which principals must practice and for which they are accountable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1942775112443438">
<title>Face-to-Face and Internet-Based Learning</title>
<p>Online learning is virtually ubiquitous across the Western world. Fortunately for Canadians, their governments and private industries provide widespread infrastructure and services of high quality and with sufficient stability to support online teaching and learning in even the most remote locations. As a result, educational support is available to learners of all ages through the services, for example, of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112443438">Alberta Distance Learning Centre (2010)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112443438">Alberta Home Education Association (2010)</xref>. In addition, online and blended learning now is embedded in regular schools across all Canadian provinces.</p>
<p>Educational leaders who wish to expand the professional knowledge base required for entrepreneurship have ready access to face-to-face and fully online graduate programs offered by most Canadian postsecondary institutions. Examples of the many programs include those offered by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1942775112443438">University of Calgary (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112443438">Athabasca University (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1942775112443438">Thompson Rivers University (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, the opportunities for educational entrepreneurs will likewise continue to expand. Entrepreneurs no longer engage in discussions about whether online learning should occur but, rather, they look for opportunities to harness technologies to create opportunities for learning that will make a significant difference for individuals and their societies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is important that this article be understood as the application of a framework for educational entrepreneurship to a particular time and context. The details of how entrepreneurship is manifested in Canada may apply to other settings, but it would be inappropriate to assume that there is direct application to other contexts. Moreover, our observations from the ISPP research collaboration and our analysis of Canadian manifestations of leadership development and entrepreneurship highlight the danger that shared experiences and common terminologies can mask significant contextual differences. We invite researchers and leaders to investigate within their own systems and cultural contexts the applicability of the dimensions and attributes of entrepreneurship that we have applied to our consideration of the Canadian education system. We also encourage other professional developers to examine the leadership development programs offered within their context with the view to overtly teach and promote the development of entrepreneurial capacities emphasizing instructional, entrepreneurial, and inclusive approaches.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to demystify the dimensions of entrepreneurship by providing examples that illustrate its doability and viability. In this article, we present examples of programs, practices, and approaches that leaders and teachers have instituted that represent entrepreneurship due to their working beyond the boundaries of their system and refuting the status quo. Our examples also are intended to underscore the need for entrepreneurship to be principled and socially responsible with the aim of fostering reflective, engaged learners and leaders.</p>
<p>Educational entrepreneurship is a fragile construct in its conceptualization, manifestation, and sustainability. Thus, we argue that entrepreneurship should feature prominently in leadership development programming offered by institutions and professional organizations. It is reasonable to assume that entrepreneurship is a set of skills and knowledge that novice leaders must develop and hone. Indeed, school and system leaders must pursue opportunities to demonstrate entrepreneurship and to avoid the temptation to be satisfied with the status quo when the status quo no longer serves the best interests of learners and their societies. In addition, accountability frameworks for leaders must encompass overtly dimension of educational entrepreneurship.</p>
