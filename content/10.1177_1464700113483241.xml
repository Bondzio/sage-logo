<abstract>
<p>With a focus on appearance and racialised perceptions of skin colour, this paper discusses the differences between <italic>being</italic> and <italic>feeling</italic> acceptable, pretty or ugly and the possibility of such displacement (from being to feeling or vice versa), as a way to understand what beauty <italic>does</italic> in people’s lives. The paper explores the fragility of beauty in relation to the visibility of the body in specific racialised contexts. It investigates the claim that beauty can be considered a feeling that emphasises processes (what beauty does) rather than contents (what beauty is). Drawing from life stories with Mexican women, I examine their concerns about visibility, temporality and appearance as expressions of racist practices and ideas, within a context where the racial project of <italic>mestizaje</italic> (racial mixture) is in operation. Beauty matters as it makes evident the pervasiveness of racism in the everyday. The lived experience of beauty, in its displacement and fragility, as a feeling and as resource, can also point to some of the strategies to resist, cope and get on.</p>

<body>
<p>Where could we start exploring what beauty or ugliness does in people’s lives? Although the rules of femininity or masculinity could be a good beginning, it is my argument here that ideas about race and nation, and the experiences of racism at work in any given context, also require careful attention. This article responds to feminist claims that have urged us to explore beauty as an empirical and pragmatic question. ‘The question [of beauty] for feminist politics’, wrote Claire Colebrook in her 2006 introduction to a special issue of <italic>Feminist Theory</italic> on beauty, ‘is not so much moral – is beauty good or bad for women? – but pragmatic: how is beauty defined, deployed, defended, subordinated, marketed or manipulated, and how do these tactics intersect with gender and value?’ (p. 132). This article responds to this call for tackling the pragmatics of beauty in the specific case of Mexico, asking not only about gender and value but also about how notions of race, racism and nation circulate and are set in motion.</p>
<p>Thinking of beauty as an empirical and pragmatic question challenges the common moral imperatives that have accompanied most research on beauty: mainly that beauty is either ‘bad’, superfluous and must be resisted, or that it is ‘good’, a choice and a path to normality. Some feminist authors have started to account for how beauty, in any case, matters, is present, and is an everyday concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464700113483241">Brand, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464700113483241">Felski, 2006</xref>). So rather than wanting to establish what beauty <italic>is</italic>, my focus here is on what beauty <italic>does</italic>: how beauty is an ambivalent concept, a ‘gendered, racialized, and contested symbolic resource’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483241">Craig, 2006</xref>: 160). A sizeable literature drawing mainly from feminist studies has examined beauty standards and practices. It has explored how beauty impacts women’s lives and structures gender relations in Anglo-European contexts, focusing on how it plays a role in the currency and exercise of power. Debate has tended to adopt one of two main competing feminist analyses: ‘beauty as a component of a structure of oppression and … beauty as an instrument of female agency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483241">Craig, 2006</xref>: 164). Foundational academic work on beauty such as Iris Marion Young’s (1980) and Sandra Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483241">Bartky’s (1997)</xref> discussed beauty work as a disciplinary practice supervised by an all-encompassing male gaze. Importantly, however, their subject was an unmarked woman, with no racialised identity, no class base, implicitly heterosexual, young and located in industrialised societies. From the 1980s, a body of work critiqued this, demonstrating how ‘beauty standards maintained racial inequality as well as gender inequality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483241">Craig, 2006</xref>: 163). Still unaccounted for, however, were subjective experiences of beauty in relation to women’s desires to feel ‘normal’, as a source of pleasurable practice, or as sites for identity work. In response, research on issues such as plastic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483241">Davis, 1995</xref>), body work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483241">Gimlin, 2002</xref>), and beautification processes as a creative/group activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483241">Cahill, 2003</xref>) presents a more nuanced account. Yet, as Craig rightly states, such research still neglects the social locations of its subjects, and while acknowledging these were white, middle class and heterosexual, such work does not address how such locations matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483241">Craig, 2006</xref>: 165).</p>
<p>In this article I therefore want to continue the work of more recent feminist researchers which has not simply listed ‘gender, “race” and class’, but rather has attempted to flesh out their research participants’ experience as a way of responding and tuning in to what specific data are calling for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483241">Candelario, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483241">Casanova, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483241">Craig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464700113483241">Felski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483241">Hobson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464700113483241">Tate, 2009</xref>). Moreover, I want to locate this analysis within a framework that allows me to work through the particular context of Mexico. Such a framework refers to what I have been calling <italic>mestizaje logics</italic> (or more broadly, racist logics) as complex strategies of racial differentiation that permeate social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464700113483241">Moreno Figueroa, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464700113483241">2011</xref>). <italic>Mestizaje</italic> refers here to the official state discourse on racial and cultural mixture as the defining feature of the nation and of Mexicanness. It is also an everyday social configuration with roots in a broader historical process emanating from the conquest and colonial experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483241">Gruzinski, 2002</xref>). The racist logics that sustain such a configuration have made it possible for racism to be lived as a constant, normalised feature of social life. Racism, as a structuring principle that creates racist logics, is not recognised institutionally or publicly, but rather is lived as an individual embodied experience. Rarely related to the now questionable understandings of ‘race’ and wider structural dynamics, racism is more often perceived as personal fault, and as ‘just how things are’. A key feature then of the workings of racism in Mexico is the breakage of the relationship between racist practices and ideas about ‘race’. The experience of racism has lost its explicit links with the processes of its formation. This lack of public discourse about ‘race’ and racism is a result of the historical move towards nation-building, modernisation processes and responses to strong racial projects emanating from Europe and the United States. In such a context, racism has gone unrecognised. Racist practices have been discursively separated from the particular understandings of ‘race’ from which they have emanated, acquiring dynamics of their own: that is, <italic>mestizaje</italic> logics.</p>
<p>This scenario is complicated by a prevalent racial discourse of <italic>mestizaje</italic> rooted in notions of national identity, belonging and citizenship. One of the features of an everyday experience framed by the racial logics of <italic>mestizaje</italic> is that, due to its fluidity, there are no fixed racial positions and people are not engaged in processes of identity politics as found in other parts of the world. This is what is striking about <italic>mestizaje</italic>: people are not white or black, but rather, they are whiter than or darker than others. The category of <italic>mestizo</italic> (a mixed race individual), which epitomises the subject of national identity, the Mexican, is relative. As historian Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483241">Knight (1990)</xref> points out, <italic>mestizo</italic> represents an achieved and ascribed status underpinned by whitening practices and promises of whiteness as privilege. It is within this framework that the racialisation of understandings of beauty is brought to the fore. I now want to establish some key background details of the research from which this analysis draws.</p>
<p>This article is based on a wider research project interested in studying the <italic>mestizo</italic> population in Mexico. Specifically, the project explores how this group, which sets itself as the privileged point of reference to Indigenous peoples, Afro-Mexicans, and other migrant groups, lives and reproduces racism. So, differently to most research on racism in Latin America, my work concentrates on a section of the population, the majority, which does not consider itself as racial or ethnic, but rather as national. <italic>Mestizas/os</italic> or Mexicans have remained racially unnamed and unmarked, and when they are, it is in very precarious ways, precisely due to the logics of <italic>mestizaje</italic> that frame everyday life. The overall aim of this project has been to give an account of the <italic>qualities</italic> of the experience of racism (how it feels and what it does) in order to make racism public as a social and political problem that crosses all social groups and relations – rather than something that just happens to some. A key question is, then, how is racism in Mexico an everyday practice that goes from the most intimate to the most institutional spaces and exempts nobody?</p>
<p>Through focus group discussions and life story interviews based on family photographs, I explored the complexities of the visible, racialised and gendered body in relation to notions of <italic>mestizaje</italic>, racism and national identity. The main sample included 40 Mexican women who fit a broad criterion: born in Mexico, living in urban environments, with a <italic>mestiza</italic>/Mexican family history (self-identified as such) and a personal photographic collection. The participants were between the ages of 18 and 55, and living in three cities – Huajuapan de León, León and Mexico City. In terms of their occupations and class experience, they were engaged as academics, civil servants, designers, housewives, journalists, lawyers, photographers, political activists and rural teachers. These women’s accounts pointed towards the ambivalences and difficulties of racial identification in relation to the visibility of their bodies. Personal photographs were employed to access the ambivalence of making use of the visible to understand the affective and visceral experience of racism, while acknowledging the need to denounce that same visibility as core to the production of racism itself. The aim was to explore racism from the particular perspective of the visible – that is, the ways the participants see and are seen; the elements that interact to inform their gaze; the meanings and values of their own image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483241">Moreno Figueroa, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a concern with beauty emerged as a strong theme within my data, working primarily to express the sense that beauty is difficult – that is, beauty is fragile, unsettled, ambivalent. In order to advance an analysis of beauty as an empirical and pragmatic question, as well as a contextualised resource that is experienced as difficult, this discussion is structured according to three key issues: (a) the differences between <italic>being</italic> and <italic>feeling</italic> acceptable, beautiful, pretty or ugly and the possibility of such displacement (from being to feeling) as a way to approach an understanding of what beauty does in people’s lives; (b) the fragility of beauty in terms of its empirical experience in a racialised context where mestizaje logics are in operation; and (c) the possibilities of extending the claim that beauty can be considered a feeling, a bodily inclination, which emphasises the processes of beauty (what beauty does) rather than the contents of beauty (what beauty is).</p>
<sec id="sec1-1464700113483241"><title>From prettiness to ugliness</title>
<p>At the time of the interview, Consuelo was proud that she had a stronger sense of herself than she did when she was younger. She had recently lived abroad for a year and had experienced a big change in how she perceived her appearance. On her return to Mexico she felt more able and relaxed to face her family, friends and acquaintances after growing up in an intimidating environment. She shared with me that she was upset about not having a partner and that she decided to go to psychotherapy to work out her feelings about this. However, in the account of her interaction with the therapist she was confronted with the strength of racialised beauty parameters:<disp-quote>
<p>Look, when I came back from Europe I wanted to work through the partner stuff … everyone was telling me how <italic>guapa</italic> [attractive], how <italic>bonita</italic> [pretty] I looked, so then that point sorted out, but ‘why don’t I have a partner?’ So I went to a gestalt psychotherapist and it was horrible … I told him the whole story of how I used to feel <italic>super fea</italic> [really ugly] and that I was worried about not having a partner. To make the long story short, he started giving me advice! … I came back with short hair, with a European style, I felt really good, everybody was telling me that my haircut was <italic>muy bonito</italic> [really nice] … I arrived without earrings; I also was wearing very little makeup. So he thought I was not very feminine and me: ‘I am pretty, I just want to know why I don’t have a partner’, and he was ‘no, you are not pretty’ and he said, ‘look, why don’t you let your hair grow and wear earrings?’ It was horrible because on top of that he said: ‘don’t worry, I have a patient who is <italic>rubia</italic> [blonde] and she doesn’t have a boyfriend either’. And I had just returned from Europe, and had got rid of those stereotypes. When I was there I used to say: ‘Those Mexican men are too much, they think blondes are the best, they should come here so that they will realise it’s not true’ … And he tells me: ‘Look I have a patient who is blonde and she feels completely alone, she is <italic>muy guapa</italic> [very attractive] and has blue eyes’. I mean, he described her to me and said she had self-esteem problems! … I went out crying and felt really bad: ‘of course, you don’t wear earrings, you have short hair, you don’t wear a skirt, how do you expect that men will look at you?’ … In the end it was like: ‘it is clear that <italic>soy una fea</italic> [I’m an ugly woman] and I’m <italic>morena</italic> [brown/dark] and everything, I have to make myself up’ … I haven’t got over the being-ugly situation, because he said ‘there are blondes with self-esteem problems’, so I’ve got even more reason … (Consuelo, 29, León)</p></disp-quote>So, where to start? We could make a literal analysis of the specific ‘talk’ Consuelo is using. Her utterances are significant particularly in her use of terms such as feeling and being: what are the implications of feeling ugly or being ugly? How are these two different states related? How distant are they from each other? How similar? To what context and wider discourses is being something or feeling something (as visceral, visible and embodied as beauty or ugliness) attached? We could extend these questions to explore Consuelo’s understanding of her own process of <italic>displacement</italic> from ugliness to beauty. She is first talking about ‘feeling ugly’ and then moves on to ‘being pretty’ to end up ‘being ugly’ again. Here, the fragility of such displacement, and the conditions in which it is occurring, emerge strikingly. Not only are these shifts narrated within one specific moment, one experience (packaged for the interview), but also they correspond to a particular context framed by wider racialised and gendered discourses about adequate, appropriate or expected physical appearances.</p>
<p>We could also analyse the gendered frames of everyday existence where the rules of femininity are clearly exposed (the skirt, the hair’s length, the earrings). As well as the psychotherapist’s questionable procedure, we can see through Consuelo’s account of his narrative how the rules of a particular type of femininity (stereotypical, mainstream, white and predictable) get reaffirmed. Moreover, this extract is an example of how national identity stereotypes are reproduced, as well as how intersections of value, gender and racialised understandings of beauty are in operation in geographic terms. While heterosexual rules are presumed (for the therapist, all men like his version of women and Consuelo wants to be pretty for men), national identifications are also reinforced. In this extract, Consuelo is giving us a version of what she believes are the standards of beauty in Europe, where she felt accepted because of her particular physical characteristics. In her experience, she is seen approvingly and she is desired. She then presents a version of the standards of beauty in Mexico, where she feels unappreciated because of those same physical characteristics. From her perspective, in Mexico men think that ‘blondes are best’, and emphasise hair and skin colour as key defining terms of beauty.</p>
<p>Earlier in the interview, Consuelo recalled with sadness those moments when she felt ugly (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483241">Moreno Figueroa, 2012</xref>). Looking at one of her photographs, she shared what her uncles used to say to her while she was growing up: ‘They used to call me “<italic>prieta</italic> [dark], <italic>cabezona</italic> [big head], and <italic>dientuda</italic> [goofy]”, and I used to say: “Why do I have such big teeth? Why am I so <italic>morena</italic>?”’ (Consuelo, 29, León). We find here more indications not only of racialised parameters of beauty, but also of her apparently naïve questions (can anybody really ask ‘why’ our bodies have specific physical features?); she makes evident how traits can <italic>happen to</italic> the body. For example, specific sizes, colours, heights and features sometimes work in favour of beauty and against ugliness and sometimes vice versa. Her questions about this <italic>happening to</italic> also suggest that such traits could have been manipulated, planned or worked out previously; they could have been negotiated. The possibility of negotiation appears throughout my research as central to the development of Mexican people’s sense of belonging and can be observed in how racial mixing has been seen as a form of improving (or not) the racialised body. This makes evident how the experience of the racialised body is not settled and is therefore fragile. This sense of a negotiation relates both to the performance of femininity and to the specificity of contemporary Mexican racial discourses; in other words, how <italic>mestizaje</italic> logics operate in the everyday experience of beauty.</p>
<p>If we think of ugly as a term related to that which causes horror or fright, to that which is offensive or repulsive, or at least displeasing in appearance, it is a strong word. However, if the racialised experience of the body is not settled, the terms prettiness or ugliness are not settled either. Rather than being able to delimit what these terms are, what their content is, it seems ugliness and prettiness are more useful if comparable to a feeling. In a similar way to feeling angry, sad, anxious or relaxed, Consuelo used to feel ugly and she does not feel like that anymore, unless or until somebody confronts her belief. This exposes the fragility of the self-perception of feeling or being ugly, and raises questions about whether ugliness (or prettiness) is something you can <italic>get over</italic>, as Consuelo thinks she did. However, this self-perception can fall apart at any time. Perceived in this way – as feelings – prettiness and ugliness appear not to be qualities of the body that are either achieved by the individual or ascribed by the social. Instead, when in motion, prettiness and ugliness are <italic>produced</italic> by the relationality of the individual and the social in particular gendered and racialised moments of interaction. This is how it is possible to think of beauty as a feeling, moreover, as an aesthetic feeling: it is a feeling in its unsettledness; it is aesthetic in relation to the racialisation it allows; it is temporal and relational. However, what is not unsettled is that physical appearance is always an issue; beauty is an unavoidable <italic>lure</italic> constantly present in people’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483241">Coleman and Moreno Figueroa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464700113483241">Felski, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464700113483241"><title>Being/feeling acceptable: Whiteness, class and privilege</title>
<p>I am also interested in exploring the idea of being/feeling acceptable. Paulina, another participant, illustrates this well.<disp-quote>
<p>In my life beauty has been a very important issue, because I always say, jokingly, that I’m the daughter and the mother of <italic>las bonitas</italic> [pretty women]. My mother had <italic>una belleza</italic> [the kind of beauty] that could stop a train, and it’s not that my sister and I are <italic>feas</italic> [ugly], we are just <italic>pasaderitas</italic> [acceptable – passing with ease] … My mother was of <italic>una belleza impresionante</italic>, <italic>guapísima</italic> [a striking beauty, so attractive] but for example when I was a kid, the neighbours would say things like: ‘Oh these girls, with such an attractive mother’, so my sister and I grew up with that, but when my daughter was born, you know what people would say to me? … ‘Oh, she’s so <italic>hermosa</italic> [beautiful]!’ Then they would turn, look at me, and say: ‘she must be exactly like her father!’ And I used to wonder: ‘Why don’t they say: “what a beautiful girl” and that’s all?’ Do you know what I mean? It was terrible. I grew up with those issues. I don’t think I’m ugly, but I always carry with me the ambivalence of what feminine beauty is and that undoubtedly is something … (Paulina, 49, Mexico City)</p></disp-quote>In this extract, the notion of acceptability comes into play in the discussion about the parameters of beauty. This category opens the possibility of locating prettiness and ugliness on a continuum where being acceptable can be placed somewhere, perhaps in the safe (yet still uncomfortable) middle. These notions of prettiness, ugliness and acceptability are all bound to each other and can only be understood in relation and comparison to one another.</p>
<p>Being acceptable could easily be understood in terms of being typical, ordinary, plain, unremarkable, average or normal. Paulina’s sense of acceptability comes from comparing herself to her mother and her daughter and locating them as the points of reference from which to define who is and who is not beautiful. However, it is worth noting that Paulina defines herself as a white <italic>mestiza</italic>, very proud of having been born in Mexico but also coming from a migrant family with Jewish, Chilean and Spanish heritage. Many times during the interview she complained about how many people would not identify her as Mexican, challenging her belonging to the nation. It is interesting then that she considers herself as acceptable, as average. She is one of the few of my interviewees who can afford to call herself someone who can pass with ease, a sense of confidence that might come from her middle-class background and her unmarked body. So in an unexpected way, considering herself as acceptable and as able to pass with ease suggests a sense of reassurance and self-confidence that was not present in other women who were more clearly located at the darker side of the <italic>mestizaje</italic> spectrum. This resonates clearly with studies on whiteness, privilege and normality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464700113483241">Nayak, 2007</xref>), work on class that argues that the middle class is the invisible norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464700113483241">Skeggs, 2004</xref>) and discussions on ‘race’ and passing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483241">Ginsberg, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>I also want to highlight the bluntness with which issues of appearance are verbalised in Mexico and how language reinforces stereotypes of beauty. It is noticeable throughout my interview data that <italic>los demás</italic>, these ‘others’ (neighbours/people), appear to have the power and freedom to express their opinions. Similarly to Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483241">Foucault’s (1977)</xref> panopticon and notions of (self) surveillance, the others simultaneously represent anybody and everybody and, in their anonymity, they seem to express society’s verdict on what is and what is not beautiful, acceptable and adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464700113483241">Casanova, 2004</xref>). These others play a significant role in shaping the participants’ perceptions of beauty. Accompanying Paulina throughout her life, these voices have been not only a ‘terrible thing’ to grow up with, but also a key component in her feelings of ambivalence towards the meaning of feminine beauty. The practice of commenting aloud on the appearance of others is not exclusive to those privileged individuals who speak from the authority of being physically acceptable. On the contrary, this practice is something everybody feels entitled to do – in Mexico and elsewhere – and thus one that constantly erases the boundaries between fault-finders and fault-carriers. This erasure of boundaries reinforces the idea that discrimination is a practice that circulates among people. A racist act is not done <italic>to</italic> one person <italic>by</italic> one person; it is not a matter of action and reaction or of perpetrators and victims. Practices of racism could rather be considered as <italic>dynamic relations</italic> within which are embedded historically produced racial discourses, that is, <italic>mestizaje</italic> logics. Acknowledging the shifting, pervasive and ambivalent character of the practices of racism means engaging with the contradictory implications of their everydayness and the difficulty of locating them with precision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1464700113483241"><title>Photographs of beautiful <italic>morenas</italic></title>
<p>This array of beauty terms and the experience of them alongside that of racism have a strong correlation with the realm of the visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483241">Moreno Figueroa, 2008</xref>). My research used photographs as a methodological tool to explore not only people’s memories but, moreover, participants’ take on their own image – the one(s) seen by themselves and the one(s) seen by others. The visibility and the interaction of gazes, within an understanding that seeing is a racialised, gendered and classed cultural practice, also brings us close to the tension between being and feeling beautiful, acceptable, pretty or ugly. Patricia’s case below is similar to Paulina’s story in its concern with beauty, but also links with the issue Consuelo’s narrative raised about dark skin. It provides an example of the difficulty of correlating personal experience with the ‘evidence’ of photographic images and external stories which, in this case, Patricia hears from others about herself.<disp-quote>
<p>These photographs … why did I select them? Because they made comments about them. I feel they were counterproductive … For example in this one I’m newly born, I remember that my mother told me they named me Patricia, like her, because I looked like her. My father first saw me at the hospital and told her: ‘Oh! She is a <italic>morena muy linda</italic> [very pretty dark-skinned girl], just like you’. My father regarded my mother very highly and I was like her, so that’s why I’m called Patricia. So, in this photograph, I was ‘so <italic>bonita</italic> [pretty]’ [in ironic tone], I’m saying this the way my grandmother used to, because this is my problem [laughs] … My problem is that I never felt pretty. I mean, I always felt different, less, inferior, never pretty at all. So then I see the photograph and I say: ‘Hey! That girl is pretty’. Don’t I? I didn’t feel pretty, but they were always making so much fuss about it … They tell me these stories but I don’t quite believe them … So then I wonder, why is it so difficult for me to accept myself or acknowledge it even a little bit … ? (Patricia, 37, Huajuapan)</p></disp-quote>In this extract, there is a continuous interaction between internal and external gazes, which tell different stories of the same self and question the idea of a unified individual. Internal and external gazes could work as resources to enrich self-understanding, but since a simplifying perception of the individual will tend to eliminate fragmentation, layers and, ultimately, complexity, the gazes seem to confuse rather than enhance Patricia’s self-appreciation. Patricia expresses her difficulty of bringing together three possible versions of herself: the one she <italic>knows</italic> by what others tell her about herself (knowledge); a second one that relates to how she <italic>feels</italic> about herself (feeling); and a third one that tells her about the image she <italic>sees</italic> (visibility), which, although supported by what others have said of her, is in contradiction to what she sees. These versions (knowledge – feeling – visibility) act as different ways of looking at herself, as different gazes that constitute larger units and unique experiences. In such a presentation, the gazes fragment her individual perception. While Patricia is telling us her story from her present perspective, we can also see that she is able to distinguish her life experience as constituted by plural selves, with perceiving gazes, which coexist simultaneously without linear time considerations.</p>
<p>This extract also prompts us to consider the <italic>relational</italic> perception of beauty. Patricia, like Consuelo and Paulina, seems confused about who has the authoritative voice that is able to give the definitive verdict of who is and who is not beautiful. At stake is not only who conveys ‘the truth’, but what ‘the truth’ could be; for example, in the reaction of her father, what for him is considered beautiful, for her is not. Although this difference in opinion emphasises how definitions of beauty vary and depend on who is defining and at what point in time, for Patricia, the salient issue is her inability to believe what others continually tell her. In addition, as she stated later on in the interview, it is difficult to believe those others when their attitudes and actions tell different stories. Moreover, it seems even suspicious if attitudes and actions are consistent. For example, Patricia recalls another voice, that of a photographer, who asked permission to display a photograph of her as a child to advertise his studio because he liked it so much. She also talked about being asked for her portrait to be used to represent her school as a good image of Mexico. She is left wondering: ‘this situation was a bit confusing because I didn’t understand … ’.</p>
<p>These various events are received with a complete sense of disbelief (‘why is it so difficult for me to accept myself?’) and confusion (‘I didn’t understand’), leaving the truth indefinite: is it possible to be pretty? Why can’t Patricia understand? As in Consuelo’s case, Patricia is also asking herself ‘why?’ Consuelo framed her question in the past, as something she used to wonder in a period of her life that she feels she has now overcome (however fragile that overcoming is). For Patricia, it is a question that haunts her. However, the mere possibility of being able to ask ‘why?’ reveals the interactions that have generated her problem: not feeling beautiful despite the fact that everybody says she is. So this inability to feel beautiful does not question the premise of appearance (beauty is a lure) and is also perceived as a personal issue, as if a self-esteem-raising exercise would suffice. The structural relations of power in which racialised perceptions of the body emerge remain untouched. It is my argument, then, that Patricia’s experience raises political questions about the racist logics that are circulating and structuring everyday-life interactions. The family, the hospital, the school, the photographer’s studio window leave unchallenged the relevance of appearance while reproducing its racialised rationale.</p>
<p>Patricia’s extract is also informed by discourses that, in this case, make skin into a fetish – something that is external to her self, or multiple selves – and which acquires a life and a quality of its own. Her skin (and name) marks her, and the story she has been told of her birth might be the key to this marking procedure. The first words she remembers being used to describe her relate to her physical appearance: <italic>linda</italic> and <italic>morena</italic> (pretty and dark-skinned). These words seem to trouble her, since in her life experience they have not been ‘truthfully’ or even coherently related; rather, they collide and constantly seem to be in contradiction. She then remembers her grandmother’s tone of voice when she repeated that Patricia was ‘so pretty’. I recall that moment in the interview: Patricia imitated the ironic voice of her grandmother and summarised with that act many repeated moments in her life where she was confronted with the ambivalence of words, images and perceptions.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1464700113483241"><title>‘Since I became pretty’: Keeping oneself in the realm of beauty</title>
<p>So beauty is difficult. It is a resource and a feeling, an unavoidable lure that does different kinds of work: it stabilises and enables hierarchies to fall into place but also reminds us of the intermittent temporalities where beauty resides.<disp-quote>
<p>Since I became <italic>bonita</italic> [pretty] I always carry my makeup with me, every day. It’s like I have to carry something to be how I’m not. I’m not really pretty, so I have to make myself up, make an effort. Before I was completely the opposite: I was ugly and I didn’t take care of myself. But now it’s like I’m the ugly girl who makes herself up. I have to keep on making myself up until I get to a point where I don’t care if I do or not, and just think of myself as pretty because I am, and not as the ugly girl who looks better because she makes herself up and makes an effort … (Consuelo, 29, León)</p></disp-quote>‘Since I became pretty’ says Consuelo. Is it then possible to achieve beauty? Consuelo expresses various moments or modes of presentation of beauty. Each of them operates, just like the body, as a powerful symbolic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464700113483241">Bordo, 1997</xref>: 90), as a metaphor of the processes people engage with when building and strengthening their identities. Consuelo talks about <italic>being</italic> pretty, <italic>making</italic> herself pretty, and <italic>thinking</italic> of herself as pretty. All three moments are bound to a point in time; words such as ‘since’, ‘before’, ‘now’, ‘until’, gesture to the temporal and dynamic processes where beautification as a practice, and beauty as a state of being, overlap. They also allude to different self-perceptions, which in this extract talk to each other in a rather confrontational way.</p>
<p>First, Consuelo affirms she is pretty, but she admits to always carrying her cosmetics ‘to be how I’m not’. So, is she or is she not pretty? Consuelo answers herself: ‘I’m not pretty’; she <italic>makes</italic> herself pretty. As if closing a circle, she then starts again: ‘Before … I was ugly and I didn’t take care of myself’. Like Patricia, Consuelo is dealing with ‘one self’ talking about the ‘other self’ in charge of the action, of the doing, of taking or not taking care, of carrying the makeup. So we can ask again, has she achieved beauty? Not yet, but she will make herself up till she <italic>thinks</italic> of herself as beautiful, until she <italic>believes</italic> she is beautiful. That is her goal and a safe place where beauty, as a precious resource, would not slip away: she will <italic>know</italic> she is beautiful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483241">Bartky (1997)</xref> suggests that women’s concern with making-up their faces presents their bodies as deficient and engages them in a struggle for perfection. The disciplinary project of femininity is a ‘set-up’:<disp-quote>
<p>[I]t requires such radical and extensive measures of bodily transformation that virtually every woman who gives herself to it is destined in some degree to fail. Thus, a measure of shame is added to a woman’s sense that the body she inhabits is deficient. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483241">Bartky, 1997</xref>: 139)</p></disp-quote>If we explore this line of thought with a racialised lens that gives women different starting points, what Consuelo seems to be saying is that sometimes the struggle for beauty is not only a ‘set-up’. Racialised processes and histories play a role and complicate a (limited) gendered narrative that fails to take racial logics into account and that situates women as unable to stop ‘giving themselves’ to radical processes of bodily transformation. Consuelo is talking about the extent to which women have agency in negotiating the lure of beauty and she is also making evident that, in everyday life, people cannot just walk away from racist and gendered constraints. Rather than pointing towards wearing makeup as a way to succeed in controlling her body, what Consuelo offers is an insight into the process of dealing with, being practical about, making an effort and ‘getting on’ with a specific body, and the constant struggle with deficiency and shame. The reasons that one might give for the need to make an effort could be easily dismissed as evidence that one is simply falling prey to a pervasive beauty industry. However, when this analysis is also located within racial histories, the need for exploring the complexity of beauty and its lure becomes apparent and a re-reading of women’s agency is enabled.</p>
<p>Consuelo then continues with a further key element in the self-perception of beauty: the possibility of seeing oneself as beautiful. As with Patricia’s case, this process is mediated by the opinions and comments of others, and more specifically through their gaze:<disp-quote>
<p>I started seeing myself as <italic>bonita</italic> [pretty] because of other people’s comments. It’s what I’m working on at the moment in my therapy. Before I didn’t see myself as pretty, I didn’t believe I was pretty or anything. I was ugly and that’s it. The next stage, and that’s where I’m at now, is that I feel pretty because of what others see. I’m at that stage: I need people to keep telling me … I only feel pretty because I’m listening to them and that gives me strength to keep taking care of myself and to confirm it. So then the following stage would be that I truly believe it, that I say it to myself … When I’m depressed I go to the other extreme: ‘I’m ugly again’. (Consuelo, 29, León)</p></disp-quote>Consuelo shares with us her worst fear: being ‘ugly again’. It is as if beauty is something that can be given but that can also be easily taken away. This is because beauty seems to be working more as a feeling she needs to ‘truly believe’, rather than as a material or fixed characteristic of the body, as in being pretty. If she were pretty, she should not be concerned about being ‘ugly again’. She has even delineated the stages involved in the process she has to go through in order to achieve, or to be in total possession of, her beauty. At the moment, she recognises that she depends on other people’s opinions and comments; she needs their reassurance and their approving gaze. The final step is to ‘truly believe’ that she is beautiful. But she also acknowledges that the ownership of her beauty is very fragile, and I suggest that this fragility relates to the overlapping of the various definitions of beauty: is it something you see in yourself, is it something you are, is it something you think about yourself, is it material, is it in your imagination, is it in your gaze, is it in the gaze of others? How can we locate beauty in its dynamic displacement? I suggest that what exists is a realm of beauty where all these positions, gazes and debates take place simultaneously. These women will negotiate their feminine identification in relation to such a realm: inside, outside, on the boundary between them.</p>
<p>Consuelo has developed certain strategies to maintain herself in the realm of beauty. Later on in the interview she says that she looked at her old photographs because she thinks that ‘The images reinforce in me that I’ve changed, and I remember how I used to look … ’. This is when she was able to see how she ‘started losing weight, I started dressing differently and I was less scared of showing myself’. Susan Bordo suggests that through the ‘regulation of the time, space, and movements of our daily lives, our bodies are trained, shaped, and impressed with the stamp of prevailing historical forms of selfhood, desire, masculinity, femininity’ (1997: 91). In these ways women’s bodies become docile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483241">Foucault, 1977</xref>), constantly managing different parameters of beauty, regulations of acceptability and notions of improvement. For Bordo, ‘[t]hrough these disciplines, we continue to memorize on our bodies the feel and conviction of lack, of insufficiency, of never being good enough’ (1997: 91). However, if we extend this analysis to a context where racist logics inflict another layer of complexity, we can start thinking about these dealings as a form of ‘getting on’, of hoping, of feeling. The struggle for beauty is not just one for normality or for agency. It is also an arena where penalties and pleasures are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483241">Craig, 2006</xref>). Being ‘less scared’, as Consuelo feels, is not irrelevant; it is also a way of resisting racism even if it is not an uncompromised process, even if she needs to keep making herself up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1464700113483241"><title>Conclusion: Beauty and racism</title>
<p>The difference between <italic>feeling</italic> beautiful as a qualitative characteristic of the body versus <italic>being</italic> beautiful as a supposed material, fixed, ahistorical and unprejudiced characteristic of the body might be one of the key aspects of the ‘beauty problem’. The difference between feeling and being beautiful results from the collision between cultural understandings, everyday life experience about beauty, acceptable physical appearance and skin colour. The collision presents this dilemma as impossible to resolve (how can you be dark-skinned and beautiful?), yet, simultaneously, tells us that while the conflict exists, the possibility of questioning this dilemma surely brings something to it – a hope for its resolution or at least peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>Beauty matters as it makes evident how, in its displacement and fragility, as a feeling and resource, women could make evident to themselves and others both the pervasiveness of racism in their everyday lives, and also some of the strategies to resist, cope and get on. Through an analysis of women’s beauty talk, I have pointed out how feelings and desires interact with racial discourses and the construction of the feminine. Looking and women’s perceptions of the visible world become key elements in understanding processes of discrimination and practices of racism. Beauty is a notion in tension with the visible and becomes a primordial practice that reveals the rules by which specific visible worlds operate: for example, the terms and conditions of beauty in the Mexican context. John Berger writes, ‘The eye of the other combines with our own eye to make it fully credible that we are part of the visible world’ (1972: 9). However, I want to suggest that this realisation of the other and of our belonging to the visible world is not easy or emotion-free. There are gains and pains; beauty is difficult. Such a realisation not only extends to the acknowledgement that if my gaze is informed, so is that of the other. It also points towards the unequal ways in which such gazes are informed, ‘the politics of the exchange of gazes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464700113483241">Phelan, 1996</xref>: 4), and towards the emotionally loaded process attached to confirming we are part of the visible world. Paulina, Patricia and Consuelo are sharing a claim to the process of personalisation of the project of beauty, which detaches it from any social and political responsibility. If beauty is a notion that struggles with the visible in the construction of the feminine and the racialised body, it is a political notion too.</p>
<p>Feelings of lack and shame, anger and disbelief, and the willingness to improve one’s appearance, are reproduced within a social context where the ‘omnipresent dimension’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483241">Knight, 1990</xref>: 99) of racism and its logics operates. There is a tense relation between beauty, the darker-skinned <italic>mestiza</italic> body and the performance of femininity. This analysis has pointed to the accumulation of meaning that informs a notion such as beauty in its empirical experience. When these women see themselves in a mirror, in their photographs, in the stories that others tell about them, they cannot avoid the racial configuration of the visual world, where beauty, skin colour, bodily features and the performance of femininity collide. To contemplate a racial configuration of the visible is to problematise the idea of looking as an unmediated act, and to confirm the constructed character of the informed gaze. In such a configuration, in such a collision of regimes of difference, several elements come together – the informed gaze, notions of beauty, feelings of shame and anger – creating the various racist moments these women talk about. The omnipresent dimension of racism is then fully revealed when that configuration/collision occurs.</p>
