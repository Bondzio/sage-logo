<abstract>
<p>Globalization is causing companies to rethink their business strategy. In support, global talent management strategies are changing as well. Companies are focused on emerging markets to provide a growing percentage of their revenues. They are learning that they need to hire local talent that understands all the nuances of local business instead of using traditional long-term expatriates. This article looks at the history of talent management globally, the global “war for talent” in the “new normal” and a number of talent alternatives for companies to choose from based on each operation’s specific need.</p>

<p>The era of the traditional long-term, 3- to 5-year expatriate assignment is almost over. It is time for a different approach to global talent management.</p>
<p>Why make this statement? Because the world of business has changed. Globalization is obviously here to stay, and companies must change both their business and their talent management strategies to ensure their survival. In many cases, long-term expatriate assignments will not be the best use of talent.</p>
<p>Top management has few challenges that are more crucial than how to manage talent on a global basis. They need to plan where talent will be needed geographically and the best way to staff their locations. Different business needs by location will require different types of talent. In today’s world, there are many different talent management alternatives.</p>
<p>A look at the business world in the past and contrasting it with how it is today will be helpful. It will help clarify why talent requirements need to change to align with the new business needs.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712440488">
<title>Business Model in the Past</title>
<p>Fifteen to 20 years ago, most businesses did not operate on a global basis. Companies received the vast majority of their revenues from markets/customers in the United States or from the developed countries in Western Europe. There was no need to set up operations throughout the world to tap markets that did not exist.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, the only reason operations were set up overseas was to take advantage of the low labor cost for manufacturing. Foreign countries had plenty of low-skilled talent for manufacturing jobs. In addition, the pay for this talent was much lower than that for the same talent in the same jobs back in the United States. It was not a difficult decision for management to make.</p>
<p>The traditional method of managing these international manufacturing operations was to use long-term expatriates. U.S. companies sent Americans, most of whom stayed at the overseas post for a 3- to 5-year period. The primary reason for this was that there was no local talent with enough knowledge or training to run these operations. In addition, since U.S. companies were new to the global scene, top management felt more comfortable having “one of their own” managing these plants.</p>
<p>There was no need to hire professional/talented people outside the United States for any other type of operation, such as sales, customer service or design centers. This was because there were no real markets/customers in these countries. Foreign markets/customers were very small and had very little purchasing power. Almost all the purchasing power and markets still resided in developed countries such as the United States and those in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only type of talent needed overseas was in manufacturing. Americans on long-term expatriate assignments managed these operations. As these operations matured, the goal of expatriate managers was to train their replacements, who would be local nationals. In fact, this did not happen very often. More often than not, there would be a procession of expatriates in and out of the same operation.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0886368712440488">
<p>One local national administrative assistant to the expatriate manager was asked how many managers she had had since joining the company. This company had existed in the country for 20 years and was by all accounts considered to be a mature operation. She laughed and said, “In my 15 years with the company, I have had six managers—all from the United States.” This is a prime example of an operation that had matured but continued to have expatriate rotations.</p>

<title>Business Model Today/Future</title>
<p>During the past 10 to 15 years, the economic growth in emerging markets has lifted millions of people out of poverty and into a new, global middle class. This development has been driven by both rural migration and urban population growth. As income and opportunities have increased, the standard of living, lifestyle and consumption patterns have shifted from basic necessities toward increased expenditure on discretionary products and services.</p>
<p>The new middle class in emerging markets is growing not incrementally but exponentially. It is the fastest growing segment of the world’s population, and for the first time in history, the middle class now accounts for more than half the world’s population.</p>
<p>By 2020, this new development will intensify as another 700 million people enter the new middle class. According to a 2009 report by the World Bank, the number of middle-class households was estimated to be 31.7% in China, 14.6% in India and 35.7% in Indonesia. By 2020, these percentages are expected to reach 46.2% in China, 41.1% in India and 58.3% in Indonesia. By 2015, for the first time, the number of consumers in Asia’s middle class will equal those in Europe and North America combined.</p>
<p>“There is a shift in economic power that’s going on and will continue. China just became the world’s second-largest economy,” says David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor’s, who notes that half of the revenue for companies in the S&amp;P 500 in the past couple of years has come from outside the United States.</p>
<p>“Companies will go where there are fast-growing markets and big profits,” says Jeffrey Sachs, globalization expert and economist at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Many U.S. companies haven’t been prepared for this change. Prior to globalization, the companies’ only type of operation outside the United States was manufacturing. Now they find themselves faced with new burgeoning overseas markets that are much more complex than they have ever had to manage. In a global economy, companies must have a deep understanding of how consumer needs change as incomes grow in each market/country. They must find ways of creating innovative products that meet those changing needs. They must deliver localized products at the right price and with the right branding strategies to customer markets all over the world. And they need a new talent management strategy that can help them meet their business challenges.</p>
<p>They need a diverse and geographically dispersed workforce with intimate knowledge of and the capacity to deliver to these different markets. Fortunately, unlike talent availability in foreign countries in the past, today there is a large, educated and highly skilled local national pool of talent in most emerging market countries. “What’s changed is that companies today are getting top talent in emerging economies.” says Jeffrey Sachs.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text2-0886368712440488">
<p>A woman at a company approached a director in her organization one day and asked how many employees the company had outside the United States. She was told there were about 4,000. She looked stunned and said, “I had no idea the company had that many Americans working overseas.”</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Why hire local nationals? Because, unlike expatriates, local nationals understand local markets and what customers want. They are able to adapt a company’s selling and marketing techniques and make them culturally appropriate to each market. They also know what changes need to be made in a product or service in order to make it “fit” the market. To put it another way, they are “street savvy.”</p>
<p>Here are some examples of some U.S. companies that have adapted their talent management strategy to help them meet their global, emerging market needs.</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712440488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Caterpillar hired 15,000 employees in 2010, of whom 7,500 were from outside the United States. Asia sales were up 38% but only 16% in the United States.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DuPont sells less than 30% of its products in the United States.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coca-Cola’s CEO points out that 1 billion consumers will enter the middle class during the coming decade, mostly in Africa, China and India. Of Coke’s 93,000 global employees, less than 13% were in the United States in 2009, down from 19% 5 years ago.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>McDonald’s gets about two thirds of its revenue from overseas sales.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In a McKinsey 2010 survey of 1,500 participants, 750 CEOs expect revenues outside the United States to exceed 50% in the next 3 years, if they haven’t already.</p></list-item></list>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text3-0886368712440488">
<p>Many companies in the past had kept their design centers for products in the United States. This was because they used the same product in all global markets. Now companies have design centers all over the world. When asked why, management says that because of the need to customize products, design centers need to be close to the local customers/markets to understand, firsthand, what is needed.</p>

<title>Global Talent Management Alternatives</title>
<p>The information presented clearly shows how the business world operated in the past and how it is operating today. It also shows why companies need to rethink global talent requirements. Emerging markets and globalization have definitely changed the need for global talent practices.</p>
<p>In PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Talent Mobility 2020 survey, 55% of 900 CEOs interviewed realized that they needed a well-defined approach to talent management as a result of globalization. Companies need speed to take advantage of global opportunities. In addition, they need more cost-efficient ways to move their global talent across borders. This means not only moving talent from the United States out but moving employees outside the United States around the world to different countries as well.</p>
<p>There are various alternatives that companies can use to handle as many talent requirements as possible in the “new normal.” Included here are some of the major ones. Long-term expatriate assignments still have their place in some circumstances and, therefore, have been included as one of the alternatives.</p>
<sec id="section4-0886368712440488">
<title>Traditional Long- Term Expatriate Assignments</title>
<p>With the “new normal” for global business, the need for long-term expatriate assignments is being heavily scrutinized. Companies are looking at both financial and non-financial aspects.</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712440488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Cost:</italic> U.S. salaries are among the highest in the world, and when the various overseas allowances and cost-of-living differentials are added in, keeping an American in a long-term assignment overseas can cost a company three times the expatriate’s U.S. salary.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Local national sensitivity:</italic> Jumbo-sized expatriate compensation packages cause tension between local employees and headquarters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lack of permanence:</italic> The common American on a foreign assignment repatriates in less than 5 years. There are disadvantages associated with this. They include the length of time necessary to acquire knowledge of the local business environment, different legal and regulatory rules and customs and other issues. There is also the fact that the expatriate is ultimately focused on his or her career path back in the United States and not the local operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lack of local business experience and savvy:</italic> This is often the most telling argument for replacing expatriates with local nationals. Although expatriates may understand the company inside out, they lack knowledge of local markets, local business cultures and government regulations and do not have trustworthy local business connections. They may upset local customers, underestimate local market conditions or try to work following conventional U.S. methods. In the process they might not understand or respect local culture. In addition, expatriates may be too slow or stubborn to change their business models and applications.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Poor adaptation to local culture:</italic> Most of the time, expatriates are selected because of their technical or managerial skills. The selection process very rarely includes any consideration of their “cultural fit.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lack of advancement potential for local nationals:</italic> Seeing the endless rotation of expatriates fuels a belief among local employees that there is a ceiling on their own potential in the company.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In summary, it is not rational for a company to try to staff all their operations in all their countries with long-term expatriates to solve their global market needs. If nothing else it would be incredibly expensive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368712440488">
<title>Short-Term Assignments</title>
<p>These assignments typically last up to 1 year and help companies react more quickly to global opportunities. Approvals on assignments tend to be quicker and acceptance rates are often higher as they don’t typically involve moving an entire family.</p>
<p>Short-term assignments aren’t as easy to manage or to keep track of cost. One reason is that companies may tend to relocate more employees more frequently. This boosts overall program costs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368712440488">
<title>Commuter Assignments</title>
<p>These assignments allow talent to commute from the home location to work in the host location. Commuters are often viewed as talent on business trip and paid in expense reimbursements or per diems. This is cheaper than having to provide cost-of-living differentials or other such benefits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886368712440488">
<title>Global Virtual Teams</title>
<p>According to research from the World Economic Forum in 2011, it is estimated that 30% of tasks in U.S. companies can be done virtually.</p>
<p>Companies now can choose the most qualified people, a “dream team,” regardless of their physical location. These remotely connected dream teams are known as global virtual teams. Team members from all parts of the world can be used to tackle and resolve company-wide issues. There is synergy with a global team that cannot be found when multiple teams try to solve the same problem while working in various business units in silo fashion.</p>
<p>Global virtual teams can also help decrease the company’s response time to changes in hypercompetitive markets. This can be accomplished by taking advantage of round-the-clock work by team members dispersed around the world.</p>
<p>Global virtual teams can improve resource utilization by using time to their advantage. Performing work asynchronously helps global companies bridge different time zones. For example, design engineers in the United States can work on a project during their day and then transmit their work to India when they leave for the day. Design engineers in India work on the project during their day—which is night in the United States. Before leaving work, the engineers in India transmit the data back to the United States. Thus, there is 24-hour coverage of a project. This continues until the project is completed.</p>
<p>If problems surface during the course of the project, video conferencing can be used by the global team to solve them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886368712440488">
<title>Reverse Expatriates</title>
<p>Reverse expatriates are employees outside the United States who become short-term assignees. They rotate through either headquarters or some of the company’s more mature operations elsewhere in the world. The purpose is to immerse these reverse expatriates in the company’s way of doing business.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t simply to transplant mature-market practices into emerging markets—these practices will fail at the hands of locals just as they would in the hands of traditional expatriates. Reverse expatriates need encouragement from headquarters to adapt new strategies and practices that work best in their own market. The main objective is to establish relationships with people who can assist them in the future if required. Other objectives are to learn risk-taking limits and the economic fundamentals of the business.</p>
<p>Reverse expatriates shadow company leaders and observe/absorb company protocols, processes and practices. They develop plans for adapting any relevant U.S. practices to their home country. When executed effectively, this approach accelerates the development of locals. It ultimately allows them as mature managers to transfer to other company sites as the need arises as well.</p>
<p>Although not yet widespread, this practice is beginning to take hold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886368712440488">
<title>Development Assignments</title>
<p>The need for employees to understand other cultures, understand differences in business operations and to develop a global “mindset” is growing. Top management in many U.S. companies does not have global work experience. This lack of global work experience has been a difficult hurdle for them to overcome in the “new normal.” CEOs understand the need to develop global knowledge in their lower level managers and employees. This global “mindset” will be helpful in the future as they replace current company executives.</p>
<p>There is another reason that developmental assignments will be more frequent in the future. The Millennials or Generation Ys view overseas assignments as a mandatory requirement in their career. And Gen Ys and their successors will make up the majority of the workforce in a few years.</p>
<p>Research conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers with 3,000 new university graduates reveals that Gen Ys expect global assignments in their job. They want to experience what it is like to work overseas. 94% of this population believes they will work across geographic borders. 80% are very open to the idea of one or more overseas assignments during their career.</p>
<p>As shown above, many more varied talent requirements will be necessary to align with U.S. companies’ global business strategies. The reasons will include both financial and nonfinancial. The three main reasons for using multiple talent alternatives in the future are the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0886368712440488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Placing specific talent where it is needed to successfully serve in different markets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cost reduction from decreasing the number of long-term expatriates</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Building cultural awareness and the ability to work across the globe</p></list-item></list>
<p>Envision a company “war room.” There is a bulletin corkboard on the wall with a huge world map on it. There are different colored pins—one for each type of talent management alternative. Red might be for commuters, green for local nationals, blue for developmental assignments, yellow for reverse expats and so on. Top management moves the pins around, sticks them in different countries and discusses the reasons why certain types of talent are needed at each location. The management executives keep moving the colored pins and discussing alternatives until the entire top management group agrees on a global talent management plan. In general, no one method is better than others, but each has a specific reason for use.</p>
<p>The year 2020 is fast approaching, yet the way global talent is sourced, organized and managed will have changed radically by that time. An explosion of activity in emerging markets has contributed to a significant increase in the need for companies to move people and source talent from all around the world.</p>
<p>Emerging markets are not a one-off occurrence. They will be around and affecting the way companies do business for a long time.</p>
<p>Welcome to the “new normal” of global talent management.</p>
