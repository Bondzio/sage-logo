<p>Bone tissue engineering takes part in the complex process of bone healing by combining cells, chemical/physical signals, and scaffolds with the scaffolds providing an artificial extracellular matrix network. The role of the support template for cell activity is crucial to guide the healing process. This in vitro study compared three different poly(<sc>D</sc>,<sc>L</sc>-lactic acid) scaffolds obtained by varying the pore size generated by applying different salt leaching processes. The influence of pore dimensions on the extracellular matrix produced by human osteosarcoma-derived osteoblasts (MG63 cell line) seeded on these different materials was analyzed. This study is targeted on the intermediate stage of the bone healing process, where a collagen network is beginning to develop by the growing osteoblasts representing the template for the ultimate stage of bone formation. Imaging analyses assessed by confocal laser microscopy were combined with gene expression measurements of the most common genes involved in the bone healing process. Furthermore, in vitro evaluations were carried out to investigate cell morphology, proliferation, and viability. It was found that the different pore size matrixes can affect extracellular matrix development and that cell organization, collagen I assembly, and mineralization are strictly correlated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissue engineering for bone regeneration is focused on developing scaffolds, which are structural supports able to mimic the native tissue-like environment and to assist, once combined with cells, a complete healing process. The main idea is to reproduce the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) with scaffolds able to simulate the physiological ECM features and to interact biomolecularly with cells tuning their functions and guiding the entire multicellular events of ECM formation and tissue regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512470885">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512470885">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ECM of connective tissue is a fibrous composite that surrounds cells comprising many biological components. It is the main component of bone combining inorganic and organic parts. Osteoblasts are responsible for ECM synthesis and mineralization. ECM components are central to every phase of wound healing. In the early step, the cellular inflammatory reaction is followed by fibrocartilage tissue production (soft callus tissue). This is the natural fingerprint for the formation of hard callus that is physiologically replaced by the final bone, either cortical or trabecular, remodeled, and completed in an ultimate stage. During the repair process, every newly formed tissue evolves from the previous and the entire healing mechanism results from the development of these overlapped stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512470885">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512470885"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512470885"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512470885"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512470885"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512470885">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tissue engineering efforts to create functional biological tissues rely on three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds as temporary artificial ECM frameworks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512470885">9</xref></sup> 3D constructs are currently produced by different techniques using biocompatible polymers, either of synthetic or natural origin. Different features can be achieved and have to be taken into account when designing a scaffold for bone tissue reconstruction. Therefore, mechanical properties and geometrical features (pore size, pore morphology, and interconnectivity) should be selected considering the mechanisms of biocompatibility described by Williams,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512470885">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512470885">11</xref></sup> that is, the ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response during the regenerative phase.</p>
<p>In the present study, implications of scaffold geometry and collagen assembly on the ultimate stage of mineralization of bone tissue were assessed. In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512470885">12</xref></sup>, a comparison between constructs with regular ordered structures (microfabricated scaffolds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512470885">13</xref></sup>) versus constructs with random morphologies (salt-leached sponges) was carried out to evaluate which architecture was more efficient as a scaffold to promote osteoblast-like cell activity. Particular attention was paid to the collagen 3D organization, the natural template for subsequent mineralization. The study demonstrated that a scaffold with a randomly organized structure, rather than an ordered porous matrix, was more favorable as a template for a physiological collagen assembly from a bone tissue regeneration perspective.</p>
<p>Based on this previous study and beginning with a salt-leached scaffold morphology from poly(<sc>D,L</sc>-lactic acid) (PDLLA) polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512470885">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512470885"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512470885">16</xref></sup>, three different pore size ranges were obtained by varying the porogen granular size. The goal was to develop an in vitro model to evaluate how different scaffold pore sizes can affect cell behavior in terms of collagen I production, development, arrangement, and mineralization. A human osteosarcoma-derived osteoblast (MG63) cell line was used for preliminary in vitro biological evaluations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512470885">17</xref></sup> Cell growth, distribution, proliferation, and activity were studied. Imaging analysis by confocal laser microscopy (CLM), after marking collagen I with a specific antibody, was combined with collagen quantification as well as gene expression assessment by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. The expression of the most significant osteogenic genes (RUNX2, Decorin, and <italic>ALPL</italic>) was evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512470885">18</xref></sup> Alizarin Red staining was finally used to determine the degree of mineralization.</p>

Sieved NaCl particulates with three different dimensional ranges (240–315 µm, construct S1; 315–425 µm, construct S2; and 425–1180 µm, construct S3) were mixed into the PDLLA solution, obtaining a 1:25 w/w polymer/porogen final concentration. The mixture was air-dried (24–36 h) and immersed in deionized water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) for 3 days with changes every 6 h for the removal of the porogen.</p>
<p>All the scaffolds were prepared with a thickness ranging from 2 to 3 mm by casting into glass Petri dishes. After detaching, the scaffolds were cut into 6-mm-diameter disks. Before use in in vitro cell culture studies, the scaffolds were sterilized with aqueous ethanol solution 70% (v/v) at 4°C for 24 h and dried under a sterile hood at room temperature. Scaffold modifications due to the sterilization process were not detected.</p>

<title>Scaffold characterization</title>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (Supra 40, Carl Zeiss AG; Jena, Germany; operating mode: high vacuum, secondary electron detector) was used for the evaluation of scaffold surface morphologies. Samples were previously sputter-coated with a thin gold layer under argon atmosphere (SEM Coating Unit PS3; Assing S.p.A., Rome, Italy).</p>
<p>Scaffold pore size ranges were estimated by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging analyses using ImageJ software. Three different scaffolds of each type (S1–S3) were analyzed, and a total of 150 pores per sample were considered.</p>
<p>Sponge porosity was assessed by a liquid displacement method similar to a previously described technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911512470885">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512470885"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911512470885">24</xref></sup> Briefly, scaffolds were immersed into a 5 mL graduated cylinder containing a known volume of ethanol (<italic>V</italic>

<title>In vitro cell culture</title>
<p>After sterilization, scaffolds were placed in 96-well plates and washed several times with sterile, distilled water. Samples were seeded with 20 µL media containing 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells and human osteosarcoma-derived osteoblasts (MG63 cells). After 1.5 h, media were added and after 24 h, scaffolds were moved from the original well plate to a new one and incubated for a total of 28 days. Results were evaluated at six experimental time points: 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, and 28 days. Minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin, 1% glutamax, 1% vitamin, and 1% nonessential amino acids comprised the culture medium. The culture medium was further supplemented with ascorbic acid (50 µg/mL) and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate after 9 days. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere incubator, with medium changes every 2–3 days.</p>

<title>Proliferation</title>
<p>Cell number and its variations during the culturing time were measured through DNA quantification, using the PicoGreen assay (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit, Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA). At predetermined time points, the medium was removed from wells and the scaffolds were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Five hundred microliters of 0.05% Triton X was used to completely cover the scaffold before freezing and storing at −20°C until analysis. Each thawed sample was then sonicated for 10 s using a tip of an ultrasonic processor (UP400S Hielscher, Ultrasonics GmbH; Teltow, Germany). Samples were aliquoted in triplicate (100 µL each) into a 96 Nunclon delta black microwell, and 100 µL of PicoGreen working solution was added to each well. Fluorescence was read by a spectrophotometer (excitation wavelength: 485 nm, emission wavelength: 538 nm; Tecan Infinite M200 Pro; Männedorf, Switzerland). To correlate fluorescence to DNA concentration, a calibration curve was generated using DNA standards at a known concentration, provided with the assay. The DNA amount of each sample was divided by 7.7 pg of DNA, the average amount of DNA in a human cell according to the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512470885">25</xref></sup> to finally obtain the cell number.</p>

<title>Cell morphology and distribution, collagen I fibers assembling</title>
<p>Cell attachment, growth, distribution, and migration and collagen I fiber formation were detected using specific stainings and visualized by CLM. The surface figures result from stacking multiple horizontal images corresponding to different focused planes.</p>
<p>Cell growth and distribution were visualized by Oregon Green 488 Phalloidin (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma–Aldrich; St. Gallen, Switzerland) staining. To detect collagen I, a primary rabbit antibody to human type I collagen was used (Meridian Life Science, Saco, ME, USA). Briefly, fixation with a formaldehyde solution (4% formaldehyde in PBS solution) was performed. After three rinses with PBS, the samples were incubated with the primary antibody (in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) overnight at 4°C. The seeded scaffolds were then rinsed with PBS/BSA and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with Triton X (0.2% Triton X in PBS solution) and stained with Oregon Green 488 Phalloidin and DAPI, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<title>RNA isolation and real-time qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy MINI Kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, at each experimental time, scaffolds were minced and put in a QIAshredder column with 600 µL of lysis buffer and then centrifuged. Then, 600 µL of ethanol were added to the lysate, and the solution was transferred to a spin column. After centrifugation and discarding the flow-through, different buffers were added, and each time, the columns were centrifuged. The total RNA was eluted in 30 µL of RNase-free water. At each culturing time, the RNA was extracted from three constructs of the same scaffold type.</p>
<p>The total RNA was quantified using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific; Wilmington, DE, USA) and ranged from 400 ng to 5 µg with an average of 2 µg total RNA. The quality of the RNA, expressed as RNA integrity number (RIN), was checked for randomly selected samples by automated electrophoresis (Bioanalyser 2100, Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA, USA) and ranged from 6.0 to 9.9 with a median of 8.6.</p>
<p>RT-qPCR was performed according to the protocol from the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad ; Hercules, CA, USA). In brief, a reaction mixture consisting of 1× iScript Reaction Mix, 1 µL iScript Reverse Transcriptase, 400–500 ng total RNA, and nuclease-free water was prepared in 20 µL of total volume. The single-strand cDNA synthesis occurred by incubating the complete reaction mixture for 5 min at 25°C, followed by 30 min at 42°C, and terminated by incubation at 85°C for 5 min. Subsequently, the cDNA was diluted with nuclease-free water to 2.5 ng/µL cDNA.</p>

The cycling conditions comprised 2-min polymerase activation at 95°C and 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 10 s, followed by a dissociation curve analysis from 65°C to 95°C. PCR efficiencies were calculated using a relative standard curve derived from a cDNA mixture of five randomly selected samples (a 10-fold dilution series with four measuring points). Calculation of normalized relative expression levels was done in Excel as described by Hellemans et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512470885">26</xref></sup> Normalization was performed using the SDHA reference gene.</p>

<p>The pores were highly interconnected and randomly distributed in each scaffold. In general, scaffold architectures are very similar with only variation in pore size, increasing with the varying NaCl crystal sizes used in the different sponges. Through imaging analysis, it was found that the scaffold pore size ranges were different on analyzed samples: from a few nanometers to 275, 325, and 420 µm in S1–S3, respectively. However, the scaffolds’ open porosity, calculated by a liquid displacement method, was comparable and ranges from 85% to 88% (S1 = 87% ± 2%, S2 = 88% ± 4%, and S3 = 85% ± 2%).</p>

<p>In particular, RUNX2 is a well-known gene, downregulated during the differentiation into mature osteoblasts that form mature bone. Downregulation of RUNX2 gene was particularly evident for samples S2 and S3 after the addition of osteogenic medium (after day 9), while on S1 this trend occurred earlier, between days 5 and 9. The changes in Decorin expression were significant. At day 20 in S2 and S3, a low value was shown, and in the same constructs, a subsequent rapid increase was detectable. In constructs S2 and S3 between days 20 and 28, the expression of alkaline phosphatase, an important osteogenic marker corresponding to calcium phosphate deposition, was nearly doubled compared to S1 (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The key to understanding the mechanisms of biocompatibility, as defined by Williams,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512470885">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512470885">11</xref></sup> is to determine which material variables influence the host response throughout the regenerative process. Unique combinations of chemical, biochemical, physiological, physical, or other characteristics can influence how contact and interaction between biomaterials and the cells or the tissues occur.</p>
<p>The role of scaffold morphology and its features as a bioactive template for cell activity is, therefore, one of the main subjects of tissue engineering research. Scaffolds should guide cell functions and create a temporary matrix until the biological ECM produced is mature enough to take over the biological functions. Therefore, different scaffold parameters should be considered in designing a suitable matrix for cell support because every tissue and/or cell type requires a scaffold with specific morphological and physical characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911512470885">31</xref></sup> Among the several characteristics that have to be considered, larger porosity and pore size increase the ability of a scaffold to be penetrated by cells and subsequently vascularized,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883911512470885">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911512470885">33</xref></sup> but, conversely, its mechanical properties are weaker.

<p>In this study, targeted at bone tissue regeneration, the attention was focused on understanding how a single scaffold variable, pore size, can influence MG63 activity, in particular regarding ECM development. Three PDLLA salt-leached sponges were generated using diverse salt granularities, resulting in scaffolds having a similar open porosity but different pore size ranges. Scaffolds had pore sizes ranging from a few nanometers up to 275, 325, and 420 µm in S1–S3, respectively. Such a broad pore size distribution is suitable for bone regeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512470885">1</xref></sup> allowing cell penetration, vessel growth, nutrient transport, and waste removal. An innovative approach to evaluate the influence of scaffold morphology on MG63 activity was used: ECM production and its development were considered with respect to the scaffold pore size. The major goal of the work was to use the developed scaffolds differing in pore structures as in vitro models to look at the mechanism of ECM formation early in the regenerative process. All the phases of bone development were characterized by examining the expression of different genes. Among them, collagen I, the main structural protein involved in the early stage of bone regeneration, was analyzed quantitatively, via gene expression analysis, and qualitatively, via imaging analysis.</p>
<p>An increased proliferation and a higher level of cell organization were found for scaffolds S2 and S3, when compared to scaffold S1, by DNA quantification and CLM evaluations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512470885">Figures 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911512470885">4</xref>). A more difficult cell migration into the smaller pores may be an explanation of these differences.</p>
<p>Gene expression of collagen I, assessed by RT-qPCR analyses, was upregulated at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512470885">Figure 5(b)</xref>). These results agree with early steps in bone healing: ECM matrix begins to be produced usually during the first stage of bone formation corresponding to an upregulation of the Type I collagen. Collagen I gene expression is also linked to the osteogenic gene expression of RUNX2, essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. It is known that RUNX2 is a positive regulator and that it can upregulate the expression of bone matrix protein genes such as collagen I.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911512470885">28</xref></sup> Furthermore, downregulation of RUNX2 promotes osteoblast maturation. Considering the gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512470885">Figure 7</xref>) and the confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911512470885">Figure 6</xref>), we can assume that cells on scaffold S1 matured prematurely around day 9 without producing the right amount of organized collagen I necessary for ECM development. Conversely, on S2 and S3, RUNX2 is downregulated later, allowing a functional collagen I production and assembly. Furthermore, Decorin downregulation is connected to collagen I assembly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911512470885">29</xref></sup> and its increase for S2 and S3 at day 28 may represent that cells were not organizing collagen I anymore but they were mineralizing the ECM already synthesized. Further evidence of these findings was given by the upregulation of the ALPL gene only for samples S2 and S3 at day 28, suggesting that only on these scaffolds the mineralization event was finalized. Those RT-qPCR results are compatible with imaging analyses after AlizarinRed staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512470885">Figure 8</xref>) in which it was possible to notice mineralization trace only in S2 and S3.</p>
<p>Based on the results observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911512470885">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512470885">8</xref>, it appears that S2 is characterized by thicker collagen I fibers and calcified spots, S3 by a well-organized net of thin collagen I fibers and slight lines of calcium while no clear mineralization is detectable on S1, where collagen I seems less abundant and packed. This corroborates the connection between the final mineralized bone and the previous phases of ECM developments, confirming the importance to evaluate each single phase of tissue formation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This in vitro study demonstrates that pore size plays an important role in cell behavior, focusing on ECM production and organization. In fact, a small pore size appears to prevent an efficient cell migration and proliferation and, more interesting, to induce MG63 to mature earlier without, however, producing a functional ECM. Sponges with a pore size ranging up to 325 or 420 µm lead instead to a well-organized collagen I network and to the subsequent calcium deposition. Moreover, the evaluation of collagen I assembling could be a useful tool to predict the degree of the final mineralization. This study connects scaffold morphology and collagen I assembly, which affect the final mineralization process. It also allows to evaluate the tissue produced by osteoblasts throughout the bone formation process. Further investigations will consider the use of human primary osteoblasts, and results will be finally validated by in vivo studies.</p>
