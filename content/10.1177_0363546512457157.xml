<sec id="section1-0363546512457157">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The results of surgical treatment for femoroacetabular impingement have been increasingly reported, and more advanced intra-articular disease has been identified as an important predictive factor of outcome. Yet, the reliability of arthroscopic hip disease classification has not been well defined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512457157">
<title>Purpose/Hypothesis:</title>
<p>To determine the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the Beck classification of labral and articular cartilage disease (anterior-superior acetabular rim) encountered in hip arthroscopy. Secondly, we identified the sources of poor reliability that may be improved with future disease classification schemes. Our hypothesis was that the Beck classification of labral and chondral lesions would demonstrate substantial reliability, while the differentiation of early forms of disease would be a common source of disagreement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512457157">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512457157">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Four experienced hip arthroscopists reviewed standardized arthroscopic videos of 40 cases. Arthroscopic findings at the anterior-superior acetabular rim were classified using the Beck classification of labral and articular cartilage disease. Repeat classification of videos was performed at least 2 weeks later. The reliability of arthroscopic classification was defined using the average weighted Cohen κ values and agreement rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512457157">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Arthroscopic classification of labral disease using the Beck classification demonstrated moderate to substantial interobserver reliability (average κ = .62; range, .48-.78) and an overall agreement rate of 81.7%. Intraobserver reliability showed a similar level of reliability (average κ = .65; agreement rate, 80.6%). The differentiation between labral degeneration and labral detachment was a common source of disagreement. Similarly, the Beck classification of articular cartilage disease had moderate to substantial interobserver reliability (average κ = .65; range, .49-.78) and overall agreement rate of 57.5%. Intraobserver reliability showed a slightly better level of reliability (average κ = .80; agreement rate, 77.5%). The differentiation between articular cartilage malacia and debonding was a common source of disagreement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512457157">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The arthroscopic classification of acetabular rim disease with the Beck classification has substantial interobserver reliability. This level of reliability is similar to previously reported arthroscopic disease classifications in the knee and shoulder and seems appropriate for future outcome reporting. Future classifications that eliminate common sources of disagreement may further improve the reliability.</p>

<body>
<p>Arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular hip disease has become increasingly common with the improved understanding of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512457157">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457157">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457157">11</xref></sup> In FAI, the labrochondral junction of the anterior-superior acetabular rim is the most common site of injury, leading to adjacent articular cartilage and labral lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457157">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457157">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457157">11</xref></sup> Classification of cartilage and labral disease has also evolved. Articular cartilage injury has been classically described by Outerbridge,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512457157">20</xref></sup> while our understanding of labral pathological abnormalities has evolved from initial studies by Lage et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457157">14</xref></sup> McCarthy et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457157">18</xref></sup> and Seldes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457157">22</xref></sup> Abnormalities of the labrum and articular cartilage are now commonly classified using the Beck classification systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457157">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457157">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512457157">Table 1</xref>). Labral condition is classified as (1) normal, (2) degeneration, (3) full-thickness tear, (4) detachment, or (5) ossification. Articular cartilage disease is classified as (1) normal, (2) malacia, (3) debonding, (4) cleavage, or (5) defect. The Beck classification schemes were initially described for open surgical dislocation but have been applied to arthroscopic interventions as well.</p>

<p>Short-term outcomes of the treatment of FAI are being frequently reported with clinical improvement noted in most patients. Byrd and Jones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512457157">6</xref></sup> found improvements to be generally maintained at 10-year follow-up. Yet, a subgroup of patients has suboptimal outcomes. Advanced intra-articular disease has been proposed as a predictive factor for poorer clinical results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512457157">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457157">16</xref></sup> Therefore, establishing the reliability of arthroscopic classification of labral and articular cartilage conditions is important for identifying disease characteristics that have prognostic value. An effective classification scheme should not only adequately describe the extent of disease present but also help guide the treatment of disease and potentially predict outcome. Additionally, reliable disease classification systems will facilitate the comparison of results from different centers, surgeons, and surgical techniques. Investigation of the reliability of current standards of disease classification will also assist in determining which disease characteristics can and cannot be reliably classified and may allow for the development of more reliable classification systems. While the reliability of arthroscopic classification has been reported in the knee and shoulder,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512457157">#</xref></sup> to our knowledge, it has not been previously established for the hip.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the Beck and modified Beck classification schemes of labral and articular cartilage disease (acetabular rim) encountered in hip arthroscopy. Secondly, we attempted to identify sources of poor reliability that may be improved with future disease classification schemes. Our hypothesis was that the Beck classification of labral and chondral conditions would demonstrate moderate reliability, while the differentiation of early forms of disease would be a common source of disagreement.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A reliability study of arthroscopic findings of labrochondral disease at the anterior-superior acetabular rim was performed. All patients eligible for inclusion in the study were undergoing arthroscopic treatment for presumed intra-articular hip lesions, most commonly FAI, and did not have radiographic findings of advanced osteoarthritis (Tonnis ≥2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512457157">24</xref></sup> The senior author generally recorded video of a systematic diagnostic arthroscopic examination during all procedures.</p>
<p>A hip arthroscopic procedure was performed with the patient in the supine position, utilizing the midanterior and anterolateral portals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457157">5</xref></sup> The standardized videos were obtained through an anterolateral viewing portal, while the midanterior portal was utilized for arthroscopic probing. All videos included a standardized arthroscopic examination focusing on the anterior-superior labrum and articular cartilage, which included probing and visualization of the acetabular labrum, labrochondral junction, and articular cartilage. Systematic probing of the articular cartilage, labrochondral junction, articular side of the labrum, and capsular side of the labrum was performed.</p>
<p>A large database of videos from approximately 100 consecutive arthroscopic surgeries was reviewed by 2 authors not involved in the actual readings. Cases were excluded for poor quality videos, inadequate visualization, or inadequate probing of pathological lesions. Videos were chosen to span the spectrum of intra-articular findings and to ensure a high quality of visualization. Specific attention was paid to ensure several cases with a normal labrum, ossified labrum, normal cartilage, and articular cartilage defect were included. Forty patients were included in the study. Videos were generally 30 to 60 seconds in length.</p>
<p>Four surgeons familiar with hip arthroscopy (&gt;100 hip arthroscopy cases) participated in the study. Readers participated in a telephone conference discussion of the relevant classification schemes as well as an in-person group session discussing the classification schemes and practice video cases. An initial reading was followed by a second reading of reordered cases more than 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic findings were classified into the 5 types of labral and articular cartilage states by the Beck criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457157">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512457157">Table 1</xref>). If more than 1 finding was noted, the readers were instructed to report the most advanced finding. Because classification focused on only a segment of the labrum, the definition of labral ossification was modified to include only complete, nonfocal ossification. Additional post hoc analyses were performed to investigate specific sources of disagreement.</p>
<p>The initial read by each reviewer was utilized for interobserver analysis, while both reads were utilized for intraobserver analysis. Interobserver analysis included comparison of each of the 40 readings with each of the 3 other readers (6 reader combinations for a total of 240 comparisons). Similarly, intraobserver analysis included comparison of each of the 40 readings for 4 readers (160 comparisons).</p>
<p>Statistical measures of reliability including percentage agreement and weighted Cohen κ values were calculated. Cohen κ values were interpreted as described by Landis and Koch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457157">15</xref></sup> The κ values were classified as described by Landis and Koch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457157">15</xref></sup> with values of .81 to 1.0 indicating excellent agreement, .61 to .80 substantial agreement, .41 to .60 moderate agreement, .21 to .40 fair agreement, and 0 to .20 slight agreement. Absolute agreement on any given case was defined as the agreement of all 4 readers.</p>

Nine cases were classified as labral degeneration by at least 1 reader, with none having absolute agreement. In comparison, 27 of the remaining 31 cases (87.1%) had agreement on labral classification by all 4 readers. Discrepancy in 1 case resulted from disagreement of classification between degeneration and normal, while in 8 cases, disagreement between degeneration and labral detachment occurred. The average weight κ value for these 9 cases was .18 (range, –.17 to .44) compared with .80 (range, .68-.90) for the remaining 31 cases.</p>
<p>Subgroup analysis of the 9 cases labeled labral degeneration by the Beck classification found an average weighted κ of .42. Similarly, the modified Beck classification had an average weighted κ of .42 for these 9 cases. Additional post hoc grouping of labral status as (A) normal, (B) labral tear or severe degeneration, or (C) complete ossification resulted in an average weighted κ value of .62 for these cases. The overall weighted κ for this grouping among all cases was .80 (range, .69-.92). The overall agreement rate for this grouping was 92.5% (222/240).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, there are no published studies reporting the reliability of arthroscopic classification of labral and articular cartilage hip disease in a clinically relevant setting. In the present study, we observed substantial interobserver reliability of the Beck classification of labral and articular cartilage disease in hip arthroscopy.</p>
<p>While the Beck classification of labral disease did show substantial reliability (κ = .62), we found the differentiation of labral degeneration from labral detachment to be a major source of disagreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457157">Figure 1</xref>). A labral lesion in FAI begins at the labrochondral junction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546512457157">**</xref></sup> Early disease at the labrochondral junction may result in partial detachment and mild associated changes in the adjacent labrum and cartilage. These findings are difficult to fit into the Beck labral classification. The Beck classification has been criticized for not being a progressive classification as well as frequently having difficulties in classifying disease when several types of injury coexist. Labral tears in the hip are generally detachments at the labrochondral junction, with a preserved labral attachment to bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457157">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457157">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457157">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457157">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457157">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457157">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457157">22</xref></sup> While full-thickness labral tears do occur, they are actually very uncommon. Often, by the time full-thickness labral tears occur, they are accompanied by significant labral degeneration. The treatment of a full-thickness labral tear does not differ significantly from that of a labral detachment; rather, the quality of the labral tissue determines its repairability.</p>

<p>The classification of articular cartilage disease using the Beck classification also had moderate reliability (κ = .65). Acetabular rim cartilage disease in FAI is linked to the status of the labrochondral junction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546512457157">**</xref></sup> In early disease, repetitive contact at the labrochondral junction may result in adjacent cartilage debonding. Further damage may cause malacia or partial-thickness cartilage flap formation, until eventually complete disruption of the labrochondral junction results in full articular cartilage disease. Readers demonstrated poor reliability in differentiating articular cartilage malacia and debonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512457157">Figure 2</xref>). This is not surprising because early disease at the labrochondral junction can result in varying degrees of both malacia and debonding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457157">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457157">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457157">11</xref></sup> Differentiating between which of these 2 factors is more prominent is likely to be very subjective. Readers also demonstrated poor reliability in differentiating cleavage lesions from full-thickness defects. This is likely because when a cleavage lesion is present, there is often significant cartilage fraying as well as adjacent labral degeneration and hypermobility, which can make judging a small amount of articular cartilage loss very difficult. Large articular cartilage defects are relatively uncommon, as the articular cartilage sleeve in a cleavage lesion often remains in continuity until a late stage. Based on these 2 findings, a post hoc articular cartilage classification system including (1) normal, (2) early articular disease: malacia/debonding, or (3) advanced articular disease: cleavage/defect was investigated. The agreement rate improved from 57.5% to 73.2% for interobserver comparisons and from 75.8% to 81.8% for intraobserver comparisons. This modified classification resulted in a similar level of substantial reliability (κ = .68), as it accounts for the number of categories.</p>

<p>Our findings with hip arthroscopy can be compared with those of similar studies investigating the classification of knee and shoulder disease. Multiple studies have previously reported the reliability of arthroscopic disease classification in the knee (meniscus/articular cartilage) and shoulder (rotator cuff/superior labrum anterior-posterior [SLAP]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546512457157">††</xref></sup> These studies have generally concluded that this level of interobserver reliability is clinically acceptable (with κ values generally .40-.80), and these classification systems have become accepted in the peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<p>There are several potential limitations to the current study. First, the classification of disease utilizing recorded intraoperative videos fails to provide the viewer with tactile feedback and the ability to further probe areas of question. While actual arthroscopic examinations would be feasible in cadaveric specimens, it is not in patients with FAI. The classification of disease based on arthroscopic videos may be a source of bias. While readers in the current study were aware of the purpose of the study, they were not provided with other clinical information. The arthroscopic visualization and probing could have been potentially influenced by the pathological abnormalities present. However, the standardization of videos in our study attempted to provide a consistent means to classify intra-articular findings. Second, the current study focused on findings at the anterior-superior acetabular rim only. The findings in our study may not be applicable to other regions of the central compartment where visualization is less optimal or to findings in the peripheral compartment. Additionally, the current study utilized surgeons familiar with hip arthroscopy. The reliability demonstrated might not extrapolate to surgeons with less experience.</p>
<p>The current study demonstrates that arthroscopic classification of acetabular rim disease using the Beck classification has substantial interobserver reliability. We have also identified areas in the labrochondral disease classification that pose a challenge for interobserver reliability; namely, the distinction between labral degeneration and tear and the distinction between acetabular malacia and debonding remain sources of disagreement. In summary, we propose that the Beck classification is appropriate for documenting hip disease characteristics present at the anterior-superior acetabular rim during hip arthroscopy. Future grading systems should focus on improved reliability for these labrochondral disease characteristics.</p>
