<abstract>
<p>Conceptual analysis, like any exclusively theoretical activity, is far from overrated in current psychology. Such a situation can be related both to the contingent influences of contextual and historical character and to the more essential metatheoretical reasons. After a short discussion of the latter it is argued that even within a strictly empirical psychology there are non-trivial tasks that can be attached to well-defined and methodologically reliable, conceptual work. This kind of method, inspired by the ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Peter Strawson (conceptual grammar), and Gilbert Ryle (conceptual geography), is proposed and formally depicted as being holistic, descriptive, and connective. Finally, the newly presented framework of connective conceptual analysis is defended against the “Charge from Psychology,” in a version developed by William Ramsey, claiming that conceptual analysis is based on psychological assumptions that have already been refuted by empirical psychology.</p>

<title>Why may psychology need such a disgraceful activity as conceptual analysis?</title>
<p>Conceptual analysis does not seem to be a well-regarded endeavour in modern psychology. Not only is it not by itself encouraged, but it may also, especially if conducted as a primary occupation, constitute a serious hindrance in one’s professional career. This situation seems to take place not only in the applied branch of psychology but also in its academic counterpart, which could be suspected of a somewhat more theoretical bent.</p>
<p>In order to account for this state of affairs it may be useful to consider it as part of a more general tendency. The neglect of conceptual analysis is only one aspect of the widespread distrust of all theoretical, especially if solely theoretical, psychological projects. The range of this inclination seems to be, in fact, wide enough to have led some psychologists to very grave, even if probably oversimplified, remarks of the kind that a “number of interlocking influences in the academic world have had the effect of encouraging <italic>activity</italic> at the expense of <italic>thought</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310383077">Wachtel, 1980</xref>, p. 399).</p>
<p>The “influences” referred to by Paul Wachtel include: the urge that any theoretical work is supplemented by empirical data; quantitatively understood productivity; as well as the current standard of assessing academic work and grant policy. As such they are all relatively proximal and, hence, can be a good vantage point to prescribe specific changes in the institutional setting of psychology, like the ones proposed by Wachtel. At the same time, however, an explanation provided by their enumeration is rather confined and not sufficient for a deeper metatheoretical understanding, let alone a more thorough attempt to reconsider the prevailing paradigm.</p>
<p>An account that is more distal, and probably a little bit more moderate, has been offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310383077">Jerome Wakefield (2007)</xref>, who claims that the fact of “first-rank departments” generally rejecting “the legitimacy and job-worthiness of even outstanding conceptual and theoretical researchers” (p. 40) can be related to long-lasting attempts to establish psychology as an independent discipline fundamentally different from philosophy. Any psychology undergraduate knows that from a theoretical endeavour (he or she does not probably know the very term “conceptual analysis”) there is not far to go towards irresponsible armchair speculation, a speculation that psychologists would be very happy to leave to philosophers. The reserve towards philosophy and anything that may be too closely associated with it can be considered as a negative side of these self-identifying and self-reassuring attempts. The positive side of them is an aspiration to become a <italic>truly experimental</italic> science, as similar as possible to the natural sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354310383077">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The influences of the kind discussed by Wakefield, although widespread and obviously persistent, are in a sense outdated. After all, one may hope that scientific psychology has already grown up enough to give up its adolescent opposition to the parental figure of philosophy. At the same time, it should be emphasized that psychologists’ neglect to convey conceptual analysis and any other theoretical endeavours can be due to reasons of more a-historical and context-free character.</p>
<p>The first issue in question is connected with the radically positivistic stance that all meaningful and non-trivial questions can be reduced to ones of an empirical, preferably experimental, character. Any theoretical work, as taken from this perspective, can serve only as a means to successful operationalization. As soon as the concepts and problems in question are expressed in terms of appropriate measurement operations, all that remains is considered purely empirical. What we need, in short, is a proper experimental setting and a proper number of participants rather than a comfortable armchair in which to take a thoughtful outlook. Although the extreme version of this reductive view is not often endorsed any more, its continuous influence can be noticed through the “reinforcement contingencies” operating (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310383077">Wachtel, 1980</xref>) in contemporary academia.</p>
<p>The second argument that can be formulated against the conceptual and, more generally, theoretical investigation is inductive and points to the fact that theorizing in psychology has often, too often in fact, led to theories that were simply bad. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310383077">Wachtel (1980)</xref>, “a great many pronouncements, utterly untestable either in practice or in principle, have been put forth under the guise of ‘theory’” and led psychologists to “become suspicious of theorizing altogether” (p. 401). A “theoretical,” let alone a “speculative,” psychologist is a suspicious figure, after all.</p>
<p>In order to briefly address the above issues there are two things that need to be mentioned. First, even if we want all our questions to be ultimately empirically answerable, conceptual work can be much more than an operationalization’s tool. The successful operationalization is not, should not be, the aim in itself. The purposes of psychology, be it explanation, prediction, law formation, or something else, are not achieved through any accidental operationalization. Our questions, in order to be answered, need not only to be <italic>empirically operationalized</italic> but also to be <italic>operationalized thoughtfully</italic>. After all, it is not an uncommon reaction to ask “what does it really mean” or, more sadly, “so what?” after having read a perfectly empirical paper that simply shows us nothing new. And it is actually careful conceptual work that can decrease the probability of obtaining data that are either ambiguous or trivial and, furthermore, that can help us to cope with a confusion some empirical data will inevitably cause.</p>
<p>The possibility of an empirical psychologist being confused by his or her own data, one can argue, is to some degree a feature that psychology shares with all empirical sciences being prone to “transgress the bounds of sense” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310383077">Hacker, 2009</xref>, p. 136). However, some aspects of this confusion seem to be more specifically connected with psychology. Opinion of this kind has been famously expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310383077">Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953/1999)</xref>, who claimed that “in psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion” (p. 232). He added that although “the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems which trouble us … problem and method pass one another by” (p. 232). A similar point has, more recently, been made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310383077">Wakefield (2007)</xref>, who emphasizes that “in psychology … the level of confusion is higher than in many other fields” (p. 42) and suggests that it is particularly conceptual analysis that may be helpful to decipher the meaning of ambiguous empirical results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354310383077">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the above point is valid, then for a conceptual analysis there is much more to do in psychology than just to prepare the ground for empirical research. However, there is still the second doubt, the one concerning “bad” theories as a result of excessively theoretical investigation, that remains to be addressed. The simplest response that can be probably given is the one offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310383077">Wachtel (1980)</xref>, who lays great emphasis on the fact that “the wholly speculative spinning of yarns by certain kinds of clinicians and would-be gurus” (p. 401) is by no means the only kind of theorizing that is available for a psychologist. As an alternative to these confusion-woven and confusion-prompting speculative endeavours he proposes “the careful, tentatively speculative forming of hypotheses by individuals who have immersed themselves in the data currently available and have tried to find some coherence in the varying outcomes under varying conditions of observation” (p. 401). In short, one may conclude, there is a kind of conceptual work that is fully compatible with a reliable empirical study and which can serve to the advantage of both more promising and intelligible research and psychological, empirically founded, theory in general.</p>
<p>Interesting examples of empirically oriented and empirically fruitful conceptual work can be found in those parts of psychology that investigate domains shared, or once shared, with philosophy and/or religion. The historical and conceptual scrutiny of the ancient views of virtues, for instance, has recently become a vantage point for the project of character strengths’ and virtues’ classification proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310383077">Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman (2004)</xref>. This work can be cited as a perfect example of conceptual and empirical work going hand in hand because it not only directs its “conceptual eye” at the empirical results and theories obtained previously but also consequently applies it to the design of a new research programme. Conceptual analysis, as a result, contributes not only to theory’s critical assessment but also, and more importantly, to its formation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959354310383077">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The above discussion has attempted to examine the reasons why conceptual analysis, or exclusively theoretical work in general, seems to be a disgrace to the psychological family. Some of these reasons turned out to be of only local (proximal) or historical importance; some others, however, proved to be more essential in nature. Two of the latter have been subjected to a brief scrutiny. The argument for the reduction of all meaningful and non-trivial problems to empirical ones, being the first, though not directly questioned, was addressed by showing that even a strict operationalization project, if it is to become thoughtful and intelligible, leaves a lot of room for a conceptual analysis, which is especially the case in such a confusion-prone discipline as psychology. The second argument against conceptual analysis, in turn, was that this non-empirical method is preordained to produce speculative and obscure theories of the kind that one can find in philosophy and in some kinds of clinical psychology. The most reliable answer for this kind of doubt is that this apparently preordained result of conceptual analysis is by no means a necessary one. There is a kind of a conceptual work that can be both deeply ingrained in empirical results and beneficial to general progress in psychology.</p>
<p>The two arguments against conceptual analysis addressed above are by no means all the conceivable problems connected with this method’s application in psychology. Apart from them, for example, there is a salient question of the psychological presumptions apparently made by conceptual investigation and their relation to the accounts of modern psychology. The issue of this kind, however, cannot be reliably addressed unless the particular conception of conceptual analysis is proposed and its psychological presumptions are revealed. It is for this reason that its discussion will be postponed until the last section of the paper.</p>
<p>As a final point, it is worth noting that conceptual analysis seems to be a method of choice if one wants to directly address the kind of confusion and lack of clarity that is prevalent in psychology. It is for the reason that the problems concerned are by themselves essentially conceptual (discursive): that they are ultimately rooted in the disorderly application of notions or psychological discourse in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959354310383077">4</xref></sup> If so, it is a discursive awareness brought about by conceptual analysis that is the most straightforward way of resolving the puzzlement (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310383077">Hacker, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the discursive phenomena and conceptual analysis are many-faceted. More particularly, the kinds of conceptual confusion as well as the respective techniques of their analytic eradication may be very diverse. The species of conceptual puzzlement that will, first of all, be discussed in this paper is connected with a lack of awareness or erroneous awareness that a psychologist may exhibit in respect of the connections between his or her own specialization (paradigm) and other specializations (paradigms) within psychology and non-psychological disciplines interconnected with psychology. In order to avoid this kind of confusion and to dissolve it where it is already present, the method of connective conceptual analysis will be proposed.</p>

<title>Connective conceptual analysis</title>
<p>The technique in question can be considered as a kind of philosophical analysis. The methods of the latter, however, are very diverse. If understood as specific to so-called “analytic philosophy,” they are often, though not exclusively, connected with a <italic>reductive</italic> (<italic>decompositional, atomistic</italic>) <italic>project</italic> of the kind proposed by Bertrand Russell, George Edward Moore, and the “early” Ludwig Wittgenstein (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310383077">Beaney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310383077">Soames, 2003</xref>). The aim of such a project is “the resolution of something complex into elements and the exhibition of the ways in which the elements are related in the complex”: the reduction, “without reminder,” of the complex to the simple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 17). It should be emphasized at the very beginning that the connective conceptual analysis depicted in this paper is not motivated by any kind of such a reductive purpose. None of the specializations and disciplines scrutinized is presumed to be ontologically fundamental in a way that physics used to be in the classical reductive programme. Instead of this, a much weaker expectation of mutually revealing parallels and connections between the discourses analysed is made (cf. below).</p>
<p>The methodological stance of <italic>connective conceptual analysis</italic> (<italic>elucidation</italic>) proposed here had been inspired by “late” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310383077">Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953/1999)</xref> and further developed by philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle and Peter Strawson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310383077">Ryle, 1949/2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310383077">1945/2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310383077">Beaney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310383077">Sultana, 2006</xref>). As such it can be vividly illustrated by two pictures (metaphors). The first image, developed by Ryle, is of a <italic>conceptual geography</italic>, the purpose of which is to chart a map of a conceptual area, a map intended to help us to “get about.” With such a chart “we are less likely to suffer … intellectual and conceptual shipwreck” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 3). The second image, in turn, is of a <italic>conceptual grammar</italic>. As offered by Strawson it is built on the presumption that there is such thing as a “grammar” of our conceptual practice. Such grammar, though usually more or less hidden, can be revealed in the same way in which the grammar of our ordinary language is clarified by a grammarian, who not only shows us why our real utterances are grammatically proper but also makes explicit the rules that constitute the universe of all grammatically proper sentences.</p>
<p>The conceptual analysis depicted by the pictures of conceptual geography and conceptual grammar can be further clarified by a brief discussion of its formal properties. In short, it can be said that the method proposed is: (a) holistic, (b) descriptive, and, not surprisingly, (c) connective.</p>
<p>It is <italic>holistic</italic> in a sense that its preferred subject matter is a whole relatively integrated conceptual structure rather than a set of separately treated (analysed, explained) concepts. In terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310383077">Ryle’s (1945/2009)</xref> metaphor it can be worded as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Surveyors do not map single objects like the village church. They put together in one map all the salient features of the area: the church, the bridge, the railway, the parish boundary, and perhaps the contours. Further, they indicate how this map joins the maps of the neighbouring areas, and how all are co-ordinated with the points of the compass, the lines of latitude and longitude and standards of measurement. (p. 211)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Accordingly, all psychological concepts, “single objects,” are to be scrutinized as far as they are meaningful within their original discourse, in the context of their own “parish.” The discourses investigated, furthermore, are related to their “neighbouring areas,” their counterparts in the other psychological specializations (paradigms) and non- psychological disciplines.</p>
<p>The second feature of connective conceptual analysis is its <italic>descriptive</italic> character, by which it is understood that its purpose is to <italic>elucidate</italic> and <italic>clarify</italic> the conceptual structure of the psychological language without any attempt to explain or modify it. The full examination of a particular concept, more precisely, would involve revealing: its original (meaning-providing) application, the presuppositions (conditions) of its meaningful utilization, the connections of the concept with its “neighbourhood” counterparts, the discursive functions it plays as well as the pragmatic context within which it is usually employed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310383077">Hacker, 2009</xref>). Performed as such it would often “identify incoherences and implications of our beliefs and meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310383077">Wakefield, 2007</xref>, p. 41) and, hence, play a corrective role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0959354310383077">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overall meaning of the descriptiveness ascribed to connective conceptual analysis can be better understood when presented with the help of a Strawsonian grammatical picture. According to the image in question it was Queen Isabella of Castile who, when first Castilian grammar had been presented to her, asked what use could be done with it. After all, both she and all her mature subjects could speak proper Castilian without it. They simply knew it and it was for the very simple reason that “grammatically correct Castilian <italic>was</italic> what they spoke” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 5). What more, then, could have been learnt from a formal and explicit discipline of grammar? Must we really “wait upon future discoveries by linguists, logicians or philosophers in order to find out what we mean by the words we use and by the sentences we utter” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310383077">Hacker, 2009</xref>, p. 144)?</p>
<p>The answer given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson (1992)</xref> acknowledges the fact that “the grammar was in a certain sense of no use at all to fluent speakers of Castilian” (p. 5). At the same time, however, it also emphasizes that there is a sense in which these speakers did not know the grammar and, hence, could benefit from the work of the grammarian. This double-fold statement is a consequence of the more general truth that “being able to do something … is very different from being able to say, how it’s done; and that it by no means implies the latter” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 6). In case of linguistic activity, it means that the mere ability to speak grammatically, to follow the rules of the language, does not entail any automatic competence in stating these rules explicitly. An observation of a similar kind has been made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310383077">Gilbert Ryle (1945/2009)</xref>, who claims that “people can correctly be said to have only a partial grasp of most of the propositions that they consider” and, more specifically, that they can stay unaware of these propositions’ “remoter logical connexions” (p. 208).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0959354310383077">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distinction between an ability to use something properly and an ability to explicitly express the rules of such utilization is equally valid when the conceptual structure embedded in language is concerned. In order to acquire the “enormously rich, complicated, and refined conceptual equipment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 6) with which we usually operate, we didn’t need any systematic account. However, we might need one if we want to become aware of the conceptual paths we usually follow, to remind us of the ones that have been forgotten, and to discover the ones that are still waiting unused, hidden in our conceptual framework. And it is exactly the purpose of connective conceptual analysis to provide such a systematic account of “the general <italic>conceptual structure</italic> of which our daily practice shows us to have a tacit and unconscious mastery” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 7), to determine “the logical cross-bearings” (“logical geography”) of the concepts that we already properly apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310383077">Ryle, 1949/2002</xref>, p. 8). In slightly more general terms, such an endeavour can be understood as a “search for a theoretical understanding of what one is doing when one uses concepts in practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310383077">Sultana, 2006</xref>, p. 19).</p>
<p>The point made above as based on the image of Queen Isabella of Castile and the first Castilian grammar seems to be fully convincing for the ordinary language which is usually acquired and applied without any explicit theory. The issue, however, becomes more complicated when more professional discourses, like the psychological one, come into play. Accordingly, for the sake of the argument’s validity, one should distinguish between “pretheoretical or non-technical concepts on the one hand and essentially theoretical concepts on the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 10). In case of the formalized and theoretical disciplines, as a matter of fact, it is exactly a way of a direct and explicit instruction that is applied for teaching one how to apply the conceptual structure in question: “There are countless books and crowds of teachers whose function is precisely to introduce us to the key concepts of their disciplines by means of explicit instruction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>With this being the case, the question of the conceptual grammar’s benefits returns. It could have been needed for an unsophisticated user of the ordinary language, but how can it be helpful for an educated professional who can easily provide formal definitions of the concepts he or she operates with as well as the precise rules of their proper employment? While trying to address such an objection, Strawson points to the specific purposes of the theoretical education provided to professionals. He emphasizes, namely, that “the point and purpose of this route of explicit theoretical instruction … is precisely to enable us to operate effectively <italic>inside</italic> the discipline concerned, <italic>within</italic> this discipline” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>The first point that deserves to be underlined in his statement is the claim that the theoretical instruction provided by specialized disciplines is directed at the <italic>practice of applying</italic> concepts properly, rather than at in-depth <italic>conceptual understanding</italic> of them. This kind of instruction, in other words, emphasizes the practice of conceptualizing a subject matter in accordance with the internal rules of a discipline (<italic>the first-order discursive practice</italic>), rather than an ability to address the form of such a practice from an external, or only more distant, point of view (<italic>the second-order discursive practice</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0959354310383077">7</xref></sup> It is because of this kind of short-sightedness that a well-trained professional may remain relatively unaware of those aspects of his or her discursive practices that are expressions of his or her discipline’s hard or metaphysical core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310383077">Lakatos, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310383077">Watkins, 1975</xref>). Similarly, there is “no guarantee” that his or her education will automatically confer “on the instructed the ability to form an undistorted picture of the relation of the specialized discipline concerned to other human and intellectual concerns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 12).</p>
<p>Such intra-specialization (intra-paradigmatic) and intra-disciplinary biases might be especially impairing for more general and interdisciplinary attempts, which is especially apparent from the meta-analytical perspective proposed by Ryle. In terms of his geographical metaphor, we can talk about the people who “know their way about a locality” but are “quite unable to describe the distances or directions between different parts of it or between it and other familiar localities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310383077">Ryle, 1945/2009</xref>, p. 210), about the ones “who know their way about their own parish, but cannot construct or read a map of it, much less a map of a region or continent in which their parish lies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310383077">Ryle 1949/2002</xref>, p. 8). People of this kind, in consequence, can feel safe only as long as they use local and familiar routes; more distant trips as well as unusual paths can still lead them astray.</p>
<p>The descriptive task of connective conceptual analysis is to draw an accurate map of the “parishes” that are constituted by the discourses of psychological specializations (paradigms) as well as the “neighbouring area” of other, non-psychological disciplines. This map, in turn, is intended to provide a picture that is wider and more in-depth than the local geographical sketches usually offered by psychology. In short, it is “the continental geography of the subject” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310383077">Ryle, 1949/2002</xref>, p. 8) that is to be revealed.</p>
<p>The third formal feature of the conceptual analysis depicted here is its <italic>connectiveness</italic> or, in negative terms, <italic>non-reductiveness</italic>. In contrast to the most orthodox ways of understanding conceptual analysis, the aim set here is not to fully dismantle complex concepts into simple conceptual “atoms.” Accordingly, it is not presumed that there is a discursive level that is fundamental for the whole psychological language and that its counterparts can be fully reduced to it. There is nothing that is a priori given the place that behavioural (physical) language once used to have. As an alternative to such an atomistic perspective a more complex account is proposed. The concepts of psychological specializations (paradigms) as well as those of non-psychological disciplines are expected to constitute “an elaborate network, a system, of connected items … such that the function of each item … could … be properly understood only by grasping its connections with the others, its place in the system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 19). The analysis appropriate for this kind of conceptual reality is the one “of tracing connections in a system without hope of being able to dismantle or reduce the concepts we examine to other and simpler concepts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0959354310383077">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The network of concepts as the main image underlying connective analysis should not suggest that no order within a conceptual domain is possible (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310383077">Szubka, 1998</xref>). There are many conceivable hierarchies that are alternative to the one presumed by the reductive project and which are fully compatible with the connective model. Accordingly, while it is not intended to find any <italic>simple elements</italic> (<italic>atoms</italic>) of the discourses scrutinized, there is still a hope to reveal some <italic>basic</italic> (<italic>non-dismantlable, irreducible, fundamental</italic>) concepts, the ones that “enjoy some kind of priority in our conceptual scheme” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310383077">Szubka, 1998</xref>, p. 143). Concepts of this kind can be understood as ideas that are crucial in the sense that “the logical unravelling” of them “leads directly to the unravelling of some complex tangle of interconnected ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310383077">Ryle, 1945/2009</xref>, p. 221). As soon as these ideas are revealed, “the geography of a whole region is, at least in outline, fixed” (p. 221).</p>
<p>The idea of basic and irreducible concepts that are not at the same time simple is both tempting and difficult to make perspicuous. From a negative side it can be clarified by saying that a</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>concept may be complex, in the sense that its philosophical elucidation requires the establishing of its connections with other concepts, and yet at the same time irreducible, in the sense that it cannot be defined away, without circularity, in terms of those other concepts to which it is necessarily related. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, pp. 22–23)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The more positive and straightforward characterization of the way in which it is basic is a little bit harder to explain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Peter Strawson (1992)</xref> suggests that when “the ability to operate with one set of concepts may presuppose the ability to operate with another set, and not vice versa,” it is justified to claim “that the presupposed concepts are conceptually prior to the presupposing concepts” (p. 21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0959354310383077">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The last thing that should be emphasized is that basic concepts do not have to be recognized as such by a competent user of the language in question and that they do not even have to be often nominally referred to. If conceptual analysis points to them as being basic, it should be understood as “a kind of shorthand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1992</xref>, p. 23) for the claim that they constitute the deep structural core of the variety found on the discursive surface, the core whose elements represent the general types of the concepts nominally utilized. Such a claim seems to be quite compatible with the fact that we ordinarily have few occasions to utilize them. A psychiatrist, for instance, may not often explicitly refer to the notion of mental health in his or her everyday clinical practice. However, not only the particular diagnoses of mental disturbances he or she makes but also the whole teleological dimension of his or her professional activity would be unintelligible without this concept or its functional equivalent.</p>
<p>In order to summarize the above section, it may be said that the method proposed as a means of theoretical psychology is a holistic, descriptive, and connective conceptual analysis. When applied to the conceptual schemata of psychological and non- psychological discourses, it will aim at revealing the complex connections and parallels present both within the former and between the former and the latter. While not providing any new empirical knowledge, it is hoped to yield a conceptual understanding of “a coherent whole whose parts are mutually supportive and mutually dependent, interlocking in an intelligible way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310383077">Strawson, 1985</xref>, p. 23).</p>

<title>Hasn’t conceptual analysis already been (empirically!) refuted?</title>
<p>The last issue that will be scrutinized in this paper has been already mentioned in the first section and concerns the psychological foundations (presumptions) of conceptual analysis. More precisely, what will be discussed is “the Charge from Psychology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310383077">Sandin, 2006</xref>) claiming that these foundations have been empirically falsified. A clear and straightforward formulation of the charge in question has been made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">William Ramsey (1992)</xref>, who, in brief, states that “the assumptions which drive conceptual analysis are not empirically founded and clash with prevalent psychological theories of concept representation” (p. 59). It is this very formulation that was, subsequently, critically analysed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310383077">Per Sandin (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to reliably assess the charge made by Ramsey, it may prove useful to break it up into three, relatively independent parts. Namely, it seems to consist of: (a) a certain image of conceptual analysis; (b) a claim that analysis understood in such a way is based on a particular set of assumptions and justifications; and, finally, (c) a thesis (charge) that these assumptions and justifications have been refuted by the most recent theories of empirical psychology.</p>
<p>As far as the first element is concerned, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">Ramsey (1992)</xref> explicitly identifies conceptual analysis with an attempt to provide definitions that, firstly, are “relatively simple—generally a conjunction of individually necessary and jointly sufficient properties” and, secondly, do not “admit of any intuitive counterexamples” (p. 61).</p>
<p>Analysis of this kind, as Ramsey claims, is based on some particular and non-trivial assumptions concerning human cognition. These “lurking in the background” premises are: that (a) “there is considerable overlap in the sorts of intuitive categorization judgements that different people make” (p. 61) and that (b) “our intuitive categorization judgements will coincide perfectly with the presence or absence of a small but specific set of properties … that our intuitions will nicely converge upon a set whose members are all and only those things which possess some particular collection of features” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">Ramsey, 1992</xref>, p. 61).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0959354310383077">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>These assumptions, in turn, are in need of justification, which is reconstructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">Ramsey (1992)</xref> as follows. In the epistemologically modest version it is a weak, and slightly obscure, hypothesis that (a) “the representation scheme for concepts—whatever form it may take—yields intuitive judgements that correspond with small set of necessary and sufficient conditions” (p. 62). In a version that is “classical” and considerably stronger, (b) “categorization intuitions … are generated by underlying representations of necessary and sufficient properties” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">Ramsey, 1992</xref>, p. 62). In short, it is assumed that “we have tacit knowledge of the ‘essence’ of abstract concepts” (p. 62). Although Ramsey admits that “relatively few philosophers engaged in conceptual analysis explicitly endorse the classical view,” he still considers it as “the most plausible and charitable way to make sense of this enterprise” (p. 62) and, hence, makes it a direct subject of his forthcoming critique.</p>
<p>This critique, in turn, is based on empirical accounts of concept representation developed by modern cognitive psychology, especially an experimental paradigm rooted in Eleanore Rosch’s conception of prototypes. As a result of a short, though informative enough, review of these accounts he sums up that it is “safe to say that, with a few exceptions, psychologists today believe that the classical picture of concept representation is no longer in the running” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">Ramsey, 1992</xref>, p. 63): that “there is no simple, tidy collection of properties that is possessed by all and only intuitive instances of the concept” (p. 66).</p>
<p>The whole reasoning summarized above is presented as having very destructive conclusions for conceptual analysis itself:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he search for a simple, non-disjunctive definition of a given philosophical concept that accords with all of our intuitions and admits of no counterexamples is a hopeless enterprise—there simply is no such thing … any definition expressed in this way is doomed from the outset. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310383077">Ramsey, 1992</xref>, pp. 65–66)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0959354310383077">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If one wants to defend conceptual analysis from the charge made by Ramsey, which is the case here, one has to criticize as invalid, or more modestly confined, one of the three elements of reasoning made by him. The empirical data concerning concept representation gathered by cognitive psychology are serious enough, in terms of both quality and quantity, to be the part that is relatively strongest and, hence, not easily refutable. The first and the second steps of the reasoning, on the other hand, are arguable, especially if the conclusion of the whole argument is to be treated as concerning conceptual analysis in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0959354310383077">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>It must be emphasized that the image of conceptual analysis presumed by Ramsey is not applicable to all kinds of conceptual analysis and is simply inadequate as a description of the connective conceptual analysis proposed here. This method of analysis is not directed at providing definitions of the kind discussed by Ramsey. Defining concepts is obviously one of its standard procedures but the definitions yielded aren’t its final goal and don’t have to be organized around the necessary-and-sufficient conditions scheme. As a matter of fact, the majority of relations revealed by connective conceptual analysis are expected to be structured by family resemblance: that is, the very same kind of relation that is considered crucial by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Peter Strawson, on the one side, and Eleonore Rosch and William Ramsey, on the other.</p>
<p>A similar point can be made with reference to the second part of Ramsey’s argument, which concerns the assumptions allegedly made by conceptual analysis. Even if they are correctly identified in the case of some traditional forms of this method, as they probably are, they would be completely missed if assigned to connective species of conceptual analysis. This kind of analytic method does not, in fact, have to be justified by any particular account of mental concept representation. The concepts investigated, accordingly, can be considered as kinds of theoretical constructs utilized to describe and explain discursive practice. The concepts can be, more precisely, understood in the Wittgensteinian spirit as “no more than abstractions from the uses of symbols,” the abstractions “constituted by the sense-determining rules for the use of the words that express them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310383077">Hacker, 2009</xref>, p. 143; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310383077">Sandin, 2006</xref>). Concept-possession, respectively, would be “no more than mastery of the use of concept-expressing symbols” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310383077">Hacker, 2009</xref>, p. 142).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0959354310383077">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The aim of this paper was to propose the method of connective conceptual analysis as well as to provide the rationale for utilizing it as a means of metapsychological reflection. After taking a glance at the current situation in psychological academia, in which both conceptual analysis and any theoretical activity are not particularly well regarded, a few factors (reasons) that might have been responsible for this state of affairs were reviewed. Some of them turned out to be of merely proximal, institutional, and organizational or contextual character. Some others, on the contrary, appeared to be more essential and, hence, were subjected to a short scrutiny. It was argued, in brief, that even if serious, they are not conclusive of all conceptual analysis’ futility.</p>
<p>After this short introductory part the method itself was illustrated with the help of insights and images developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Peter Strawson (conceptual grammar), and Gilbert Ryle (conceptual geography). This was done both negatively, by showing that the technique in question is not intended to be reductive, and positively, by depicting its formal features of holism, descriptiveness, and connectiveness. These properties of the conceptual analyses proposed are supposed to make it especially promising for comparisons between various psychological specializations (paradigms) and between psychology and non-psychological disciplines related to it.</p>
<p>Finally, the so-called “Charge from Psychology” was addressed, namely the claim that the psychological assumptions allegedly hidden behind conceptual analysis are invalid. After the short delineation of the charge, as it was formulated by William Ramsey, it was argued that it does not affect connective conceptual analysis. This was because the method proposed by no means presumes the account of mental representation that Ramsey had assigned to conceptual analysis. Connective conceptual analysis, as a matter of fact, was illustrated as not being related to any particular position of this kind.</p>
<p>The overall result of the above discussion is that connective conceptual analysis seems to be a promising tool for any psychologist interested in general, conceptual, and paradigmatic aspects of his or her research. As such it may efficiently prevent empirical psychology from some kinds of conceptual confusion and, hence, contribute to its further development.</p>

<p>It is physics that has been, at least historically, referred to as a model of <italic>real</italic> science, as a psychologists’ paradigmatic super-ego. Interestingly enough, however, in this very discipline progress usually has resulted from a complex interplay between conceptual scrutiny and empirical research, between theoretical and experimental physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310383077">Machado &amp; Silva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310383077">Wachtel, 1980</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310383077">Lakatos, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310383077">Watkins 1975</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>The particularly high level of conceptual confusion present in psychology is, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310383077">Wakefield (2007)</xref>, “not accidental” (p. 42). With a reference to Foucauldian notion of power/knowledge, he argues that psychological, and social in general, research can serve purposes other than the unconcerned search for truth and is related to functions of mind other than the truth-seeking ones (self-esteem preservation and enhancement, adoption of cultural doctrines to allow intrapsychic cohesion and meaningful membership in a society and culture).</p></fn>

<p>This statement should not be read as entailing any strong distinction between psychological language (discourse) and psychological practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310383077">Woolgar, 1986</xref>). In fact, the Wittgensteinian perspective taken below directs conceptual analysis at language embodied, first of all, in discursive practices. It is for this reason that investigations of the kind conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310383077">Danziger (1985)</xref>—that is, focused on the assumptions hidden in psychological research methods—can be considered as parallel to conceptual analysis.</p></fn>

A natural scientist may be fertile of brilliantly confirmed hypotheses but at a loss to give a general account of the confirmation of a scientific hypothesis, or even of the general nature of scientific hypotheses themselves.
