<abstract>
<p>Recently, the demands for eco-friendly and effective energy systems have rapidly increased due to global environment problems. A heat exchanger is a well-known mechanical rig that has been used for a long time in many energy systems to reduce heat energy loss and to increase energy efficiency. However, till now, there have been few attempts to install a heat exchanger inside of an airliner engine. In such a case, the heat exchanger should be designed to be compact, lightweight, and highly reliable; therefore, the issue of the mechanical integrity of the heat exchanger becomes very important. In this study, we suggest a method by which it is possible to evaluate the mechanical integrity of a tube-type heat exchanger using global and local analysis. In the global analysis, fluid–structure interaction was introduced to get global behavior of a tube, which was used as boundary conditions in the local analysis. Also, local material properties near a brazing joint were measured using a nano-indentation test, and then they were utilized in the local analysis to evaluate clearly stress distribution around the joint. Through this study, a U-shaped single tube brazed on a manifold, which is a segment of a tube-type heat exchanger, was used as an example; its fatigue limit and stress concentration on the joint depending on the change of fillet radius were estimated by the proposed approach.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406212463845" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>For the past several decades, the temperature of earth has increased sharply, thus causing environmental issues. There has been a concomitant dramatic increase in the number of studies on highly efficient energy systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212463845">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212463845">2</xref></sup> In particular, considering that the regulation of greenhouse gas emission is expected to be enacted globally in coming years, products with low energy efficiency will probably be banned from use. Against such a backdrop, there have been various efforts to increase the efficiency of heat energy. For example, there are currently studies being conducted on how to recover waste energy in order to recycle it or to reduce the consumption of energy by improving the efficiency of combustion.</p>
<p>The representative piece of mechanical equipment that plays the key role in highly efficient energy systems is the heat exchanger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212463845">3–5</xref></sup> Heat exchangers have been used in power and heat energy-related devices for a long period of time. Recently, there has been a study that attempted to develop a heat exchanger capable of being used at high temperature and pressure (generally, about 1000°K in temperature and more than 50 bar in pressure); this study had the aim of improving the efficiency of an aircraft gas turbine in response to the rising demand for reduced greenhouse gases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406212463845">6</xref></sup> Important issues associated with applying a heat exchanger to a real aircraft engine include the selection of the high temperature and pressure resistance materials, the optimal shape design, and the mechanical reliability of the heat exchanger. The materials currently available for the harsh conditions are heat resistant alloys of inconel line or nickel line.</p>
<p>Heat exchangers are generally classified into plate-type and tube-type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212463845">7</xref></sup> These two types have varying merits and demerits, and each type of heat exchanger is utilized in diverse applications. These two types of heat exchangers should be designed and fabricated to have a function of blocking water leakage on the joint parts, as well as to reinforce mechanical integrity where permanent welded and brazed joints can sustain physical loads caused by vibration and repetitive pressure. Therefore, this study evaluated the mechanical integrity of the brazing joint of a tube sheet and a slender tube, which are regarded as the weakest parts in the tube-type heat exchangers applicable to aircraft engines. The narrow part of a brazing joint has a somewhat wide spectrum in terms of local material properties caused by the brazing process at a high temperature near 1050°C or more and the influences of filler materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212463845">8</xref></sup> Thus, it is necessary to develop a method that can evaluate the mechanical reliability in consideration of the local material properties of the narrow joint part. So far, many works to evaluate the mechanical reliability on ceramic component,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212463845">9</xref></sup> welding joint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406212463845">10</xref></sup> and brazed parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406212463845">11</xref></sup> have been suggested. However, in the jointed part by the brazing process, there are somewhat different material properties comparing to the base material. Thus, it is essentially required to study how to consider the local mechanical properties for more meaningful evaluation of its mechanical reliability, although there is not enough reports on the works until now.</p>
<p>In this study, we propose an approach to evaluate the mechanical reliability of the jointed part with considering local material properties using global and local analysis; first, we analyzed the overall mechanical behavior of the heat exchanger’s tube using the fluid–structure interaction (FSI). We then analyzed the local behavior around the jointed part using the overall behavior as previously analyzed using the FSI. The local material properties of the joint, which are necessary to perform the local structural analysis, were obtained by a nano-indentation test. In addition, we conducted an experimental evaluation of the variation of the local material properties depending on the conditions of the brazing process. Through this study, we compared the fatigue limit calculated based on the method proposed in this study and the fatigue limit that was calculated by the conventional method, based on the uniform material properties of the joint part.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954406212463845"><title>Selection of turbulent flow analysis model</title>
<p>In the manufacturing process, a bundle of slender tubes of a tube-type heat exchanger was brazing-jointed to the tube sheet. Therefore, the flow behavior around the slender tubes needed to be forecast precisely in order to calculate the pressure on and the deformation of the slender tubes. Then, tube life span and safety were evaluated. In general, in the case of high-speed air flow around a tube, there is a slipstream such as vortex and eddy that may affect the deformation of a tube due to the local change of pressure distribution around the tube. So, an approach using turbulent flow models is much suitable comparing to a case of laminar model use to predict the exact deformation of a tube.</p>
<p>In order to analyze the flow behavior of the slender tubes, this study considered three turbulent flow models that are widely used for flow analysis; we selected the most suitable turbulent model. The selection of turbulence models is dependent on what turbulent scales one chooses to model and what scales one chooses to simulate using unsteady Navier–Stokes equations. However, it is an unfortunate fact that no single turbulence model is universally accepted as being superior for all classes of fluid problems. Because, turbulence phenomena is instability that origins from interactions between non-linear inertial and viscous terms, and the interactions are fully time-dependent and fully three-dimensional. Thus, that is the reason why no model can express all kinds of flow with various fluidic materials. The considered models in this study included the standard <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ε</italic> model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406212463845">12–15</xref></sup> the shear stress transport (SST) <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ω</italic> model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406212463845">16</xref></sup> and the large eddy simulation (LES) model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406212463845">17–19</xref></sup> which are well-known basic models for analysis flow-induced vibration problems and have each characteristic as followings; traditional <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ε</italic> model is generally accurate in shear-type flows and well behaved in the far field, and SST (<italic>k</italic>−<italic>ω</italic>) is more numerically stable in the near wall region. LES model is known as useful to treat the smallest turbulent scales in a problem; however, its solution requires a large number of time steps to eliminate starting transients. However, there are many other turbulent models for solving special fluidic flow problems (please see Davidson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406212463845">20</xref></sup> to understand in detail the classification of diverse turbulence models.).</p>
<p>As can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212463845">Figure 1(a)</xref>, the analysis model for selecting a turbulent model was a single U-tube (diameter: 1.5 mm and thickness: 0.12 mm). The whole shape and size of U-tube are shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212463845">Figure 1(a)</xref>. The U-shape tube’s air flow field was 150 mm high (<italic>H</italic>), 20 mm wide (<italic>W</italic>), and 300 mm long (<italic>L</italic>). According to the boundary condition, an external air flow continuously moved in with a velocity of 14.45 m/s, as required by one of the design specifications of an aircraft gas turbine. However, the air velocity as design specification is not a fixed value and it depends on the kind of heat exchangers. A periodic boundary condition was given to both sides (<italic>y</italic>-axis direction) of the analysis model and the external air at the entrance was set to atmospheric pressure. Fifteen meshes along a radial direction were generated on the wall side of the tube; this is where the pressure data were calculated. Also, ANSYS ICEM CFD (version 12.0) was used for the flow analysis; approximately seven million elements were generated. In order to enhance the precision of the analysis, a hexahedron element was used around the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212463845">Figure 1(b)</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>To compare the three turbulent models of computational fluid dynamics analysis, the velocities of each turbulent model were compared at 0.02 s and on a 50 mm high point, which was 10 mm away from the <italic>x</italic>-axis of the first row of the U-shaped tube, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212463845">Figure 2(a) and (b)</xref>. The velocity of the <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ε</italic> model was found to be nearly constant, indicating that it was not appropriate for the turbulent flow analysis of the slender tube. Generally known, in the derivation of the <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ε</italic> model, the assumption is that the flow is fully turbulent, and the effects of molecular viscosity are negligible. The <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ε</italic> model is, therefore, valid only for fully turbulent flows. Also, the <italic>k</italic>−<italic>ε</italic> model has two main weaknesses to predict a turbulent flow exactly; it over-predicts the shear stress in adverse pressure gradient flows and it requires near-wall modification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406212463845">20</xref></sup> On the contrary, a velocity change along the flow direction was shown using the SST and the LES methods; this change was caused by the slipstream generated when air passed through the U-shaped tube. In the case of the SST model, a repetitive and slightly regular pattern of velocity distribution was shown; in the case of the LET model, a swirling motion of air was supplied when the air passed through the slender tube. Also, the LET model is known that it predicts turbulent kinetic energy well in the wake region comparing to other models.

</fig></p>
<p>For a quantitative evaluation of the turbulent model with the three reviewed models, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212463845">Figure 3(a)</xref>, data prepared by the previous study were utilized; this data showed the flow pattern around a straight tube using the relationship between <italic>Re</italic> (Reynolds number) and <italic>St</italic> (Strouhal number).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406212463845">21</xref></sup> In general, the flow pattern occurring around a tube can be expressed as a combination of repetitive periodic functions. Therefore, the frequency of a flow pattern can be identified through fast Fourier transform analysis. According to the preliminary data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212463845">Figure 3(a)</xref>, when passing a U-shaped tube, <italic>Re</italic> is calculated at 1435 (when air inlet velocity is 14.45 m/s) as can be observed from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954406212463845">equation (1)</xref>, and the corresponding <italic>St</italic> is roughly between 0.20 and 0.225. (In general, if <italic>Re</italic> is within the range 300 and 3 × 10<sup>5</sup>, <italic>St</italic> amounts to 0.21 on average.) As <italic>St</italic> is related to the value of the vortex shedding frequency around a cylinder, the flow frequency around the tube can be calculated using the <italic>St</italic> number

<p>Then, we compared the frequency values, which were obtained at the <italic>St</italic> number of 0.2–0.225 in the experiment, and were calculated in the FSI analysis with the SST and the LES models, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212463845">Figure 3(b)</xref>. The frequency range that resulted from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406212463845">equation (2)</xref> had a gap of approximately 3.6–8.3% with the frequency range value determined from the analysis, indicating that both values match well. When considering only the result of the frequency analysis, both the SST and the LES methods are seen to be acceptable to express the turbulent flow. However, in this study, the LES model is selected to express the complex turbulent flow, even though it takes a large computational time in analysis. In addition, in order to check the mesh dependency in the LES model, 1, 4, 7, and 10 million elements were generated in the analysis. As a result, it was determined that the velocity distribution and the flow pattern converged at the element numbers of seven and over one million (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212463845">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>According to the two-way FSI analysis, the deformation of the structure was found to be caused by the pressure of the fluid flow; changes of the fluid flow pattern caused by the deformed structure were simultaneously reflected in the calculation. Accordingly, an Eulerian perspective could not be applied, but it was possible to apply a Lagrangian perspective.

The same conditions as those mentioned previously in ‘Selection of turbulent flow analysis model’ section were given for analysis. As for the U-shaped tube behavior analysis model, local material properties and the fillet of the brazing part were not considered; the material was assumed to be identical to the material of inconel-625. According to the results of the analysis, the maximum displacement caused by a fluid velocity of 14.45 m/s was found to be approximately 63 µm; the maximum stress around the joint part was found to be approximately 9 MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212463845">Figure 5(a) and (b)</xref>). As time-transient analysis was applied, it was found that the U-shaped tube vibrated in the flow direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212463845">Figure 5(a)</xref>, <italic>x</italic>-axis direction) and that its amplitude decreased slightly over time due to the material damping coefficient. It is thought that if there were enough analysis time, the tube would go into a steady-state condition and its deformation value would converge to a specific value.

<sec id="sec5-0954406212463845"><title>Experimental verification of analysis model</title>
<p>In order to verify the analysis results of a single U-shaped tube, the experimental tools were prepared, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212463845">Figure 6</xref>. The same conditions as those applied to the analysis were used in the experiment. An acrylic rectangular-shape channel with a height of 150 mm, a width of 20 mm, and length of 1000 mm was set with a suction type blower attached to produce a wind velocity of 14.45 m/s on the specimen. A single U-shaped tube as large as that used in the analysis was fixed inside the straight channel and a high-speed camera (model: Fastcam SA-X, maker: Photron Co.) was installed to take pictures of the tube behavior, which was influenced by the vibration from the side. In addition, a honeycomb was installed to straighten the air flow; this straightening enabled the inflow of outside air to the specimen.
<fig id="fig6-0954406212463845" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Experimental setup for measuring the displacement of U-tube (in mm).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212463845-fig6.tif"/>

<p>Results comparing the displacement at the center position of the U-shaped tube during the time from 0 to 0.05 s are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212463845">Figure 7</xref>; this data were obtained with the high-speed camera. The behaviors of tube were taken under the speed of 1500 frames/s with the magnification of 10 times by an objective lens. The comparison of the analysis and experimental results showed almost the same vibration frequency. Nevertheless, the experimental results for the displacement between sections at 0.015 and 0.025 s showed a difference from the results of the analysis. Due to a tiny manufacturing error on the specimen and the experiment error, such as the unstraight flow of air, which was different from the analysis conditions, the experimental results showed not only the rocking mode (<italic>x</italic>-direction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212463845">Figure 7</xref>) found in the analysis results, but also a slight wagging mode (<italic>y</italic>-direction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212463845">Figure 7</xref>), therefore making these results different from the analysis results. In addition, it requires the further study using an imperfection model to define clearly the main factors on the both modes, rocking and wagging modes. However, as the maximum displacement in the <italic>x</italic>-direction, and the vibration frequency of the experiment, were thought to match well those values from the analysis, the reliability of the analysis was fully verified.

<sec id="sec7-0954406212463845"><title>Minute mechanical properties of brazing part</title>
<p>As for the tube-type heat exchanger, a bundle of slender tubes was connected to a tube sheet with a brazing process; at the time of connection, the local properties were different depending on the filler material and the high temperature of 1050°C. In this regard, these local properties and the fillet shape of the brazing joint should be accurately considered in order for precise analysis. The brazing filler material used in this study was Nicobraze L.M. (Wallcolmonoy Co.); its principal components include Cr 7.0%, B 3.1%, Si 4.5%, Fe 3.0%, C 0.06%, and Ni 4%. Under the conditions of the brazing process, a vacuum furnace was used to keep a tube at a temperature of 1050°C for 30 min; to cool down the tube to room temperature under the atmosphere of a nitrogen gas. According to the results of the vibrating test that was conducted to determine the mechanically weak parts of the U-shaped tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406212463845">Figure 8</xref>), the weak part of the slender tube was found to be the part adjacent to the brazing jointed part, where the fillet shape ends. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the mechanical integrity by considering the local material properties and the accuracy of the fillet shape.
<fig id="fig8-0954406212463845" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Photos of fractured or damaged parts in tube after vibration test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212463845-fig8.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>First, a hardness test was carried out to investigate the local material properties of the brazing jointed part. For the hardness measurement, a measurement specimen was manufactured by cutting the brazing specimen in half by wire cutting (see the right picture (A) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406212463845">Figure 9</xref>). A cross-sectional part of the specimen, with a size of 20 mm, was grinded in order to observe the brazing joint part. The hardness test used a micro-Vickers device (Mitroyo Co.). The hardness test was conducted on the inside of the tube cut at an equal interval in the direction of the joint brazing part in order to examine the distribution of the local material properties of the joint brazing part. As can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406212463845">Figure 9</xref>, the average hardness of inconel-625 reached approximately 280 Hv; the highest level of hardness was found at the brazing fillet part. Also, a tube sheet or a tube wall in direct contact with the brazing filler material was found to have a relatively high level of hardness, because chromium (Cr), one of the filler materials, permeated the inconel tube during the brazing process and caused precipitation hardening, consequently increasing the level of hardness.
<fig id="fig9-0954406212463845" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Magnified photo-image of the brazed part and hardness distribution.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212463845-fig9.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Grouping of the distribution of the material properties is possible through the hardness test. From the perspective of the slender tube’s reliability, it is possible to classify parts into four groups, such as base metal, boundary layer of base metal, boundary layer of brazing part, and brazing part. If there are big differences in terms of material properties among these groups, heat stress is likely to occur at high temperature. Or, cracks are likely to occur around the joint parts due to the mechanical load caused by the hardness gap. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the differences in the material properties of the joint parts by optimizing the brazing conditions (‘Material properties depending on the brazing conditions’ section summarizes the test results for component change, which depends on the brazing conditions).</p>
<p>The local mechanical properties of the joint parts were measured quantitatively; also, differences in local elastic coefficients caused by component differences were compared using the nano-indentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406212463845">24</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406212463845">Equations (6)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0954406212463845">7</xref>), offered by Oliver and Pharr, were used to calculate the elastic coefficient using the nano-indentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406212463845">25</xref></sup>

<p>Measurements were made using the same specimen and performing reparative tests five times per section. Due to component differences in the joint parts, the local elastic coefficient had a range between 211 and 252 GPa. It was found that, in general, parts with a high level of hardness had a high level of elastic coefficient. In the case of the slender tube, the part contacting the filler material had a high level of elastic coefficient. In contrast, another part in which the fillet ends had a discontinuity in terms of the elastic coefficient was highly likely to have material defects or a concentration of stress. Therefore, a lot of cracks were expected at the time of the vibrating test.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0954406212463845"><title>Material properties depending on the brazing conditions</title>
<p>The components of the joint parts were analyzed based on which change of components occurred in the different brazing conditions. This was investigated via scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. According to the analysis results, the inconel-625 of the base metal was composed of Ni (60%), Cr (22%), Fe (5%), Mo (10%), and Nb (3%). At the time of brazing, the base metal boundary part contacting the brazing filler material turned dark, which represented a color change vis-a-vis the original material; this was because Cr, the primary element of the filler material, permeated the twin place, which permeation was a result of the temperature rise during the brazing process. As a result, a Cr–Mo compound was created. This darker area had a higher level of hardness compared to that of the inconel-625 element, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406212463845">Figure 9</xref>. In order to determine the component changes of the joint parts according to the brazing process conditions, the highest temperature (1050°C), the one that had the biggest effect in terms of changes in material properties, was maintained for different times, such as 20, 30, or 40 min. The effects that the brazing conditions had on the component change were examined.</p>
<p>According to the analysis results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406212463845">Figure 11</xref>, when the highest temperature was held for 20 and 30 min, the inconel-625 slender tube showed significant differences of components for an area adjacent to the filler material (‘b’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406212463845">Figure 10</xref>) and an area away from the filler material (‘a’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406212463845">Figure 10</xref>). On the other hand, when the highest temperature was held for 40 min, which was enough time for the diffusion of the material components at the junction part, it was found that all changes of weight percentage of components were in the range 7%. Therefore, the component difference in an internal wall of the slender tube was very small, and, accordingly, the material property difference was thought to be small; this indicates that the highest temperature should be held for over 40 min under the brazing conditions. In addition, the maintenance time is thought to influence the local material properties and the mechanical integrity of the brazing joint part.

<p>In the previously described results of FSI analysis, the U-shaped tube provided enough information for us to analyze the overall behavior that originated from the air flow. However, it is necessary to consider accurately the shape and the material properties of the joint parts so that the precision stress can be analyzed for the local parts, such as the joint part of the U-shaped tube. Therefore, this study conducted local analysis of joints using the overall behavior analysis results from the FSI analysis; this approach can be classified as one of the global/local analysis methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406212463845">26–28</xref></sup> With the aim of considering the shape of the joints and the local material properties, the local analysis model was formed, including a detailed shape of a fillet. The total model size in terms of height was 15 mm from the tube sheet to the end of the tube, which was the part of the overall model of the FSI analysis. A local model was formed so that the length of a slender tube could become 10 times longer than that of a filter; as a result, a semi-infinite condition was applied. Hence, in the local model, it was concluded that the displacement boundary condition at the end of the slender tube does not have a direct impact on the stress. As for the split side, a structural analysis was conducted after the displacement, previously calculated from the overall behavior (displacement 4 µm in the <italic>x</italic>-axis direction), was input as the boundary condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406212463845">Figure 12(a)</xref>). To make another boundary condition, the tube sheet was completely fixed (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>-axes fixed). As can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406212463845">Figure 10</xref>, regarding the local material properties, the distribution of elastic modulus on the joint brazing part was shown, which was resulted from holding the temperature for 30 min. The brazing process was divided into six parts, and the same fillet shape was applied for all parts, with a radius of 1 mm. The number of infinite elements used for the analysis was divided in detail, with around 80,000 numbers, using quadratic hexagonal element with 20 nodes.

Also, in comparison to the maximum stress of 9 MPa, which was calculated in the overall behavior analysis (the previous global analysis using FSI, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212463845">Figure 5(c)</xref>) without considering the fillet shape and by applying equal material properties, the stress became larger by approximately 30.1%. However, when the local material properties were applied, the elastic coefficient became locally different. So, as can be observed from the picture on the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406212463845">Figure 12(b)</xref>, stress discontinuity occurred. Through the results, we can make a conclusion that the accurate evaluation of life span requires local analysis that considers even the fillet shape. It was also discovered that whether the material properties change or do not in the course of the joining process can influence the analysis results.</p>
<p>The fillet shape can be amended in the brazing process by changing the input amount of filler material. Hence, the amount of filler material for brazing can be decided based on the local stress difference caused by the change of fillet shape. In this regard, as can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406212463845">Figure 12(c)</xref>, the maximum stresses were compared according to five fillet radiuses (fillet radius, <italic>R</italic>): 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 mm. As for the analysis conditions, calculations were made for two cases. In one case, local material properties were applied with a brazing holding time of 30 min; in the other case, equal material properties of inconel-625 were applied. As for the initial displacement conditions, as can be observed from the previous analysis, a displacement of 4 µm in an <italic>x</italic>-axis direction was given. The analysis results show that the stress concentration became significantly less in fillets with radius of 0.7 mm and over, indicating that it is necessary to make the fillet shape over a certain size by properly considering the filler material quantity in the brazing process. The stress concentration of a fillet shape can be expressed quantitatively using the factor of <italic>K<sub>f</sub></italic> shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-0954406212463845">equation (8)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954406212463845">29</xref></sup>

<p>If the U-shaped tube is under repeated loading, fatigue failure occurs. The mechanical integrity of the brazing joint part was reviewed by comparing the actual fatigue limit with the stress that resulted from the global and local analysis at a flow velocity of 14.45 m/s, which is the given value by the design specification of aircraft turbine. From the experimental test of fatigue life span of U-tube, the fatigue limit of U-tube was obtained as approximately 300 MPa, and the prediction of fatigue life can be expressed as the following <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954406212463845">equation (9)</xref> based on the experimental data

<p>This study reviewed overall U-shaped tube behavior by conducting FSI analysis with the aim of examining the mechanical reliability of tube-type heat exchangers. The investigation of three turbulence flow analysis models found that SST and LES models were the most appropriate ones. In addition, the results of a comparison of the vibration frequency and the displacement of the U-shaped tube calculated from the experimental method were found to be well-matched with the interaction results. Based on the results of the overall model analysis, local analysis was conducted in which the local shape and material properties of the brazing joint part were considered.</p>
<p>According to the local analysis, when locally changed material properties resulted from the component differences caused by the brazing process, and the single material properties generally used were compared, there was a gap of up to 19.2% in the stress size. In addition, in the FSI analysis, compared to the case in which the fillet shape of the brazing part was not considered, there was a gap of about 41% in the stress size. Therefore, it was found that the global and local analysis is useful to evaluate the precise fatigue life span.</p>
<p>The components of the joint parts were analyzed in detail by applying various holding times of the highest temperature. As a result, it was determined that the dispersions of the components showed significant differences depending on holding times. Thus, over a critical period of holding time (in this study, about 30 min) is required in the brazing process. The results of examining the local elastic modulus, which is caused by the component differences, also showed a higher elastic modulus in the area of high hardness; there was also a dispersion between 211 and 252 GPa. In particular, a rapid change in the elastic coefficient of the slender tube was found at the part where the fillet ended. As a result of our attempts to determine the fatigue life span under the given conditions in comparison to the fatigue life curve, the fatigue life span was found to be shorter than the fatigue limits of the U-shaped tube, indicating the mechanical integrity.</p>
<p>Through this study, we newly proposed the prediction method of fatigue life of a slender tube with considering flow state and local material properties, and evaluated the usefulness of the proposed method. In the future work, a bundle of tubes will be studied to evaluate the deformation, stress, and fatigue life using the proposed approach. In the case of a tube bundle, a flow-induced vibration may be a main issue due to the small gap between tubes. Also, the local material properties in a brazing joint should be studied in the further work by changing the brazing conditions to get the mechanical integrity of brazing joint.</p>
