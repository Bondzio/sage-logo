<p>At one point, China’s leader Deng Xiaoping said that he would be satisfied if, after he went to ‘meet Marx’, people judged him to have been 70 per cent correct. Surveying the historiographical scene from the Communist heaven, Deng would find solace in Ezra Vogel’s monumental biography – a lucid, convincing, even passionate, narrative about Deng the reformer and Deng the human being, which, though it is for now banned in China, will surely win friends throughout the world for Deng Xiaoping and the country he had helped to transform.</p>
<p>This biography is an essential read for anyone interested in China’s recent history. Vogel shows how Deng, after Mao returned him from political oblivion in 1973, set out to restore order in a country paralyzed by the Cultural Revolution; how from early on Deng, ever the pragmatist, valued science over politics; and how he was drawn to the idea of bringing Western technology to China. Although, a victim of the power struggle – he was cast aside in 1975 – Deng resurrected these priorities once he returned to the centre stage two years later.</p>
<p>Vogel sees continuity between the policies of Deng’s predecessor Hua Guofeng and Deng’s own; he does not take 1978 as the great divide between chaos and reform. Indeed, many of Deng’s reform initiatives have deeper roots in the policies of the Mao era, not least China’s opening to the West. But Deng opened China’s doors much, much wider so that Beijing could learn from the United States, Western Europe and Japan. He sent trusted emissaries and students to the West. He went himself to take a look. He struck up friendships with foreign capitalists, entrepreneurs and scientists. For Deng, success was the ultimate measure of political correctness.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, China’s economy began to grow at astonishing rates. But overheating, over-spending, inflation and corruption worried the economic planners in Beijing. Vogel describes the conflict and coexistence between forward-looking enthusiasts who wanted more, and faster, and the conservatives who urged caution. The key figure among the latter was Chen Yun whom Vogel credits with providing much-needed stability and preparing the platform for further economic growth.</p>
<p>Some of the most fascinating passages in Vogel’s book account for Deng’s role in the Tiananmen tragedy. The author does not pull punches: Deng was responsible. He did not show ‘any hesitation in deciding to send armed troops to Tiananmen Square’ (625). For all his enthusiasm about learning from the West, Deng was unwilling to adopt Western democracy, seeing separation of powers as inherently inefficient and completely unsuitable for China’s conditions. Vogel is ambiguous about Tiananmen, for, in spite of China’s immense progress since 1989, many of the deep problems persist – none of them deeper, perhaps, than the government’s continued deficit of legitimacy. This may mean that it is too early to understand Deng’s long-term legacy. The uncertain ground of Vogel’s analysis may yet shift.</p>
<p>The ground may yet shift for another reason – the availability of sources. Indeed, one major shortcoming of Vogel’s book could not be helped: archival materials on the Deng Xiaoping era remain firmly out of bounds to researchers. Vogel tries to fill the documentary gap with careful reading of often self-serving Chinese memoirs, official publications (which obscure more than they reveal), and a smattering of documents at one time or another leaked or smuggled to the West. Vogel draws for evidence on his many interviews in China, yet he often deems the subject too sensitive to reveal his sources. Unfortunately, references to ‘party historians who have seen the relevant documents’ (146) and ‘knowledgeable officials in Beijing’ (150) make it difficult to judge the veracity of Vogel’s information or to draw sweeping conclusions from what, after all, may just be hearsay. In some cases, he avoids referencing altogether, as for instance, where he makes major claims about Hua Guofeng’s reformist policies (190–1).</p>
<p>Weakness of the sources makes for notable uncertainties in the narrative. For instance, Vogel is surprisingly sanguine about China’s ethnic problems. He claims that unlike the Soviet Union, which had been ‘annexing minority groups that were either actively or passively resistant to Soviet authority’, China ‘had ruled most of its geographical area for over two millennia’ (474). China historians may take issue with this claim, and perhaps disagree with the claim that ‘both Tibetans and Chinese see that the long-term trend is toward Tibetans absorbing many aspects of Chinese culture … while not giving up their Tibetan identity and loyalty’ (522). Here, Vogel’s oversight is not in that he overstates the harmonious present of the Sino–Tibetan relationship (though, curiously, neither Tibet nor Xinjiang feature on Vogel’s list of China’s current challenges) but in that he spends too little time on Deng’s policy towards Tibet, especially his response to the Tibetan unrest between 1987 and 1989.</p>
<p>To give another example, Vogel’s account of the Sino–Soviet normalization supports the myths perpetuated by Chinese propaganda. For one thing, he overlooks the tactical ploy on Deng’s part in initiating Sino–Soviet rapprochement in 1982 – in Vogel’s mind, this was all just a matter of reducing the Soviet threat, though perceptive observers at the time, including people like Michel Oksenberg, saw Deng’s manoeuvre as a (successful) effort to apply pressure on the United States by playing the Soviet card. Vogel then writes that ‘Gorbachev had agreed to all of the conditions and was coming to Beijing on Deng’s terms’ (610). In reality, from Deng’s three obstacles to normalization, only one (Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan) was removed by the time Gorbachev arrived in Beijing (for reasons that had nothing to do with China). The Sino–Soviet normalization was much more of a two-way street that Vogel suggests.</p>
<p>Vogel’s Deng is a likable, charismatic, almost American, leader who made China work. Indeed, as long as Deng was around, petty squabbles and factionalism of Chinese politics appeared secondary to the basic unity of purpose that Deng strove to promote. Deng was not above jealousy: he expected his pawns to save the king when needed, and he could and did sacrifice some of his closest allies to deflect criticism from his own persona. But these issues fade in comparison with Vogel’s assessment of Deng’s role and legacy, put forward in the form of rhetorical questions: ‘Did any other twentieth-century leader do more to improve the lives of so many? Did any other twentieth-century leader have such a large and lasting influence on world history?’ (690). Vogel’s book answers ‘no’ to these questions, raising Deng’s historical image to heights from which it will not be easily dislodged, at least as long as the Chinese archives continue to evade reform and opening.</p>
