<p>For 30 years or more, appreciative inquiry (AI), participatory action research, and other methods of inquiry which privilege the role of target communities in research have been developed and applied in contexts ranging from organizational consulting and community development to scientific studies. While practitioners of such approaches rarely shy away from meta-inquiry about their personal goals and biases, Sheila McNamee and Dian Marie Hosking have continued beyond this to consider the meta-theory itself and its implications for practice.</p>
<p>For the authors of <italic>Research and Social Change</italic>, post-positivist models incorporating uncertainty or propensity are not enough, because they fundamentally objectify the subjects of research and rely on the assumed superior knowledge of the researcher to produce new insight. By contrast, McNamee and Hosking propose a relational multi-centered model of research which privileges local knowledge and imagines the professional consultant or researcher as a partner in allowing self-understanding and mutual understanding to emerge organically. The authors, both practitioners and teachers of AI and other group processes at the Taos Institute, explore ideas of community, inquiry, transformation, value and evaluation, reflexivity and ethics, providing invaluable provocation, even to those whose methods and meta-theories are more traditionally academic. They emphasize that while some methods have more affinity with relational constructionism than others, any method, practiced with care and attention to co-construction with the local community, can be responsible or ethical in this way.</p>
<p>The authors reject universal knowledge construction as the principal motivation for research, preferring to privilege praxis and community development in their work. Practically, relational methods could be particularly valuable for those whose work spans research and helping professions, like social workers, but it also provides a revealing alternative criterion for anyone engaged in social research to consider their work in terms of meaning for its subjects.</p>
