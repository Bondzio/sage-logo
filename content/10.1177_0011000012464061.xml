<abstract>
<p>The authors responded to the commentaries on the Major Contribution, “Multicultural Clinical Supervision and Benchmarks: Empirical Support Informing Practice and Supervisor Training.” The commentaries provided a structure of consensus, critical questions, and requests for additional elaboration. The commentators advocated for the urgent need to move forward translating clinical supervision, a distinct professional competency, directly into training and practice in the United States. They also agreed on the essential multicultural framework and the imperative for empirical research to provide validation for the Competency Benchmarks as a developmental training schema. The authors also provided responses with regard to future directions for supervision and training parameters.</p>

<title>Response to Reactions to <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic> Major Contribution: Multicultural Clinical Supervision and Benchmarks: Empirical Support Informing Supervision Practice and Supervisor Training</title>
<p>We thank the discussants and applaud their thoughtful integration of the implications and data from the Major Contribution (MC) and the panoply of ideas for further research and practice. The responses expanded the discourse in a range of intriguing ways. Most important is the consensus concerning the importance of the attitudinal shift within psychology in the United States to treat clinical supervision as a distinct professional competency that requires specific standards and guidelines and that the MC will serve as a stimulus to galvanize change. Many of the comments follow directly from the lag throughout multiple levels of education and training of professional psychologists in the United States to affirm (a) that clinical supervision competence requires separate knowledge, skills, and <italic>attitudes/values</italic> and (b) that the complexity of supervision with its compound frames of reference and multicultural worldviews [client(s), therapist/supervisee, and supervisor] warrants both empirical and theoretical exploration. The commentaries supported our initial effort toward identifying effective supervisory practices, using multicultural, international, and diverse samples, providing preliminary evidence with regard to the Competency Benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012464061">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The commentators—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012464061">Westefeld and Rasmussen (2013)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012464061">Foo Kune and Rodolfa (2013)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012464061">Grus (2013)</xref>—identified several pivotal issues: (a) All commentators viewed the individual articles as a significant step in delineating common factors, essential components of effective supervision, or specific competencies requisite for effective supervision. (b) All commentators urged that the field enhance the valence of clinical supervision in psychology by infusing supervision comprehensively as a distinct competency into doctoral curriculum, clinical training, and professional practice in the United States. (c) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012464061">Foo Kune and Rodolfa (2013)</xref> questioned whether the Benchmarks are too complicated to be widely adopted and should be reduced to a maximum of six clusters. (d) All commentators questioned whether the developmental framework on which the Benchmarks are built is sufficiently robust to bear the scrutiny of empirical study and urged that such study must be timely, that is, designed to assess supervisee development and ultimately client outcomes. Failure to produce empirical evidence for the Benchmarks will fuel the status quo and, from their and our perspectives, negatively affect future generations of psychologists.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012464061">Foo Kune and Rodolfa (2013)</xref> itemized aspects of the data from the MC that correspond to the theoretical basis for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012464061">Bordin’s (1983)</xref> supervisory working alliance model. We suggest, however, that Bordin’s extrapolation from the psychotherapy alliance did not add the most salient distinction between therapy and supervision—the power differential and the resultant evaluation and gatekeeping required of the supervisor to ensure the safety of the client and the integrity of the profession. It will be essential for supervisors to be mindful of the power differential as a major factor affecting supervision and the supervisory relationship, which is further confounded by multicultural variables as well as privilege and oppression factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012464061">Yabusaki, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The commentators raised concerns about the definition of supervision, a controversial topic and a bellwether of the evolution of definitions that reflect the changing tides of supervision theory and pedagogy. Definitions of supervision have thus far focused on the relationship, power differentials, translation to facilitate empirical support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012464061">Milne, Aylott, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Ellis, 2008</xref>), evidence-based components, multicultural issues, and a critical tension between collaboration and hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012464061">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012464061">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2004</xref>). A consensual definition will be an important requisite for empirical study of clinical supervision.</p>
<sec id="section2-0011000012464061">
<title>The Competency Benchmarks and Beyond</title>
<p>To address these questions and issues, we digress briefly. Consider that in the Benchmarks document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012464061">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>supervision</italic> is mentioned/referenced 13 times outside of the specific Supervision and Teaching competency areas and is included in every foundational competency except Interdisciplinary Systems. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012464061">Foo Kune and Rodolfa (2013)</xref> suggested, part of the complexity of implementing the Benchmarks in supervision is the overlapping compulsory skill sets, such that supervision not only has its own set of competencies but also involves multiple constellations of competencies. For example, the Essential Foundational and Functional competencies of Reflective Practice/Self-Assessment/Self-Care, Relationships, Individual/Cultural Diversity, Ethical, Legal Standards and Policy, Interventions, and Assessment require the supervisor and supervisee to be highly fluent in the Benchmarks to both track effectively and monitor multiple competencies simultaneously.</p>
<p>For this level of integration, at least two things need to occur. First, the Benchmarks must be firmly embedded in all Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology graduate training programs in both didactic and fieldwork components, with ongoing self-monitoring strategically linked to the specific competencies, essential components, and behavioral indicators. Second, the professional and regulating bodies in the United States need to institutionalize clinical supervision competencies. From our perspective, doing both is obligatory. It is noteworthy that other professions and disciplines in the United States (e.g., American Counseling Association) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012464061">Borders et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012464061">National Association of Social Workers, 1996</xref>) and abroad (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012464061">British Association for Counselling, 1988</xref>) developed guidelines or competency statements for supervision decades ago. As professional psychology across the anglophile world has advanced guidelines and competencies for clinical supervision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012464061">Australian Capital Territory Psychologists Board, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012464061">Australian Psychological Society, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012464061">British Psychological Society, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012464061">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012464061">Canadian Psychological Association [CPA], 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012464061">New Zealand Psychologists Board, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012464061">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012464061">2010b</xref>), psychology in the United States is endeavoring to catch up. Concurrent with the Major Contribution going to press, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012464061">Campbell and colleagues (2012)</xref> released <italic>A Practical Guidebook for the Competency Benchmarks</italic> that delineates the use of the Competency Benchmarks Evaluation System (CBES) and implementation of the Competency Assessment Toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012464061">Kaslow et al., 2009</xref>). Evaluation forms are provided for the three developmental levels articulated in the Benchmarks (readiness for practicum, internship, and entry to practice, respectively) plus an evaluation form for interpersonal and relationship competencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012464061">Campbell et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012464061">Kaslow et al. (2009)</xref> will be invaluable resources for academic training programs, pre-doctoral internships, and post-doctoral agencies, as well as for the broader profession, as the field transforms forward with a competency-based approach to the profession.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012464061">Foo Kune and Rodolfa’s (2013)</xref> reflection on the various frameworks developed by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the Competencies Conference (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012464061">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>) raises a pivotal issue of the interface between regulatory bodies that address practitioners’ competence to protect the public and the training institutions that ensure the competence standards are achieved during the training trajectory. In essence, the task is to determine that which will be regulated by statutes (state licensure laws, ethical standards, and regulations) and that which will be governed by professional entities (e.g., APA, CPA) via accreditation, practice guidelines, and ethical standards. One question is whether it is possible to have one document that meets the needs/criteria for both. On a cautionary note, if supervision is to be combined as a competency with Interventions and Consultation as suggested by the <italic>ASPPB Practice Analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012464061">ASPPB, 2010</xref>) or simply contained under a rubric such as Education (Revised Benchmarks Clusters and Core Competencies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012464061">APA, 2012</xref>), we fear that the recognition and institutionalization of clinical supervision as a distinct professional practice will be diminished, if not lost. Similarly, if categories are combined and condensed, should Professionalism, an essential competency for supervisees, be combined with Ethics as recommended in the Practice Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012464061">ASPPB, 2010</xref>). By doing so, are we overshadowing professionalism and devaluing its distinct importance as a major competency to be achieved in the training trajectory? This question is especially of concern, as early unprofessional behavior in other helping professional training programs (e.g., medical school) has been significantly associated with later disciplinary actions by state licensing boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012464061">Papadakis et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, we should be mindful of the worrisome recent reports of faculty supervisor behavior in medical school training distinctly lacking in professionalism, or even respectful behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012464061">Fried, Vermillion, Parker, &amp; Uijtdehaage, 2012</xref>), and the growing data that supervisees often experience harmful supervision, connoting a distinct lack of professionalism among training staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012464061">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012464061">Ellis et al., 2009</xref>) who serve as major role models for developing psychologists.</p>
<p>The Benchmarks were intended to be a developmental training roadmap rather than a regulatory one, however, so that settings including doctoral programs, practicum, and internship settings would identify relevant portions for their particular practice area(s) and that the entire document would not be relevant for each site. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012464061">Rodolfa et al.’s (2005)</xref> competency cube, the Benchmarks could be transformed spatially to a geometric or multi-dimensional figure to address redundancy, reducing complexity. We share <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012464061">Foo Kune and Rodolfa’s (2013)</xref> concerns that the Benchmarks not be so reduced as to lose the behavioral indicators, essential tools with promise for enhancing the usefulness and reliability of monitoring supervisee development and providing supervisor feedback. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012464061">Grus’s (2013)</xref> thoughtful analysis of the history of competencies in supervision provides essential perspective for future directions.</p>
<p>To move into the competencies culture, with clinical supervision acknowledged as a distinct professional practice for psychologists, it is time for both regulations and guidelines for supervisory practice in the United States. A confluence of groups is addressing these issues; CPA, APA Board of Educational Affairs (BEA), and ASPPB all have had or are in the process of developing more specific guidelines for supervisory practice. The BEA charge to the Supervision Guidelines Task Force was to develop education and training guidelines for best practices in (a) the provision of supervision and (b) the teaching of a competency-based approach to supervision and to include consideration of supervision at various stages of trainee development (BEA, March 2012 minutes). The BEA Task Force coordinated their efforts with those concurrently under way by the Supervision Competencies Task Force convened by the ASPPB to develop a resource document for state and provincial boards of psychology as they develop their own regulations with regard to supervision and requirements for licensure as a psychologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012464061">Schaffer, 2011</xref>). The work of these two task forces will no doubt have a profound effect on professional psychology in the next decade, especially for clinical supervision training and practice and the movement to competencies.</p>

<title>Future of Training in Clinical Supervision</title>
<p>We appreciate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012464061">Westefeld and Rasmussen’s (2013)</xref> request for more specific strategies to integrate supervision into curricula and training. A significant area of future exploration is the development of empirically supported models to enhance effective supervisor training. Particularly, all the commentaries emphasized the importance of enhancing supervision competency in the academic pipeline. Given that <italic>supervision</italic> is mentioned only once in the current standards, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012464061">Westefeld and Rasmussen (2013)</xref> suggested changes to the APA Committee on Accreditation Standards, strengthening the requirements or suggested competencies for supervisees as they transition to serving as clinical supervisors:
<disp-quote>
<p>Domain B., 4. “In achieving its objectives, the program requires that all interns demonstrate an intermediate to advanced level of professional psychological skills, abilities, proficiencies, competencies, and knowledge in the areas of: (b) Theories and/or methods of consultation, evaluation, and supervision.” (Retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/about/policies/interns.aspx">http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/about/policies/interns.aspx</ext-link>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This analysis of standards prompts professional psychologists to question (a) how a clinician is prepared to become a clinical supervisor, (b) at what point an individual is ready to become a supervisor, (c) what the requisite level of clinical competence is, and (d) how professional psychologists assess the readiness of trainees to engage in the transition to becoming a supervisor, or (e) should it simply occur at a given moment in the training trajectory—either at the point of licensure or several years thereafter? An expectation for supervisors at the point of readiness for independent practice requires that the supervisor “articulates a philosophy or model of supervision and reflects on how this model is applied in practice, including integrated contextual, legal, and ethical perspectives” (Benchmarks, Supervision, A. Readiness for Independent Practice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012464061">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>, p. S21). It would be important to assess how many supervisors articulate such a model in their practice, and if so, if it is comprehensive across all the areas of the Benchmarks (e.g., Individual and Cultural Diversity, Ethical, Legal Standards and Policy). A developing trend is the reconceptualization of multiple psychotherapy-based models of supervision into competency-based structures to ensure adequate attention to the abundant complexities of supervision that differ from psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012464061">Farber &amp; Kaslow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012464061">Watkins, 2012</xref>). The preliminary framework of supervisor competencies in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012464061">Table 1</xref> was a product of the 2002 Competencies Conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012464061">Falender et al., 2004</xref>, p. 778).</p>

<p>We proffer that counseling, school, and clinical psychology doctoral programs should require self-contained coursework in supervision as supervisees desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012464061">Crook-Lyon, Presnell, Silva, Suyama, &amp; Stickney, 2011</xref>) rather than being superseded or combined with internship preparation, consultation, professional development, or professional roles. Ideally, applied programs in psychology will develop two to three courses: One will occur at the onset of clinical training to prepare the supervisee to be effective in that role and lay the groundwork of specific tenets of supervision structure, expectations, theory, research, skills, and process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012464061">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2012</xref>). The second course would address the transition from supervisee to supervisor and would occur after a minimum of two practicum experiences. In that course, the supervisee would be introduced to the perspective of supervisor, a significant cognitive shift, and would learn knowledge, skills, and attitudes to ensure effective supervision practice. Another option for the second course is a formal, structured, applied practicum in supervision to emphasize such training. Models include supervisees conducting peer supervision on less advanced cohorts or role-playing supervision with peers and an experienced supervisor during practicum supervision. In the third course, supervisees will have an opportunity to receive supervision of supervision—while they are supervising a less experienced counselor or therapist. Psychologists can work within academic programs to create opportunities for advanced students to supervise master’s students, receive supervision-of-supervision in an individual or group format, and receive academic credit for such work, thereby having such work reflected on their transcript. Each of these courses could be of shorter duration than a full term.</p>
<p>Singularly little attention has been devoted to the process of the development of the supervisor, most effective training paradigms, and assessment of the process. The most common training format is a 1- or 2-day workshop focused on skills and knowledge with some attention to attitudes. However, there has been inadequate formal assessment of efficacy, pre- and post-functioning of the effect of workshops on participants’ behavior and client outcome, although participant satisfaction with continuing education is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012464061">Neimeyer, Taylor, &amp; Wear, 2009</xref>). The lack of these data notwithstanding, there would be little argument that such training alone would be considered sufficient to qualify someone to be a therapist—yet this is the practice for clinical supervisors. Thus, assessment of the effect of various protocols of supervision training is an essential next step to identify effective multiculturally relevant training strategies.</p>
<p>It will also be important to train and supervise individuals post-graduate school who are performing supervision without prior formal training. In general, protocols include both short and extended courses ideally with a built-in evaluative component whether it be a test of knowledge or a follow-up video review. There should be movement toward formal assessment of the effect of supervision on client outcomes and supervisee development on benchmarks. Training would be geared to generally instilling the notion that clinical supervision is a protective factor and a component of lifelong learning and development as strongly urged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012464061">Westefeld and Rasmussen (2013)</xref> and practiced in other countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012464061">New Zealand Psychologists Board, 2010b</xref>). It is likely that until supervisors generally value and adopt lifelong learning paradigms, we will be stymied in our progress to a culture of competence.</p>
<p>The biggest shift will need to be in the attitudes/values concerning clinical supervision—its existence as a distinct professional competency. Supervisors must engage in transformational leadership strategies to achieve this outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012464061">Kaslow, Falender, &amp; Grus, 2012</xref>). What will follow are investigations of effective multiculturally competent supervision practices, how effective supervision is learned and taught, and how supervision outcomes can be effectively assessed. In addition, recognition will propel understanding that supervision is collaborative, providing supervisors the motivation to grow and learn from and with their supervisees in the process. Finally, we hope that more researchers will become inspired to investigate clinical supervision, therapist training and development, and competencies thereof.</p>
