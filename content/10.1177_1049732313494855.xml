<p><italic>Qualitative Health Research</italic> is undergoing expansion on two fronts by (a) introducing a new section, Qualitatively-Driven Mixed Methods, and (b) allowing for “article enhancements”; that is, expanded submissions and supplementary materials pertaining to an article placed in an accompanying digital file. Our goal is to make articles more comprehensive, significant, and interesting.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732313494855">
<title>New Section: Qualitatively-Driven Mixed Methods</title>
<p>With increasing frequency, <italic>QHR</italic> has been receiving “half” of mixed-method articles, with the other half—the quantitative component—presumably submitted to a journal that accepts quantitative articles. This leaves the editor wondering, “Did I get the best half?” And, of course, such splitting violates the purpose, comprehensive design, and conduct of a mixed-method study. More recently, we have been receiving qualitatively-driven mixed-method articles, with shy apologies from the authors regarding the quantitative components. Rarely do we receive articles integrating findings from multiple-method studies.</p>
<p>But authors had a problem: In a discussion with Donna Mertens, one of the editors of the <italic>Journal of Mixed Methods Research</italic>, I learned that <italic>JMMR</italic> decided not to publish qualitatively-driven mixed-method articles (QUAL-<italic>qual)</italic>, based upon the belief that authors had the option of submitting their qualitative manuscripts elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, <italic>QHR</italic> has come up to the plate. Julianne Cheek will serve as the editor for the new mixed-method section. Submitted articles must be qualitatively-driven designs, either QUAL-<italic>qual</italic>, or QUAL-<italic>quan</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313494855">Morse &amp; Niehaus, 2009</xref>). This is an exciting development for mixed methods and <italic>QHR</italic>, particularly at this time, when funding agencies such as PCORI (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) are recognizing the importance of patient-centered research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732313494855">
<title>Expanded Submissions</title>
<p>We are excited to announce a new “article enhancements” feature, which will allow authors to submit additional content related to their articles. This content might be video files, audio files, large data sets, or other important supportive data to supplement an article, and would be reviewed with the article (see the latest version of the <italic>QHR</italic> Author Guidelines). The additional material will be stored on the journal’s Web site and should be referred to in the article so that it can be accessed online. Authors who want to supply article enhancements should submit them with their manuscript and clearly identify them as such. Note that all such supportive content will appear as submitted (i.e., unedited), so authors will be responsible for the form in which it is submitted.</p>
<p>Also, for a number of years my dream has been for a multilingual journal, and now, by giving authors the right to translate and submit articles in other languages as well as English, <italic>QHR</italic> has the opportunity to become truly international. This element of the article-enhancements feature opens the way for translations to become a reality. Accepted articles must be submitted in English, but in a supplementary file authors may also submit another version, translated into their native language. Indeed, we have already accepted an article that will be published in English, with a Spanish version included in the auxiliary file.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those authors who specialize in arts-based research will be able to submit a video of their production, or photographs of their art installation, so that <italic>QHR</italic> readership can share the experience and properly engage, receiving expanded information from the submitted articles. Meta analyses and extensive reference lists or long tables from articles can be placed in the supplementary file, so that concern about article length will become less problematic. We are hoping to offer videotaped book reviews, including interviews with authors and comments from reviewers. How expansive and how exciting the auxiliary files become will be in the hands of our authors.</p>
