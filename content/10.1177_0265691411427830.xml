<abstract>
<p>This article explores the popular and critical reception of operetta in Russia during its European heyday, which broadly coincided with the transformative reign of Tsar Alexander II (1855–1881). It argues that the genre consistently drew audiences from most social strata and should not be considered, as some historians have suggested, a uniquely ‘bourgeois’ form of entertainment closely associated with the rise of the middle classes. It also argues that operetta crystallized a range of wider concerns about Russian culture and politics during the era of the Great Reforms. Many critics attacked operetta’s frivolity and eroticism (held to be inconsistent with the aims of art), while radicals and conservatives regarded it as symptomatic of a new climate of political uncertainty (the former with hope, the latter with trepidation). The critical responses to operetta thus testified to its popularity and to the rapidity of change in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s.</p>

<p>During the second half of the nineteenth century, operetta was one of the most popular forms of commercial theatrical entertainment throughout the capital cities of Europe. Operettas were ‘little’ or ‘light’ operas, especially as represented by the works of Jacques Offenbach, Johann Strauss Jr and Franz Lehár (among many others). They were ‘little’ because ordinarily they consisted of one act, and ‘light’ because they eschewed serious themes and, in contrast to many grand operas, guaranteed happy endings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691411427830">1</xref></sup> The genre was effectively pioneered and primarily symbolized by Offenbach, a German-born composer based in Paris, who presided over its startling success following the premiere of his <italic>Orpheus in the Underworld</italic> at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens in 1858. From the early 1870s, under the musical leadership of Strauss, Vienna began to rival Paris as the pre-eminent operetta metropolis. Strauss himself composed the first full-length Viennese operetta, <italic>Indigo and the Forty Thieves</italic>, which premiered in 1871 at the Theater an der Wien. Other centres of popularity for the genre included Berlin, Budapest and London, where the works of Gilbert and Sullivan soon began to reinforce the repertoire. Despite its obvious affinities with opera, not least the centrality of music, operetta was more closely associated with the dramatic stage. As Richard Traubner pointed out, ‘From their very inception in mid-nineteenth-century Paris, operettas were intended as entertainments not for opera houses… but for boulevard theatres, for popular consumption’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691411427830">2</xref></sup> They were primarily theatrical rather than musical, and they were performed by actors rather than professional singers, some of whom, such as Hortense Schneider in Paris and Marie Geistinger in Vienna, became major celebrities.</p>
<p>Operetta, despite its close associations with boulevard theatre, proved popular with most strata of society, especially the middle classes. Offenbach’s satirical jibes at the official world of the Second Empire earned him the adulation of French high society and in 1861, notwithstanding his political irreverence, he was even made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691411427830">3</xref></sup> Operetta was enthusiastically patronized by the middle classes of Habsburg Vienna and Budapest, where the works of Strauss helped to restore a degree of pride following the military humiliation of 1866. It has even been suggested that its popularity assisted in the ‘formation of a common mass culture’ in the multinational empire, ‘thereby contributing to cultural integration’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691411427830">4</xref></sup> Such was the vogue for operetta during its early years that even Europe’s political leaders were compelled to demonstrate a fashionable interest. In 1867, during the International Exposition in Paris, performances of Offenbach’s <italic>The Grand Duchess of Gérolstein</italic> were attended by, among others, Louis Napoleon, Thiers, Bismarck, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. All were attracted, at least in part, by Schneider, then Europe’s leading operetta diva, who dazzled audiences with her performances as the Grand Duchess.</p>
<p>In the midst of its widespread popularity, operetta was not without its detractors, of course, who included some prominent writers and composers. Émile Zola complained that it reeked of vice and vacuity and concluded that ‘operetta is a public enemy that should be strangled behind the prompter’s box, like an evil creature’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691411427830">5</xref></sup> Hector Berlioz was unable to conceal his contempt for Offenbach, whose works he regarded as a debasement of art. Like some critics, the composer objected to <italic>Orpheus in the Underworld</italic>, a parody of Greek mythology laden with satirical references to contemporary politics and society, because it demeaned Gluck’s <italic>Orfeo ed Euridice</italic>, and he described Offenbach as a ‘pretentious ass’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691411427830">6</xref></sup> Richard Wagner was more scathing, describing Offenbach’s music as ‘a dung-heap on which all the swine in Europe wallowed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691411427830">7</xref></sup> After the Franco-Prussian War, Offenbach was even accused of hastening the demise of the Second Empire at the hands of Prussia by fomenting mass frivolity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691411427830">8</xref></sup> The authorities, moreover, had mixed feelings about the genre and its potential impact. The Habsburg censors, for instance, described Strauss’s <italic>Indigo</italic>, based on the story of <italic>Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</italic>, as ‘trash’ that was ‘not suited to fulfil the responsibilities of the stage – as an educational institution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691411427830">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet operetta also had its advocates among Europe’s cultural elite. Not all ‘serious’ composers regarded the genre as unworthy of their attention, and a few, notably Camille Saint-Saëns and Léo Delibes, wrote their own operettas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691411427830">10</xref></sup> Gioacchino Rossini was so impressed by Offenbach’s early work that he labelled him ‘the Mozart of the Champs-Elysées’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691411427830">11</xref></sup> Friedrich Nietzsche, who also dabbled in musical composition, remarked that Offenbach, ‘this most gifted and high-spirited satyr’, had a greater claim to the title of ‘genius’ than the ‘heavy and ponderous’ Wagner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691411427830">12</xref></sup> August Strindberg wrote approvingly of Offenbach’s works, which ‘ridiculed outmoded Western civilization’ and ‘taught him to laugh at idols’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691411427830">13</xref></sup> Thus, operetta as a genre, and Offenbach in particular, clearly divided critical opinion, further testimony to its broad impact, especially between the 1850s and 1880s.</p>
<p>The Russian empire during the reign of Tsar Alexander II (1855–1881) proved no exception to the Europe-wide mania for operetta. The burgeoning urban population of the Great Reforms period (1860s–1870s) eagerly consumed the latest spectacles to emanate from the Second Empire and elsewhere, and the tsar himself attended performances at the 1867 International Exposition in Paris.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691411427830">14</xref></sup> Yet historians have paid relatively little attention to the emergence and status of operetta in Russia during the genre’s heyday.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691411427830">15</xref></sup> Why was operetta popular in Russia? Did it reflect the emergence of a middle-class culture? What was the critical reception, and what does this say about Russia during the period? In exploring these questions, this article suggests that operetta was not uniquely associated with any one social class, and that it crystallized a range of wider concerns about Russian culture and politics during the transformative years of Alexander II’s reign. Many critics attacked what they regarded as its unabashed frivolity and moral dubiety (held to be inconsistent with the aims of art), while radicals and conservatives regarded it as symptomatic of a new climate of political uncertainty (the former with hope, the latter with trepidation). Such responses, taken together, provide an insight into how commentators grappled with the implications of the sudden proliferation of commercial entertainment, and, in particular, how it was closely linked in their minds with the condition and future of Russia in general.</p>
<p>In this respect, the period from the 1860s to the 1870s was distinctive. Although the commercial popularity of operetta became increasingly pronounced during the subsequent decades – reflecting the expanding audience for urban entertainments and the proliferation of theatrical ventures, especially after the abolition of the state theatre monopoly in 1882 – it no longer acted as such a provocative focal point for the expression of anxieties about the wider circumstances of Russian politics and society, in contrast to the initial years of its popularity. This was evident in the changing character of contemporaneous discussion about operetta, which, from the 1880s, began to focus more exclusively on operetta as an art form. Much of the criticism now contended that operetta had gone into decline and that the earlier period was its ‘golden age’. The explanation for this contrast in the commentary is two-fold. First of all, operetta was still a novelty in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s and its capacity to excite and scandalize had not yet diminished. By the mid-1880s, however, it was a familiar feature of the theatrical landscape and many regarded its flowering as over.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691411427830">16</xref></sup> Secondly, operetta’s introduction to Russia coincided with a period of relative liberalization in the country’s politics and society, and many of the critical responses to the genre reflected a range of anxieties occasioned by these changes. As the reform era passed, however, the commentary no longer mirrored the wider context in the manner that had been previously evident. It is suggested here, therefore, that the trenchant nature of early responses to operetta were conditioned not only by its novelty, but also by the climate of the reform period.</p>
<p>The word ‘operetta’ can be found in Russian sources from at least the late eighteenth century,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691411427830">17</xref></sup> but until the 1850s it was used only as an occasional synonym for vaudeville and comic opera.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691411427830">18</xref></sup> Thereafter, as the term entered common Russian vocabulary, it was used in what had become its familiar modern sense, namely to describe the ‘little’ and ‘light’ operas that were increasingly popular throughout Europe. Operetta in Russia, as elsewhere, was confined almost exclusively to the dramatic stage,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691411427830">19</xref></sup> and this is reflected, for instance, in the fact that most histories of Russian music generally ignore the genre.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691411427830">20</xref></sup> There were no original Russian operettas until the Soviet period, but the imported repertoire was normally ‘russified’. Librettos were translated into Russian and plots were peppered with references to topical issues and local characters, although, as Moisei Iankovskii observed, the russified versions lost much of their original satirical content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691411427830">21</xref></sup> The impresario Mikhail Lentovsky (see below) introduced a uniquely Russian element to many of the operettas that he produced, namely the ‘Gypsy style’ – the inclusion of songs with Gypsy melodies and dances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691411427830">22</xref></sup> Ivan Turgenev completed four operetta librettos, in French, between 1867 and 1871, which were set to music by his close friend Pauline Viardot and performed to some acclaim in Baden-Baden (where the writer now lived) and other parts of Europe, though not in Russia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691411427830">23</xref></sup> The librettos were typical of the operetta genre, combining exotic characters and fabulous realms with buffoonery.</p>
<p>Operetta initially established itself at the state-subsidized Imperial drama theatres of St Petersburg: the Mikhailovsky, where a French troupe performed, and the Alexandrinsky, where Russian-language drama was based. It was especially prominent in their repertoires from the late 1860s to the mid-1870s. The first performance of a full operetta took place in 1859 when the French troupe staged <italic>Orpheus in the Underworld</italic>; but the critical reception was lukewarm and operetta largely disappeared from the capital’s stages for the next six years. In 1865, the drama troupe based at the Alexandrinsky mounted a production of <italic>Orpheus in the Underworld</italic> (in a translation by Victor Krylov), and such was its success that it was performed 32 times in four months, a long run by the standards of the Russian stage at that time. The French troupe reintroduced operetta to its repertoire in 1866 when it staged Offenbach’s <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic>, another parody of a classical Greek tale, for a benefit night.</p>
<p>Operetta developed into something of an obsession for St Petersburg’s theatrical audiences after October 1868, when Russia’s first operetta diva, Vera Lyadova (1839–1870), performed the title role in <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic> to great acclaim at the Alexandrinsky.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691411427830">24</xref></sup> From then on, the genre dominated the repertoires of the Imperial stages until 1874. The number of operetta performances at the Alexandrinsky during that period, for example, greatly surpassed those of the most frequently staged plays, Nikolai Gogol’s <italic>The Government Inspector</italic> and Alexander Griboedov’s <italic>Woe from Wit</italic>. The most popular by far was <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic>, while other Offenbach favourites such as <italic>Orpheus in the Underworld</italic> and <italic>La Périchole</italic> were also regularly performed, as was Franz von Suppé’s <italic>Zehn Mädchen und kein Mann</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691411427830">25</xref></sup> After 1874 there were no further operetta premieres at the Alexandrinsky or the Mikhailovsky. This was partly because, notwithstanding the enthusiasm of the performers, the Russian and French drama troupes proved ill-suited to the musical execution of operetta, a fact that became increasingly apparent after the initial outpouring of interest in the genre had waned. But it was also because two private commercial theatres in St Petersburg, the Bouffe and the Berg, proved more adept at staging operetta. Competition from the Bouffe in particular highlighted the inadequacies of Imperial theatre performances, and it soon became the main seat of operetta in the capital until its demise in 1878.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691411427830">26</xref></sup> Operetta was available not only to the patrons of the Alexandrinsky, the Mikhailovsky, the Berg, and the Bouffe. Extracts from popular works were performed regularly in the capital’s <italic>cafés-chantants</italic> and summer pleasure gardens, notably the suburban Minerashki, serving to extend the genre’s appeal to a broader public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691411427830">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Moscow, the pattern was similar. Operetta initially gained prominence at the state-subsidized Malyi drama theatre, where it dominated the repertoire from 1865 to 1874.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691411427830">28</xref></sup> Subsequently, private commercial ventures became the main centres of operetta production. The enterprises of Mikhail Lentovsky were especially prominent. Lentovsky, an accomplished operetta performer and actor at the Malyi, organized stage performances in various locations throughout Moscow. In 1878 he rented the Solodovnikovsky Passazh Theatre, which he renamed the Bouffe, for performances of variety and operetta. The stage curtain, according to Iankovskii, was emblazoned with the names of Offenbach, Charles Lecocq and Franz von Suppé, among others, in celebration of operetta.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691411427830">29</xref></sup> For the next two decades, Lentovsky entertained Muscovites with a wide variety of theatrical ventures (the most durable of which was the Hermitage summer garden) in which operetta always played a prominent part. As an impresario, he also cultivated new stars of Russian operetta, notably Vera Zorina and V. I. Rodon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691411427830">30</xref></sup> Lentovsky’s enterprises also inspired the young Konstantin Stanislavsky, who later co-founded the Moscow Art Theatre, to dabble in amateur operetta, including a production of <italic>The Mikado</italic> in April 1887.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691411427830">31</xref></sup> From the early 1870s, operetta also began to conquer Russia’s provincial stages, where it remained popular well into the twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691411427830">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why did operetta become such a popular form of entertainment in Russia? In an obvious but important sense, operetta was popular among audiences simply because Russia’s urban entertainment tastes did not differ significantly from those of the rest of Europe. Russian town-dwellers, especially the upper classes of St Petersburg, had been consuming West European, notably French, culture since the early eighteenth century, and the fashion for operetta was merely an extension of that interest. The triumph of operetta in Paris was familiar to the readers of Russian newspapers, who diligently followed the culture and politics of Europe’s major capital cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691411427830">33</xref></sup> It was no coincidence that operetta was introduced to Russian audiences at the relatively exclusive Imperial theatres, where patrons idolized the latest Gallic fashions. The success of the genre in Russia, however, was not simply a function of Francophilia. During the 1870s, French operetta was popular throughout Europe because the French produced a large number of accomplished works. Later in the century, when the Viennese school conquered the continent’s theatrical capitals, Russian audiences consumed it with equal ardour.</p>
<p>There were, however, more specific contextual factors which facilitated the spread of ‘operettamania’ in Russia. The Great Reforms of Alexander II, which began with the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and went on to address areas such as local government, the judicial system, education, and the army, included a relaxation of censorship regulations from 1865.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691411427830">34</xref></sup> This made it easier for the press and the stage to comment on current affairs without fear of official reprisal, and this partly explains why it was possible to stage operetta, which was known, at least in France, for its satirical and political edge. Although operetta in Russia was largely stripped of such content, performances nevertheless included references to topical events, and even if it remained difficult to criticize the authorities directly, the general climate of reform emboldened society and encouraged an unprecedented degree of collective dissoluteness (paralleled in the radical political sphere, for example, by the growth of nihilism amongst students) which helped to popularize operetta. Certainly operetta’s success was associated in the minds of some contemporaries with a temporary liberation from the autocracy’s stultifying influence on cultural life. The playwright and critic P. M. Iartsev alluded to this association in a melodramatic but illuminating comment in 1901:<disp-quote>
<p>In the epoch of the 1870s, during the quickening disappointment in the age of reform, and in the agonizing foresight of an approaching retribution, Russian society lived life like a spendthrift, squandering its last pennies. Weakening nerves required something sharp, provocative, and the magnificent flower of operetta blossomed on the Russian stage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691411427830">35</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The spread of operetta across Europe during the second half of the nineteenth century has been closely linked by historians to the rise of bourgeois culture. The genre’s popularity is held to reflect economic growth, urbanization, and the consequent commercialization of entertainment (since it successfully catered to the new public’s tastes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691411427830">36</xref></sup> These factors were increasingly present in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s, and they point to another contextual factor that might explain the popularity of operetta. The Great Reforms contributed to an unprecedented animation of Russian society and the development of public life. The professional classes (such as physicians, teachers and lawyers) developed rapidly, while the growth of commerce and industry fostered a new business elite and contributed to the expansion of the urban population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691411427830">37</xref></sup> For Soviet historians, the rapid flowering of operetta in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s was not an accident but a function of the Great Reforms and the associated emergence of a new middle class. One historian regarded the genre as ‘the newest, patented product of bourgeois jubilation and of the “internal liberation” of the bourgeoisie of the 1860s and 1870s’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691411427830">38</xref></sup> and the standard history of the Russian theatre identified a close similarity between the ‘triumph of the bourgeoisie’ in France during the reign of Louis Napoleon and the ‘growth of bourgeois consciousness’ in Russia during the era of the Great Reforms. This, it was suggested, accounted for the ‘operetta epidemic’ in Paris, St Petersburg and Moscow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691411427830">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>To what extent, then, was operetta in Russia associated with the appearance of a new socio-economic group? In order to answer this question, it is necessary to consider the nature of the audience. There is a general consensus that, during the 1860s and 1870s, Russian theatre audiences were becoming more variegated as a consequence of population growth. The abolition of serfdom and the development of trade and commerce facilitated a steady increase in the size of the urban population. It has been estimated that between 1860 and 1897, the total population of the empire grew from 74.1 million to 126.4 million. Between 1863 and 1897, the population of St Petersburg increased from 539,500 to 1,264,900 and during the same period the number of Moscow’s inhabitants went up from 462,500 to 1,038,600.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691411427830">40</xref></sup> Thus, the urban pool of potential theatre-goers was greatly augmented, which in turn helped to stimulate the growth of the theatre industry. One historian has suggested that, as demographic changes took hold, theatre’s dependence on the nobility began to weaken, even in St Petersburg.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691411427830">41</xref></sup> Iankovskii painted a slightly more specific picture: ‘The bourgeois, the educated man of non-noble origin [<italic>raznochinets</italic>], the average bureaucrat – these were the new consumers of the theatrical product’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691411427830">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is very little information about who, in particular, patronized operetta, but the evidence from individual theatres suggests that it appealed to different social classes. In St Petersburg, operetta was popular at the Mikhailovsky, which had a largely aristocratic audience, yet it was also prominent in the repertoire of the Alexandrinsky, which attracted a more diverse audience, including merchants and <italic>sibirki</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691411427830">43</xref></sup> One reviewer described the audience at a Bouffe performance: ‘Bare shoulders, low-necked waistcoats, colossal yellow chignons, English-style hair partings, curly wigs, smoothly shining bald patches, ringlets, moustaches, beards, side-whiskers, whitewash, rouge, powder and cold cream’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691411427830">44</xref></sup> According to Iankovskii, this was a profile of St Petersburg’s operetta patrons at the beginning of the 1870s: ‘It is the aristocracy, military and non-military, it is the apex of the high-ranking in the capital’, which never went to operetta productions at the Alexandrinsky but never liked to miss a high-profile premiere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691411427830">45</xref></sup> In Moscow, the audience of the Imperial Malyi was not dissimilar to that of the Alexandrinsky, and Lentovsky’s popular ventures in the late 1870s were designed to make theatrical fare, including operetta, available to ordinary people.</p>
<p>It is important, however, not to exaggerate the novelty of audience diversity in the 1860s and 1870s. Evidence for earlier in the century suggests similar levels of variety. One scholar described the early nineteenth-century St Petersburg auditoriums as follows: ‘arm-chairs [<italic>kresla</italic>] for high officials and members of the court, a standing parterre for middling bureaucrats and “bourgeois”, a gallery for the crowd, loges for ladies and their companions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691411427830">46</xref></sup> The parterre tended to include the intelligentsia, journalists, guards officers and a variety of younger people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691411427830">47</xref></sup> In 1845, the radical writer and dramatist Nikolai Nekrasov described the audience of the Alexandrinsky’s upper gallery as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The collar of a caretaker, the beard of an illiterate bricklayer, the red nose of a household servant, the green eyes of your cook, the unshaven chin of a sacked clerk, occupying himself with visiting particular households, red, growing fat from grease, soggy from perspiration, the head of a stout chef; the pretty little face of a shop assistant, whom you often meet on Nevsky Prospect; next to her the face of a retired soldier … <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691411427830">48</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Since audiences were already quite diverse during the first half of the nineteenth century, it seems reasonable to conclude that the most notable change in the audience during the 1860s and 1870s was its overall size rather than its social composition.</p>
<p>There is little evidence, therefore, that operetta appealed to one particular stratum of the growing urban population. Audiences were already diverse, and different social strata patronized the various theatrical establishments where operetta enjoyed its greatest successes. Consequently, in terms of audience interest and demand, the popularity of operetta in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s cannot be explained by reference to the emergence of any new social group. The one obvious sense in which operetta was ‘bourgeois’, or at least associated with wider socio-economic change, was its commercial attraction. The Great Reforms had created new markets for urban entertainments, and operetta proved especially attractive (and in most cases profitable) to impresarios like Berg and Lentovsky who relied on ticket-paying crowds for their livelihoods. Even then, however, it is important to bear in mind that operetta initially triumphed in Russia at the Imperial theatres, where generous state subsidies rendered the commercial imperative much weaker. Ultimately, therefore, the success of operetta in Russia during the genre’s heyday is explained by the fact that Russia’s entertainment culture was closely integrated into that of metropolitan Europe as a whole, rather than by reference to a specific socio-economic context.</p>
<p>The critical responses to operetta in Russia did not match its popularity. As the genre conquered the theatrical repertoire during the 1860s and 1870s, the weight of contemporaneous commentary was dismissive, and a few observers even regarded it as a politically malign influence. The various reactions collectively expressed the uneasiness among the intelligentsia about changes in cultural life, and amongst radicals and conservatives about the political direction that the country was taking during the Great Reforms. The rise of operetta, in other words, was viewed as symptomatic of a deeper transformation. From the early 1880s, by contrast, critics began to focus more narrowly on the alleged artistic decline of the genre, underlining the extent to which the ‘operettamania’ of the earlier period was considered a phenomenon of more than just theatrical significance.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the consternation about operetta, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Russian intelligentsia attached an important public value to the arts in general, and to theatre in particular. Ever since Catherine the Great declared that ‘Theatre is a school for the people’, educated Russians of all political persuasions had regarded the dramatic stage as a serious public forum, which, if properly organized, had the potential to educate and ‘civilize’ the masses. This notion was a regular refrain of theatrical commentary in Russia from the early nineteenth century onwards. Alexander Shakhovskoi, a prominent playwright and director, believed that theatre’s role was, ‘To strive to refine taste, to soften manners, to eradicate vices, to rouse the spirit and a sense of patriotism’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691411427830">49</xref></sup> and the dramatist Fyodor Ivanov insisted that ‘an actor does not entertain but teaches’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691411427830">50</xref></sup> Alexander Herzen described theatre as a ‘high tribunal for the resolution of vital issues’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691411427830">51</xref></sup> and Nikolai Gogol described it as ‘a kind of pulpit from which much good can be spoken to the world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691411427830">52</xref></sup> From the mid-1850s, under the influence of Nikolai Chernyshevsky’s essay ‘The Aesthetic Relations of Art to Reality’, many educated Russians believed that all art should have a serious, didactic function.</p>
<p>It was into this intellectual climate that the light-hearted French operettas appeared, much to the delight of thousands of theatre-goers, but to the dismay of critics and others. A common response to operetta was that it was frivolous, a trivial French import that was unworthy of serious attention. When the French troupe at the Mikhailovsky staged <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic> in April 1866, the newspaper <italic>The Week</italic> (‘Nedelia’) concluded that ‘The authors of this farce, of course, really did not intend to create a serious work. Their aim was to make the public laugh with that instinctive laughter behind which there is no instructive or damning ulterior motive…’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691411427830">53</xref></sup> Russia’s great composers rarely mentioned operetta in their letters and memoirs, and when they did it was usually in derogatory terms. César Cui, for example, wrote in 1865 that Offenbach’s works had nothing in common with music or art,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691411427830">54</xref></sup> and after seeing Offenbach’s <italic>Parisian Life</italic> in St Petersburg in October 1869, Alexander Borodin wrote to his wife: ‘The devil knows what nonsense this is; neither rhyme nor reason’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691411427830">55</xref></sup> In 1868 the journalist and soon-to-be publisher Alexei Suvorin, reflecting on the trivial character of the newly-popular genre, predicted that ‘operettas will disappear suddenly, as soon as more serious needs are awakened in society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691411427830">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Operetta, moreover, was closely associated, in its early years in Russia, with what were regarded as the declining morals of the Second French Empire, and the cancan was regarded as a sign of the ‘new Parisian nihilism’, brought about by the ‘depravity and cynical scepticism of contemporary France’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691411427830">57</xref></sup> When <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic> premiered at the Moscow Malyi theatre in 1870 the critic M. P. Shchepkin wrote of this ‘pathetic parody of stage art, offending the moral senses of the audience’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691411427830">58</xref></sup> Lev Tolstoi alluded to the disreputable status of operetta in his novel <italic>Anna Karenina</italic>, written during the mid-1870s, when one of the main characters, Vronsky, arrives at a high-society soirée in St Petersburg and confesses that he has come directly from the Bouffe: ‘A delight! I know it’s shameful, but at the opera I go to sleep, while at the Bouffe I stay until the very end, and I enjoy it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691411427830">59</xref></sup> The scene captures the ambivalence that many exhibited towards operetta, as enthusiastic patronage was often accompanied, in certain circles, by a sense that it was morally inappropriate entertainment.</p>
<p>The association of operetta with ‘loose morals’ in Russia was perceived most clearly in its erotic undertones. During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, many serf theatres on Russian manorial estates exhibited a pronounced erotic content, but they fell into abeyance from the 1820s and modesty subsequently characterized the theatrical mainstream.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691411427830">60</xref></sup> The levels of flirtatious behaviour and sexual suggestion that operetta offered audiences were therefore relatively daring by the standards of the 1860s and 1870s. For many, this was a considerable part of its attraction, as one reviewer of the April 1866 performance of <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic> at the Mikhailovsky emphasized:<disp-quote>
<p>When Paris came into the boudoir of the beautiful Helen, when they came to declare their love, when mademoiselle Devéria … with an impetuous and smooth motion cast off her upper garments and revealed her shoulders and arms in all their beauty, when her mouth half-opened and the corner muscles of her lips grew voluptuously thin, when her glance broke into delight, when her waist, of its own accord, began submissively to move forward and her whole body froze and quivered in the embraces of Paris, then … then, so I heard, many young pupils of Belloni were unable to contain themselves and, running from the theatre, threw themselves into cabs and dashed away in rapture somewhere into the distance, pursued by charming visions … I glorify mademoiselle Devéria, despite the fact that she expresses one feeling, and not even a feeling but a sensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691411427830">61</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>French actresses who performed in Russia, like Devéria, were considered rather more daring than their native Russian counterparts in operettas, and some observers implicitly turned the Russian modesty into a patriotic virtue. The writer Pyotr Gnedich wrote of Lyadova that, ‘She knew how to veil the most risqué places in the operettas of Offenbach in such decent images that she was able to appear in the second act of <italic>La Belle Hélène</italic> in front of school pupils’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691411427830">62</xref></sup> Sergei Khudekov recalled Lyadova’s ‘dear little cancan’ in <italic>Graziella</italic>: ‘Not one movement exceeded the limits of propriety, so even the cancan was acceptable on the classical stage in her performance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691411427830">63</xref></sup> Suvorin also commended Lyadova for her modesty in operettas, while raising a moral eyebrow at some of the more racy scenes performed by Schneider when the Parisian star performed in St Petersburg early in 1872.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691411427830">64</xref></sup> And it was a French actress, Blanche Gandon, who caused an operetta ‘scandal’ at the Berg that resulted in a court summons. According to the main source for this incident: ‘During the performance of one song, Gandon raised a leg so high that she lost her balance and, having fallen to the floor with her buttocks facing the audience, she remained lying down, manufacturing various movements with her body…’. A policeman in the theatre, indignant at this display, reported the actress for ‘shameless acts’. Gandon’s lawyer argued that ‘there was no shamelessness, that his client only lost her balance and floundered on the floor, wishing to get up somewhat quicker, but became entangled in her skirts, and besides she was wearing drawers [<italic>pantalony</italic>]’, which were duly displayed in court as ‘material evidence’. The judge was unpersuaded by that argument and the hapless Gandon was fined 150 roubles for offending public sensibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691411427830">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>If commentators were somewhat reassured by the relative decorum of native Russian actresses on stage, popular prints were another matter. Operettas were often accompanied by series of visiting cards with photographs of characters from productions. Both Gnedich and Suvorin remarked that Lyadova appeared on these cards in much more revealing poses than on stage, and Suvorin even refrained from describing one of the images in full, lest his editor delete the passage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691411427830">66</xref></sup> One card was withdrawn from sale because Lyadova’s cleavage, in her portrayal of Helen, was regarded as the height of immorality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691411427830">67</xref></sup> While it would be an exaggeration to say that operetta was essentially pornographic – Iankovskii argued that this was the case around the fin-de-siècle<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691411427830">68</xref></sup> – it evidently had a reputation for titillation and indecency already by the 1870s.</p>
<p>The erotic element in operetta was symptomatic of a growing sense of cultural liberation during the period of the Great Reforms. In turn, the moral censure implicit in much of the commentary reflected latent concern about the impact of this development on moral order. At the same time, the more scabrous aspects of the genre were attributed to foreign performers, and native interpretations of key roles were deemed rather more respectable. Thus, the immoral side of operetta was utilized to create a sense of national cultural superiority, and the intelligentsia could reassure itself that its ambitions for a serious, didactic entertainment culture were not entirely thwarted by the mass popularity of Offenbach and others.</p>
<p>Operetta was also regarded in some quarters, both radical and conservative, as a corrosive influence on the established political order. A prominent radical who welcomed operetta’s irreverence and its capacity to destabilize political structures was the literary critic, nobleman and leading populist, Nikolai Mikhailovsky (1842–1904). In a lengthy article published in the ‘thick’ journal <italic>Notes of the Fatherland</italic> in October 1871, Mikhailovsky argued that the two ‘present masters’ of the historical stage were Darwinism and the operettas of Offenbach. Both were widely discussed at the time, since Darwin’s <italic>Descent of Man</italic> had just been published and Offenbach’s works dominated repertoires throughout Europe (though his star was starting to wane in France in the aftermath of the recent Franco-Prussian War). Mikhailovsky began by acknowledging that Darwin and the works of Offenbach ostensibly had nothing in common and were regarded by educated society as polar opposites:<disp-quote>
<p>The difference in attitudes of liberal criticism towards Darwin and Offenbach is really enormous. One is esteemed by everyone, although very few read him and even fewer understand him; the other is despised by everyone, although everyone watches, listens, hums and whistles, but also do not understand. In one they see the pride of our century, in the other a disgraceful blemish on contemporary civilization. One is defended with fervour from attacks of obscurantism, the other they are ready at any time to deliver up to the head of the Directorate of Public Prosecutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691411427830">69</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet they had important features in common: both were continuing the work of the Enlightenment – Darwin in his elimination of the supernatural from the scientific understanding of man and nature, Offenbach in his Voltairean ridicule of authority – and both were challenging the established order. Few would recognize the wider results produced by Darwin and Offenbach, claimed Mikhailovsky:<disp-quote>
<p>But in any case they are doing one and the same thing: one with proper importance and composure (as far as the representatives of science are concerned), the other babbling like a merry stream, whose cascading splashes are being listened to by those under whom it is quietly and gradually undermining the shore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691411427830">70</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Mikhailovsky, the parade of characters from ancient mythology and history who danced the cancan clearly possessed a ‘salacious element’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691411427830">71</xref></sup> though whether it was a decadent influence was more difficult to determine, since the works of Offenbach were ‘not only an agent but a symptom [of change]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691411427830">72</xref></sup> Moreover, in Mikhailovsky’s view, Offenbach was morally pure in comparison to some of the Enlightenment’s figures, notably Voltaire. Yet he was in no doubt about what Offenbach’s popularity ultimately signalled: ‘Debauchery is one of the hammers of history. If the comparatively very modest Offenbach has spread to entire layers of society and simultaneously to all ends of Europe, then this is because a great amputation lies ahead’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691411427830">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Main Administration for Press Affairs, which monitored publications for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, objected to the tone of Mikhailovsky’s article. In the censors’ almost unanimous interpretation, Mikhailovsky was suggesting that:<disp-quote>
<p>Darwin and Offenbach are like the agents who prepared the way for the French Revolution, affecting society with revolutionary methods; that present society is not answering all the requirements of the contemporary era, that it still contains many antiquated concepts, which inevitably, beyond its volition, must decline and give way to a new order, as happened at the end of the last century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691411427830">74</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the censors argued that Mikhailovsky was correct to suggest that Offenbach was continuing Voltaire’s work of shaking respect for authority, but that the article was ‘satirical’ and contained nothing reprehensible. Nevertheless, <italic>Notes of the Fatherland</italic> was reprimanded for publishing it, an official reaction that was in certain respects odd. If the censors were concerned that Mikhailovsky really had identified revolutionary agents in Darwin and Offenbach, why did they not ban the latter? If they believed that his article was absurd, why admonish the journal that published it? Most probably the censors thought that Mikhailovsky greatly exaggerated the (political) revolutionary potential of Darwin and Offenbach, but that it was unacceptable to encourage the reading public to associate them with political radicalism, since revolutionary discourse was proscribed in the public sphere.</p>
<p>The censors did not discuss Mikhailovsky’s article in isolation. The evidence adduced by Nikolai Drizen indicates that they also reflected, albeit briefly, on the general moral climate in which operetta flourished. The censor who was sympathetic to Mikhailovsky agreed with the radical author that the ‘old days’ were hardly less dissolute than the present, though the ‘erotic element’ was now much more in evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691411427830">75</xref></sup> It seems reasonable to assume that, since the censor was at odds with his colleagues on the importance of Mikhailovsky’s article, he probably disagreed with them about the relative dissoluteness of the age. In other words, most of the censors probably believed that they lived in a time of unprecedented immorality of which operetta, by implication, was both a cause and a symptom.</p>
<p>The most vociferous attack on the political and moral perils of operetta was launched by Prince Vladimir Meshchersky (1839–1914), an arch-conservative xenophobe and virulent opponent of the Great Reforms who founded the reactionary newspaper <italic>Citizen</italic> (‘Grazhdanin’) in 1872.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691411427830">76</xref></sup> The early issues of <italic>Citizen</italic> coincided with Schneider’s celebrated performances in St Petersburg in <italic>The Grand Duchess of Gérolstein</italic>, the Offenbach operetta that had entertained Europe’s political leaders, including the tsar, five years earlier at the International Exposition in Paris. Rumours circulated that Schneider would be prohibited from performing the eponymous role because of suspicion that the character was a loosely-veiled Catherine the Great. The plot of the three-act operetta, set in the fictional Duchy of Gérolstein in 1720, revolves around the Grand Duchess’s infatuation with the guardsmen, in particular Fritz whom she rapidly promotes through the ranks in order to distract him from his beloved peasant girl Wanda. Although Fritz eventually becomes commander-in-chief, he remains devoted to Wanda, and after a series of comic escapades, the Grand Duchess finally reconciles herself to life without her favourite soldier.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Offenbach’s librettists, Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based the story of <italic>The Grand Duchess of Gérolstein</italic> on Catherine the Great, at least in its entirety. It was more akin to a composite satire of court politics across Europe. ‘The libretto’, wrote Traubner, ‘was seen as parodying such things as the petty, pre-Bismarck German courts, the romance of Catherine the Great and Potemkin, the dictatorial rule of Spain’s Bourbon Queen Isabel II and her court, and, most obviously, the activities of Napoléon III and his court’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691411427830">77</xref></sup> Meshchersky, however, was incensed that permission was granted for its performance (presumably unaware that Alexander II had rushed to see the operetta in Paris in 1867). Writing about the ‘immorality of our society’, he strongly objected to the fact that:<disp-quote>
<p>Every day in the capital of the Russian state, between the Anichkov Palace and the monument of Catherine II, the Bouffe theatre presents a play ridiculing the sense of devotion to the sovereign, ridiculing military honour, ridiculing patriotism, and with an immorality unlike anything in the annals of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691411427830">78</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The public was so enraptured by Schneider that it even gifted her, ‘an actress of the Parisian theatre’, a golden sceptre. The bewildered Meshchersky, clearly getting carried away, concluded that, ‘in terms of a danger threatening government and society’, even the Nechaev affair did not compare with these ‘terrible events’ (a reference to the revolutionary terrorist Sergei Nechaev). In his memoirs, he described the operetta as a ‘profanation’ that was a ‘sign of the times’, ‘a picture of the general dissoluteness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691411427830">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is likely that Meshchersky was prompted to attack <italic>The Grand Duchess of Gérolstein</italic> in response to Suvorin’s enthusiastic endorsement of Schneider and the operetta.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691411427830">80</xref></sup> In his memoirs, Meshchersky associated the liberal Suvorin (unjustifiably) with nihilism and cited his journalism as one of the reasons he founded <italic>Citizen</italic> at the very moment Schneider was on tour in Russia, an organ that would be ‘conservative’, ‘in defence of Church authority’, and against liberalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691411427830">81</xref></sup> Suvorin responded by dismissing Meshchersky’s concerns. Rather than posing a threat to the state or society, the French star was the very embodiment of contemporary civilization: ‘Schneider is no more and no less than a talented bearer of French wit, gaiety, and the cancan; there was a time when the French carried the banner of civilization on bayonets, now they carry it on their legs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0265691411427830">82</xref></sup> If operetta posed a threat to government and society by ridiculing the military and undermining patriotism, thereby sealing the fate of the Second Empire the year before, why did it not have a similar effect on the victorious Germans, given that the Offenbach repertoire was well-known throughout Germany? Meshchersky had attributed far too much influence to the world of theatrical entertainment.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue in this exchange, of course, was not operetta’s aesthetic or even moral worth, considered in isolation by theatre critics, but rather what it symbolized in the wider context of the Great Reforms. Suvorin and Meshchersky held antithetical views about the direction of Russian politics during the reign of Alexander II, and the debate about operetta as a civilizing influence or a force for instability was really a sublimation of broader political concerns (including the erosion of deference, the altered structure of urban society, and their longer-term effects). Given the cultural prominence of operetta by the early 1870s, it is hardly surprising that it was used as a weapon in the war between liberal and conservative ideas.</p>
<p>By the early 1880s, operetta’s novelty had worn off, but it remained a popular component of repertoires across the empire. Concerns about its associations with moral impropriety continued to surface. A variety performance at the Astrakhan theatre in 1885 provoked the indignation of one observer because a girl aged 10 or 11, accompanied by her mother on the piano, sang suggestive couplets from Robert Planquette’s operetta <italic>Les Cloches de Corneville</italic>, and, in imitation of operetta stars, pointed to her chest and raised her skirt a little. ‘I cannot describe the sense of loathing that enveloped me upon seeing this disgraceful scene!’ wrote the Astrakhan correspondent. ‘Where was the shame of this lady, publicly exposing a child to disgrace? What concept of upbringing must one have in order to so ignorantly, so crudely encroach upon a child’s innocence?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0265691411427830">83</xref></sup> Some contemporaneous literature reflected what was, for many, the disreputable image of operetta performers, deemed worthy of applause while on stage but never fully integrated into polite society. The actor Alexander Sumbatov-Iuzhin, for example, wrote a play in 1884, <italic>The Celebrity’s Husband</italic>, in which an operetta singer with a reputation for immoral conduct is persuaded by her husband to become an opera singer instead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0265691411427830">84</xref></sup> A similar dilemma was alluded to by Anton Chekhov in 1886 in his short story <italic>Calchas</italic>, in which an ageing operetta performer reflects on how his sweetheart refused to marry him because of his questionable profession.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the nature of operetta commentary began to change from the early 1880s. Some observers now suggested that the longer-term impact of the genre had been to diminish the general standard of Russian theatre. In 1883, the theatrical newspaper <italic>The Prompter</italic> ran a two-part article that lamented the damage operetta had wreaked on the dramatic stage. It began by affirming the importance of theatre in Russian public life: ‘Theatre is one of the prominent factors in the political, intellectual and moral life of the people’. Yet, the author suggested, operetta had failed to meet this serious requirement. It was merely ‘a peculiar, concealed scabrousness, a derisive protest against many age-old ideas and customs’. Satirical protest was acceptable, but the appeal of operetta lay primarily in its coarse and ribald qualities: ‘Our masses do not understand subtle allusions, therefore our operetta allusions have become crude, vulgar and silly’. Moreover, operetta had been borrowed from the French only because it was fashionable, ‘like hats from Paris and knick-knacks’. This fashion for the frivolous had impeded the development of serious drama: ‘Thanks to the great dissemination of operetta here, the condition of Russian theatre has become, in truth, awful: dramatic art is in complete decline even in the state theatres of the capitals’. The solution, argued the author, lay in the urgent establishment of indigenous people’s theatres to cultivate serious Russian drama and comedy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0265691411427830">85</xref></sup> Thus, a new theme was added to the concerns about operetta’s incompatibility with serious theatre and its foreign origins, namely condescension towards ordinary people, who were held (absurdly) to be responsible for driving out the genre’s satirical quality and who required, consequently, a new education at the hands of a didactic and patriotic repertoire.</p>
<p>Critics increasingly remarked upon what they regarded as the declining quality and diminishing significance of operetta. One writer concluded in 1889 that ‘with each year the quality of operetta artists declined and, finally, had declined so much that even the most undemanding section of the public stopped going to operetta’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0265691411427830">86</xref></sup> Another contended in 1892 that ‘Operetta is in decline everywhere, it is even being wound up in its only native country, Paris’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0265691411427830">87</xref></sup> Another stated in 1894 that ‘Operetta has lost its significance, and its days are numbered’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0265691411427830">88</xref></sup> In the same year, a review of a new French operetta at the Mikhailovsky theatre declared that ‘Operetta died after the death of Offenbach [in 1880]’ and that ‘light satire and brilliant wit have been replaced by crude caricature and vulgarity’. There was little point, concluded the reviewer, in cultivating the genre at the Mikhailovsky since, even on commercial stages, it no longer created the impression it once did.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0265691411427830">89</xref></sup> The theme of decline became so pervasive that in 1907 the journal <italic>Theatre and Art</italic> initiated a discussion ‘On the Decline of Operetta’, inviting theatrical professionals to submit their views on the causes. The four responses focused mainly on the poor quality of performers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0265691411427830">90</xref></sup> One respondent, a conductor, remarked on how fortunate he had been to work in operetta during its ‘golden age’, when Lentovsky was at the height of his success as an impresario. ‘I participated in all stages of its growth, its brilliant flourishing, and its gradual decline’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0265691411427830">91</xref></sup> The prevalence of such observations underlines the extent to which contemporaries now perceived the passing of a distinctive era.</p>
<p>Yet, despite lamentations about its decline and the passing of a ‘golden age’, operetta persisted on the Russian stage. ‘A provincial theatre without operetta doesn’t make any money’, claimed one writer in 1892.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0265691411427830">92</xref></sup> The genre was given a new lease of life in the late 1890s through the growing interest in Viennese works, which, although they did not provoke the sharp critical reactions characteristic of the earlier period,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0265691411427830">93</xref></sup> attracted large audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0265691411427830">94</xref></sup> Impresarios, such as Charles Aumont, Ia. V. Shchukin and Vera Linskaya-Nemetti, established new theatrical enterprises dedicated in large part to operetta, and by the eve of the First World War there were five operetta theatres in St Petersburg, three in Moscow, and between 35 and 40 in the regions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0265691411427830">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, operetta conquered the Russian stage during the 1860s and 1870s because Alexander II’s Great Reforms had facilitated important preconditions for its success, notably urban population growth, commercialization of entertainment, and an unprecedented sense of social and cultural liberation. Yet even without these developments, operetta would have attained some presence in the tsarist empire’s theatres, simply because Russia’s urban entertainment culture did not differ significantly from the rest of Europe, particularly in St Petersburg where French fashions were enthusiastically monitored. The genre was especially prominent in Russia because the heyday of European operetta coincided with the arrival of thousands of new town-dwellers, eager for some light-hearted musical relief from the tribulations of everyday urban life, whether in the upper galleries of the state theatres, the new commercial stages, or the <italic>cafés-chantants</italic> and summer pleasure gardens. Operetta appealed to most social strata, however, and it should not be considered a distinctively middle-class or ‘bourgeois’ form of entertainment in Russia (except in the broader sense of its commercialism).</p>
<p>If the operetta craze was facilitated partly by Russia’s circumstances during the period of the Great Reforms, it also acted as a lightning rod for contemporaneous anxieties about those circumstances. By virtue of its cultural prominence, operetta was seized upon as evidence of moral disarray, popular irreverence, and political decline. It variously exposed cultural snobbery, national chauvinism, and fear of liberalization. Contemporaneous discussion about entertainment culture, of course, has often functioned as a proxy for other concerns, but operetta proved especially provocative in this respect, testimony both to the genre’s wide popularity and to the rapidity of change in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0265691411427830"><label>1</label><p>These typical characteristics gave operetta much in common with its major precursors, vaudeville and comic opera. In many respects there is little to distinguish between them, and operetta is perhaps best regarded as a latter-day fusion of these earlier genres. Many ‘operettas’, indeed, were categorized officially as <italic>operas bouffes</italic> (Offenbach) or comic operas (Gilbert and Sullivan), but the formal differences between them were too esoteric to hinder the popularization of ‘operetta’ as a generic term for most variants of light-hearted musical comedy in the late nineteenth-century. For a discussion of the nuances of definition see Richard Traubner, <italic>Operetta: A Theatrical History</italic> (London 1984), xi–xii and 1–17.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn14-0265691411427830"><label>14</label><p>It has even been claimed that, while <italic>en route</italic> for Paris, Alexander II reserved his seat as early as Cologne (Offenbach’s birthplace) and visited the Bouffes three hours after he arrived in the French capital.

<fn id="fn15-0265691411427830"><label>15</label><p>The only scholarly book devoted to the topic is the Soviet-era work by M. Iankovskii, <italic>Operetta: vozniknovenie i razvitie zhanra na zapade i v SSSR</italic> (Leningrad-Moscow 1937). A. R. Vladimirskaia, <italic>Zvezdnye chasy operetty</italic> (Leningrad 1991) provides a useful overview but is designed for a popular rather than academic readership. General histories of Russian theatre devote little attention to operetta, though occasionally they include short discussions, for example V. Vsevolodskii (Gerngross), <italic>Istoriia russkogo teatra</italic>, Vol. 2 (Leningrad-Moscow 1929), 132–34. Outside of Russia, practically nothing has been written about operetta in Russia. A notable exception is Laurence Senelick’s ‘Offenbach and Chekhov; or, La Belle Yelena’, <italic>Theatre Journal</italic>, October 1990, 455–67. A brief account, based largely on Vladimirskaia, is provided in Louise McReynolds, <italic>Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era</italic> (Ithaca NY 2003), 229–38 (including five pages of illustrations).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn17-0265691411427830"><label>17</label><p>A handbook for music enthusiasts published in St Petersburg in the mid-1790s contained an entry for ‘Opera, operetta’ and described them as a ‘musical theatrical spectacle of serious or humorous content’.

Vladimir Dal’s famous lexicon, published during the 1860s prior to the vogue for modern operetta on the Russian stage, defined ‘operetta’ as a diminutive of the word ‘opera’, the meaning of which was ‘sometimes closer to vaudeville’.</p></fn>
