<p>In this eloquent and evocative book, Neville Bolt rehabilitates the concept of ‘propaganda of the deed’ (POTD) for the 21st century. Marshalling theoretical and historical resources, he succeeds in updating our understanding of POTD from its failed 19th-century revolutionary roots to a successful tool of modern insurgent strategy. Moving away from an interpretation of POTD as pure physical violence goading governments into over-reaction, Bolt claims it is now ‘an act of political violence with the objective of creating a media event capable of energising populations to bring about state revolution or social transformation … irrespective of whether it uses bombs, bullets or hunger strikes’ (pp. 2–3). Bolt contends that ‘in an age of global communications the narrative domain becomes the new, contested battlespace’ (p. 82), and it is in this environment that insurgents seek to generate strategic effect. Therefore, unlike 19th-century POTD, which sought to use the weight of the state against itself to generate popular support, contemporary POTD uses ‘the weight of the media against the media’ in order to mobilise collective memories of grievance and oppression.</p>
<p>Bolt argues in Chapter One that in a world of digital media, which can circumvent state media controls to reach populations directly, POTD has embraced the complexity and unpredictability of the global media ecology. In contrast to its use in the 19th century, contemporary POTD combines political marketing and strategic communication, playing out in the global flows of media production and consumption. Pursuing this theme, Chapter Two proposes that insurgent ‘brands’ depend upon the construction of collective memories that mine the past in order to legitimise the present and hold out promises for the future. Chapter Three then uses the Irish Republican struggle to illustrate how these processes of identity and memory construction have evolved since the 19th century through the increasingly self-aware positioning of revolutionary politics within powerful narratives of liberation and nationhood.</p>
<p>Chapter Four shifts attention to POTD as a strategic operating concept of modern insurgents. Each violent event creates an ‘opportunity space’ into which both insurgent and state seek to inject narratives to their advantage. In political marketing terms, insurgents realise that images are more powerful than words and thus seek to frame events to not only stir the passions of target populations but also ‘trigger what remains unarticulated’ in collective memories and submerged discourses. That extreme violence must be used carefully is shown by the contrasting examples of insurgent success (Mumbai) and failure (Omagh). Chapter Five describes how the relationships between state, media and insurgents were reconfigured with the growth of mass media, particularly television, in the late 19th century, and Chapter Six shows how this process has intensified since the advent of the internet in the 1990s. We read here of the power of the network to challenge bureaucratic, organisational and political orthodoxies: the ideas and images at the heart of POTD can flow relatively unimpeded between disparate and distant populations.</p>
<p>This discussion leads to Chapter Seven’s examination of the role of digital media in the revolutionary upheavals of the ‘Arab Spring’, the outcomes of which are still unclear. The images of mass protest in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, for example, are POTD as performative politics played out under the global electronic gaze, yet their ability to effect true revolutionary change is questionable. Nevertheless, the images from Cairo and elsewhere shape narratives of oppression, arouse popular support, and thereby pose serious threats to the ability of governments to both control populations and ignore their concerns. Chapter 8 examines in more depth how these characteristics are central to insurgents’ appreciation of POTD as a ‘new strategic operating concept’, which states often find difficult to counter. In the final analysis, the story continues to unfold: as Bolt concludes, in relation to POTD’s ability to energise popular dissent: ‘In the coming years we shall discover whether it can convert that electric charge into decisive mass action’ (p. 269).</p>
<p><italic>The Violent Image</italic> has many strengths, not least of which is its fluency with a wide theoretical literature often overlooked in discussions of terrorism and insurgency. It draws upon media and communication studies, politics, semiotics, sociology, and other fields, yet does not burden the reader with academic jargon. In this respect, Bolt uses theory to construct arguments and frame ideas rather than to constrain them. This tolerant and pluralist methodology is very welcome, allowing author and reader to challenge totalising conceptions of globalisation, revolutionary politics, temporality, and so on, a trap into which critical scholars fall as readily as those they deconstruct. The author takes great pains to stress the contingency of social phenomena, whilst not ignoring the wider structural issues of society and global politics. Consequently, this book is a much-needed addition to the study of terrorism and insurgency, freed as it is from security dogma and from self-imposed disciplinary boundaries.</p>
