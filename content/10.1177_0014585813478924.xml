<abstract>
<p>Australia experienced a period of mass migration from Italy in the immediate post-Second World War period. This article presents findings from the oral narratives of a cohort of first-generation Italians who migrated from the region of Campania, in southern Italy, to the city of Adelaide, in the state of South Australia, in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of exploring the pre- and post-migratory vicissitudes of the informants, as well as their personal memories of the long sea voyage, the analysis examines the effects of cultural dislocation over a broad arc of time and discusses issues connected to identity formation, belonging, the loss of home and cultural maintenance on a group of migrants who are now senior citizens. The oral testimonies evidence the candid reactions of the project informants to the prospect of transnational migration, the cultural impact upon reaching the unfamiliar destination site and the transformative factors that motivated both the maintenance of core values and the enactment of cross-cultural communication strategies. The oral testimonies reveal the project conversants’ negotiation of cultural boundaries, in order to cope with the assimilation pressures being exerted by the dominant culture, and their honing of survival strategies in order to facilitate the identity formation and successful integration of subsequent generations. The article also includes excerpts from the oral testimonies of a second cohort of informants of Anglo-British origin who were residing in Adelaide during the post-war period.</p>

<p>Academic inquiry about migration viewed through the lens of oral testimony can elicit valuable connections and understandings about the nature of transnational identity, cross-cultural belonging, personal history and cultural loss and maintenance. Research project informants who share their experiential narratives and memories from both pre- and post-migration standpoints are able to shed light on the experience of cultural dislocation that takes place from the moment of definitive departure from the community of origin to the dynamic cross-cultural interaction that takes place following settlement in the new environment. As Portelli has observed:<disp-quote>
<p>at the core of oral history, in epistemological and in practical terms, lies one deep thematic focus, which distinguishes it from other approaches and disciplines also based on interviewing and fieldwork … the combination of the prevalence of the narrative form on the one hand, and the search for a connection between biography and history, between individual experience and the transformation of society, on the other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0014585813478924">Portelli, 1997</xref>: 6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In Australia, as elsewhere, migrant diasporas include cohorts of young, skilled workers and budding family groups, as well as ageing cohorts of first-generation migrants who arrived in propitious numbers as young and enterprising immigrants, crossing unknown seas in the turbulent years following the end of the Second World War. Researchers are acutely aware that with the passing of first-generation arrivals, in any migration context, their personal history and experiential narratives of loss of home, adaptation, transformation and cultural belonging are at risk of disappearing. Failure to capture such narratives would leave an inestimable void in our understanding of the multiple and complex ways that transnational migration reconfigures an individual’s sense of belonging, family networking, formation of social bonds and enactment of community cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Migration research on the arrival of Italians to Australia’s shores following the Second World War has posed many questions and garnered a wealth of information about individual and collective experiences of survival and success, whether in employment situations, or in family structures (today comprising three or four generations), as well as experiences of ‘sacrifice, failure, delusion, suffering, alienation, discrimination, isolation, poverty and nostalgia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0014585813478924">Cresciani, 2003</xref>: 143). Ultimately, the process of migratory movement functions as ‘an engine for social change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0014585813478924">Manning, 2005</xref>: 2) and the syncretism that occurs involves its protagonists, to greater or lesser degrees, in cross-cultural adaptation, active agency and self-governance, the dynamic transformation of individual lives and communities over time, and the creation of porous borders, the crossing of which allows people to experience social change and become involved in diverse spheres of activity.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, the new arrivals to Australia from war-torn Italy were shaped and influenced by the physical and mental landscapes of their border crossings, just as surely as they influenced and shaped the environment in which they settled. Travaglia states:<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone speaks of the waves of immigration, but few people think through the analogy. These immigrants … were indeed waves: they shaped Australia as surely and as profoundly as do the oceans. They came in great rushes, carrying with them ideas, excitement, hopes and aspirations. Some stayed and became part of the existing structures; others pounded away and carved themselves a new space in an ancient continent. Some managed to overturn existing structures, or build new ones, and rise above the rest. They shaped the land and the people, constructed and reconstructed, were destroyed on the factory floors and in their relationships, and ultimately, as a group, survived. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0014585813478924">Travaglia, 1993</xref>: 5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is sobering to reflect on the fact that in the years between 1946 and 1965, two Commonwealth nations, Canada and Australia, received nearly two million immigrants from Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0014585813478924">Castles, 1992</xref>). Previously in the twentieth century, the traditional destination for arrivals from Italy had been the United States of America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0014585813478924">Sabatino, 2004</xref>). Social, cultural and linguistic knowledge acquired and transferred across the Atlantic sea route by Italian migrants moving to the USA had created a migration map consisting of a shared corpus of oral and epistolary narratives, shared knowledge about survival strategies, known geographical locations, employment experiences and prospects, and the relative security of established intergenerational family nodes in a place of settlement that had evolved through successive patterns of chain migration.</p>
<p>For Italian migrants, the alteration of the destination route from the USA to Australia meant that the markers and signposts formerly available along the well-worn North American destination route were no longer valid or applicable. A new migration map was needed. Although there had been a documented flow of Italians back and forth to Australia, there had not previously been a wide-scale and targeted migration scheme, as was the case after the Second World War when Australia was in need of workers and their families to boost population growth and stimulate economic development. For the new arrivals, the island-continent of Australia, located in the Asia-Pacific region, was perceived as vast and limitless in its geographical dimensions: <italic>terra australis incognita</italic>, a territory almost completely unknown and hard to visualise or imagine, and one that was radically different from the provincial settings from whence great numbers of Italian migrants set forth in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>While there exists an abundance of research on the presence of Italians in Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014585813478924">1</xref></sup> regional-specific studies of migrant communities through oral history offer a precious form of documentation and testimony with a focus on regional-specific cohorts whose generations-old linguistic and cultural practices have been reconfigured in a new cultural dimension. This article explores selected findings from interview samples of oral narratives collected from 30 first-generation Italians who hail from provincial locations in Campania in Southern Italy, a region with mountainous terrain covering an area of 13,595 sq km and divided into five provinces: Avellino, Benevento, Caserta, Naples and Salerno. A common feature of the informant group is that in the period between the early 1950s and the late 1960s, the project participants undertook a 30-day sea crossing in order to settle in the city of Adelaide, a capital city founded in 1836 in the state of South Australia. The city of Adelaide covers the great expanse of the Adelaide Plains, once the traditional home of the Kaurna people. Today, South Australia produces grapes (especially for the production of fine wines), olives, vegetables, citrus fruits and grain, much as the residents of the plains of Campania have been doing since antiquity.</p>
<p>For a number of the project informants, the favourable confluence of climate and food production evident in parts of South Australia proved felicitous and engendered feelings of hope and positive enterprise for the future. Market gardening was a particular source of revenue for Italian migrants in the early years of their settlement. During the post-war 20-year period under consideration, the largely Anglo-British population of Adelaide witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of arrivals from Italy, with the Campanians arriving predominantly from provincial towns such as Benevento, San Giorgio la Molara, San Leucio del Sannio, Molinara, Ceppaloni, San Marco dei Cavoti, Altavilla Irpina and from a host of others. Although in 1951 an Assisted Migration Agreement was signed by the governments of Australia and Italy, in the case of the majority of Campanian migrants arriving in Adelaide, their resettlement was made possible largely through sponsorship, with spouses, relatives or <italic>paesani</italic> acting as sponsors.</p>
<p>In the immediate post-Second World War years, transnational immigration by Campanians to South Australia was characterised by high-density cluster settlement patterns that were strongly influenced by family kinship networks operating within a chain migration system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0014585813478924">Bosworth (1988: 616)</xref> states: ‘the numbers immigrating to Australia were appreciable, taking the Italian-born population from 120 000 in 1954 to 228 000 in 1961 and to a peak of 290 000 in 1971’. It has been estimated that by 1981, approximately 78,000 Campanians had left Italy bound for overseas destinations. In Australia, compared to other state capitals such as Sydney and Melbourne, Adelaide recorded the highest percentage of settlement by Campanians (27.9%), with an estimated 10,145 Campanian immigrants, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0014585813478924">O’Connor (2004)</xref>, thus constituting a more numerous regional group than the arrivals from the regions of Calabria (23.5%) and the Veneto (10.5%). More recently, O’Connor and Cosmini-Rose have observed:<disp-quote>
<p>I modelli di insediamento nel Sud Australia furono pertanto determinati, per lo più, dalla presenza di familiari e paesani, dalle opportunità d’occupazione e da fattori religiosi. Tra i censimenti del 1947 e del 1961 24.000 italiani si stabilirono nel Sud Australia, il che ebbe l’effetto di aumentare la percentuale della presenza italiana tra la popolazione locale dallo 0,38% al 2,70%. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0014585813478924">O’Connor and Cosmini-Rose, 2012</xref>: 353)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The chain migration factor connected to the self-funded arrivals from Campania led to settlements in regional-based clusters in suburban Adelaide where family connection functioned as a solid and binding element. One such area of intense settlement was the suburb of Payneham located in the north-east of the city. A local history of Payneham published in 1983 identified ‘sustained family affection and loyalty, working together as united bands … sending back home money for the expenses and fares of the extended family’ as distinctive features of Italians living in the Payneham area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0014585813478924">JW Warburton, 1983</xref>: 165). Another local historian noted: ‘The eastern municipalities of St. Peters, Payneham, Kensington-Norwood and Campbelltown attracted 30 per cent or more of the Italians settling in metropolitan Adelaide, an unusually high concentration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0014585813478924">E Warburton, 1983</xref>: 184). These particular areas in Adelaide were popular with Campanian migrants who adapted to the city’s wide, planned streetscape surrounded by green belts of parkland. One informant has spoken of his sense of wonder upon viewing, after sunset, the bright lights of the city from a hillside panoramic lookout. With its roads and infrastructure laid out in an orderly grid plan, Adelaide’s urban layout was reminiscent of ancient Roman city plans.</p>
<p>Over five decades, Campanian migrants not only settled, found employment and nurtured their families but, as a collective, they established associations and community clubs. Eventually, the numerous associations formed a Federation in 1987 known as <italic>La Federazione delle Associazioni di Emigrati Campani in Sud Australia</italic>. They also published a volume entitled <italic>I campani in Sud Australia</italic> (2nd edn 2003) and there was an official twinning of the Region of Campania and the State of South Australia on 1 October 1990. Noteworthy publications on the history of the settlement of two regional groups, the <italic>sangiorgesi</italic> and the <italic>molinaresi</italic>, have appeared in recent times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0014585813478924">Longo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0014585813478924">Mercurio and Scarino, 2004</xref>), and today people of Campanian origin in Adelaide are active in a wide variety of clubs, associations and purpose-specific groups, such as sporting networks or prayer groups, for example for the veneration of San Pio da Pietrelcina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0014585813478924">Carchedi, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The present research consists of the qualitative analysis of survey data using face-to-face interviews as the primary data collection technique. The oral survey, consisting of 100 questions, was administered by the project investigator in the informants’ native language and sought to elicit responses not only about life in Australia but also direct testimony about the informants’ childhood and adolescence in Campania. Therefore, the oral survey covered the informants’ family background; the rituals that were enacted in a family, community and religious context; formal education (most received 3 to 5 years of primary school education); family expectations; experiences of courtship, marriage and parenthood; employment; the outbreak of war and the effects of the Second World War upon the local community; the aftermath of war; the decision to leave Italy and emigrate to South Australia; the sea voyage; the settlement process in Adelaide’s suburbs; the social factors impacting on their lives in the new country; employment experiences; family life; and the maintenance of cultural and culinary traditions and rituals. The project informants communicated their memories of departure for the long sea voyage and the impact of a cross-cultural experience shared with a transient community on board the vessel taking the voyagers to their new destination. They also commented on the preservation of linguistic codes and practices within the family and public domains; the sometimes painful exploration of the world of paid employment where racism could be rife in certain sectors; and the preservation of religious faith and belief in Roman Catholic doctrine that was transferred to a new cultural setting where there were few Italian-speaking parishes.</p>
<p>The informant group is part of the ageing demographic of the migrant diaspora in South Australia and many of the oral testimonies record events taking place in Italy from the 1920s onwards, thereby encapsulating the Fascist era, invasion and occupation by the German Army, liberation by the Allied Forces and the difficulties of reconstructing a former way of existence during the harried post-war years. For the most part, the parents of these individuals have long since passed away and, in their senior years, the informants reflect on a lifetime of experiences across two continents. As cherished members of their family groups, they find themselves at the head of family structures whose younger members are well integrated into Australia’s multicultural society. In the courtship and marriage annals of these families, the practice of exogamy, which was frowned upon in the community of origin, is commonly found among the third-generation offspring who are Australian-born. Regrettably for the informants, the third and fourth generations rarely communicate in the language of their grandparents and great-grandparents, representing an erosion of the regional language. The primary language and linguistic variants used by the project informants include a regional dialect, standard Italian expression, forms of Australian-Italian and other hybrid vernacular.</p>
<p>The clarity of the informants’ recollections and the fluidity with which the memories and stories of long ago were expressed during interview constitute a rich source of cultural memory. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0014585813478924">Poggio (2004: 30)</xref> states: ‘Ogni narrazione è un artefatto culturale’. There was an eagerness expressed by all of the project conversants to tell their individual stories of adaptation in the host community, sharing memories that were often conveyed with a high level of emotional intensity. For some, the interview was a unique occasion to remember the past and align it with the present temporality. The oral narratives evoked moments of profound joy and self-discovery, as well as stories of disappointment and grief. The latter was especially evident for those who had separated from their parents as young adults and had had few opportunities to return for visits to Italy in later years. Amid the mixture of tears and laughter, personal and intimate stories, and candid reflections on the radical changes that were wrought in their lives by the decision to emigrate, the project informants articulated, albeit in diverse ways, their response to notions of belonging, home and identity. They reflected on what had been transformed and what had been lost and could never be recovered. Although the image of their former home in Italy remains indelibly imprinted in their memory, the notion of home in the post-migratory context is connected with the redefinition of their personal sense of belonging and identity in a multicultural context.</p>
<p>The project participants were open and frank in reconstructing past events, strictures, ritual practices, tales of love, loss, endurance and hardship, and the minutiae of everyday domestic life in a traditional family structure formed along patrilineal lines. The core values derived from these experiences constituted the foundation elements which each individual drew upon when they were physically separated and culturally dislocated from their community of origin through the process of transnational migration. In all cases, the informants have continued to maintain a strong identification with their place of origin, preferring at interview to identify themselves primarily as ‘sangiorgesi’ or ‘beneventani’ within the parameters of the Italian community in Australia, and as ‘italiani’ within the wider Australian community. This firmly-rooted sense of <italic>italianità</italic> and <italic>campanità</italic> lies at the heart of their sense of belonging in the new place of settlement, notwithstanding the fact that the experience of migration took place more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The research project explored how the Campanian migrants adapted and functioned within the norms of the dominant culture in the context of being culturally displaced. It also examined the impact that the official policy of assimilation had on the new arrivals, not only in the immediate context of settlement, but also in the long term, following the birth of Australian-born offspring. The interviewer sought to engage participants in creating a narrative of their lives in two diverse realities, pre- and post-migration, framed around the survey questions, which would allow for reflection and the interpretation of key typologies connected with identity and cultural maintenance. The project aimed to explore the extent to which participants adapted, assimilated or experienced a degree of erasure of their cultural practice and identity. What emerged from the oral narratives was how the new arrivals had sought respectful dialogue and social interaction in multicultural and intercultural contexts, where the transfer of skills and socio-cultural understanding in the new environment meant consolidating temporal and spatial realities, reframing cultural points of view, and adapting linguistic expression. In the elaboration of prior knowledge about the cultural norms of pre-industrial traditional communities, the participants identified cooperative strategies based around the model of the extended family as the primary source of cultural values, socialisation, role modelling, mentoring, and religious observance, and did so with an attitude of openness to dialogue, enterprise and opportunities for greater autonomy and self-determination.</p>
<p>As was mentioned earlier, the host community, both in its identity and typologies, experiences permanent change and growth as a result of incoming cultural influences and networks. In order to provide an alternative perspective for the purposes of this article, the memories of the first-generation Campanian cohort (translated by the author into English) are interspersed with excerpts from a second group of informants who were interviewed at the same time. The latter cohort of five women of Anglo-British origin, all of whom were residing in Adelaide during the post-war period, offer a series of personal and considered observations on the presence of Italians arriving in the thriving and well-established city of Adelaide in the post-Second World War (and post-Depression) years.</p>
<p>Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, provincial communities in Campania depended on an agrarian lifestyle and many of the informants were involved in the cultivation of olives, grapes, corn, tobacco, chestnuts and a variety of fruit. However, the share farming economy (<italic>mezzadria</italic>) overseen by exacting land-owners constrained the labourers through various iron-clad farming contracts. Thus the labourers were obliged to supply and use their own farming tools, obtain their own seeds for planting, and then supply to the property-owner, on a regular basis, a fixed number of goods and produce, such as tobacco, grain, cured hams, fruit or eggs.</p>
<p>The disastrous effects of the war, with the German Army’s invasion of the region, the arrival of the Allied Forces and the targeted bombing campaigns, all took their toll on the tight-knit communities who had relied on their traditional way of life and seasonal patterns of labour. The hilltop town of San Giorgio la Molara offered a strategic panorama of the surroundings valleys, roads and neighbouring communities and therefore was selected by officials from the occupying German Army as a suitable place to set up a central command post. Unfortunately, this rendered it a prime target during the military campaign. The subsequent bombing of the town on 29 September 1943 was recalled in vivid detail by one of the project informants:<disp-quote>
<p>A bomb fell … 100 metres away … then the whole street was bombed … we fled to the countryside … we spent the first night on our feet, seized with fear … we were too frightened to go back to the town and retrieve our mattresses and blankets.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>After the war, the outbreak of phylloxera, the devaluation of the currency, food shortages, property loss and the deaths of family members (through disease, bombings and military combat), the loss of infrastructure (bridges and roads destroyed and water and electricity supplies cut), together with the disappearance of family members through migration to developing industrial centres in the north of Italy and other parts of Europe contributed to a rapid decline and destabilisation of communities in Campanian provinces. Another negative factor was the devastation caused by seismic activity such as the major earthquake that occurred on the evening of 21 August 1962. During this catastrophic event, Molinara’s <italic>borgo antico</italic> was all but destroyed, as attested to in this account appearing in a volume published by members of the Molinarese community in Adelaide:<disp-quote>
<p>in barely 10 seconds it destroyed 93% of all buildings, that is, 1,256 houses! The first tremor occurred at 5.00pm, followed at 7.00pm by another which was so strong that even the most courageous left their homes. Ten minutes later came the final, most intense tremor registering 9 on the Mercalli Intensity Scale [6.7 on the Richter Scale] and lasting for a mere 10 seconds! … The Borgo Antico became a scene of ruins … Farewell to all the self-denial, the hard work, and the sacrifices of our ancestors and forefathers whom these walls had protected so effectively! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0014585813478924">Cirocco, 2010</xref>: 14–15)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Even today, locals refer to two distinct phases of existence of the town: the traditional Molinara that existed prior to the earthquake and the modern-day Molinara that emerged after the calamity, during which residents underwent a radical transformation of their former way of life. One of my project informants, who was a resident in the nearby town of San Giorgio la Molara, which also experienced the severity of the earthquake, recalled in vivid detail the shock and trauma of that event during which she and her family watched in horror as their house collapsed after the third violent tremor. She barely escaped with her life.</p>
<p>Campania’s history, over millennia, has witnessed continual invasion, occupation, destruction and reconstruction. In addition to six centuries of Roman domination, the area has been home to Greeks, Etruscans, Samnites, Osci, Visigoths, Ostragoths, Longobards, Normans, Swabians and Angevins, as well as representatives of the Aragonese and Bourbon dynasties. This multilayered history of occupation and colonisation has resulted in a rich and culturally diverse region that conserves remnants of its historical past in its architecture, linguistic practices, ancient sites, traditional cultural practices and rituals from a pre-Christian era, superimposed by traditions and influences introduced by the early Christian religion and later formalised by the Papacy. Scholars and local historians have keenly recorded the historical panorama of events and the cultural practices pertinent to individual communities in Campania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014585813478924">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In pre-Second World War provincial Campania, there was a measure of uniformity in the collective cultural life of individual communities. While it is true that the doctrines of the Catholic Church held sway, each community elaborated cultural practices in its own way, for example, in the celebration of the cult of the Virgin Mary (<italic>la Madonna delle Grazie</italic>, <italic>la Madonna del Carmine</italic>, <italic>la Madonna di Pompei</italic> and <italic>la Madonna di Montevergine</italic>), feast-days of certain saints, pilgrimages to designated sites such as Montevergine, and the celebration of the all-important cycle of Christmas, Epiphany, Lent and Easter. The project participants recalled a strong adherence to cyclical patterns of family and community worship and activity. In Adelaide, they recreated a number of these celebratory events, such as the feasts of San Donato, San Giorgio Martire, San Marco, San Pellegrino Martire, San Rocco and Maria SS. di Montevergine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014585813478924">3</xref></sup> The informants recorded their willing participation in the re-enactment of these religious festivals in the place of settlement.</p>
<p>When recalling the final moments of departure from Italy, the project conversants gave descriptions of harrowing scenes of farewell that took place, either in the village or town or at the port of Naples, most often in the company of their parents and siblings who were remaining in Italy. At the time of peak migration to Australia, the once-solid family structures seemed to be fracturing, with offshoots reassembling on the other side of the globe. These patrilineal communities had preserved time-honoured rituals and a rule of unquestioned respect towards family elders: ‘The family was everything’. In the evenings, the family recited the rosary together and girls were expected to keep busy after dinner by hand-embroidering their trousseau. For young men and women, the family rule meant obedience and the maintenance of family honour. For women, it also meant silence. Female informants reported: ‘Fathers were strict with their daughters’; ‘Girls had to remain silent. One didn’t know anything’; ‘We were kept so ignorant’; ‘Girls were always controlled by their families’; ‘Married women in Italy didn’t tell you anything. Everything was kept hidden’. The enculturation of young women entailed the journey from the altar to their father-in-law’s house. Those who did not marry were expected to stay at home and look after their parents and siblings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0014585813478924">Passerini (1978: xxxviii)</xref> points out: ‘La storia orale può contribuire… a scoprire… la dialettica tra passato e presente’. In this dialectic along the time continuum, memories of the past provide a fixed and stable point of reference for the present temporality. No matter how strong the adherence to traditional role models and cultural values in an established community, in the move to a new place of settlement the future and its typologies become less rigid and predictable, with a greater degree of uncertainty and flexibility because the cultural parameters have shifted. The old strictures and ways of life are being influenced by a multiplicity of outside sources, not only generated by the dominant culture in which settlement has taken place, but also by myriad other cultural influences, both regional and foreign, that are taking root in order to establish themselves in the new socio-cultural context.</p>
<p>The project participants left Italy prior to the economic miracle of the 1960s and the atomisation of culture that brought about Italy’s rapid social and economic transformation. For the new arrivals to Adelaide, the old strictures, in which one distrusted the ‘outsider’ or the foreigner, once transplanted to a new cross-cultural landscape, began to lose rigidity and force. The old ways could no longer be imposed with the same implacable authority. In Adelaide, some of the female informants described the thrill and fear of learning to drive a car, managing a budget, organising a mortgage and taking up outside employment. The women found that they had greater freedom to exercise their judgement and gain new skills in the labour market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0014585813478924">Vasta (1992: 154)</xref> identifies the role of Italian women in cultural risk-taking: ‘as cultural custodians and cultural brokers, Italian migrant women have been protagonists in the maintenance of Italian language and culture, all the while negotiating new cultural and political practices’. Most of the female informants attested to working hard to maintain established cultural practices intergenerationally. They encouraged their household to support family unity, engage in traditional food preparation, including tomato-sauce bottling, uphold a sense of financial responsibility, practise a solid work ethic and maintain religious faith. At the same time, they realised that other cultural norms and practices, such as enforcing inflexibility in gender-assigned roles, encouraging endogamous practices in courtship, expecting girls to carry out activity such as the production of handmade linen for glory-boxes, and imposing silence about sexuality, relationships, intimacy and childbirth, were not going to be sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p>As a destination route, Australia could not purport to usurp the golden myth of ‘Lamerica’ as a place of immense opportunity and wealth to be tapped. Australia’s cities were largely unknown to Campanian migrants, while the Australian outback was considered a place of mystery and danger. As one of the project participants exclaimed, ‘there was no America here!’ The utterance encapsulates the notion of a lost paradise and shattered dreams. Nevertheless, this woman embraced the experience of difference, refashioning her cultural outlook in order to transform herself for survival and the nurturing of offspring who would be successful even in the radically altered new environment that bore little resemblance to the place of origin. Moreover, the distance to be traversed was so far as to engender feelings in some individuals of a one-way transoceanic voyage to the far-flung ends of the earth. As one informant expressed it: <disp-quote>
<p>I had come out with the idea of earning some money and then returning to Italy. When the ship docked in Fremantle, I looked back at the expanse of water that I had crossed and I thought ‘How will I cross all this water again? I don’t think that I will ever return to Italy’.</p></disp-quote>Another expressed a similar view but with a twist: ‘I have come to a prison. I don’t believe that I will ever return’.</p>
<p>To those emigrants bound for Australia’s faraway shores, tales of life in the antipodes varied wildly, from being described in letters as a place of magical wonder where so many lollies were strewn about on the local streets that people ignored them and did not bother to collect them, to desolate tales of an arid, inhospitable land: ‘From what people were telling you, some said that it was a land of prosperity, others that it was a land full of flies, a hot dry land where there were water shortages even in the 1950s’. Some new arrivals reported strange vegetarian eating habits in a southern land forsaken by God where nothing prospered and people were forced to survive on green-leaf vegetables.</p>
<p>One male informant who emigrated to Adelaide in 1962 recalled his attempts to find work. However, his overriding memory was one of bewilderment, of losing his internal compass. During the interview he repeated the question, ‘Where were we going?’ When I asked him: ‘How had you imagined Australia to be?’ he replied, <disp-quote>
<p>A dream. I really knew nothing about where I was going. I was on board the <italic>Sydney</italic> for 32 days, food and water but where was I going? There was a pool, there were games, there was a cinema, there was everything, but I just didn’t know where I was going. It took me two years to pay off my debts.</p></disp-quote>During his stay in Australia he felt a sense of unease that he could not endure and he eventually returned to Italy in 1973. His view of Australia was consistently negative: ‘There was nothing there.’ This was a mantra recited by others whose inner eye could not dispel the image of a European landscape. Nevertheless, others reported that Australia was imagined as a miraculous destination that would offer salvation from <italic>miseria</italic> and <italic>povertà</italic> and the generally difficult conditions of life back home after the war: ‘In Italy when you were able to buy a pair of shoes, it was like seeing Paradise!’; ‘People used to say: “Saint Australia”. People were leaving to find work, to change their lives.’ Once the decision had been taken, there was no turning back: ‘We made the decision and embraced the cross.’</p>
<p>Campanian migrants arriving in Adelaide in the immediate post-Second World War period faced multiple challenges for which a number were ill-prepared, notwithstanding the safety net of chain migration and its solid familial and compeer networks. The aftermath of war in Campania had cut a swathe through the economy based on share farming (<italic>mezzadria</italic>) with its diverse patterns of farming contracts and labour overseen by land-owners whose practices were based on a feudal model of overlordship. Five years after the cessation of hostilities, the Italian government’s infrastructure and development project for the depressed areas of the South, the <italic>Cassa per il Mezzogiorno</italic> (State Fund for the South), was enacted on 10 August 1950, but in the early 1950s, many were still struggling with the widespread scarcity of employment and basic necessities. Emigration offered the prospect of a more secure future.</p>
<p>The long sea voyage undertaken by the project informants represents a defining moment; an experience of liminality, wherein the subject who is relocating to a foreign place enters a neutral threshold state following the often difficult or even traumatic separation from family members and friends in Italy. The project informants embarked at the port of Naples and the route they followed included Messina, Port Said, Aden, Colombo, Fremantle and Melbourne, where they were generally met by relatives and then proceeded to make an inland crossing by car or train to Adelaide. On board the ocean liner there were cabins for those with means, or dormitories with bunk bedding that slept 30 to 40 people at a time. The men’s and women’s quarters were separated. One informant recalls: <disp-quote>
<p>I was sick with fear on board that ship. I was worried about my husband and small child who had been separated from me. And it stank down there with all those men. I never thought that I was going to survive. But what choice did we have? We were leaving to find work, to change our lives. In Italy there was always the fear that you would not survive.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The month-long voyage aboard a seafaring vessel bound for the antipodes represents the subject’s spatial relocation of self from the community of origin to a landscape of new social, cultural, political and linguistic dimensions located in foreign territory at the edge of the world. As I have remarked elsewhere, the significance of the sea voyage as a rite of passage also means that the journey away from the place of birth to a new frontier necessitates an opening up of the self and the exploration of new possibilities and imaginings:<disp-quote>
<p>Transnational migration involves a movement outwards from the nucleus of time-worn ritual and engendered social norms. Thus, the sea voyage is not only a physical journey of dislocation from the place of origin to the new settlement, but also represents a time of re-evaluation of self and belonging, allowing those on the journey to project themselves spatially in order to move forwards into a modern lifestyle occurring in a cultural outpost, wherein lay a future of possibilities and progress; a blind faith in order to forge a new identity with the host culture. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0014585813478924">Glenn, 2011</xref>: 132)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The experience entails the construction of a diverse mental cartography, enabling a redefining of the self and a revalorisation of the cultural values, modes of communication, typologies and coded behaviour of the known millennial culture in order to settle and thrive in accordance with the new and sometimes bewildering exigencies of the geographical, social, cultural, political, legislative and linguistic parameters at the place of settlement. Transnational migration represents both a physical and mental journey of dislocation and regeneration. While shared cultural knowledge and the unity and cohesiveness of core values nurtured by family and community members appear fragmented or displaced, at the same time, this allows for the development of new ways of being and belonging. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0014585813478924">Aufiero (1998: 88)</xref> notes, this is particularly the case for women: ‘la donna che raggiunge il marito oltreoceano può vivere con lui una vita diversa. La lontananza dal mondo di origine crea una nuova complicità nella coppia, un rapporto diverso dal passato.’</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the informants reported that they set about seeking employment and working in a variety of settings to support themselves and their families. They laboured on construction sites, in market gardens, factories and foundries. In spite of the existence of negative stereotypes of Italians in the media, a respondent from the second group of interviews (conducted with Anglo-British women) strongly articulated her view of Italian migrants as consistently hard workers: ‘They would nearly all have two jobs. They would have a job but they’d work as gardeners over the weekends and that sort of thing. … I think that they have been wonderful migrants for this country’. One of the Campanian informants whose father worked on weekends as a gardener for a wealthy family told how her father received an invitation to attend a wedding party at the home of his employer. He took his daughter along to act as interpreter. The event turned out to be a stand-up affair, a type of cocktail party, which the father found bewildering: ‘They invite you to a party and make you stand up!’ However, it introduced father and daughter to a new way of socialising that made a strong impression on them. Naturally, the linguistic divide hindered meaningful conversation with outsiders, and migrants of the first generation spoke of the long hours spent labouring, setting up a household and paying bills. On the issue of Italian migrants remaining close to their community groups and not mixing with the general community, a respondent from the second interview group stated:<disp-quote>
<p>One of the things that people were worried about was the fact that they didn’t mix with other people. But there again, I mean neither did we because it was the situation, the money problem. I was too busy feeding my children and dressing them and not having them look like they came from who knows where. And I would say it was the same with the Italian people.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>From this same set of respondents, there emerged a perceptive observation of Italian women out and about doing their shopping, conveyed by a woman who expressed admiration for the tasteful way in which women from Italy dressed and prided themselves on their appearance in public:<disp-quote>
<p>One thing that has stood out in my mind is that the older ladies doing their shopping, almost always in pairs, dressed what I would call well and tastefully. They were not necessarily wealthy but certainly knew a good fabric when they saw one, knew a good cut and knew what suited them and would not be overly ornamented in any way. It always reminded me of women I saw in particularly Italy, and probably France as well, who just seemed to have an innate sense, when we would be here thinking we would have to absolutely plaster our faces with all the makeup we could get hold of in order to go out abroad amongst other people. It struck me that makeup was not used heavily at all here or in Europe and I thought, ‘Golly, they’ve got a confidence that we lack here.’ … Yes, well I have always had admiration for that. It seemed to be when they finally were able to emerge from their, I am sure, their busy lives at home, then they took pride.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As the first generation carved out a place in the public and economic life of the city, different ideas and norms were encountered and these began to influence their offspring who were being shaped and influenced by the compulsory education system and by the interplay of ideas and concepts, economic resources and material culture that created a dynamic mix. A story related by a respondent from the second group of interviews recalls an incidence of a girl of Italian origin observed pushing boundaries. This girl, who would be expected to give her earnings to her father when she arrived home from work, reacted in an altogether different manner:<disp-quote>
<p>They definitely had to give up their pay packet. I’ll tell you something quite funny too. I was standing in a bus stop in Rundle Street and there were two young Italian girls, you see. And the youngest one had obviously just started work, and she had her pay packet in her hand and she opened it and the eldest one said, ‘Daddy won’t like that.’ She said, ‘Did Daddy earn it?’ And I thought, ‘There is going to be trouble in that house tonight.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Arriving in the antipodean landscape in the 1950s, during which a climate of assimilation prevailed, communication in Italian (a foreign language that was not a language of diplomacy and moreover bore vestiges of an alien enemy past) carried little purchase. At that time, markers of cultural difference were seen as detrimental rather than constituting a rich national resource. For many new arrivals to Australia, cultural difference and the maintenance of traditional practices were actively discouraged and misunderstood. Notions of cross-cultural adaptation engendered fear and intolerance on both sides of the cultural divide and transactions were often predicated on an Anglo-British conservatism that sought to regulate cross-cultural practices and admonish threats to its monolingual hegemony.</p>
<p>The project narratives reveal the effects of cultural dislocation over a long period of time, the degree of success in maintaining core values, the formation of identity in a multicultural setting and the development of strategies to facilitate the socio-cultural integration of offspring born in the place of settlement. During the early years of their arrival in Adelaide, many of the project respondents were seeking work, acquiring new skills, learning a new language, paying off the expenses from the voyage, dutifully sending remittances (<italic>rimesse</italic>) to family members back home, raising young families, adjusting to the new and unfamiliar environment, as well as maintaining close connections with the regional community in situ. Self-determination and a drive to succeed, in spite of challenges, fuelled their aspirations as they navigated the diverse cultural mix within Australian society that comprised indigenous Australians, Anglo-British residents, and new arrivals and permanent residents from other countries.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, migrants in Australia who were naturalised were identified as British subjects and were encouraged to swear allegiance to the Queen of England. Although linguistic practices, time-worn customs and rituals, traditional markers of regional or village identity, religious codes and practices, and collective identity were preserved as significant cultural capital, in the new place of settlement, the most successful adaptation was by individuals who adopted a forward-thinking and cooperative strategy for securing the future of their family dependants and offspring. Of course, the adaptation factors were influenced by affective traits, personality, age, gender, degree of trauma experienced during the war and personal motivation, but most had willingly desired to join family members or provide a better economic future for themselves and their children. They were highly motivated, sought appropriate resources for adapting to the new environment and also practised better self-management strategies. Even while conserving regional distinctiveness, they were also imagining and negotiating selfhood in a new cultural setting. Their projects looked to the future, negotiating cultural boundaries, exchanging and adapting practices and reformulating approaches in order to lay the groundwork for the education and development of future generations, while also passing on cultural knowledge from previous generations.</p>
<p>Conversely, those interviewees who continued to look back to the ways and mores of the past, and who tried to superimpose their mental map of the former home and way of life over the new cross-cultural landscape registered a deficit in the new environment and consequently found it harder to adapt and prosper. The comparison with their former cultural life in Italy and what they had left behind shackled their motivation and ability to adapt and seek more flexible social strategies.</p>
<p>The informants openly discussed their adaptation to ageing and their present-day activity as elderly citizens with grown-up family and grandchildren or great-grandchildren who are fully immersed in the social fabric. The final interview excerpt comes from one of the women interviewed in the second group who enthusiastically stated:<disp-quote>
<p>And I said that the community must have grown a terrific lot. And I think it is very good. I think that we should be very thankful that the Italians and the Greeks came here. And I think that we have gained a great deal right from the very start, even before the war, when there was just a sprinkling of Italian and Greek people who came. They were introducing new ways, new foods and adding colour to an otherwise very monotonous or monotone society.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As the oral narratives of the Campanian informants revealed, successful transition to the new place of settlement was largely determined by the participants’ personal degree of investment and contribution to the migration journey, as well as the enactment of outward-looking, cooperative social and cross-cultural strategies. Adaptation and skills in self-management aided the first-generation Campanian informants to become self-sufficient mediators between two cultural realities, seizing new opportunities that the experience of transnational migration presented to them so many years ago.</p>
