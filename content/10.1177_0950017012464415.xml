<p>This book argues that income inequality is the causal source of social dysfunction. Developed market economies with higher levels of income inequality such as the USA, the UK and Portugal suffer from more socio-health problems than countries with lower levels of income inequality such as Japan, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Furthermore, everyone is affected by income inequality regardless of where they sit on the social ladder. If you live in an unequal society you are more likely to suffer from a variety of health problems than your equivalent in a more equal country. In this regard, it is a theory of problems with social gradients. Mental illness, life expectancy, child mortality, obesity, educational performance, teenage births, violence and imprisonment can all be traced to one causal source: income inequality. Hence, the book has been described as a theory of everything.</p>
<p>The intuition that material inequality is socially corrosive has been around since Plato. What this book provides is the empirical data to show why. Part one, Material Success, Social Failure, argues that <italic>relative</italic> income differences rather than <italic>national</italic> averages are what affects the quality of life in capitalist democracies. When countries reach a certain level of economic growth, that growth ceases to make any difference to overall standards of living. This is not to say that economic growth no longer matters, but for rich countries it has reached a point of diminishing returns. What matters is the extent of income distribution within and between societies or where you sit relative to other people. The greater the material divide the greater the social problems. The causal mechanism through which income inequality affects health outcomes is competition induced status anxiety. Humans, it is argued, are highly sensitive about being regarded as inferior to others. More unequal countries are more hierarchical and this heightens social evaluation anxieties by increasing the importance attached to social status. In turn, this leads to a perpetual sense of insecurity which creates chronic stress and a variety of psychosocial problems.</p>
<p>In the second part of the book, <italic>The Cost of Inequality</italic>, the authors analyse 10 health and social problems and illustrate why all of these get worse the further one steps down the social ladder. The data make for sobering reading. In the UK one in six children are mentally ill and 23 per cent of adults have a neurotic illness. Obesity, infant mortality, heart disease, homicide and teenage births are all class issues. Educational performance for teenagers is worse in the USA and the UK when compared to their counterparts in Denmark or Sweden. Social mobility, in effect, is non-existent in countries such as the UK and the USA. But, if this is not enough, more unequal countries spend less on foreign aid, more on prisons, have larger carbon footprints, more childhood bullying and are less creative in economic innovation than their egalitarian neighbours. As the book unfolds, however, the argument on social gradients becomes less obvious. It concludes with a vision for economic and workplace democracy.</p>
<p>There are three problems with this book. First, the causal process of material inequality is traced to status, not class stratification. The causal mechanism through which inequality affects outcomes is psychosocial not material class resources. This creates an inference problem as to whether inequality is socially corrosive because of psychology or economic structure. There is no analysis on the importance of employment, collective bargaining or labour market institutions as contextual factors in the process of conditioning material inequality. In this regard, the reliance on individual psychology downplays the importance of cross country variation in employment and welfare state regimes.</p>
<p>This leads to the second problem. The book does not analyse the underlying economic and labour market structure that gives rise to material inequality in the first place. There is a vast literature in comparative political economy on the contextual effects of historically evolved institutions in explaining why the USA and the UK differ from Nordic, Alpine and continental European countries. This literature has the benefit of enabling historical-empirical comparisons of different varieties of capitalism. Institutions, politics and public policy condition different levels of material inequality. The authors trace the corrosive effect of inequality to the absence of trust and social cohesion. However, a strong argument can be made that levels of trust and cohesion are conditioned by historically evolved public policies and institutions.</p>
<p>Third, bivariate correlations with regression illustrate a direct association between inequality and health and social problems. However, this is not causal inference. The use of evolutionary psychology and status competition to flesh out the causal pathway is heavily reliant on countries with a pronounced class structure: the USA and the UK. Status, however, is just as important in Japanese, Dutch and German society. These countries, however, do not have the same level of social and health problems associated with material class divisions. Future comparative research would benefit from combining statistical with historically oriented configurational case study analysis to identify the precise causal pathway as to how some countries became more or less unequal and the different types of class stratification this produces.</p>
<p>This is a powerful book and should be required reading for all public policy analysts.</p>
