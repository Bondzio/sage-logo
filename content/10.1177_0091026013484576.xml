<p>I am very pleased to present this first issue of <italic>Public Personnel Management</italic> (<italic>PPM</italic>) as a SAGE Publications journal and would like to thank SAGE for allowing me to serve as the first editor-in-chief under its ownership. We envision <italic>PPM</italic> as a top tier scholarly journal that provides a forum for the exchange of ideas between scholars from the academic and practitioner communities. The articles presented in each issue aim to explore relevant aspects of the organizations, individuals, work environments, and decisions that are part of the theory and practice of public human resource management. The interests of our readers should be served through refereed articles, case studies, and commentaries that present a broad spectrum of timely management issues and concerns at all levels of government, both nationally and internationally, and comprise methodologically sound research, critical analysis, and academic writing of the highest degree. The first three issues in 2013 will include those articles that were previously accepted by the former publisher, International Public Management Association for Human Resources (IPMA-HR). I would like to acknowledge the production team at IPMA-HR, and those contributors who published in <italic>PPM</italic> over a number of years and provided many significant contributions to our knowledge of emerging trends in public personnel management.</p>
<p>My appreciation is also extended to each member of the new editorial board of <italic>PPM</italic> who has graciously agreed to serve for the next 3 years as the journal transitions into a new era of scholarly contribution to the field. This board comprises many distinguished scholars and experienced practitioners who represent the range and diversity of public personnel interests today. These individuals are key to establishing and maintaining <italic>PPM</italic> as a journal committed to preserving the high standards of academic rigor for intellectual study while bridging the nexus between public administration practice and management research in this field. I am extremely grateful to the SAGE publication team that has worked diligently with me to bring the March 2013 issue to print. I would like to acknowledge Cynthia Nalevanko, Lucy Berbeo, Kay Felicano-Ballesteros, and Purnima Narayanan for their endless collaborations with me as I transition into this new role, and Jennifer Stephenson and Gabriella Massari for their work on the <italic>PPM</italic> ScholarOne Manuscripts System, which will allow new manuscripts to be submitted through an online electronic process. A special thank you is offered to Caragh M. Boyles, assistant director of career services at Mississippi State University (MSU), for the organizational skills and assistance she has provided. And finally, I would like to acknowledge the encouragement and support for this new endeavor that has been extended to me by the administration at MSU.</p>
<p>Many thanks go to the authors who have contributed to the issues for 2013. Our goal over the next several years will be to publish original articles that will enhance our visibility, legitimacy, and scholarliness regarding timely public management issues and concerns. I believe the future is very bright for <italic>PPM</italic>, and I encourage you to consider this journal as a premier outlet for your research.</p>
