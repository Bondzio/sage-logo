<abstract>
<p>Although many repeat victimization studies have focused on describing the prevalence of the phenomenon, this study attempted to explain variations in the concentration of victimization by applying routine activities as a theoretical model. A multivariate analysis of repeat victimization based on the 2005 Taiwan criminal victimization data supported the general applicability of the routine activity model developed in Western culture for predicting repeat victimization. Findings that diverged from Western patterns included family income to assault, gender to robbery, and marital status, family income, and major activity to larceny incidents. These disparities illustrated the importance of considering the broader sociocultural context in the association between risk predictors and the concentration of criminal victimization. The contradictory results and nonsignificant variance also reflected untapped information on respondents’ biological features and psychological tendencies. Future victimization research would do well to integrate measurements that are sensitive to salient sociocultural elements of the society being studied and individuals’ biological and psychological traits.</p>

<p>Victimization studies have consistently shown that a disproportionate number of criminal victimizations are concentrated within a small number of victims across types of offences in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11400715">Farrell, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11400715">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang, Gottfredson, &amp; Garofalo, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11400715">Laycock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11400715">Mukherjee &amp; Carcach, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11400715">Sparks, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11400715">Ziegenhagen, 1976</xref>). A cross-national comparative study, for example, revealed that 1.6% of the households reporting burglary accounted for 41% and 40% of total burglaries in the United Kingdom in 1994 and the Netherlands in 1993, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni, Wittebrood, Farrell, &amp; Pease, 2004</xref>). Similarly, 0.3% households that were burglarized accounted for 30% of total burglaries in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). The prevalence of reports that a relatively small subgroup among the population was repeatedly victimized has led to an implication that a reduction in repeat victimizations would be a promising approach to reducing crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11400715">Laycock &amp; Clarke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11400715">Laycock &amp; Farrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11400715">Weisel, Clarke, &amp; Stedman, 1999</xref>). Research on criminal victimization, however, has been mainly devoted to studying the dichotomous distinction between nonvictims and victims and the transition from nonvictim to victim status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11400715">Julie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). A full picture of crime concentration with an empirical model to sort out at-risk groups has been largely overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11400715">Chenery, Ellingworth, Tseloni, &amp; Pease, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11400715">Farrell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The phenomenon of repeat victimization has been widely recognized in Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11400715">Weisel et al., 1999</xref>). This is evident from the volume of published research analyzing large-scale victimization data sets from Canada, the Netherlands, the United States, and Great Britain, which has disclosed the significance and extent of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11400715">Farrell, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11400715">1995</xref>). In Taiwan, little has been done to discover the extent of repeat victimization or to identify the groups that are most affected. Exploring this phenomenon may provide practical insights for identifying high-risk subgroups within the population for effective intervention and may also provide a non-Western context for broadening the theoretical construction of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Routine activity theory has been influential in explaining criminal victimization, suggesting that variation of victimization is a function of individuals’ lifestyle patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>). Victimization studies have found that the routine activity proposition has predictive applicability on macro-level variables, such as the community size and the population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy &amp; Forde, 1990</xref>). Research on criminal victimization that involves testing the routine activity model at the micro level generally includes social demographic characteristics and social routine activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe, Stafford, &amp; Long, 1987</xref>). Social demographic characteristics are commonly used as proxies for victimization risk, which are not completely consistent with the theoretical propositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy &amp; Forde, 1990</xref>). Routine social activities are considered to directly depict risk, but they have been less frequently analyzed due to the unavailability of data in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11400715">Miethe &amp; Meier, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11400715">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study sought to apply a routine activity model to victimization events at a micro level with variables derived from the 2005 Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization Survey. This survey is an important nationally representative data source and the most recent survey of criminal victimization in Taiwan. Besides sociodemographic data, the survey also contains data on social activity to assess the routine activity model and does not need to rely on social demographics as proxy measures of lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy &amp; Forde, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11400715">Lynch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11400715">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11400715">Sacco, Johnson, &amp; Arnold, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>As different crime types are presumably different in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>), researchers have advised a crime-specific approach when criminal victimization is studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11400715">Johnson, Bowers, &amp; Hirschfield, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11400715">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11400715">Sacco et al., 1993</xref>), so that “the relative contributions of particular risk factors can be identified and considered independently” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11400715">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>, p. 224). Consistent with the foregoing literature, this study investigated the risk effects of assault, robbery, and larceny victimizations specifically in modeling the prevalence of repeat victimization. Three questions were addressed in this study: (a) to what extent is the prevalence of repeat victimization in Taiwan, (b) what is the relationship between the daily/routine activity indicators and victimization incidents across different types of offenses, and (c) does the Western model of victimization apply within a non-Western context?</p>
<sec id="section1-0306624X11400715">
<title>Routine Activity Patterns</title>
<p>The lifestyle/exposure theory and the routine activities theory adopted the routine activity pattern as the central thesis to formulate propositions. The former was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> and the latter was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen and Felson (1979)</xref>. These two theories are briefly introduced in this section.</p>
<p>Studying victimization data across eight states in the United States in 1972, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> found that the probability of becoming victims was determined by individuals’ daily routine behaviors. The routine daily activities included “vocational, such as work, school, keeping house etc., and leisure activities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>, p. 241). These behavioral patterns were reflective of individuals’ social characteristics, such as age, gender, marital status, and family income. Those who were young, male, single, and poor tended to experience a higher risk of victimization than their old, female, married, and wealthy counterparts. The rationale behind this finding was directed toward role expectations ascribed to personal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11400715">Garofalo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11400715">Meier &amp; Miethe, 1993</xref>). Traditionally, for instance, females were expected to assume child-rearing and household-related work, which required a fair amount of time within the household. According to routine activity theorists, being involved in activities near home or at home decreased the risk of encountering potential offenders on the street. Females tend to have lower public exposure than males and are thus less likely to be victims of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen and Felson (1979)</xref> examined the link between routine activities and upward trends in crime in the United States from 1947 to 1974, finding that differential lifestyle or behavioral patterns would augment or inhibit the level of risk for victimization, similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al.’s (1978)</xref> study. They further postulated that crime occurrence required three congruent elements: (a) motivated offenders, (b) suitable targets, and (c) the absence of guardian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>). Engaging in activities that expose individuals to a public setting elevates the likelihood of direct-contact predatory violations committed by potential offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>). Going to bars or shopping malls, for example, creates opportunities to contact potential assailants and pocket pickers. Lessening criminal opportunities might change victimization risk despite the presence of motivated offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen and Felson (1979)</xref> agreed that crime does not happen at random; some groups with some behavioral patterns or lifestyles would be more likely to put themselves in greater danger of victimization than others. These two theories may differ in terminology, but they share similar underlying assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11400715">Garofalo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11400715">Wittebrood &amp; Nieuwbeerta, 2000</xref>), and subsequent research has had little or no tendency to distinguish between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11400715">Tischler, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Going beyond analyzing victimization rates across personal characteristics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> extended their research to multiple victimizations and confirmed an unequal victimization distribution among victims, which directed them to speculate that some respondents in their study were “victimization prone” (p. 130). To elaborate, the person or the household that reported being victimized once had a higher risk to be victimized by the same type of offense subsequently than the person or household that did not report victimization. There was also an interaction between personal and household victimizations in that if one person in the household was victimized, the probability that another person residing in the same household would also be victimized increased. They suspected that the area where these victims lived might play a role in explicating the correlation. Although Hindelang et al. did not directly test the effect of personal attributes on repeat victimizations, they posited that those with particular characteristics who suffered victimization were also predisposed to repeat victimizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0306624X11400715">
<title>Relevant Studies</title>
<p>Although much of the literature on criminal victimization has provided evidence of repeat victimization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11400715">Farrell, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11400715">1995</xref>), relatively few studies have sought to explain the distribution of victimization risk. Four studies were found that identified vulnerable subgroups and modeled the frequency of incidents on the pattern of routine activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen &amp; Quinet, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn and Tseloni (1998)</xref> analyzed the 1992 British Crime Survey to predict household victimization with household attributes and neighborhood characteristics. They found that the age of the household’s head was negatively correlated to predicted victimization, compatible with the hypothesis. In addition, there was a positive effect between household wealth and crime but a negative effect between area affluence and crime. This result suggested that relatively wealthy households located in poor neighborhoods would experience a high proportion of crimes. Osborn and Tseloni concluded that the concentration of household property crimes was attributed to the households with vulnerable characteristics, lending support to the routine activity proposition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen and Quinet (1995)</xref> introduced the notion of deviant behavior as a type of lifestyle and tested whether deviant behavior and initial victimization, besides traditional demographics, were linked to risk factors for repeat larceny, assault, vandalism, and robbery incidents over time. Making use of the first five waves of National Youth Survey, they found the overall investigated variables, particularly deviant involvement, to be associated with the observed phenomena. However, as unexplained variance was also captured, they speculated that some individual variables that persisted among respondents were not specified in their model, which might be related to biological or psychological factors such as physical vulnerability or risk-taking propensity, or contextual sociological factors such as neighborhood disorders.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al. (2004)</xref> examined burglary incidents drawn from the 1994 British Crime Survey, the 1994 National Crime Victimization Survey, and the 1993 Police Monitor in the Netherlands. Prevention measures, urban areas, lone parenthood, and a location with 250,000 people or more presented significant effects across the three data sets. The direction of prevention measures, surprisingly, ran contrary to the hypothesis that homes without security measures were less likely to be burglarized than those with protective devices. They rationalized that security devices were possibly installed as a response to burglary rather than security devices attracting burglars. Tseloni et al. considered the effect of the routine activity indicators on burglary in their study to be “modesty” (p. 87).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson (1984)</xref> compared one-time and two-time victims to multiple personal victims with the 1982 British Crime Survey. From the data he asserted that the variables explaining victims and nonvictims were consistent with those among multiple personal victims. That is, victims of multiple personal crimes tended to be male, young, single, and unemployed, supporting the proposed statement made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> regarding some specific groups of people who were prone to repetitive victimization.</p>
<p>The cited criminal victimization studies are important in that they have contributed to an enhanced understanding of multiple victimizations within a routine activity framework. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn and Tseloni’s (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al.’s (2004)</xref> studies focused on burglary victimization, such studies on multiple personal victimizations have been greatly underinvestigated. While examining multiple personal victimizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson’s (1984)</xref> study did not disaggregate the personal victimization data by offense, which might offset the effects pertinent to different types of personal crimes. Moreover, Gottfredson performed descriptive analysis that was unable to control for confounding effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen and Quinet (1995)</xref> specifically connected deviant lifestyles to criminal victimization, but their model used a summary number of deviant lifestyle attributes and provided no detailed information on what activities and places posed more danger than others.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson (1984)</xref> argued that the routine activity model applies to both binary victims and nonvictims and repeat victims, as noted previously. As routine activity has been primarily applied to explain the dichotomous risk of crime victimization, the findings from these studies provide a reasonable foundation for modeling repeat victimization. A review of some victimization studies on micro-level routine activity patterns with victims and nonvictims follows.</p>
<p>Citing the lack of direct lifestyle variables emerging in previous studies to support demographics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al. (1987)</xref> added two lifestyle variables extracted from the 1975 National Crime Victim Survey to their analyses of violent and personal crimes. These two variables consisted of the frequency of nighttime entertainment and respondents’ major activity that was categorized by “unemployed, retired, homemakers, or unable to work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>, p. 187). The results showed a strong interaction effect between the lifestyle variables and property victimization but not on violent victimization. They speculated that violent crimes were inclined to be “spontaneous,” “impulsive,” and “expressive,” which deviated from the underlying rational characteristics embedded in the routine/lifestyle model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>, p. 192). Using a domain-specific approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11400715">Lynch (1987)</xref> examined victimization at work based on demographics and work-related variables, derived from the lifestyle patterns. The former included race, gender, and age, and the latter included how frequently respondents handled money as part of their job, whether respondents’ workplace was open to the public, and how many contacts on average respondents faced weekly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11400715">Lynch, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11400715">Lynch (1987)</xref> found that the personal attribute variables were not significantly related with work victimization, whereas all aspects of work-related measurements predicted victimization as expected.</p>
<p>Utilizing the data from the 1984 Canadian Urban Victimization Study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy and Forde (1990)</xref> employed individual characteristics and nighttime and daytime activities as independent variables to observe victimizations for burglary, robbery, assault, and vehicle theft. Daytime activity was operationalized as respondents’ main occupation and nighttime activity was coded as the frequency per month going to sporting events, bars, movies, visiting friends, and so on. Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al.’s (1987)</xref> study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy and Forde (1990)</xref> found that the individual demographics, particularly young males, performed better than other variables in predicting victimization. They argued, however, that routine activities could not be ignored and should still be taken into account, particularly, going out at night for entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy &amp; Forde, 1990</xref>). Drawing on the data set with a sample of 1,939 respondents surveyed in the Netherlands in 1996, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11400715">Wittebrood and Nieuwbeerta (2000)</xref> observed the effect of previous victimization and patterns of routine activities on seven types of crimes. It was found that the social characteristics correlates, such as education, gender, age, and marital status, showed more explanatory power than previous victimization for several types of offences.</p>
<p>Two cross-cultural risk analyses studies that tested the routine activity model have been presented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11400715">Maxfield, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11400715">Van Dijk &amp; Steinmetz, 1983</xref>). Analyzing the victimization data from the Netherlands and Vancouver (Canada), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11400715">Van Dijk and Steinmetz (1983)</xref> summarized that the young people below 25 years of age and going out at night frequently appeared to be the strongest variables explaining street crime victimization in both countries. These two variables were also associated with victims of breaking and entering private residences and motor vehicle theft in Vancouver but not in the Netherlands. They claimed that the nonsignificant result might be due to very few cases of these two types of crime reported in the Netherlands. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11400715">Maxfield (1987)</xref> compared personal and household victimization risks between the United States and England and Wales using the 1983 National Crime Survey and the 1982 British Crime Survey, respectively. He found that household characteristics significantly affected property victimization, and nighttime activities were correlated with personal victimization for both countries.</p>
<p>Other than testing the connection between delinquent behavior and the distribution of criminal victimization, as noted previously, Lauritsen et al. conducted other studies using different sources of data to examine whether there was a significant difference in delinquent lifestyle between victim and nonvictim among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen, Laub, &amp; Sampson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen, Sampson, &amp; Laub, 1991</xref>). The results supported their hypotheses that delinquent activities had a direct effect on various types of victimization. Influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen et al.’s (1991)</xref> research on offending and victimization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11400715">Mustaine and Tewksbury (2000)</xref> differentiated risk factors for assault victims, offenders, and victim-offenders among college students according to students’ lifestyles and sociodemographic characteristics. They found that these three groups had more differences in characteristics than similarities, suggesting that detailed and focused lifestyle measurements should be used for victimization risk of different subgroups.</p>
<p>A more recent study on risk for criminal victimization using the lifestyle/routine activity model was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11400715">Messner, Lu, Zhang, and Liu (2007)</xref> in Tianjin, China. Observing personal theft, swindling, robbery, and assault, the authors hypothesized that personal characteristics and lifestyle activities may have differential effects on risk victimization. Involvement in activities away from home, such as eating out at restaurant and taking public transportation, would enhance a person’s visibility and accessibility by potential perpetrators. They concluded that their lifestyle explanatory indicators did not predict well in accounting for personal violence, consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al.’s (1987)</xref> study but contrasting with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy and Forde’s (1990)</xref>.</p>
<p>These studies formed micro-level routine activity variables but limited their scope by using a binary victim/nonvictim dependent variable, which did not account for the distribution of multiple victimization incidences. For repeat victimization studies, it is important to employ the entire distribution of victimization events because the effects and “factors which influence repeat victimization may differ from those that explain an isolated crime experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>, pp. 67-68).</p>
<p>Considering the constraints that appeared in previous relevant research, this study was concerned with modeling the distribution of assault, robbery, and larceny victimizations with the routine activity model as a theoretical framework. A variety of direct lifestyle variables were specified in the testing model. Negative binominal regression was performed to analyze criminal victimization counts. This study expanded the empirical test to a non-Western context in Taiwan.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>To explore the relationship between individuals’ routine patterns and the frequency of their victimizations, this study drew the data from the 2005 Taiwan Areas Criminal Victimization Survey administered by the National Police Agency in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11400715">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>). The samples of the 2005 survey were selected through a multistage stratified sampling method among the population of persons aged 12 or older who were chosen at random from each selected household. A computer-assisted telephone interview system was used to record answers so that human errors with handwritten answers could be minimized.</p>
<p>To ensure the quality of interviews, the interviewers were monitored and their interviews were recorded throughout the course of the investigation from February 18 to April 15, 2005. A total of 18,046 valid surveys were collected with a response rate of 72.2%.</p>
<p>This survey contained a series of questions regarding respondents’ experiences of selected victimizations, such as robbery, assault, larceny, burglary, auto theft, and so on as well as the times and places where these incidents occurred. In addition, data were collected on respondents’ daily routines, reactions to the incidents, attitude toward the police, and actions taken in response to the incidents. The reference period of the investigation was from January 1 to December 31, 2004. For more detailed information about this survey, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11400715">Kuo, Cuvelier, and Chang (2009)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section5-0306624X11400715">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The three dependent variables for the present study were the distribution of assault, robbery, and larceny victimizations. Assault, as defined in the Taiwanese legal statutes, included physical attacks or health damage. Robbery involved property being taken by force or threat of force. Larceny referred to valuables stolen from individuals or vehicles without the victim’s awareness. The violating behaviors included both attempts and completions. This study defined those who suffered the same type of criminal victimizations two or more times in a given period as “repeat victims.” Two questions in the survey were used to construct the dependent variables. The first was a screening question that asked whether the respondents had been victimized by a selected crime (e.g., assault, robbery, larceny, etc.) during the year prior to the survey. If the answer was positive, the question “How many times?” was asked. The counts were coded as the actual number reported by the victims. The respondents who replied did not experience any of the targeted crimes during the reference period were scored as 0.</p>

<sec id="section6-0306624X11400715">
<title>Explanatory Variables</title>
<p>Demographics and personal lifestyle measurements were included to represent the routine activities in both direct and indirect ways. Demographics consisted of age, gender, family income, education, and marital status. Replicating the measures shown in previous research, direct daily routine activity was captured by respondents’ major activity (employment status), various nighttime activities, and the frequency of going out at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Cantor, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11400715">Miethe &amp; Meier, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy &amp; Forde, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Respondents’ age was transformed from original 14 response categories to 3 groups: 12-34 years old (1), 35-54 years old (2), and above 55 years old (reference group). Gender was denoted based on the biological distinction: females (0) and males (1). Nine categorical options were provided for family monthly income in the original data, from less than US$1,212 to more than US$2,801. This variable was collapsed into the following groups: &lt;US$1,212 (income low = 1), between US$1,212 and US$2,424 (income medium = 2), and more than US$2,424 (reference group). Respondents’ level of education was distinguished between “below college” (0) and “college or above” (1). For marital status, the respondents reporting being married or cohabiting were classified as 1 (<italic>married or cohabiting</italic>), and those checking the remaining response options, never married, divorced, separated, and widowed, were coded as 0 (<italic>not married or cohabiting</italic>). Major activity was operationalized as employment status: homemaker/retired (1), employed/student (2), and unemployed/daily labor (reference group). The homemaker/retired category of people was theorized to have a relatively low risk for being victimized. It was assumed that homemakers spent more time at home doing household-related chores, diminishing the risk of contacts with strangers who might potentially threaten their safety in public areas. A study on the leisure life of the retired and elderly people in Taiwan suggested that these people were likely to engage in a “static” and “less active” lifestyle, such as reading newspapers, watching TV, playing with grandchildren, or religious worship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11400715">Chen, 2003</xref>, p. 98; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>, p. 596), which would be associated with a low predicted rate of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>). Although the employed people or students presumably spent substantial amounts of time outside the home, they were considered to have a minimal exposure to the risk of victimization being in a “sheltered” or “protective” environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Cantor, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>, p. 253). As opposed to the other two categories, the unemployed or those who did not have a steady job were thought to have the most risky lifestyle for two reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Cantor, 1980</xref>). First, they tended to be predominantly groups of young and poor people who were likely to associate with the persons who held similar characteristics and who would be most likely to commit crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>). Being around people with higher likelihood of having offender characteristics, they placed themselves in a victimization-prone environment, escalating the risk of being victimized. Moreover, the unemployed/daily labor might have more leisure time to spend outside the home, heightening the opportunities to interact with a large number of people who might be possible offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The nighttime activity variable was measured by an item that asked what activities respondents normally engaged in when going out at night during the year before the survey was administered. Fourteen options were provided, including going to work, to school, to restaurants, to pubs, and so on (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11400715">Table 1</xref>). Each individual categorical option was dichotomized. That is, those who checked the option “going to work” were scored as 1 (<italic>at work</italic>) and the remaining as 0. The respondents who answered “going to school” were given 1 (<italic>at class</italic>) and others 0. This coding pattern was applied to the rest of the response options. Another variable describing the routine behavior was the number of times going out in the evening per week. It was hypothesized that the more frequently the respondents went out at night, the higher risk they would expose to danger and in turn be victimized than those who went out at night less frequently.</p>

<p>It should be noted that not all variables that have been reported in the literature as significant explanations of victimization were available in the current data.

<title>Control Variable</title>
<p>Social disorganization theorists suggested that physical proximity to high crime areas significantly affected individuals’ risk of falling victim to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11400715">Meier &amp; Miethe, 1993</xref>). In this study, physical proximity to crime-ridden areas served as a control variable and was proxied by respondents’ perception of community safety, including the following three items: (a) to what extent is the concentration of youth loitering within 200 meters of your neighborhood; (b) to what extent is the concentration of fighting, violence, and scuffling within 200 meters of your neighborhood; and (c) to what extent is the concentration of the entertainment establishments (e.g., arcades, pool halls, gambling pachinko stores, etc.) within 200 meters of your neighborhood? The optional responses included four ordinal categories and were recoded as “very serious (5),” “serious (4),” “not serious (2),” and “not serious at all (1).” “Don’t know” was also an option, which was treated as a neutral response (3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306624X11400715">1</xref></sup> Responses for the three items were summed up to construct an index, which was named as “perception of community disorganization” (Cronbach’s α coefficient = .73).</p>

<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>The Poisson formulation is used to model counts as dependent variables with the assumption that mean and variance are equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>). In the current data set, the distribution of the three crimes has a highly positive skew with a long tail of low repeat victimization counts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11400715">Table 2</xref>). The sample variances of all three crimes exceed the mean, and the observed dispersion of assault, robbery, and larceny is 2.8, 2.3, and 2.0, respectively, signifying overdispersion. A further look at the coefficient of variation for the three crimes corroborated the observed overdispersion: 2.5 in assault, 1.9 in robbery, and 1.7 in larceny. Although overdispersion is common in practice, it violates the assumption of the Poisson process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11400715">McCullagh &amp; Nelder, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11400715">Osgood, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). To correct for overdispersion with count data, the compound model of negative binominal regression has been proposed as an alternative to Poisson models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). Also, following previous studies, the number of victimizations reported by respondents was truncated because of unreliable human memories possibly emerging when many events were involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). Because there were very few or no respondents having more than six victimizations in any crime categories, those with seven or more incidents were removed from the analysis. No substantial differences in results were found before and after the truncation.</p>

<p>To differentiate the varying effects of demographics and daily-basis activity correlates on victimizations across crime types, two models were built for each type of victimization. Specifically, Model I analyzed demographics only and Model II (full model) introduced both demographics and routine activity correlates. The perception of community disorganization (control variable) was included in both models. Before proceeding to multivariate analysis, collinearity among predictors was diagnosed and no high correlation coefficient was detected (<italic>r</italic> &lt; .55).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11400715">Table 2</xref> presents the observed frequencies of assault, robbery, and larceny victimizations. The distribution pattern in this victimization data remarkably resembles those collected in Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen and Quinet, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11400715">Sparks, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). In all three categories of crimes, the majority of respondents reported zero incidents, followed by a relatively small proportion of respondents victimized once and by an even smaller group reporting more than one incident. Variation was found across these three crimes, however. The larceny victimization prevalence (11.2%) is almost 19 to 13 times more than assault (0.6%) and robbery (0.9%) prevalence, respectively.</p>
<p>As for repeat victimization, the prevalence for both assault and robbery incidents is 0.2%, and for larceny is 3.7%. The significance of repeat victimization is evident from the fact that more than half of the assault (55.6%) and larceny (56.7%) incidents were concentrated on 0.2% and 3.7% victims in the total population. Also, only 0.1% robbery victims in the total population reported more than one third (37.8%) of robbery incidents. The distributional pattern in criminal victimization displayed in this data paralleled that found in Western victimization with a minority of victims accounting for a large proportion of incidents. Although the repeat victimization phenomenon has been studied through examining large-scale victimization data in Western criminological literature for more than two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11400715">Farrell, 1995</xref>), this study was the first attempt to explore the phenomenon in Taiwan with a representative national sample.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11400715">Table 1</xref> outlines descriptive analyses of demographics, the routine activity, and the control variables.</p>
<p>The estimated effects of independent variables in relation to the number of incidents for each crime are set out in the exponents of coefficients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11400715">Table 3</xref>). A comparison with a χ<sup>2</sup> distribution between the null model and the models with explanatory variables revealed that each individual model was significant at the .001 level. This indicated that the explanatory variables provided important information for predicting the selected criminal victimizations. The relationships between the theoretically based independent variables and each crime are discussed later.</p>

<title>Assault</title>
<p>In Model I, all social demographic variables were significantly associated with the assault victimization, with an exception of the “income low” category (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11400715">Table 3</xref>). Of these significant demographic predictors, the direction was consistent with the routine activity proposition. Female respondents were about 39%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = .612, less likely to be assaulted than males. Young and middle-aged people were almost two times, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 2.024 and 1.964, respectively, more likely than old people to be attacked physically. The respondents with less than a college education and those who were classified as not married were about twice as likely to be assaulted, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 1.631 and 2.010, than those with higher education who were married. Although it was assumed that rich people have the ability to live in good neighborhoods with relatively low odds of being victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11400715">Meier &amp; Miethe, 1993</xref>), the data showed differently. The respondents with medium income had lower odds of being victimized, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = .566, than those with high family income. The contrasting finding may involve the different definition and perception of what is a “good” location to reside for Taiwanese people and the people in the United States, which will be explained in the discussion section.</p>
<p>Adding the routine activity indicators to the equation, Model II (the full model) demonstrates that the effect of gender, education, medium income, and marital status remained significant, although there were some changes in the magnitude, for example, from as small as an increase of 5.6% in the coefficient for education to as high as a decrease of 9% for the marital status coefficient. The coefficient for age (with a reduction of 24% in the magnitude) became nonsignificant, implying that the higher rate of victimization for young people was partially attributable to their lifestyle. The major activity (employment) in Model II was significantly correlated with the criminal victimization in the expected direction. Both homemaker/retired and employed/student were 68%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = .320, and 46%, Exp (B) = .536, less likely to be victimized, respectively, than those who fell in the category of unemployed/daily labor. Also, the respondents who reported going out at night to work, to theaters, libraries, or art (music) performances were two to three times more likely to be victims than those who did not report engaging in these activities at night. Conversely, for those who visited friends and relatives at night experienced a 52%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = .477, decrease in odds of being victimized by assault. As being outside of home at night was considered to be exposed to danger, being with friends or relatives appeared to enhance guardianship and prevent crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>). The control variable “the perception of community disorganization” was positively related to victimization across these two models, as predicted.</p>

<title>Robbery</title>
<p>Aside from the control variable, gender was the single statistically significant variable in explaining robbery victimization for both Models I and II. The direction of the control variable followed the theoretical proposition. Females experienced nearly twice the likelihood—Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 1.661 in Model I; Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 1.845 in Model II—of being robbed than males, contrary to the expectation. In Model II, the magnitude of the effect for gender increased approximately 11.1% with an addition of the daily routine indicators, suggesting that possessing some attributes that are unique to females might elevate the level of target attractiveness from the potential violators’ perspective. Further explanation of this finding will be covered in the Discussion section.</p>

<title>Larceny</title>
<p>Without controlling for the routine activity correlates, Model I showed that all social demographics were significantly associated with larceny victimization. The odds of being victims of larceny for females were about 28%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = .715, lower than males, supportive of the theoretical assumption. For those who were young (age &lt; 34 and age &lt; 35-54) and who had educational attainment below college, the odds of being victimized were around 100%—Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 2.169 and 2.086—and 21%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 1.210, greater, respectively, than those who were older (age &gt; 55) and those with higher education, in concert with the assumption. The respondents with lower economic status and not married, nevertheless, were less likely to be victims of larceny than those with opposite characteristics, contradictory to the proposed model.</p>
<p>Demographics remained significant in Model II with a slight increase or decrease in coefficients, similar to the pattern found in assault victimization. Of the major activity categories, the employed/students had odds of being victims about 24%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 1.242, greater than the unemployed and daily labors, inconsistent with the proposition. The nighttime activities that exposed respondents to risk and increased the odds of being victims included going to work, to classes, to restaurants, for shopping, to discotheques, to nightclubs, to Internet cafes or pubs, and so on. These results confirmed that out-of-home activities at night posed a higher danger for having fewer potential guardians than did daytime activities, increasing the risk of victimization. It was also found that as the frequency of going out at night increased by 1 time per week, the respondents were 5%, Exp (<italic>B</italic>) = 1.052, more likely to report being larceny victims, supporting the routine activity model. Finally, conforming to the theoretical assumption, the relationship between the perception toward community disorganization and the likelihood of victimization was positively correlated. The inconsistent results generated from family income, marital status, and major activity associated with larceny victimization may be related to the concept of “target suitability” noted by Cohen and Cantor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11400715">1980</xref>, p. 156), which will be explicated in the next section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study assessed the routine activity model at the micro level by modeling the number of three types of criminal victimizations. The large-scale representative 2005 victimization data in Taiwan included the frequency of victimization incidents and personal attributes as well as detailed daily routine behaviors, which offered an opportunity to explore the victimization concentration and risk of victimization in a non-Western social/cultural setting. Negative binomial regression was performed to analyze highly dispersed victimization counts. Some results replicated the findings in agreement with routine activity propositions and previous research but some divergent patterns emerged as well. This section begins with an illustration of general observations, followed by plausible explanations to conflicting results. Relevant Western research and context will be associated with some of the conflicting and supporting results of this study and will be incorporated whenever appropriate throughout the section.</p>
<p>First, the 2005 Taiwan criminal victimization data provided evidence that the repeat victimization phenomenon in Taiwan is similar to the pattern discovered in some Western victimization studies, in which a minority group of repeat victims reported the majority of criminal victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11400715">Tseloni et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson (1984)</xref> found that 14% of respondents reported around 70% of all victimization incidents in the 1982 British Crime Survey. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen et al.’s (1995)</xref> study of the National Youth Survey, more than 78% of the respondents experienced two or more criminal incidents of robbery, assault, vandalism, and larceny victimization, respectively.</p>
<p>Second, the results reconfirmed that risk factors for criminal victimization should be crime specific and that different types of crime are attributed by different indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11400715">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen &amp; Quinet, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11400715">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11400715">Sacco et al., 1993</xref>). Education in this study, for example, had an impact on increased likelihood of becoming assault and larceny victims but not robbery. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen and Quinet’s (1995)</xref> study on repeat victimization among adolescents, age was correlated with robbery and larceny victimization but had no effect on assault and vandalism risk. Moreover, although gender was found to be significantly related to the three types of crime victimization in this study, the direction varied across crime types: Females faced a lower risk of assault and larceny than males but a higher risk of being victimized for robbery. This indicated aggregating crime data would confound the interaction with gender and lose explanatory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11400715">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1999</xref>), and it also showed that the importance of specifying crime types to identify respective contributing factors could not be overemphasized.</p>
<p>Third, the demographic indicators generally performed well in accounting for criminal victimizations, agreeing with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy and Forde’s (1990)</xref> study. Nevertheless, the less prominent results in the routine activity indicators should not be disregarded, particularly nighttime activities, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11400715">Kennedy and Forde (1990)</xref> reported. In the current study, going out at night for work was associated with elevated risk of assault, whereas visiting friends was associated with reduced risk. In addition, the effect of the routine activity model was pervasive in larceny victimization and was consistent with some previous suggestions that the routine activity model might well explain property crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11400715">Messner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11400715">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1998</xref>). The explanation might be that the rational assumption underlying the routine activity model corresponded to the nature of property crimes as opposed to spontaneous and impulsive nature in violent crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>). Finally, the general support for the routine activity theory reinforced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11400715">Hindelang et al.’s (1978)</xref> hypothesis and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11400715">Gottfredson’s (1984)</xref> study that the theory may predict variation in both binary victims and nonvictims and the clustering of risk. Several unexpected results, however, were produced and will be discussed as follows.</p>
<p>In assault victimization, affluent people were more likely to be victimized than those less economically privileged. Theoretically, people who were economically capable should have greater flexibility to choose better residential areas, such as suburban or rural zones, and in turn encounter less victimization than those who cannot afford expensive housing in the noted areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11400715">Meier &amp; Miethe, 1993</xref>). This theoretical assumption has been empirically verified by prior Western research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen &amp; Quinet, 1995</xref>). Two studies using the National Youth Survey consistently found that the respondents from wealthy families reported less assaultive incidents than those from poor families across different time points of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen &amp; Quinet, 1995</xref>). However, this result was not supported by the 2005 Taiwan criminal victimization data. The opposite result might be the disparate view on favorable living areas for affluent Taiwanese and Americans.</p>
<p>In the United States, the terms “inner city” or “urban areas” convey a negative connotation related to poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11400715">Teitz &amp; Chapple, 1998</xref>). Those who are financially capable favor living in suburban or rural residence that is seen as safer than living in the central city. By contrast, in Taiwan, the inner city or urban areas are generally related to prosperity, and many Taiwanese tend to choose to dwell as near to the central city as possible. Part of the reason for this tendency might be the advantages they could obtain from the well-established public infrastructure in cities, such as the efficient public transportation network, education, shopping, and other modern amenities. Unlike the United States, Taiwan’s housing in urban areas is much more expensive than that of in suburban or rural areas, and a substantial number of Taiwanese make efforts to own a condominium or rent an apartment in the city but fail to do so because of their tight budgets. As the public infrastructure brings convenience to daily life for residents, it also attracts businesses and gathers a crowd for various activities. As zoning ordinances do not separate residential and commercial areas in Taiwan the way they do in some parts of the United States, residences, restaurants, shopping malls, stores, business offices, or even entertainment establishments in Taiwan are often in close proximity to one another. This confounds Western concepts of social class and the safety of the residence. As high-income Taiwanese are more likely to afford to live closer to the central city, they are also subject to the high crime rates that historically have accompanied highly developed areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11400715">Stahura &amp; Sloan, 1988</xref>). Cross-referencing family income and the perception of community disorganization as a proxy of neighborhood safety, it was found that respondents with the highest family income reported a significantly higher rate of neighborhood disorganization (13%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with those with high incomes considering their neighborhood to have more serious issues of youth loitering, fighting, or entertainment establishments than were reported by respondents with medium (11.5%) or low (10.8%) family income. This provides indirect evidence that the wealthy people might be choosing to live close to prosperous or commercial areas where strangers congregate, elevating the opportunity to confront potential offenders. Certainly, further examination with objective information on respondents’ physical environment is needed to test this speculation in future studies.</p>
<p>Another unexpected result in assaultive victimization was that persons visiting friends and relatives at night experienced less victimization than those taking part in other categories of nighttime events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11400715">Meier and Miethe (1993)</xref> related it to the concept of “capable guardianship” that the availability of others, such as friends, pedestrians, and law enforcement officers, may “prevent crime by their presence alone or through offering physical assistance in warding off an attack” (p. 483). Friends and relatives in this study might serve as both protectors and preventers who deterred the crime from happening.</p>
<p>Gender showed substantial variation in robbery victimization counts, besides the control variable, and female respondents experienced almost three times more increased likelihood of being robbed than male respondents, in contrast to the proposed theory and some Western data. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, for instance, reported that 3.8% of males were robbed compared with 1.4% of females in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11400715">Catalano, 2006</xref>). The National Youth Survey also showed that male adolescents experienced a higher likelihood of being robbed than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauritsen &amp; Quinet, 1995</xref>). Though the result of this study refuted the typical routine activities proposition and the above-noted Western data, it was consonant with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11400715">Yang and Cheng’s (2004)</xref> study on robbery victimization in a southern city in Taiwan. Surveying 809 interviewees above the age of 20 through phones, Yang and Cheng found that the chance for females being robbed was about 5 times that of males. The authors identified two similar behaviors among the female victims that placed them in danger. First, they held their purses in their hands or bags on their shoulders when walking on a street. Second, many victims had their belongings placed on the scooter floor board when riding. Yang and Cheng pointed out that most perpetrators were male motorcyclists who drove-by and snatched the goods from victims. Echoing Yang and Cheng’s study, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11400715">National Police Agency (2010)</xref> released a report from 2007 indicating that 91% robbery victims were females and only 9% of victims were males. Of these female victims, the majority (67.40%) reported being victimized by drive-by motorcyclists and 15.71% reported being victimized by offenders on foot. To this point, scooters or motorcycles apparently played a significant role in robbery incident from both victims’ and offenders’ perspectives. The phenomenon of scooters or motorcycles in Taiwan is quite different from the United States and the prevalence of scooters or motorcycles in Taiwan will be briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Taiwan is extremely compact due to its large population and scarce land for human inhabitation. In 2008, Taiwan had the second highest population density (635.7 persons per square kilometers) among the countries with more than 10 million people around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11400715">The Ministry of the Interior in Taiwan, 2010</xref>). The scooter or motorcycle thus becomes the most popular transportation for its swiftness, convenience, economy, parking ease, and suitability for a short distance travel through narrow streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11400715">Dai, 2005</xref>). It was estimated that 70% of Taiwanese chose scooters or motorcycles as their preferred means of transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11400715">Yang &amp; Cheng, 2004</xref>), giving Taiwan the highest average number of scooters and motorcycles per kilometer of road in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11400715">Dai, 2005</xref>). Scooters and motorcycles are an indispensible transportation tool for Taiwanese people, and it is not surprising that potential offenders also use them to prey on suitable targets as well. Females are attractive targets for potential offenders because valuable items are commonly carried in a visible and accessible position. The motivated motorcyclists could grab the goods, speed up, and escape into the intertwined and narrow alleys or streets. Females of smaller size would present less guardianship and ability to defend against the force of robbers, making them suitable targets. The scooter and motorcycle phenomenon behind the association between gender and robbery illustrates the need to comprehend the social and environmental context when cross-cultural studies are conducted.</p>
<p>The concept of “target suitability” was explicitly used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11400715">Cohen and Cantor’s (1980)</xref> study to account for contrary findings in larceny victimization, which may well apply to the conflicting result in this study that family income and larceny victimization were positively correlated. Cohen and Cantor analyzed 1975-1976 National Crime Survey victimization in the United States, finding that the wealthiest respondents had higher odds of becoming larceny victims than those who were poor. They rationalized by citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11400715">Hindelang’s work (1976)</xref> that the rich individuals might possess more valuables and also be more mobile than the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11400715">Cohen &amp; Cantor, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11400715">Hindelang, 1976</xref>). The potential thieves might view these rich people who were exposed to public places as attractive targets and waited for chances to steal their valuables. Considering that Taiwanese people commonly carry cash, affluent respondents likely have more cash with them than the poor, leading to an increasing risk of their cash being stolen away from home. The concept of “target suitability” will be used again to reason the other two inconsistent variables, marital status, and the “employed/student” category, in relation to larceny.</p>
<p>Presumably, married people would often spend time with their family and have available guardians that reduced the odds of being victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al., 1987</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al.’s study (1987)</xref> supported this presumption, the current data indicated otherwise. This might be due to other lifestyle factors that diminished the level of guardianship and enhanced the risk of larceny. Married people, for example, tended to drive vehicles to transport their family members for entertainment activities, such as dining out, watching movies, or sightseeing during weekends. According to the definition of personal larceny that included belongings taken from vehicles, the behavioral tendency of married people might increase the likelihood of having property stolen from vehicles. Moreover, as married people take their family for entertainment events, they might have substantial amount of cash with them for family leisure expenses, elevating the attractiveness to potential pickpockets.</p>
<p>The final unexpected finding in larceny victimization was that the employed/students were more likely to be larceny victims than those who were unemployed/daily labor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11400715">Miethe et al. (1987)</xref> justified that work and school activities were “patterned” and “recurrent,” which took place repeatedly and could be predicable from the view of motivated offenders (p. 187). Given the common practice of using cash for transactions in Taiwan, the employed/students might bring cash outside the home for daily meals, paying fees, buying goods, or stationeries. A predicable traveling route plus the possession of money constituted the components of an appealing target for motivated thieves.</p>
<p>Possible explanations cannot be verified until the measurements, such as whether and how much cash respondents usually carry, and respondents’ objective surrounding living situations, are collected and tested empirically. The absence of these measurements in our data needs to be rectified by the future studies. In addition, it is well known that survey research is subject to various sources of errors, such as interviewers’ bias and respondents’ false memories or integrity. Even though the 2005 survey had been refined and the computer-based technology was used to reduce human errors over the course of data collection, it may not be possible to exclude errors completely from the survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306624X11400715">2</xref></sup> The results of this study, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Most repeat victimization studies have focused on describing the prevalence of the phenomenon. Characteristics associated with those who were repeatedly victimized, however, have not been fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11400715">Osborn &amp; Tseloni, 1998</xref>). This study added insights to contemporary knowledge of such characteristics and to the evaluation of the theoretical model. The 2005 Taiwan criminal victimization data showed the existence of a concentration of repeat victimization. The multivariate analysis at a general level indicated the applicability and utility of the routine activity model developed in a Western culture for identifying the groups in the population who experienced the most victimization. The generation of divergent findings, such as females being robbed at a higher rate than males in Taiwan, illuminated the significance of the broader sociocultural context in building an association between risk predictors and the concentration of criminal victimization. Borrowing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11400715">Lauristen et al.’s study (1995)</xref>, the contradictory results and nonsignificant variance may also reflect untapped information on respondents’ biological features (e.g., relative weakness or physical size) and psychological tendencies (e.g., risk-taking predisposition associated with deviant involvement). This study was limited by the unavailability of such contextual, biological, and psychological indicators. Future victimization research would do well to integrate measurements that are sensitive to salient sociocultural elements of the society being studied and individuals’ biological and psychological traits.</p>

<p>We placed the response “don’t know” at the midpoint (3) for the following reasons. The nature of the three-question items that made up the control variable “perception of community disorganization” was considered relatively insensitive, which presumably respondents would not intentionally avoid answering. Respondents would be aware of the stated conditions about their neighborhoods and answer based on their intuitive feelings and perception regarding their neighborhoods. The meaning of “don’t know,” therefore, is more reasonably and appropriately interpreted as respondents not knowing whether the existing conditions represent a problem. This translates into a statement of indifference and is therefore scored as a midpoint between a problem and nonproblem.</p>

<p>The 2005 survey used in this study was the second nationally represented crime victimization survey in Taiwan. The first survey took place in 2000, which was administered by the same principal researchers who repeated the 2005 survey. These researchers considered that the 2000 survey might be overcomplex, including questions on crime victimization, respondents’ deviant behavior, the relationships of respondents and their family, and incidents occurring to their family, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11400715">Sheu et al., 2005</xref>), which might affect the validity of the data due to interviewers’ and respondents’ fatigue. To maximize the quality of the data, the researchers redesigned the 2005 survey by simplifying the question items directly relevant to respondents’ victimization experiences.</p>
