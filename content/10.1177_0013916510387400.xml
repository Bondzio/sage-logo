<abstract>
<p>Relationships between transportation noise and the level of annoyance attributed to a certain noise source are well established in adults. Little is known about the noise annoyance in children. The authors assessed the reported annoyance due to different noise sources of 8- to 14-year-old children in a representative population and compared the results with existing data on adults. The primary focus was on road traffic noise because of its pervasiveness. From all over Germany, 1,048 children were randomly selected. They completed a questionnaire regarding living conditions, including noise annoyance from different noise sources such as road traffic noise. The percentage of children’s homes located on busy roads was 16.5%, and approximately half of the children (47.7%) had their bedroom facing the street. Among the 8- to 10-year-olds, 7.3% were annoyed by road traffic noise during daytime (“yes” on a dichotomous annoyance scale). Among the 11- to 14-year-olds, 16.4% were at least “slightly” annoyed by road traffic noise during daytime (sum of the upper four categories of a 5-point annoyance scale). Compared with regularly reported representative data on adults, the relative frequency of children annoyed by road traffic noise at home was considerably lower.</p>

<p>Exposure to transport noise can cause annoyance reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510387400">van Kempen et al., 2009</xref>), sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510387400">World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2009</xref>), cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510387400">Stansfeld et al., 2005</xref>), and stress-induced cardiovascular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510387400">Babisch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510387400">Babisch, Neuhauser, Thamm, &amp; Seiwert, 2009</xref>) in adults and in children. Noise effects in children may be different from those in adults because of the different time–activity patterns of children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510387400">Bistrup, Babisch, Stansfeld, &amp; Sulkowski, 2006</xref>). Adults spend much of their time at their workplace or at home indoors where they may work with noisy appliances and tools. During leisure, adults spend time both indoors and outdoors at home or they go to restaurants, pubs, or cultural events. Children are affected by noise in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510387400">Van den Hazel, Zuurbier, &amp; Bistrup, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510387400">Zuurbier et al., 2007</xref>). They attend child care centers or schools where they may be exposed to ambient and indoor noises. Children play outdoors (in metropolitan areas and regions with a cold climate they play more indoors), visit friends, go to sports or children’s clubs, or visit dance halls when they are older. Children are at risk of acquiring noise-induced hearing impairment from noisy toys and leisure activities, including listening to loud music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510387400">Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, 2008</xref>). Both children and adults are exposed to the same environmental noises while sleeping at night. Children, however, go to bed earlier and sleep longer; thus, they are more exposed during the hours from 8 p.m. to midnight and from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. when environmental noise levels are still (in the evening) or already (in the morning) high. Especially, very young children cannot choose their acoustic environment. They have less control over their environment than adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510387400">Bistrup, Hygge, Keiding, &amp; Passchier-Vermeer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510387400">Passchier-Vermeer, 2000</xref>). Children are therefore often considered a risk group for adverse noise effects. Risk group in this context means that they are more at risk than other groups of the general population.</p>
<p><italic>Noise annoyance</italic> is a term used in general for all negative feelings such as disturbance, dissatisfaction, displeasure, irritation, nuisance, or anger due to noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510387400">Ouis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510387400">van Kempen &amp; van Kamp, 2005</xref>). Noise annoyance as a subjective response toward noise occurs when intended activities of the individual are disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510387400">Guski, Felscher-Suhr, &amp; Schuemer, 1999</xref>). The concept of (subjective) noise annoyance has a long history and has been related to the general stress model, pointing to the fact that adaption, coping, and control over the noise stimulus modify the physiological stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510387400">Glass &amp; Singer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510387400">Guski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510387400">Kroesen, Molin, &amp; van Wee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510387400">Kryter, 1972</xref>). It is well understood that only part of the variance of annoyance ratings is explained by the noise level itself. Nonacoustical factors also play a major role, including attitudes to the noise source, subjective noise sensitivity, satisfaction with the neighborhood, beliefs that noise harms, and individual coping styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510387400">Job, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510387400">1991</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510387400">ISO/TS 15666 (2003)</xref> defines noise-induced annoyance as “one person’s individual adverse reaction to noise. Community noise annoyance is the prevalence rate of this individual reaction in a community, as measured by the responses to questions specified in Clause 5, and expressed in appropriate statistical terms” (p. 2). The association between noise exposure (sound level) and noise annoyance has been heavily studied in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510387400">Miedema &amp; Oudshoorn, 2001</xref>), and standardized exposure–response curves have been established to predict annoyance due to transportation noise in the (adult) population (European Commission Working Group on Dose–Effect Relations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510387400">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510387400">Schultz, 1978</xref>). However, much less is known about the relationship in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510387400">van Kempen et al., 2009</xref>) and about its prevalence in children on a general population level. A few studies using child-adapted standard self-report questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510387400">Fields et al., 1997</xref>) showed that in the home or school environment, children’s noise annoyance increased with increasing aircraft noise level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510387400">Bullinger, Hygge, Evans, Meis, &amp; von Mackensen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510387400">Haines, Stansfeld, Brentnall, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510387400">Haines, Stansfeld, Job, Berglund, &amp; Head, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510387400">Stansfeld et al., 2005</xref>). This is to be expected, assuming that children react similarly to noise as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510387400">Lercher, 2003</xref>). The question, however, is whether there are quantitative differences between child and adult noise annoyance.</p>
<p>We therefore investigated the children’s annoyance due to environmental noise sources in a representative community survey. Similar representative annoyance data were available from adults because the noise annoyance of the adult population in Germany is regularly assessed in 2-year intervals. By questionnaire, the same standardized instruments were used to assess the annoyance in children and adults. This gave us—for the first time—the opportunity to compare the noise annoyance of children with the noise annoyance of adults to see whether children were less, equally, or more affected by noise on a general population level. Besides other noise sources, the primary focus here was on annoyance due to road traffic noise, in particular, because road traffic is the most predominant environmental noise source in our communities. The association between annoyance due to road traffic noise and the type of road (as a determinant of noise exposure) was quantitatively assessed, accounting for the orientation of the children’s bedroom. The presented results are mainly descriptive.</p>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The noise annoyance of 8- to 14-year-old children was assessed in a random population sample within the framework of the German Environmental Survey on Children (GerES IV). This nationwide survey was carried out from 2003 to 2006 by the German Federal Environment Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510387400">Babisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510387400">Becker et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510387400">Schulz, Seiwert, Becker, Conrad, &amp; Kolossa-Gehring, 2008</xref>). Its objective was to determine the children’s exposure and responses to environmental pollutants, explore pathways, and identify risk groups. The basic study program included blood and urine samples, hearing tests, tap water, house dust, and indoor air samples. During the home visits, comprehensive questionnaires were administered in a face-to-face interview to all children and their parents to assess leisure activities, housing conditions, and environmental factors, including noise-related factors. The full interview took 1 to 1.5 hr. To assure that estimates derived from the survey were representative at a national level, survey weights were developed to be applied throughout descriptive statistical analyses to account for deviations of the study sample from German population statistics (reference year 2004) with respect to age, gender, community size, and residence in West or East Germany (for historical reasons). Stratified analyses were carried out regarding aspects of social inequality. For analytic statistical analyses (associations), however, nonweighted data were used.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were a subsample of the broader Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), which was carried out by the Robert Koch Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510387400">Kurth et al., 2008</xref>). The sampling procedure of this cross-sectional survey was based on a two-stage protocol. First, a systematic sample of primary sample units (KiGGS: 167; GerES IV: 150) was drawn from an inventory of German communities stratified by the grade of urbanization and the geographical distribution. At the second stage, an equal number of addresses per birth cohort were randomly selected from local population registers within the primary sample units. Finally, a total of 8, 9, or 10 children per birth cohort (depending on community size) were randomly selected and invited for participation. The final KiGGS study sample included 17,641 children of age 0 to 17 (response rate = 66.6%). In a third step, the GerES IV sample was drawn, which included 1,790 children of 3 to 14 years, who were randomly selected from the pool of respondents (parents) who had given their consent for participation in the survey (response rate = 77.3%). The age cutoff at the lower (3 years) and upper end (14 years) was made a priori because a large amount of biological and chemical tests and analyses were considered for the environmental part of the survey. The pilot study had shown that sufficient amounts of blood and urine were hard to obtain from younger children and that the response rate was much lower in the older children. The total response rate (KiGGS [3- to 14-year-old children] × GerES IV) was 52.6%. The current article refers to the noise protocol of the survey, which based on the results of the prestudy was a priori restricted to 8- to 14-year-old children (<italic>N</italic> = 1,048), which also had a hearing test that was difficult to perform on the younger children. Boys and girls were equally represented in the sample. More information is given in the major technical noise report (in German; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510387400">Babisch, 2009</xref>). All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical software package SPSS 15.</p>

<title>Noise exposure</title>
<p>The parents were asked to classify the type of street on which their home was located (question: “On what kind of street is your house/dwelling located?”; categories: “low-traffic side street,” “moderate-traffic side street,” “heavy-traffic side street,” and “busy main road or major trunk road”). In the case of more than one relevant street, answers were to be given with respect to the busiest street. The parents were also asked whether the child’s room was facing this street. Furthermore, during the home visit, the interviewers as well as the parents rated the traffic volume of the street to which the children’s room windows were facing (question: “Is there a street right in front of the child’s bedroom window? If yes, how busy is the traffic in this street?”; categories: “no street,” “low-traffic street,” “moderate-traffic street,” “busy street,” and “extremely busy street”). No further details were available for “no street” (e.g., backyard, open space, or others). It was shown that the subjective statements regarding the type of road correlated very well with short-term noise measurements that were carried out during the home visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510387400">Babisch et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Noise annoyance</title>
<p>In previous noise studies, various annoyance scales were applied on 8- to 9-year-olds and older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510387400">Lercher, 2003</xref>), including visual analog and verbal (four or five categories) and numerical annoyance scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510387400">Bullinger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510387400">Evans, Hygge, &amp; Bullinger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510387400">Haines &amp; Stansfeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510387400">Haines, Stansfeld, Brentnall, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510387400">Haines, Stansfeld, Job, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510387400">Lercher, Brauchle, Kofler, Widman, &amp; Meis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510387400">Stansfeld et al., 2005</xref>). Following the recommendations of the International Commission on Biological Effects of Noise (ICBEN) for the assessment of annoyance in community noise studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510387400">Fields et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510387400">ISO/TS 15666, 2003</xref>), we used the following question: “When you are here at home, in general, are you disturbed or bothered by (. . . source . . .) noise during daytime? Think about the last 12 months.” Sleep disturbance was assessed using the same construct: “When you are here at home, in general, are you disturbed or bothered by (. . . source . . .) noise when falling asleep or sleeping during nighttime? Think about the last 12 months.” The list of noise sources included road traffic noise, aircraft noise, railway noise, construction noise, neighborhood noise, industrial/commercial noise, noise from members of the family, and others. Regarding the scale for answers, a distinction was made in the questionnaire between the 8- to 10-year-old children (<italic>n</italic> = 448) and the 11- to 14-year-old children (<italic>n</italic> = 600). A dichotomous scale (“yes/no”) was applied to the 8- to 10-year-olds because the prestudy showed that the younger children had difficulties in answering on a graduated scale. A numerical 5-point scale (<italic>not at all</italic>/<italic>slightly</italic>/<italic>moderately</italic>/<italic>very</italic>/<italic>extremely</italic>) was applied to the 11- to 14-year-old children in the style of the German version following the ICBEN recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510387400">Felscher-Suhr, Guski, &amp; Schuemer, 2000</xref>). The cumulative percentages of <italic>at least slightly, at least moderately</italic>, and <italic>at least very</italic> annoyed children were calculated by adding up the percentages in the upper four, three, or two categories, respectively, of this 5-point scale for comparison with other studies. Such aggregated figures are commonly used to report community reactions to noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510387400">Miedema &amp; Oudshoorn, 2001</xref>). The scales and the sources were shown to the children but not the wording which was read to them. The interviewers had the option (not visible to the children) to code “source not existing” if the children said that they could not answer the question because of lack of exposure. In the statistical analyses, this was recoded to <italic>no</italic> or <italic>not at all</italic>, respectively.</p>

The percentage of children who lived in premises (regardless of room orientation) on a busy main road or a major trunk road was 16.5%, 11.7% lived on a heavy-traffic side street, 31.1% on a moderate-traffic side street, and 40.6% on a low-traffic side street. Only a small number had lived for less than a year at their present address (5.9%). Children of low socioeconomic status lived significantly more often in dwellings on a busy main road or major trunk road than children with medium or high socioeconomic status—27.8% vs. 13.5% vs. 11.6%, respectively, χ<sup>2</sup>(6, <italic>N</italic> = 1,048) = 46.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

The effect of social inequality was most pronounced with respect to living on a low-traffic side street (29.5% vs. 42.3%).

<p>Nearly half of the children’s rooms had windows not facing a street. No major differences were found between interviewers and parents when judging the traffic volume in front of the children’s rooms, which suggests that the parents’ answers were reliable in this respect. The parents’ rating was used in the following because it was based on experience with noise throughout the whole day and over a longer period. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916510387400">Table 2</xref> shows the distribution of children over the street-type categories, accounting for the children’s bedroom orientation, whether it was actually facing the street.

Further significant findings in the 11- to 14-year-old children were as follows: They were more annoyed by construction noise during daytime and by noise from family members during the night if they lived in larger agglomerations.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a representative nationwide survey, higher annoyance ratings due to road traffic noise were found in 8- to 14-year-old children who lived on busy roads where noise levels were higher compared with children who lived on side roads of low traffic volume and low traffic noise. Children of lower socioeconomic status were more often affected by road traffic noise than children of medium and high socioeconomic status. The findings regarding the impact of agglomeration size (higher annoyance in larger agglomerations) are plausible because they reflect aspects of population density, living space, and type of housing. The fact that the children were much less annoyed during nighttime than during daytime by noise sources that presumably were more prevalent during the day—for example, construction noise, noise from playgrounds, noise from family members, neighborhood noise—supports the validity of the children’s annoyance reporting. Children from the no-street group were slightly more often annoyed by road traffic noise than the low-traffic group. However, the no-street group—where there was no street in front of the child’s room—could have been exposed to busy road traffic from a distance (background noise). We cannot exclude a certain amount of exposure misclassification for this group.</p>
<p>During daytime, 7.3% of the 8- to 10-year-old children were annoyed by road traffic noise (category “yes” of the 2-point scale). Of the 11- to 14-year-old children, 16.4%, 3.4%, and 0.7%, respectively, were “at least slightly” annoyed (sum of the upper four categories of the 5-point scale), “at least moderately” annoyed (upper three categories), or “at least very” annoyed (upper two categories), respectively, by road traffic noise during daytime. These data, which were representative for the whole of Germany, suggest that 8- to 14-year-old children were less annoyed by road traffic noise than adults on an average population level. According to representative annoyance data (year 2004) on the adult German population, 60%, 30%, and 10%, respectively, were “at least slightly” annoyed, “at least moderately” annoyed, or “at least very” annoyed, respectively, by road traffic noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510387400">Umweltbundesamt, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The children of this representative survey were more annoyed by noise from family members and neighborhood noise than by road traffic noise. During daytime, 13.6% of the 8- to 10-year-old children were annoyed by noise from neighbors (category “yes” of the 2-point scale). Of the 11- to 14-year-old children, 23.4%, 6.0%, and 1.8%, respectively, were “at least slightly” annoyed, “at least moderately” annoyed, or “at least very” annoyed, respectively, by noise from neighbors during daytime. Similar results were found in the Millennium Conference Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510387400">Haines, Brentnall, Stansfeld, &amp; Klineberg, 2003</xref>): The focus group of children of this international sample reported the highest annoyance for “neighbors’ noise at home.” In adults, annoyance due to neighborhood noise often comes second or third after road traffic noise in general population surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510387400">Niemann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510387400">Umweltbundesamt, 2005</xref>). According to the representative data on German adults, 43%, 17%, and 6%, respectively, were “at least slightly” annoyed, “at least moderately” annoyed, or “at least very” annoyed by noise from neighbors. Again, the children were less annoyed than adults on a population level.</p>
<p>One can only speculate why noise from neighbors and noise from family members was rated higher than other noise sources by the children. The informational content of such noises is higher and possibly more disturbing for them than the sound of road traffic. Non-noise-related aspects of negative affectivity toward people in the neighborhood could also play a role. Annoyance is a multifactorial concept that is only partly determined by the noise level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510387400">Guski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510387400">Job, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510387400">Lercher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510387400">Ouis, 2001</xref>). The role of these covarying and contextual factors can differ between children and adults. For example, greater safety concerns concerning road traffic may be responsible for the stronger reactions of children as found in the Inn Valley Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510387400">Lercher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510387400">Lercher et al., 2000</xref>). However, in an experimental study, children felt less annoyed by traffic noise (presented via headphone) when they imagined they were playing than when they imagined they were doing their homework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510387400">Sukowski, Meis, &amp; Lercher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510387400">Sukowski, Meis, Lercher, Heydinger, &amp; Schick, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparisons between children and adults are available based on Swedish representative annoyance surveys carried out in 1999 (general adult population) and 2003 (children and their parents; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510387400">Berglund, Lindvall, &amp; Nilsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510387400">Socialstyrelsen, 2005</xref>). Twelve-year-old children (3%) were less annoyed by road traffic noise than their parents (7%) of the general adult population (9%; question: “feeling annoyed or uncomfortable at least once a week in or near their home”). The relation was similar with respect to the annoyance due to noise from neighbors (2% vs. 6% vs. 9%, respectively). In the Road traffic and Aircraft Noise exposure and children’s Cognition and Health (RANCH) study, which is a large European study on the association between community noise children’s cognition and health, an exposure–response curve was fitted for the association between aircraft noise around schools (average [A] = weighted noise level from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. [L<sub>Aeq,7-23 h</sub>]) and children’s annoyance due to aircraft noise. The polynomial fit showed an increase in the annoyance for noise levels above 50 dB (A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510387400">Stansfeld et al., 2005</xref>). A comparison was made between parents and children with respect to their annoyance due to aircraft noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510387400">van Kempen et al., 2009</xref>). At noise levels (L<sub>Aeq,7-23 h</sub>) above 55 dB (A), the percentage of severely annoyed children (upper two categories of a 5-point annoyance scale) was lower than that of severely annoyed parents. Below 45 dB (A), the opposite was found. Similar results were found with respect to road traffic and railway noise in the Inn Valley Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510387400">Lercher et al., 2000</xref>). Although different annoyance scales were applied for children and their mothers, it could be concluded from this study that children were less annoyed by railway noise than their mothers at levels (L<sub>dn</sub>) above 50 dB (A) and road traffic noise levels above 60 dB (A). However, at traffic noise levels below 55 dB (A), the proportion of highly annoyed was higher in children than in their mothers. Both studies suggest that children are less annoyed by transportation noise than adults at higher noise levels but more annoyed at low noise levels.</p>
<p>The results of our study add to the conclusion that children are more annoyed by noise from family members and neighbors than by transportation noise and that they are subjectively (noise annoyance) less affected by road traffic noise than adults on a general population level. Exposure–response curves of the relationship between noise exposure and noise annoyance for the prediction of noise annoyance have been developed for adults. Future research in this field should put emphasis on the development of similar curves for children, which are largely missing.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Results of the representative GerES IV show that 8- to 14-year-old children seem to be less annoyed by road traffic noise at home than adults on an average population level. The children, in this respect, do not appear to be a particular risk group of the general population. This, however, may be different with respect to other endpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916510387400">World Health Organization, 1999</xref>). Noise from family members and neighbors were found to be a greater nuisance to children than transportation noise.</p>
