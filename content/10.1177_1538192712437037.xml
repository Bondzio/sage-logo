<abstract>
<p>Student learning is enriched by problem-based service learning (PBSL) projects. For Hispanic students, the learning that takes place in PBSL projects may be even more significant, although the research published in academic journals about client-based projects for Hispanic students is limited. This article begins to advance an understanding of how PBSL projects can enhance the learning of Hispanic students. Data were gathered from 5 business courses and approximately 127 students, predominantly Hispanic, who served as consultants for various business organizations.</p>

<p>Although problem-based service learning (PBSL) projects are being used more frequently in higher education, the current job market makes this form of learning more crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192712437037">Maceli &amp; Box, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712437037">West &amp; Simmons, 2011</xref>). Although it is of growing importance to examine the value of this type of learning for all college students, our research indicates Hispanic college students in particular may benefit greatly. In the present study, PBSLs provide enhanced learning within the course and practical experience that is applicable and transferable to the job market. Qualitative journaling methods that were used in the classes as “reflection” techniques have been designated as one of the primary criteria for projects to qualify as “service” learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192712437037">Tretheway, 1999</xref>). The reflection criteria could also have taken the form of a more formal paper where students apply discipline-specific concepts, theories, or scholarly work to their service learning. However, because the intention was to capture students’ reflections throughout the project experience, we chose the journaling approach. Each student was asked to write at least one page per week regarding his or her experiences over the 10-week period of the courses. Reflection helps students take responsibility for their own learning and provides constructive feedback for improving teaching and learning. In addition, reflection is important for both teachers and students because it creates the spirit of a learning partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712437037">Mitchell, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Background Literature</title>
<p>This article examines how real-world problem-based community engagement projects increased the success of Hispanic students in the classroom and offers suggestions for improving learning for this key segment of college students. Learner-oriented techniques such as client-based community engagement projects, rather than traditional teacher-oriented techniques such as exams, and so on, are methods that can accelerate Hispanic students’ learning. Accelerated learning suggests greater success in courses and college achievement. Accelerated learning can be especially important for students who are challenged to fit into the traditional teacher-oriented paradigm.</p>
<p>According to a report entitled <italic>Crossing the Great Divide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712437037">Carnevale &amp; Fye, 2000</xref>), published by the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, New Jersey, Hispanic students were projected to compose 15.4% of our nation’s college enrollment in the year 2015. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192712437037">Smith-Montealegre (2001)</xref> projected that Hispanic student enrollment would increase from 1.4 million to 2.5 million in 2015. Although the increase in Hispanic students attending college might sound like good news, it is only the first part of the predicted scenario for those students.</p>
<p>The second part of the future scenario is that unless Hispanic students’ college and university graduation rates are increased from the current 18% to 20% during their 4 years of college, only a small fraction of the 2.5 million Hispanic students will earn bachelor degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712437037">de los Santos, Hume, &amp; Cortes, 2002</xref>). A significant deficit in graduation rates continues to exist between Hispanic and other ethnic groups. For example, 32% of non-Hispanic White individuals—even though the number of Hispanic students in higher education nearly tripled from 0.4 million in 1975 to 1.1. million in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712437037">Sable &amp; Stennett, 1998</xref>). Aguirre and Turner noted that in 2007 Latinos had the lowest percentage of their population with a high school diploma at 60.6%. This is compared to almost 86% of Asians, 81% of Whites, 80.1%of African Americans, and 76.2% of Native Americans who have a high school diploma. Even more disturbing is that only 12.5% of Latinos in the United States in 2007 had an undergraduate degree or higher compared to 27.5% of the U.S. population as a whole. The dismal high school and college graduation rates of Latinos is alarming, but more alarming is the fact that these rates parallel the growing Latino population in the United States. The percentage of Latinos in the United States rose by 3% from 2000 to 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192712437037">Aguirre &amp; Turner, 2010</xref>). These statistics suggest that as the U.S. population increases the percentage of the population with high school and college degrees will decrease, since much of the population increase is among Latinos.</p>
<p>These statistics reflect a significant problem in terms of waste of human capital and economic losses. College instructors can help shift these statistics through their approach to learning college course material in classrooms that have a significant number of Hispanic students. The economic benefit of doubling college graduation rates of Hispanic students would yield a 400% return on costs. Taxpayers would reap annual benefits projected at US$13 billion in reduced public spending and increased tax contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712437037">Hispanic Scholarship Fund, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to examine the benefits of PBSL projects for Hispanic students, which is especially important to Hispanic Serving Institutions such as the university where the authors serve as instructors. In the present study, student reflections provide assessment and perception data about two key areas of benefits that come from PBSL projects: (1) their view of the learning value of these projects, and (2) their view of the benefits of these projects to their future in the job market. The reflection journal responses were key not only to providing some record of students’ development and perceptions but is also an integral piece of the learning process. This is because, as stated in previous service learning research, service learning must combine needed tasks in the community with intentional learning goals and do so with conscious reflection and critical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192712437037">Kendall, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, it is the reflection that brings the experiential learning full cycle because mere activity does not constitute experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712437037">Dewey, 1980</xref>)</p>
<p>Sharing reflections written in daily journals helps students participate in a reflective thinking and communicative process, which in turn assists them in making meaning out of their applied real-world problem-solving experiences. This further connects them to the theories and concepts discussed in class and found in their text readings. This step allows students to better understand themselves and the organizations in the communities in which they live through a process of reflection, critical analytical thinking, and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192712437037">Teranishi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In looking at the first key area, their perception of learning value of these projects, there are several reasons why this type of learning might be more engaging for Hispanic students. Most Hispanic students in higher education are what are often known in academia as first-generation students—those whose parents did not attend college. At many institutions with predominantly Hispanic students, the average educational level of the students’ parents is less than eighth grade, so students graduating from a university double the education of their parents in just one generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712437037">de los Santos et al., 2002</xref>). Because many Hispanic students have little or no orientation to higher education, they need more learner-oriented pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712437037">de los Santos &amp; Vincent, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Although learner-oriented methods would be more beneficial according to many, it is often teacher-oriented methods, like lecture and discussion with the instructor doing most of the talking, that have traditionally been the most common form of classroom delivery in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192712437037">Michaelsen, 1993</xref>). Although the increase in online courses and the emphasis many educators have placed on student-centered pedagogy as the key to student learning is encouraging, many professors have not changed to these more student-centered pedagogies. The traditional teacher-centered methods result in less than optimum learning for all students—and particularly for Hispanic students. One problem with lectures is that professors on average speak at a rate of about 300 words per minute, even though students process information at 2 to 4 times that rate. This causes all students to experience an attention gap, but because the language in the classroom is often not the language spoken at home, the attention gap for Hispanic students could be even greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437037">Penner, 1984</xref>). Teaching methods that employ learner-oriented techniques, where the primary role is shifted to students, will result in a better learning experience for Hispanic students.</p>
<p>One of the best learner-oriented methods of instruction is real-world PBSLs. PBSL projects are different than many of the other learner-oriented methods in that they provide more than good student-focused learning. These real-world projects also offer students the opportunity to meet, interact, and solve problems for real clients in the local community. This is another facet of these projects that makes this approach key to Hispanic students’ success. As few Hispanic students’ parents hold college-graduate professional work positions or know people in their community who do, Hispanic students have stated that this is a serious disadvantage in securing employment upon graduation—even with a 4-year degree. In business in particular, securing employment is often more about the connections one has, not only the degrees. Allowing students opportunities to make those connections, while also offering an opportunity for optimum learning of the material, has additional benefits for Hispanic students.</p>
<p>One of these additional benefits is having the opportunity to apply skills learned through course material. Not only does this afford students real-world experience to include in their resume but completing these projects also enhances their self-confidence in ways that allows them to “hit the ground running” once they do enter the job market. Previous research suggests that the experience gained through these projects increases self-efficacy, civic participation, career preparedness, and understanding of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712437037">Brown &amp; Roodin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712437037">Kretchmar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192712437037">Ternashi, 2007</xref>). Other studies suggest that students feel more connected to their communities and when they help with solving community problems, they are held in higher regard by that community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712437037">Eyler &amp; Giles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192712437037">Harkavy &amp; Romer, 1999</xref>). In sum, these projects are valuable because they transform not only students’ lives but also the lives of the people within the organizations and businesses they serve.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study, then, was to examine the value Hispanic students’ attached to PBSL projects. The material used in assessing the value attributed to the projects was drawn from daily journals maintained by 127 students, representing four different business communication–oriented courses. There were three primary questions we wanted to answer in assessing journal feedback:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To address the objectives of this study we used a convenience sample of undergraduate students (primarily juniors and seniors) at a California state university that has been designed as Title V campus. This means the campus has been earmarked to be specifically attuned to the needs of ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged students. We assessed students from five courses including two marketing principles sections, a services marketing course, an advertising course, and a public relations course. A total of 46 students did not engage in a client-based project as they took a summer school course, which did not provide time to do a project. We chose to compare student responses in this course to those in courses in which students worked with clients. Eighty-one of the 127 students in the classes completed a problem-based project for a real-world service learning client. The students completed the real-world client projects for local community nonprofit organizations or profit-oriented businesses that required each team to design marketing, advertising, or public relations plans to assist in solving the problems facing these clients. Approximately 59% of the sample were women. The courses included business majors (72%) and communication majors (28%). The courses included in this study were taught by two different instructors. The client-based projects were administered in one section of marketing principles (Fall 2009, 20 students), one section of services marketing (Winter 2010, 15 students), one section of advertising &amp; public relations (Spring 2010, 17 students), and one section of cases in public relations (Spring 2010, 29 students). Student teams engaged in serving as consultants for a range of clients from both profit and nonprofit organizations or businesses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192712437037">Appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>All students had been exposed to team projects in other classes and were familiar with this approach to learning. All courses used a similar format that outlined the project (consisting of an executive summary, introduction, SWOT analysis, marketing advertising/public relations plan, research, evaluations, and conclusions) and grading criteria. In the real-world client-based classes, students were asked to develop a plan based on secondary and primary research data collected by the students. The goals differed by client and by the specific class (in the service marketing class, for example, the emphasis was on a service-based client). In the client-based classes, students were introduced to the project by the instructor and by the client through an initial class visit. Students later engaged in a consultation meeting with the client at a midway point, and a final written and oral presentation was given in the classroom to the client at the end of the course.</p>

<title>Measures and Data Analysis</title>
<sec id="section4-1538192712437037">
<title>Daily journals</title>
<p>Students were asked to keep a daily journal of their reflections from the first face-to-face encounter with the client in the classroom when the client gave an overview of the company or organization and introduced the PBSL project through the final oral presentation and client feedback about that project. Students wrote about their activities and their projects and integrated their reflections on the theories and concepts discussed in class. They also related these concepts to their observations and experiences with the client and company or organization. Journaling was used because qualitative inquiry is the best method for gaining a complete, detailed, and in-depth understanding of Hispanic students’ experiences with the client and with the community. Grounded theory was used to conduct systematic analysis of students’ daily journals to construct a representative theoretical model of the students’ experiential learning. Grounded theory allows for theory development related to complex social phenomena where research is sparse, such as Latina/Latino college students and their specific experiences with service learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712437037">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from the journals were transcribed in a Word document. Through multiple in-depth readings of students’ journals, major themes were coded and organized to examine common, reoccurring themes. Ten broad codes were identified, including understanding of course material, comprehension of concepts, value of applying course concepts, perceiving heightened value in course, enhanced self-confidence, enhanced real-world skills, enhanced future employment opportunities, experience benefits, enhanced community contacts, and enhanced sense of ability to lead. The researchers remained open to continual recategorization after each subsequent reading until saturation was attained, the point at which no new themes emerged. The final coding included three main themes: (1) understanding of and ability to apply course material; (2) confidence to do work, knowledge of skills to do work, job market potential; and (3) changed view of community, altered perceptions of leadership potential.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section6-1538192712437037">
<title>Better Understanding and Application of Course Material</title>
<p>The first overarching theme was reflected by most of the 127 students as they described an enhanced sense of understanding course material and lecture concepts. Monica, a 24-year-old student, reflected on her increased understanding of the concepts and an increased self- confidence in using her skills. She wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Many of the marketing strategies I learned I will use and implement when I get into the real job market. The skills I learned through this project will help me identify marketing problems in any company or organization I work for in the future. It was a great learning experience for someone like me who doesn’t have a lot of “professional” experience to list on a resume.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>John, a 30-year-old undergraduate student, echoed Monica’s view in his journal entries:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think this is a great way to teach the concepts and this real approach enriches the student’s marketing experience. The project was a good experience because it was hands-on application and related marketing material in a way that you could see how it tied to real business problems. The approach is far better than cases or exams. This helped realize that courses where you must apply what you’re learning to real work scenarios is intense when you have many time constraints, but I feel so satisfied that I really know the subject matter now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A 22-year-old business student, Cassandra, confirmed both Monica and John’s sentiments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I enjoyed applying PR and marketing to a new field I didn’t realize could make use of the concepts. As a business student, most classes seem to always focus on how to increase profits. I finally realized that maybe what we are learning is actually applied to the real world. This project was far better than a simulation or case study. Simulation and cases are okay, but more abstract. I will likely use the problem-solving techniques I learned to apply and I feel like I have a better grasp of the concepts. I will remember all of this stuff much longer than if I’d just done some virtual project or read about something.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1538192712437037">
<title>Enhanced Confidence in Skills and Job Market Potential</title>
<p>The second overarching theme that emerged from the journals was enhanced confidence in the ability to not only have a good opportunity at securing professional employment but also to perform at a high level within that job as a result of exposure to real-world application of skills needed. Pedro, a 21-year-old first-generation Mexican American student, expressed the views of many Hispanic students on the campus that the opportunity to apply concepts in a real-world setting had multiple benefits for them. As Pedro outlines, if the student’s parent speaks little or no English, has no professional employment, and has no business contacts in the community, those students can be severely disadvantaged—particularly when the job market has fewer opportunities. Pedro stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My mom doesn’t speak English very well, much less have legitimate employment. Needless to say, she has not been able to be of much help for me in approaching the adult professional work world. I think if a student’s parents are of a different social or economic class, they come into the job market with more knowledge about the system—and more experience and contacts in that professional world of business. Thanks to a class like this and the chance to have access to real-world professionals, I feel like I have a chance in the job market now. I also feel like I can come into any employment situation and I’ll know what I’m doing. I wouldn’t feel this way if I simply read chapters in a book or worked on hypothetical projects. This stuff was real. This was a true learning experience. It was tough at times and really more work than a made-up project, but I really feel like I do the work now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Monica comes from a similar background and reiterated some of Pedro’s sentiments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had a strong team but the work was excruciating at times—more than a fake project. I felt more obligated to do the work right because this was a real person with a real business who could be a good contact in the job market—but only if I did good work. I believe the more students like me have the chance to do these real-world projects for real clients, the better off we’ll be in the job market. Some of us don’t have parents who come from the professional world and can give us the advantages other students have in this community. My mom barely speaks English, much less is able to help me in a professional world. It was tough to do, but I’m so glad I had a chance to do something real. I’m so much more confident now going out into the job market. I know I will have something to say in an interview and can actually perform on the job because I’ve already done it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Roberto confirmed both Pedro and Monica’s views about enhanced job skills and engagement in the community:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This class and having real experiences with a client in the community broadened my skills for management and marketing. I believe I am more prepared now to go into the workforce because of this project. I think I will feel comfortable speaking to prospective employers now and showing my strengths. I would most definitely be proud to include this project in my professional portfolio. I feel like the final product is strong and professional. I have become more seasoned with this experience and confident that I may actually be able to fit into the business community here. I never felt that way before. Now I feel like I could be a part of this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1538192712437037">
<title>Enhanced Sense of Belonging to Professional Community/Potential to Lead</title>
<p>A third theme that emerged in the journals was an altered perception that students could be a valuable part of their community as they gained a sense of confidence in their ability to take the lead in making changes within their community. Although the demographics of the community the university serves is about 37% Hispanic, many of the Hispanic college students expressed feelings of not belonging in a significant contributory way to that community—at the beginning of the course. The journal entries by the end of the course seemed significantly altered. By the end of the course, there was far more commentary suggesting that the students felt they could now contribute to the professional world in the community, and would be viewed as credible, significant members of that community. The journal entries suggest that students felt a new sense of confidence to step out of their comfort zone and not just take part in community organizations but to be at the forefront of those organizations. Veronica, a 27-year-old first-generation college student, stated that she felt she learned how to communicate better with people she was intimidated by in the past. She also stated that the project forced her to deal with real-world professionals and improved her management skills. Veronica confirmed the value of the project to her by saying,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The project pushed me into project-manager mode and improved my leadership skills. Every time I had to speak to the client, I learned to step out of my comfort zone and work with new people I would have been afraid to approach in the past. I learned more about communicating with the person we completed the project for. Because he actually had real problems that needed solutions, I learned you have to be a good listener to be a good communicator and consultant. Our client was very sensitive about his business so it was important to communicate recommendations for that business without being offensive, disrespectful, or condescending. This experience has helped me a lot with communicating with professionals on all levels. I really feel more confident now that I not only have the skills, but I can explain myself orally in an interview and on the job.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Horatio, a slightly older student in his mid-30s and a military veteran, voiced a similar perspective about feeling more engaged in the local community:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had a lot of opportunities to lead in the military and I did. But since I came back, I’ve felt out of place again. We have a near majority of Hispanic people in this community and few who seem to be in positions of power within organizations and businesses. This whole real client experience has been very useful to me and prepared me much better than any book. I think I established a good rapport with our client and he invited me to contact him when I am about to graduate. That made me feel like I’m an accepted part of the professional community here and that makes me want to stay here rather than go somewhere else to work. It’s like I finally felt respected for my knowledge and problem-solving skills. I think we all created some good partnerships for ourselves and our future, but also for the university. Somehow I believe we gained some respect in all this and that was important to me. I have something to show a potential employer.</p>

<p>I believe this project showed me how to connect the dots with the business community and how I can be a valued part of that. I thought my career choices were set before I came into this class. But after having the chance to interact with real clients and feel like they valued and respected me and my work, it has really made me rethink my goals. I used to believe that females could never earn a respected place of leadership in the business world. Now I feel like this is possible for me. I always thought about going somewhere else to work when I graduated, but now I think I might stay.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Students in these courses outlined where the author integrated real-world PBSL projects; this particular segment of students gained the benefits of both real-world skills application and community-based service learning. Overall findings demonstrated that PBSL contributed to students’ understanding and application of course material, increased their confidence in their marketable skills and the job market in general, and enhanced their sense of belonging and desire to take leadership roles in the professional work world. Students’ journals suggested that the students’ perceptions of their abilities and their perceptions of their community changed through the projects.</p>
<p>All students indicated that they were focused on exploring and attaining their career goals, and the real-world projects heightened their awareness of the structural inequalities that may create barriers to their occupational access and mobility. Although not used as themes in our analysis, some students described in their journals their internal analysis of why they did not believe they could succeed and why they refrained from leadership roles in the past. Some students, particularly female Hispanic students, described observing the internalized oppression in traditional Hispanic families, where emotional dependence prevents some from attaining their educational and career aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192712437037">Freire, 1993</xref>). Inequalities and sexism in the family and society continue to perpetuate the oppression of women. Identity development is a complex process for any college student, but this is particularly so for Hispanic students—and Mexican American women specifically, as they wrestle with both ethnic and gender identity formation at the same time they face racism, sexism, and structural inequalities in the real work world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538192712437037">Vera &amp; de los Santos, 2005</xref>). Latina college students completing these real-world projects reported a perspective that women experienced more difficulty in attaining upward mobility in the professional world. For this student segment, then, gaining confidence and hope that they can change this in their community was a shift forward.</p>
<p>Students reported that this shift forward transpired in part because of their inactions and opportunity to engage in the professional community from which they often feel alienated. PBSL projects provide exposure and experiences they would not otherwise encounter until they were employed—if they could garner that employment in the first place. Projects not only provide the exposure and experience first but also enhance the employment avenues open to these students.</p>

<sec id="section10-1538192712437037">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is the need for other research methods of triangulation and to conduct more sophisticated statistical analyses to identify factors that might influence Hispanic students’ willingness and ability to succeed better in an environment that is unfamiliar and different from their Hispanic cocultural realms. Future studies should explore more aspects of gender and age differences on the impact of PBSL with Hispanic college students. Other studies might consider generation level as a factor in students’ ability to use PBSL successfully. Is there a difference between first-generation Hispanic students and their Hispanic counterparts whose families have been in the United States longer? Further research is needed to examine the impact of PBSL on students after they graduate to assess the long-term effects of these real-world projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1538192712437037">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>This study underscores the importance of integrating the pedagogy of PBSL in institutions that serve a predominantly Hispanic student population. This kind of learning not only allows Hispanic students to learn through methods more conducive to the style of learning that works best for them but also affords them experience and opportunities that level the playing field with some non-Hispanic students. Through real-world work and reflections, instructors learn the value of connecting what they are teaching students in the classroom to real-world applications.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities that serve Hispanic students should encourage educators to incorporate PBSL into their curricula. This study demonstrated that experiential pedagogy helped to cultivate Hispanic college students’ awareness of self and other people and organizations. Ultimately, this heightened sense of self, other people, and their community will enhance the development of our future Hispanic educators and real-world professionals and community leaders.</p>
