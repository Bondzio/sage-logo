<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to test whether there is a relationship between situational and modus operandi characteristics and criminal mobility during the sexual assault event. Data collected from both police files and semistructured interviews with 72 serial sex offenders who have committed 361 sexual assaults have been used. Negative binomial regression was used to identify the relationships between the situational and modus operandi characteristics and the criminal mobility exhibited during the sexual assault. Events that involved child or adolescent victims, those where the offender did not use pornography prior to crime, and those where victim resistance was observed exhibited more criminal mobility. Moreover, crimes in which the victim was selected, the victim was alone when approached by the offender, and the assault was characterized by sexual penetration and a lack of premeditation exhibited more criminal mobility. Results seem to suggest that criminal mobility is a goal-oriented action taken by serial sex offenders to successfully complete their crime and to avoid detection and apprehension.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-0886260512471084">
<title>Journey to Crime Is an Adequate Measure of Criminal Mobility?</title>
<p>Usually, the term <italic>criminal mobility</italic> refers to distances traveled by offenders from their home to crime locations. A recurrent finding arising from this research on the <italic>journey to crime</italic> is that offenders travel relatively short distances when committing their crime. Specifically, findings show that offenders travel a shorter distance to commit crimes against persons, such as sexual assault, compared to property offenses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512471084">Brantingham &amp; Brantingham, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512471084">Lebeau, 1987</xref>). In an extensive review of 20 studies examining crime trips of sex offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512471084">Beauregard, Proulx, and Rossmo (2005)</xref> found that the average distance traveled by different types of sex offenders between their home base and the crime location was a little more than two miles.</p>
<p>These studies are interesting and informative, but the use of journey to crime as the sole measure of criminal mobility presents several limitations. First, studies examining journey to crime have all used the home location of the offender as the starting point of the crime trip. Although this is congruent with theoretical models such as routine activity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512471084">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>), such a measure does not consider, for instance, that a crime trip might have originated from the offender’s workplace. Alternatively, a rapist could identify and target a victim while returning home from a friend’s house. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512471084">Bernasco (2010)</xref> found, offenders are more likely to target former residential areas to commit their crimes if they lived in one of these areas for a long time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512471084">Pettiway (1995)</xref> is the only one to our knowledge who showed through interviews with crack users the true origin of the crime trip. Of interest, he found that only 26% of crack-purchasing trips originated from the user’s place of residence. The lack of studies taking into consideration alternative points of origin in the journey to crime might be partly explained by the fact that most of these studies rely exclusively on police data and other anchor points of the offender might not be known.</p>
<p>Second, journey to crime research suggests that the entire criminal event takes place at the same location. Although this may be the case for property crimes such as burglary, the reality is often different for crimes in which the victim is mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512471084">Beauregard, Rebocho, &amp; Rossmo, 2010</xref>). In crimes such as sexual assaults, the offender may encounter a victim at a certain location, decide to attack her at another location, take her to a different location to commit the assault, and take her to another location to release her, the so-called EAMD classification used in geographic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512471084">Rossmo, 2000</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512471084">Lebeau, 1987</xref>, for rape). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512471084">Michaud and Morselli (2011)</xref> explain that the nonconsideration of multiple crime sites in journey to crime research is problematic given that it may distort the estimation of the criminal mobility involved in the process. To illustrate their point, they provide the example of an offender who encounters a woman in a bar, takes her to a hotel, rapes and kills the woman there, to finally go back to his place with the dead body to dispose of her body parts in garbage bags. If the journey to crime was calculated with this case, police data would record the address where the body parts were found (offender’s residence; distance to crime = 0 miles), thus greatly underestimating the criminal mobility that was involved in the process.</p>
<p>Third, research on criminal mobility seems to suggest that the concept of mobility can and should be measured only in terms of distance traveled. However, the measure of distance traveled represents only one dimension of the mobility concept—that is, the movements or the mobility performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512471084">Canzler, Kaufmann, &amp; Kesselring, 2008</xref>). However, offenders also present other “movements” that may characterize their criminal mobility. Using the same example presented above, an offender may travel from one location to another during the same event. For instance, some sexual murderers decide to move the victim’s body to a different location after the murder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471084">Beauregard &amp; Field, 2008</xref>). Although such a finding does not provide a measure of <italic>distance</italic>, it nonetheless provides some information on the mobility of the offender during the criminal event. This is not to suggest that the measure of journey to crime is not appropriate for examining criminal behavior and that this research is not important for our understanding of criminal mobility. However, this suggests that there is a need to look at complementary measures as well.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512471084">Leclerc, Wortley, and Smallbone (2010)</xref> started to fill that gap by providing an alternative to the measure of journey to crime. The authors conceptualized geographic mobility as the use of multiple locations for the purpose of repetitive sexual contact with the same victim. Specifically, the authors set out to examine whether offending differences existed between perpetrators who used multiple locations for sexual contact and those who used a single location for the entire crime-commission process. Overall, the results demonstrate that mobile offenders are more likely to isolate their victims, use violence, involve the victim in several sexual episodes, abuse the victim for over a 1-year period, and make the victim participate in and perform sexual acts on them during sexual episodes. Although the study was purely descriptive, the results help to present criminal mobility as a goal-oriented behavior aimed at successfully completing sexual assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512471084">Leclerc et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260512471084">
<title>Criminal Mobility: Choice or Consequences?</title>
<p>From a rational choice perspective, traveling greater distances or moving to different locations during the criminal event may be regarded as a cost that is outweighed by an expected benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512471084">Morselli &amp; Royer, 2008</xref>). Although authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512471084">Rengert, Piquero, and Jones (1999)</xref> argue that the conventional rational choice analysis of criminal mobility would defend a least effort principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512471084">Zipf, 1950</xref>)—that is, there is no need to travel to a different location as opportunities are present here—this interpretation is incomplete. In fact, criminal mobility should also be considered a goal-oriented action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512471084">Clarke &amp; Cornish, 2001</xref>). For instance, drawing on a sample of 194 incarcerated offenders reporting detailed criminal activity in the 3 years preceding their incarceration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512471084">Morselli and Royer (2008)</xref> showed that offenders who travel farther to commit their crimes had good reasons to do so; the longer the length of the offending parameter, the higher the criminal earnings. The effect is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512471084">Felson’s (2006)</xref> use of the concept of strategic foraging: Offenders, not unlike animals, are willing to travel farther if the additional effort is worth their while. Moreover, the decision to travel farther or to change location might be associated not only with greater rewards. In some cases, criminal mobility might serve the purpose of completing successfully the crime and avoiding detection—which constitutes the goal of the modus operandi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512471084">Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512471084">Sutherland, 1947</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, it may be argued that offenders choose to be mobile during the criminal event because they are influenced by the context of crime. For example, a sex offender attacks a woman on the street but, because of her resistance, has to take her to an alley to avoid being seen by passers-by. An offender could also not be mobile at all because of the situation. For instance, a sex offender overwhelmed by deviant sexual fantasies could decide to sexually assault a victim even if witnesses are present, being unable to assess the potential risks associated with such a decision.</p>
<p>The current study examines criminal mobility during the criminal event—the journey <italic>during</italic> the crime. We propose that criminal mobility can be defined as the number of changes of location during the criminal event. More specifically, sexual assault events present different stages—that is, encounter, attack, crime, and victim release—that may be associated with different locations. Although some sex offenders decide to commit all of their actions at the same location (i.e., zero changes of location), other mobile offenders may change location up to three times during the same event. As opposed to focusing on the distance traveled, the word <italic>mobility</italic> after all signifies <italic>movement</italic> and not merely <italic>distance</italic>. An offender changing locations many times during a crime event is effectively more mobile, at least from a journey <italic>during</italic> the crime process. As criminal mobility can be interpreted as a purposive action necessary to successfully commit a crime, the aim of this study is to predict criminal mobility using two types of factors that may influence criminal mobility: situation and modus operandi. From these two types of factors, two competing hypotheses consistent with a rational choice approach are derived:</p>
<list id="list1-0886260512471084" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Situational factors will influence the level of mobility during the criminal event.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Modus operandi characteristics will influence the level of mobility during the criminal event, even if particular situational factors are present.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260512471084">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data on crime events were collected from a sample of sexual offenders who were incarcerated in a Correctional Service of Canada institution (where inmates serve a sentence of 2 years or more). Our sample included any individual who had committed two or more sexual assaults or other sex-related crimes (e.g., sexual homicide) involving a victim of any age and of any gender who was a stranger to him (i.e., offender had no personal relationship with the victim prior to the day the offense was committed). Serial sex offenders were specifically targeted for the sample as they are more likely than nonserial sex offenders to face a variety of situations and, accordingly, are more likely to make a variety of choices during the decision-making process of each crime committed. Moreover, the stranger victim element provides a further refinement to preserve a relative homogeneity in the situation faced by offenders; prior relationship between the offender and the victim arguably heavily influences the offenders’ necessity and incentives to move the victim to a different location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512471084">Leclerc et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Among all sex offenders convicted of a sentence of 2 years or more in one province of Canada between 1995 and 2004, 92 offenders matched our definition criteria, and 72 participated in the research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512471084">1</xref></sup> Together, these 72 offenders committed an average of 5 sexual offences, for a total of 361 sexual assaults. Among the 20 excluded participants, only 9 actually refused to participate; the remaining 11 were unavailable because of their mental state, discipline problems, or transfer to another institution. The majority of the participants were White (91.3%), and the average age at the beginning of the crime series was 30.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.4). Almost half (46.4%) of the offenders were married or in a relationship at the beginning of their series of crimes. Among the participants, 89.9% had a prior criminal record before the onset of their series of sexual crimes. Despite their involvement in a series of sexual offenses, the majority of the sample was involved in wide array of other crimes. Participants with a prior criminal record had an average of 2.9 charges (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.3) for violent sexual crimes, 1.0 charges (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.1) for nonviolent sexual crimes, 2.5 charges (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.4) for violent nonsexual crimes, and 11.9 charges (<italic>SD</italic> = 19.6) for nonsexual nonviolent crimes. Offenders included in this study had sexually assaulted adult women (<italic>n</italic> = 33), children (<italic>n</italic> = 17), or both (<italic>n</italic> = 22).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512471084">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The procedure involved two main stages: (a) in-depth semistructured interviews conducted with all offenders to investigate each sexual crime event and (b) content analysis of police investigation reports for all events involved. An instrument was developed from existing police questionnaires (i.e., Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System in Canada and Violent Criminal Apprehension Program in the United States) to guide the nature of the questions. Data, especially on the criminal event, were collected from the police reports and coded in our instrument. The reliability of responses in our study was monitored by checking for and questioning inconsistencies. In the case of any discrepancies between the offender’s account and the police report, we relied on information from the police report. Interviews were conducted in a private office, isolated from correctional staff and other inmates. They lasted from 2 to 12 hours, depending on the number of crimes committed and the participants’ verbosity. Because of the sensitive nature of the conversations, permission was not requested to tape-record the interviews, although extensive verbatim notes were taken whenever possible. No offender was paid for participating in the study. All participants signed a consent form and were promised complete confidentiality, as well as a guarantee that the information they disclosed could not be used against them by Correctional Service of Canada.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0886260512471084">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable in this study consists of the criminal mobility patterns of sex offenders within the sexual assault events. Each criminal event entails four different stages: (a) <italic>E</italic>ncounter, (b) <italic>A</italic>ttack, (c) <italic>C</italic>rime, and (d) <italic>V</italic>ictim <italic>R</italic>elease. In theory, the combination of these four stages could lead to 8 different mobility patterns: <italic>EACVR, EAC_VR, E_ACVR, EA_CVR, EA_C_VR, E_AC_VR, E_A_CVR, E_A_C_VR</italic>. For instance, <italic>EAC_VR</italic> would mean that the offender encountered, attacked, and committed the crime at the same location but traveled to a different location to release the victim. For the purposes of this study, we were specifically interested in the decision by serial sex offenders to change location within each of their criminal events. Thus, our criminal mobility pattern variable comprises the number of changes of location within the criminal event, which ranged between 0 and 3. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512471084">Table 1</xref>, 43.5% of events exhibited “stability,” meaning that the offender did not change location from the moment he encountered the victim to the moment he decided to release her. The remaining criminal events showed “mobility,” as 28.3% had one change of location and 27.7% had two changes of location. Only two events (0.5%) displayed three changes of location.</p>

<p>Five variables examining the situational aspects of the criminal event are included. Offense timing (0 = <italic>week</italic>, 1 = <italic>weekend</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886260512471084">2</xref></sup> and time of the crime (0 = <italic>day</italic>, 1 = <italic>night</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886260512471084">3</xref></sup> seek to investigate the temporal aspect of the criminal event. Moreover, two dichotomous variables (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) are included to investigate the state of arousal of the offender before committing the crime: use of pornography and deviant sexual fantasies. Also, a dichotomous variable looking at victim resistance (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886260512471084">4</xref></sup> is included to take into account the reaction of the victim during the criminal event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886260512471084">
<title>Modus operandi</title>
<p>A total of five modus operandi variables were selected to tap into different stages of the crime-commission process. The planning of the crime is investigated with the variable of crime premeditation (0 = <italic>no premeditation</italic>, 1 = <italic>structured premeditation</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886260512471084">5</xref></sup> Two variables (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) examine target selection: selection of victim and victim alone when approached by the offender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886260512471084">6</xref></sup> The strategy to commit the crime is examined through the use of coercive or noncoercive methods (0 = <italic>noncoercive</italic>, 1 = <italic>coercive</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886260512471084">7</xref></sup> To examine the level of intrusiveness of the sexual assault, the type of sexual acts committed (0 = <italic>noncoital sexual contacts</italic>, 1 = <italic>sexual penetration</italic>) is also included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260512471084">
<title>Control</title>
<p>Being able to move a victim to different locations during a criminal event may depend on many factors, one of them being the age of the victim. An adult victim may be harder to move because of her size or because she may pose a greater resistance. Thus, age of victim is included to control for this, using a discrete variable with three categories (0 = <italic>child, 0-11 years old</italic>; 1 = <italic>adolescent, 12-17 years old</italic>; and 2 = <italic>adult, 18 years or older</italic>). Using these distinct categories allows us to examine the mobility within sexual assault events of different sex offender types (i.e., child molesters, rapists) who may adopt different crime-commission processes.</p>

<sec id="section13-0886260512471084">
<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>The criminal mobility pattern variable in the current study is treated as a count variable. It is measured by the number of change of locations within the criminal event, ranging from 0 to 3. As the scale in the current study is highly skewed—with a large percentage of respondents scoring 0—the normality assumption of ordinary least squares regression is violated. As such, we used negative binomial regression, a technique designed for count discrete models that allows for nonnormal distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512471084">Long, 1997</xref>) and whereby any dependencies among the count data are accounted for by the inclusion of linear combinations of linear effects in the linear predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512471084">Booth, Casells, Friedl, &amp; Hobert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512471084">Land, McCall, &amp; Nagin, 1996</xref>). The regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the independent variables against criminal mobility patterns. Because the events examined in the current study were committed by serial sex offenders, some offenders were responsible for multiple events. To control for the possibility of dependence of observations, all models include a variable measuring the mobility patterns identified in the prior event. A total of four models were run. The first model examines only the impact of the control variables on the criminal mobility patterns. The second model examines the impact of situational variables on criminal mobility patterns while controlling for age of victim and mobility pattern in the prior event. The third model investigates the impact of modus operandi on criminal mobility patterns while controlling for age of victim and mobility patterns in the prior event. Finally, the fourth model examines the impact of all the variables together on the criminal mobility patterns, that is, including the control, the situational, and the modus operandi variables.</p>

<p>Model 2 shows results from situational variables while controlling for age of victim and criminal mobility patterns in the prior event. Similar to the control model, events in which child victims (<italic>B</italic> = 0.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are involved exhibit more mobility than those involving adult victims. However, when situational variables are considered, we also find that when adolescent victims (<italic>B</italic> = 0.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are involved, events exhibit more mobility than those with adult victims. Results show that when serial sex offender use pornography prior to crime (<italic>B</italic> = -0.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) they are more likely to exhibit stability during the criminal event, but when the victim resists (<italic>B</italic> = 0.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the criminal event exhibits more mobility.</p>
<p>In Model 3, events involving either child (<italic>B</italic> = 1.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) or adolescent (<italic>B</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) victims exhibit more mobility than events where an adult victim is involved. Results also show that the event exhibits more mobility when the victim is selected (<italic>B</italic> = 0.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the victim is approached when alone (<italic>B</italic> = 0.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the crime is not premeditated (<italic>B</italic> = -0.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and the event involves penetration (<italic>B</italic> = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Finally, Model 4 examines the effect of the control, situational, and modus operandi variables on the criminal mobility patterns. We observe that situational variables are no longer important predictors of criminal mobility. With regard to modus operandi, however, results show that events in which the victim is selected (<italic>B</italic> = 0.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the crime is not premeditated (<italic>B</italic> = -0.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and there is sexual penetration of the victim (<italic>B</italic> = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) exhibit more mobility. Whether the offender targets a victim who is alone is not significantly related to criminal mobility patterns.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sex offenders considering the need to move the victim to a different location during the criminal event must first answer a critical question: Can I easily do it? When children are the target of the sexual assault event, the answer is yes. This refers to the notion of “target inertia” developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512471084">Felson (1998)</xref>. Target inertia refers to physical aspects of the person that interfere with or make him or her suitable as a target. Adults are physically larger and stronger than children and thus are better able to thwart offenders’ efforts to move them to a different location to isolate them for sexual assault purposes. This notion is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471084">Beauregard and Field’s (2008)</xref> research on body disposal patterns in which older victims were more likely to be left at the scene of the murder, whereas younger victims were more likely to be transported from the crime scene to a disposal site. The authors concluded that the reason behind these body disposal patterns is the size of the target. Younger victims, especially children, are easier to hide because they are smaller and easier to control.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512471084">Clarke (1997)</xref> proposed that one of the ways in which situations can influence criminal behavior is that they can provide the opportunities themselves, such as a lapse in supervision, that allow for a criminal response to occur. However, even when a motivated offender and a vulnerable victim meet in time and space, a sexual assault is unlikely to occur unless the circumstances are favorable for the offense to take place. These favorable circumstances include expending little effort, low risk of detection, and a desired reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512471084">Smallbone, Wortley, &amp; Marshall, 2008</xref>). Likewise, the results suggest that serial sex offenders are concerned about the risks of detection present in the situation. Thus, committing a sexual assault when the victim resists entails higher risks of being seen or being interfered with by witnesses or bystanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512471084">Beauregard &amp; Leclerc, 2007</xref>). This suggests that some sex offenders choose to change location with their victim to find a safe place to commit the crime (e.g., where people will not be able to see or hear anything), which is consistent with our first hypothesis.</p>
<p>However, when also considering the modus operandi used by serial sex offenders, regression results show that the situation is no longer important in explaining criminal mobility patterns (Model 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512471084">Table 2</xref>), thus confirming our second hypothesis. The choices made by these offenders as to <italic>how</italic> to commit their crime dictate their criminal mobility patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512471084">Davies and Dale (1995)</xref> concluded that sophistication of the offense constitutes another characteristic that is related to mobility in sexual assault. A sophisticated sexual assault may be identified, among other things, by the rapist taking various precautions to protect his identity (i.e., forensic awareness; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512471084">Beauregard &amp; Bouchard, 2010</xref>) and by his degree of planning and organization.</p>
<p>Directly related to this, our findings show that sexual assault events characterized by a lack of premeditation are more likely to display criminal mobility. Although at first glance these findings may seem contradictory, they are in fact complementary. Sex offenders who travel longer distances to commit their crime show structured planning; they have probably selected a specific victim or a specific area in which they want to find a victim and commit their crime (e.g., prostitutes in a red-light district). At the same time, sex offenders who show criminal mobility during the sexual assault event—that is, those who are changing locations during the crime—may decide to do so in response to the lack of planning. Thus, a sex offender may realize that to complete the sexual assault, he needs to travel to a different location where no witnesses or bystanders are present. Perhaps he needs to take the victim to an isolated location to overcome her physical resistance. Therefore, criminal mobility constitutes a purposive behavior to avoid detection and apprehension, an adaptive reaction to a criminal event that was not well planned.</p>
<p>However, although sex offenders are trying to minimize the risks of detection, they also want to maximize the rewards associated with their crime. One way to accomplish this is to move the victim to a location where both actors will be alone. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512471084">Leclerc et al. (2010)</xref>, being alone with the victim not only reduces risks of interruption or apprehension by a capable guardian but also provides a better opportunity to successfully complete the sexual assault. Although the study by Leclerc et al. included only pedophiles, their findings are congruent with the current study. Thus, sexual assault events involving victim resistance and sexual penetration are more likely to exhibit criminal mobility on the offender’s part. Similar to pedophiles, sex offenders targeting adult victims may need to bring the victim to a different location to neutralize and overcome the victim’s objections and to isolate the victim from possible guardians. Moreover, if the victim is encountered in a public location during routine activities, it will be necessary for the offender to take the victim to a different location—somewhere isolated enough to have time to undress and have sexual intercourse with her.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0886260512471084" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Sex offenders are rational individuals who may decide to travel to a different location either to avoid detection and apprehension, to maximize the chances of successfully completing the crime (e.g., obtaining sexual gratification, being able to perform sexual penetration actions), or both. Our findings show that criminal mobility is mainly dictated by the modus operandi of serial sex offenders. Although the decision to move the victim during the criminal event may be influenced by situational factors such as the resistance of the victim and the use of pornography by the offender, when considering certain aspects of the modus operandi, the relationship between the situation and criminal mobility disappears. This suggests that serial sex offenders’ level of mobility is mainly based on their strategies to commit the crime, not the situation. In other words, our findings suggest that serial sex offenders’ decision to move the victim during the criminal event may be influenced by the situation, but when certain modus operandi strategies are already in place, the influence of the situation disappears.</p>
<p>These findings on criminal mobility patterns have implications for prevention purposes. Our results suggest that increasing the effort involved in sexual offending may be successful in deterring opportunistic perpetrators because they are more likely to search for offending opportunities that do not involve a substantial amount of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512471084">Smallbone et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, although offenders who are very motivated may be the most difficult type to deter, interventions could be set in place that may reduce the frequency of their sexual offending against children. Thus, improving surveillance in places where children usually gather (i.e., parks, recreational facilities) and extending guardianship outside the immediate family (i.e., neighbors and place managers) could be one of the possible ways to intervene to increase children’s safety. However, the fact that sex offenders—once they have adopted a certain modus operandi—are not affected by the situation poses challenges to situational crime prevention. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512471084">Smallbone et al. (2008)</xref>, the application of situational prevention techniques requires a specific, circumscribed location and the capacity to exercise significant control over the location. In a sexual assault event exhibiting mobility, this could be a difficult, if not impossible, task because of the fact that it involves multiple locations. Therefore, efforts should be targeted toward the encounter location, as it is highly unlikely that resistance will be effective in warding off the perpetrator once the victim has been isolated from the guardians, or any other possible protective factors.</p>
<p>Although this study is one of the few examining criminal mobility in serial sex offenders from a different angle than the traditional journey to crime, it is not without limitations. First, the relatively small sample size prevented us from examining more variables and possibly from finding significant relationships with some of our predictors. Second, the study does not take into account the type of area in which the criminal event occurred. It may well be that sexual assault events occurring in urban areas present different criminal mobility patterns than those occurring in rural areas. In future studies, we hope to be able to control for environmental factors such as the type of area (urban vs. rural, residential vs. nonresidential, public vs. private).</p>

<p>Because all of our negative binomial regression models were overdispersed, we reran our models with a scale weight variable, which was equal to the inverse of deviance/degrees of freedom. This procedure does not change the parameter estimates, but adjusted standard errors are computed by dividing the standard errors by the scale variable. This procedure makes the significance tests more conservative. After running our models with the scale variables, all of the deviance coefficients approached or exceeded 1.00, suggesting the corrected models showed little to no overdispersion.</p>
