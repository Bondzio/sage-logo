<abstract>
<p>Researchers suggest that video-based interventions can provide increased opportunity for students with disabilities to acquire important academic and functional skills; however, little research exists regarding video-based interventions on the academic skills of students with autism and intellectual disability. We used a multiple-baseline-across-participants design to investigate the effects of video self-modeling (VSM) on the mathematics skill acquisition of adolescents with autism. Four adolescent male students viewed videos of themselves on an iPad solving mathematical problems to estimate the amount of money used to pay for a given item and the amount to receive in change. Findings support a functional relationship between VSM and performance on math skills for each participant. Subsequently, the VSM was systematically faded during maintenance sessions, with little deterioration of skill. Follow-up data probes were interpreted to conclude that student characteristics may affect retention of skill. Implications for practice and research are discussed.</p>

<p>The education of children with autism in inclusive environments is becoming more widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak, Fahrenkrog, Ayres, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>). For example, the U.S. Department of Education documented a 77% increase in the number of students with autism receiving services in general education classrooms between 1997 and 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088357613478829">U.S. Department of Education, 2008</xref>). This statistic—representing a 14-percentage-point increase over a 9-year period—may be partly due to the broader spectrum of autism being identified. Due to the greater variability in functioning among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), research is needed to identify interventions appropriate for an increasingly diverse population. Moreover, investigations assessing the effects of instructional strategies to help students with disabilities access the core curriculum are recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357613478829">Knight, Smith, Spooner, &amp; Browder, 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1088357613478829">
<title>Promise of Technology</title>
<p>Researchers have shown that technology can increase opportunities for students with disabilities to access the core curriculum and achieve improved learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613478829">Cihak &amp; Bowlin, 2009</xref>). Current advances in the use of technology in classrooms include new applications of video technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357613478829">Mechling, 2005</xref>). Video modeling (VM) is an instructional technique that involves a student watching a video of a model (e.g., a peer or adult) engaging in target behaviors or skills, with the student later performing the same skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak et al., 2010</xref>). Video self-modeling (VSM) is a specific application of VM, in which the individual observes herself accurately and independently performing the target behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357613478829">Dowrick, 1999</xref>). VSM is a form of observational learning in which individuals view themselves performing a task at a more advanced level than they typically perform the skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357613478829">Buggey, Toombs, Gardener, &amp; Cervetti, 1999</xref>). VSM has been used to teach a variety of skills, including transitional behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak et al., 2010</xref>), social-communication and functional/life skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357613478829">Bellini &amp; Akullian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357613478829">Buggey, 2007</xref>), perspective taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357613478829">Charlop-Christy &amp; Daneshvar, 2003</xref>), and academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357613478829">Hitchcock, Dowrick, &amp; Prater, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The effects of VSM have been assessed with students without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088357613478829">Hartley, Bray, &amp; Kehle, 1998</xref>), as well as with students with emotional disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088357613478829">Possell, Kehle, McLoughlin, &amp; Bray, 1999</xref>), learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357613478829">Clare, Jenson, Kehle, &amp; Bray, 2000</xref>), intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357613478829">Cihak, Kessler, &amp; Alberto, 2007</xref>), and ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088357613478829">Shipley-Benamou, Lutzker, &amp; Taubman, 2002</xref>). VSM has been delivered through several media, including (a) television and videocassette recorder, (b) laptop computer, (c) DVD, and (d) handheld device (e.g., video iPod). Handheld computers are one form of technology that has been shown to be effective for the delivery of VSM to individuals with disabilities in various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613478829">Cihak &amp; Bowlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Using Technology to Enhance Math Instruction</title>
<p>Youth with disabilities are in need of instruction incorporating a blend of academic and functional math objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357613478829">Browder &amp; Cooper-Duffy, 2003</xref>). Functional math focuses on teaching practical mathematics within real-life situations such as telling time, using money, and completing tasks related to measurement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357613478829">Schunk and Hanson (1989)</xref> used VSM to teach math concepts to elementary school students working below grade level in the subject area, and suggested that VSM can increase students’ academic performance during cognitive skills training. The researchers concluded that students who viewed themselves successfully completing math problems performed at higher levels than students who did not watch the VSM. However, additional research is needed to examine the use of VSM and handheld devices to teach mathematics to students with disabilities.</p>
<p>In the current study, we sought to examine the effects of VSM on the mathematics performance of adolescent students with autism and intellectual disability receiving functional skills instruction in a self-contained special education classroom. Given specific behavioral objectives involving estimating and counting exact change, two main research questions were addressed:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>After receiving approval from the university and school district institutional review boards for research involving human participants, four male students, given the pseudonyms of Joey, Will, Ryan, and Aaron, were selected to participate in the study. Parents of the students provided written consent. The university’s institutional review board waived the need to obtain student assent.</p>
<p>Participant selection was based on the following criteria adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613478829">Cihak and Bowlin (2009)</xref>: (a) junior high school enrollment; (b) disability based on eligibility requirements; (c) similar assessment results from selected math subtests of the <italic>BRIGANCE</italic>® <italic>Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills–Revised</italic> (<italic>CIBS-R</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357613478829">Brigance, 1999</xref>); (d) IEP math goals and objectives similar to the learning objective for the current study; (e) parental permission to participate in the study, including videotaping; (f) no hearing or vision impairments that might impede video instruction; and (g) functional reading skills (i.e., ability to read the math story problems without additional instruction).

<p>Ryan, Aaron, and Will received daily mathematics instruction in a self-contained special education classroom. Joey received daily mathematics instruction in a resource pre-algebra math class with seven other students; he also received additional functional mathematics instruction in the self-contained special education classroom. More specific information about each student follows.</p>
<sec id="section5-1088357613478829">
<title>Joey</title>
<p>Joey’s composite scores from the <italic>Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test</italic> (UNIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088357613478829">Bracken &amp; McCallum, 1998</xref>) were in the average to low-average range. During study implementation, Joey attended three resource classes (math, reading, and writing), two general education classes (career introduction and chorus), and two life skills self-contained classes (life skills math and social skills). In the classroom, Joey was pleasant and compliant; he often needed several redirections and prompts to focus on an activity. Joey was able to comprehend text on an upper third-grade level with 100% accuracy and on a fourth-grade level with 80% accuracy, with teacher prompting. The <italic>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills</italic> (DIBELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357613478829">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>) assessment indicated Joey was reading fourth-grade level text at a rate of 187 words per minute with 99% accuracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1088357613478829">
<title>Will</title>
<p>Will’s scores were in the borderline range for intellectual disability. Will attended two general education classes (career introduction and chorus) with a paraeducator and spent the remainder of the school day in a life skills self-contained classroom. Will had limited verbal ability and was often echolalic in his speech. Yet, Will was very compliant; he preferred to look at books or sit quietly rather than to interact with his classmates. According to the DIBELS, Will was reading a third-grade level text at 61 words per minute with 97% accuracy. In his IEP, recalling information from stories read was noted as an area of difficulty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1088357613478829">
<title>Ryan</title>
<p>Overall, Ryan’s scores were in the very low range. Ryan also had an adaptive behavior assessment indicating he had an intellectual disability. Although the cognitive score results suggested several areas of strength, Ryan clearly qualified for special education services within the intellectual disability category, based on the multidisciplinary team’s decision. However, parental consent for this classification was denied, and additional testing justified educational classification in the autism category. Ryan attended three general education classes (foods, peer-tutoring, and manufacturing) with a paraeducator. He spent the remainder of the school day in a life skills self-contained classroom. Ryan was provided a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) due to frequent displays of verbal and physical aggression. Despite difficulties in some social situations in school, Ryan seemed to enjoy interacting with adults and peers. According to the DIBELS, Ryan was reading third-grade level text at 64 words per minute with 98% accuracy. In his IEP, recalling information from stories read was noted as an area of strength.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1088357613478829">
<title>Aaron</title>
<p>As was the case with Ryan, Aaron’s assessment scores fell in the very low range. During the study, Aaron attended one resource class (reading), and three general education classes (career introduction, art, and chorus) with a paraeducator or a peer tutor. He spent the remainder of the school day in a life skills self-contained classroom. Aaron struggled to attend and stay on task in class; he often looked around the classroom or attempted to talk to other students. Aaron was friendly and outgoing, and appeared to get along well with other students in the class. According to the DIBELS, Aaron was reading third-grade level text at 130 words per minute with 99% accuracy. Aaron also scored at a third-grade level in reading comprehension. In his IEP, reading was noted as an area of strength.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1088357613478829">
<title>Participant Selection Measures</title>
<p>Two measures were used in selecting participants for the study. First, the <italic>CIBS-R</italic> was used to assess math skill. The <italic>CIBS-R</italic> is a criterion-referenced classroom assessment for children between the ages of 5 and 13 years, recommended for planning individual instruction. It consists of 154 assessments in eight areas: Readiness, Speech, Listening, Reading, Spelling, Writing, Research and Study Skills, and Mathematics. The current edition allows users to make norm-referenced interpretations regarding student performance. Scores correlate moderately well with the <italic>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.</italic> Validity evidence is reported, and analyses of reliability have shown test–retest correlations to exceed .80. In summary, the <italic>CIBS-R</italic> is an improved revision of a standard curriculum-based assessment that is widely used by teachers to document elementary and middle school students’ mastery of specific skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357613478829">Cizek, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The classroom teacher evaluated students’ money skills using the following subtests from the <italic>CIBS-R</italic>: recognizes money, equivalent values of coins and the dollar bill, total values of groups of coins (adds), converts coins, and makes change. During testing, an adapted version of the Assessment Fidelity Checklist was used to help ensure assessment integrity. The checklist included only items relevant to the pre-assessment. The results of the assessment indicated an instructional need within the subtest category of <italic>total values of groups of coins (adds).</italic> More specifically, Joey was able to recognize pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters; Will and Aaron were able to recognize pennies, nickels, and dimes; and Ryan was able to recognize pennies and nickels. In the subtest category, <italic>equivalent values of coins and the dollar bill</italic>, Joey and Will scored (4/9), Ryan scored (8/9), and Aaron scored (7/9). In the category, <italic>CBM–Exact Change (up to $25.00)</italic>, Joey scored (4/5), Will and Aaron scored (0/5), and Ryan scored (1/5).</p>
<p>Second, to pinpoint the instructional level, a curriculum-based assessment was administered to determine students’ accuracy while reading a price tag and giving exact change, using the fewest possible bills and coins. The curriculum-based assessment included five items and five price tags. The prices listed on the curriculum-based assessment were $2.37, $19.54, $7.18, $22.07, and $12.89. Results of the curriculum-based assessment for all participants ranged from 0% to 20%, indicating a need for math instruction in the area assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1088357613478829">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in a junior high school of approximately 1,200 students in a suburban neighborhood in the western part of the United States. The classroom contained 10 students (5 boys and 5 girls), with disabilities, including autism, multiple disabilities, intellectual disability, other health impairments, and emotional disturbance. Adults working in the classroom included one licensed special education teacher, two classroom paraeducators, and one paraeducator assigned to a specific student. Baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases of the study occurred in a partitioned section of the classroom.</p>
<p>Prior to the intervention, math instruction consisted of delivering math content individually or in small groups. Materials included manipulatives, worksheets, and learning activities. A token economy featuring reward charts and simulated money was used to reinforce desired behavior. Possible rewards included 5 min of free time on an iPad. By this means, students were able to familiarize themselves with the iPad prior to the commencement of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1088357613478829">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>All videos were created using a Panasonic HM-TA1 flip video camcorder and Windows Live Movie Maker software. Five videos were developed for each participant using video feedforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357613478829">Dowrick, 1999</xref>) to show the individual students successfully completing five story problems. Following the editing of each video, the five videos per student were loaded onto a 16-GB Apple iPad for viewing. A cash drawer also contained specified simulated money. At the beginning of each instructional session, students were given a worksheet with story problems relating to functional math, scratch paper, and a pencil.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1088357613478829">
<title>Response Measurement and Data Collection</title>
<p>Students were instructed to estimate the amount they should use to purchase a particular item and the amount of change they should receive back. The purpose of the instruction was to help ensure honest treatment by merchants in real-life settings.</p>
<p>The learning objective was related to the common core state mathematics standards for seventh graders, standard 7.EE, “solve real life and mathematical problems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357613478829">“Common Core State Standards for Mathematics,” n.d.</xref>, p. 47). The standard suggests that students need to understand how to solve functional multistep math problems, convert between mathematical forms, and use mental computation and estimation. Essential math skills linked to the common core were assessed by recording the dependent variable (i.e., the percentage of steps completed accurately and independently). The assessment aligned with the following learning objective:</p>
<p>Given five story problems using specific price tags ($3.49, $8.68, $14.82, $17.13, and $24.53); a cash register containing simulated money consisting of two $20 bills, four $10 bills, five $5 bills, 25 $1 bills, 10 quarters, 20 dimes, 30 nickels, and 50 pennies; scratch paper; and a pencil, students will estimate, calculate, and show the exact change with at least 80% accuracy over at least three consecutive sessions, using the following steps:</p>
<list id="list2-1088357613478829" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Read the story problem or watch the video model on the iPad.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify the cost of the item listed on the price tag by circling the price.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Estimate the amount to be paid using the smallest number of bills by writing the estimate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Give the money to the teacher.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Estimate about how much change you should get back (within $0.50) by writing the estimate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Calculate and write the exact amount you should get back.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use the cash register to make exact change using the fewest possible bills and coins.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To record student performance, the teacher used a scoring form listing all of the steps of the task analysis for each of the problems. The scoring procedure was integral to the study’s dependent variable (i.e., the percentage of steps participants completed correctly). The teacher likewise documented the number of times the student watched the VSM on the scoring form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1088357613478829">
<title>Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>Each instructional session was videotaped. To conduct the reliability checks, the first author (primary coder) and a second coder independently viewed one third of the sessions in baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases. To achieve acceptable levels of agreement, the two coders discussed the scoring criteria in detail and the second coder practiced the scoring procedure. The two coders then independently scored three work samples, achieving an agreement index of 100%. The observer scoring records were compared item by item and an agreement was tallied if both coders recorded identical scores. Point-by-point percentage agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357613478829">Kazdin, 1982</xref>) was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements and multiplying by 100%. The percentage of agreement in baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases for all study participants was 100%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1088357613478829">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>Experimental effects were evaluated within a multiple-baseline-across-participants design. Baseline data were initially gathered on the dependent variable, percentage of correct responses, for each of the four students. When all baseline data were stable with respect to level and trend, the intervention was applied to the first baseline series while baseline conditions were continued for the other participants. When the behavior of the first student reached the criterion level as defined in the learning objective (80% accuracy over at least three consecutive sessions), the intervention was implemented with the second student. This procedure was followed until all of the participants had received the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1088357613478829">
<title>Experimental Procedures</title>
<p>In addition to baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases, an additional nonexperimental phase involved the development of the video self-model, occurring between baseline and intervention phases. Math problems presented in the baseline phase differed from those assessed during the intervention phase. However, problems presented in both phases were assumed to be of similar difficulty because they were kept within the same price range. The classroom teacher additionally tried to anticipate the change participants would be expected to make to assure the use of similar coins across baseline and intervention phases. The five problems comprising the baseline assessment were changed every three sessions to prevent participants from becoming too familiar with (or overly frustrated by) the high demand task. During baseline and intervention phases, participants received daily assessment and/or instruction in approximately 20- to 30-min sessions four to eight times per week. The worksheets used consisted of step-by-step instructions and five one-sentence story problems with the solution of each problem encompassing seven distinct steps.</p>
<p>Positive reinforcement (i.e., verbal praise and a classroom token economy) was delivered in baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases. Because the purpose of the study was to test the effects of VSM alone, rather than to assess the impact of a multicomponent treatment package, participants were praised for engaging in appropriate behavior, but no praise was delivered for improved academic performance; in addition, neither prompts nor error correction procedures were used. Examples of behavior praise statements included, “I like the way you are following directions” and “Great working!” The token economy implemented in the students’ classroom allowed students to earn five stars for working prior to selecting the back-up reinforcer of their choice. Free-reading time, pretend quarters to be used in the class store, listening to music, helping the teacher, swinging, choosing a friend to sit by, and playing a game were back-up reinforcer options.</p>
<sec id="section16-1088357613478829">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>The first author (classroom teacher) trained two paraeducators in implementation procedures prior to the beginning of the study. The training occurred over a period of approximately 1 week in five 30-min sessions. During baseline, either the classroom teacher or the paraeducator worked one-on-one with each student and presented five story problems similar to those presented during the intervention phase. The adult directed the student to read the story problem and follow the directions listed on the worksheet. The adult did not instruct or give feedback regarding the accuracy of the student’s response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1088357613478829">
<title>Video development</title>
<p>To develop the videos, the teacher turned on the video recorder, presented each student with a script of the seven steps of the task analysis and prompted each student as necessary in reading the steps and solving the story problems while being videotaped. The teacher provided the level of prompting needed to ensure accurate completion of the story problem. The script listed all seven steps of the task analysis and contained exact statements to be read by the students. Each participant was required to solve five math problems, resulting in five video self-models representing the problems to be solved. The videos were edited to eliminate teacher prompts and ranged in length from approximately 3 to 5 min. Data were not collected during the video development phase because only one session was needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1088357613478829">
<title>Intervention: Math instruction via VSM</title>
<p>The intervention procedures were implemented twice daily, 4 days a week. After turning on the video recorder on the iPad, the student watched himself complete one problem. He could then pause the video, fast-forward, or rewind as necessary to solve the same problem on paper. This procedure was followed for each of the five problems presented. The VSM intervention was implemented without the teacher’s assistance. The teacher’s role was to record student performance, collect treatment fidelity data, and praise appropriate behavior. Intervention procedures were continued until the criterion level of performance was achieved and maintained for at least three consecutive sessions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1088357613478829">
<title>Post-intervention</title>
<p>Post-intervention consisted of six individual phases. During the postintervention phase, a fading procedure was used to reduce the number of video models provided to the student over time. This was accomplished by requiring the participants to complete one novel problem without a video model while gradually removing the model for previously solved problems.</p>
<p>In Phase 1, the video model was provided for four previously solved problems while one novel problem was introduced and answered without the video model. The VSM was gradually removed for the problems in subsequent phases, until postintervention Phase 5 when participants were expected to solve all five problems without the video model.</p>
<p>In postintervention Phase 6, the student was presented with the same five problems assessed during the intervention phase. The purpose of this phase was to determine whether the participant could successfully solve the previously practiced problems, given the lapse in time, without the use of the video model. Although the video model was eventually removed, visual prompts (i.e., the seven steps needed to complete each problem) were listed on the worksheets for the duration of the study. Having the opportunity to access the seven steps allowed the students to independently prompt themselves.</p>
<p>Following the completion of postintervention Phase 6, student performance was examined in three weekly probes. VM was removed during follow-up and the math problems presented were identical to those evaluated during the intervention phase.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1088357613478829">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Visual analysis was used to analyze and interpret the results of the study. Using a line graph, individual student performance was recorded and analyzed daily in baseline, intervention, and postintervention phases. Changes in level, trend, and variability were carefully noted across and within conditions and were important indicators of an experimental effect. Baseline, intervention, and postintervention averages were calculated and compared. The research objective was to demonstrate a functional relationship between the dependent variable (percentage of correct responses) and independent variable (VSM) by observing a systematic change in student performance that occurred at the same time the intervention was introduced.</p>
<sec id="section21-1088357613478829">
<title>Treatment fidelity</title>
<p>The teacher assessed treatment fidelity using a checklist for each phase of the study as well as the set-up. She collected data on all steps of the task analysis for each intervention session, and an independent observer recorded data during 33% of the intervention phases. Treatment fidelity measures verified the teacher’s use of the instructional task analysis, which included providing the iPad to the student, prompting the student to activate the device, and collecting data, during all phases of the study. Data confirmed that all materials were set up and intervention procedures accurately implemented 100% of the time.</p>

<title>Stimulus Generalization</title>
<p>Because the novel problems had not been previously introduced and the order in which these problems were presented in each of the five postintervention phases varied, the first five of the six postintervention phases allowed participants to transfer previous learning to an unfamiliar stimulus and to demonstrate flexibility of responding without the use of the video model. In terms of the dependent variable, percentage of correct responses, the results achieved in the assessment indicated varied degrees of stimulus generalization across individual participants.</p>
<p>To sort out the effects of test practice, the dependent variable was examined in relation to each participant’s initial attempt to solve a novel problem. In this analysis, the mean percentage of steps completed correctly across the five postintervention phases ranged from 82.8% (Joey) to 59.8% (Aaron), with an overall average of nearly 70% for the four participants.</p>

<sec id="section28-1088357613478829">
<title>Social Validity</title>
<p>Social validity was assessed using two versions of an open-ended, four-question survey. The surveys evaluated participants’ satisfaction with goals, procedures, and outcomes of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357613478829">Wolf, 1978</xref>). The first survey was administered to the paraeducators involved in the study’s implementation; the second was administered to student participants. The classroom teacher distributed the surveys and assumed the students could read and understand the questions; she offered an explanation if a student asked for one. (Ryan asked one or two questions. Other participants answered the questions independently.)</p>
<p>Both paraeducators stated that they enjoyed participating in the study. Time and scheduling issues were the only challenging aspects noted. Each paraeducator reported seeing immediate progress in the students’ performance during the intervention phase. One remarked, “I saw students using the iPad as a learning tool, and I saw firsthand that these students could remember each step.” The other commented, “This study was amazing to me.”</p>
<p>In their written comments, all student participants indicated that they liked having a video made of them in class and stated that they enjoyed watching a video of themselves. As Ryan affirmed, “It was cool and fun.” Three of the four participants positively referenced the iPad. It was observed that without exception, all of the students seemed enthusiastic and excited to participate in the study each day.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current research was to evaluate the effects of VSM via an iPad on the mathematics skill acquisition of adolescent students with autism and intellectual disability. Results of the study were interpreted to identify a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables over three replications of the VSM intervention. The dependent variable, percentage of correct responses, indicated marked improvement in participant performance only when the intervention was implemented and not before; intervention effects were similar during the study’s follow-up phase, and the participants’ ability to transfer learning to a novel stimulus was demonstrated in the first five postintervention phases.</p>
<p>Similar to previous VM and VSM findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357613478829">Bellini &amp; Akullian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357613478829">Buggey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357613478829">Charlop-Christy &amp; Daneshvar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357613478829">Hitchcock et al., 2003</xref>), the intervention applied in the current study was successful in teaching students with disabilities a new skill. Results were likewise consistent with those of prior researchers in showing improved math functioning through the use of VM and VSM of students with disabilities and students at risk of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613478829">Cihak &amp; Bowlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357613478829">Schunk &amp; Hanson, 1989</xref>). The data additionally substantiated previous VM and VSM research demonstrating continuous improved student performance across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357613478829">Bellini &amp; Akullian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613478829">Cihak &amp; Bowlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the results can be used to confirm the efforts of previous researchers investigating the use of handheld computers to promote student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613478829">Cihak &amp; Bowlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613478829">Cihak et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of the current study extended the previous VSM literature in a number of respects. First, the VSM intervention incorporated innovative instructional methodologies allowing students with disabilities who were receiving services in a self-contained special education classroom increased access to the core curriculum. Although many evidence-based practices have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357613478829">Browder &amp; Cooper-Duffy, 2003</xref>), our efforts expanded the knowledge base in academic core instruction, specifically, through the use of VSM via an iPad, demonstrating the intervention’s utility as a highly efficient aide to instruction. Second, the study extended the research by documenting the acquisition of a functional math skill clearly linked to the core curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357613478829">Browder &amp; Cooper-Duffy, 2003</xref>). Third, the study extended research involving the use of VSM to teach a mathematical skill to a new population of students, that is, adolescents with autism and intellectual disability.</p>
<sec id="section30-1088357613478829">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The single-case study was conducted with four participants, affecting the generalizability of the findings. Replications of the experimental effect would strengthen external validity. An additional limitation relates to the first author assuming the dual role of classroom teacher and researcher. Although the original intent was to involve the paraeducators according to a set schedule, near the beginning of the study, this involvement was discontinued. Even though data collection procedures did not appear to be compromised, the change was made due to concerns related to treatment fidelity. The paraeducators frequently asked the teacher questions about the procedures, interrupting classroom instruction. As a result, the paraeducators were only involved in approximately 20% of the total sessions, mostly during the baseline condition.</p>
<p>Certain procedural limitations factored into the current research. Part of the instructions on the worksheets stated, “Read the story problem” when they should have read, “Read the story problem out loud or watch the video.” Changes were made to the worksheets after Day 1 of baseline. During the second session of the intervention phase, it was noted that Joey’s video self-model contained a step that was incorrect. Additional filming and editing were required to correct the VSM for Joey. On one occasion during postintervention phases, only the morning session was conducted due to the scheduling of school activities during the afternoon session. It is possible this change in routine may have had a subtle effect on participant performance. Because spring break occurred the 7th week of the 10-week study, the postintervention and/or follow-up phases were interrupted for all participants. Outcomes for certain students may have been adversely affected.</p>
<p>Marked differences were noted between Joey’s and Aaron’s performances during the fading procedure and follow-up probes. Although the two students made similar gains during the intervention phase, Aaron’s posttreatment averages declined dramatically, falling to 87% and 79.6%, respectively. In contrast, Joey’s scores averaged 100%, both during postintervention Phase 6 and follow-up. It is speculated that differences in the students’ ability to retain and generalize information may have been related to uncontrolled factors, such as differences in aptitude. For example, Joey’s level of intellectual functioning was reported to be in the “low to average” range, while Aaron’s full-scale IQ fell in the “borderline” range of intelligence. In addition, Aaron’s working memory was estimated to be at the fourth percentile. The classroom teacher believed that Joey’s ability to memorize and follow visual cues were important factors relating to his success. She likewise attributed Aaron’s performance, at least in part, to his being the last student to receive the intervention. Although both students qualified for participation in the study on the basis of skill-based assessment, differences in participant performance suggest that it may be important to consider factors other than skill level when planning for and accurately projecting intervention outcomes.</p>
<p>An additional limitation relates to the similarity of prices in the intervention and postintervention phases. Each price was changed based on its generalizability to one part of the problem (penny, nickel, dime, quarter, or dollar bill). In other words, the price was altered either by one penny, one nickel, one dime, one quarter, or one dollar. Problem presentation during the intervention phase also was restricted to one five-item exemplar. It is acknowledged that repeated presentations of the same academic task can have a “facilitative effect” on participant performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357613478829">Gast, 2010</xref>). Practice effects thus present a confounding variable, potentially influencing the outcome of the study. Instituting greater variability among visual stimuli during task presentation may have strengthened the results of the study in terms of the inferences made.</p>
<p>Finally, although social validation data were collected, the way in which the information was gathered represents a limitation. A more indirect method of assessing consumer satisfaction such as documenting students’ voluntary and/or continued use of the VSM procedure following the study’s completion would have strengthened the interpretation of the results. In the future, researchers would do well to examine areas noted in this section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1088357613478829">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The current findings can be used to suggest that VSM via an iPad could be an effective option for teachers implementing interventions to improve the academic performance of students with autism and intellectual disability, including those receiving educational services in special education classrooms. Moreover, the results of the study can be used to draw implications for educators delivering instruction to students of varied abilities in broadly diverse settings. Importantly, the study’s outcome addressed the current need to extend the literature base in the use of VSM to strengthen academic skills instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357613478829">Prater, Carter, Hitchcock, &amp; Dowrick, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, the VSM intervention allowed participants to independently access the technology and prompt themselves through the completion of functional math skills without teacher assistance. The results, therefore, have implications for educators in terms of innovative methods that may be feasibly implemented without high levels of teacher supervision. The intervention is less labor-intensive than some instructional procedures, potentially freeing up instructor time and allowing multiple students to receive individualized assistance. Furthermore, the invention supports independence and the development of quality work habits, important outcomes for all learners, including students with autism.</p>
<p>An immediate and abrupt change in student performance was observed each time the video model was introduced. The data therefore demonstrate the efficacy of using visual stimuli to enhance skill acquisition when working with students with autism and limited cognitive ability. The classroom teacher reported that study participants appeared to be excited to use the iPad and watch the VSM. Anecdotal information indicated that students with serious behavior issues (i.e., aggression, language, fidgeting, inattention) remained on task to a greater extent than when the technology was unavailable. Results suggest that VSM improved students’ academic skills and may have increased their task engagement.</p>
<p>Additional applications of VSM could benefit students with disabilities in a number of ways, allowing learners to engage in a wide array of academic and work-related tasks. The increased educational opportunity could lead to improved self-efficacy, resulting in better social and academic outcomes over the life span. Positive intervention effects, generalized across behaviors, contexts, and time could likewise significantly affect future educational practice.</p>
<p>Interventions such as the one evaluated in the present study may help adolescents with disabilities access the core curriculum and achieve improved long-term outcomes. However, further research is needed to explore the efficacy of using interventions such as VSM to extend the literature base in academic core instruction for all students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357613478829">Browder &amp; Cooper-Duffy, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1088357613478829">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>Systematic replications of the study could be helpful in examining a number of research questions. For example, in the future, researchers would do well to assess the positive effects of VSM via an iPad on dependent variables such as on-task behavior during academic instruction. Anecdotal data collected as part of the current research suggested that measuring students’ on-task behavior during regular math instruction and comparing the level of performance to the students’ behavior during VSM intervention could provide useful information for teachers. Assessing different math skills, such as budgeting and time management, also could be beneficial. Additional research is likewise needed to examine the use of VSM via an iPad to teach students with autism and intellectual disability a variety of academic subjects, such as science, reading, and writing. The investigation of mathematics instruction incorporating similar technology in community and post-high-school settings also is warranted. Generalization of the methods to involve teachers, community workers, family members, and other school professionals is an additional area deserving further investigation. A potential residual effect in relation to improved on-task behavior and academic performance was observed following the removal of VSM. Because the apparent improvements may have been associated with the intervention, further investigation of unplanned effects is recommended.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Over the past two decades, opportunities for students with developmental disabilities, including autism and intellectual disability, to participate more fully in the core curriculum have greatly increased. In addition, there exists a greater focus on individual strengths and fostering independence in the presence of high expectations for students with disabilities. Important outcomes include the acquisition of functional, adaptive, daily living, and social skills, and to gain the competencies necessary to achieve the highest level of independence possible. Results of the study are interpreted to conclude that VSM via an iPad may be an effective way to deliver academic content to adolescent students with autism and intellectual disability. Although present findings are promising, additional research is needed to establish VSM as an evidence-based practice for students with disabilities and in a variety of academic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357613478829">Prater et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
