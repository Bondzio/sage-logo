<p>The revolution to live healthier lifestyles has many individuals exercising more and eating healthier foods. Most followers of this revolution can discuss the nuances of healthy eating and exercise. But, when it comes to brain health how much does the average health conscious individual know? Amazingly, the brain plays a major role in the quality of life one experiences, yet most people do not consider maintaining a physically fit brain. There is a plethora of new information being published on lifestyle habits that enhance brain health.</p>
<p>While much can be done to facilitate brain health, there are two major risk factors that are not affected by behavioral modification. These risk factors include inherited genetic predisposition and aging, the two most important risk factors for developing neurodegenerative diseases such as dementias, most commonly Alzheimer’s, as well as movement disorders like Parkinson’s. There is now evidence that the aging process includes structural chemical and functional changes; the degree of change, however, may not be clinically manifested in the same way even with similar genetic predispositions.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822312466869">
<title>The Concept of Brain Plasticity</title>
<p>Brain plasticity (also known as neuroplasticity or cortical remaping) refers to the ability of the nervous system to change its structure and function over one’s lifespan in reaction to environmental elements. There are several forms of brain plasticity; the most important ones include synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and functional compensatory plasticity.</p>
<p>Synaptic plasticity (or synaptic pruning) occurs when the brain is exposed to learning new information and or is engaged in new experiences. New neuronal pathways evolve or old ones are altered allowing better communication at the synaptic junction of the neurons to create new memories, learn new information, or adapt to new experiences.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis, on the other hand, is the proliferation of new nerve cells in the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus and, according to some research, the prefrontal cortex. The new neurons occur when the stem cells in these areas divide, one becoming the stem cell and the other the new neuron, which can travel to needed parts of the brain. Studies, both animal and human, demonstrate sudden neuronal death can trigger the process of neurogenesis. Neurogenesis in the adult brain is a new concept as it was once believed the number of neurons one possessed was present at birth.</p>
<p>Finally, functional compensatory plasticity is a strategic function whereby some older adults are able to use the same regions of the brain as younger adults and also use other regions not used by younger individuals. This type of plasticity demonstrates the brain’s ability to use multisource plasticity resulting in higher cognitive function in older adults at a time the aging brain experiences age-related brain function decline.</p>
<p>While much is still unknown about brain plasticity at various ages across the lifespan, what is known is that intellectual or mental activity simulates brain plasticity in healthy older adults as well as those with neurological degenerative disorders.</p>

<title>The Aging Brain</title>
<p>As a function of aging, it stands to reason that the brain, like the rest of the human body, undergoes physical, chemical, biological, and psychological changes. Originally, it was believed that age-related memory loss (on one end of the spectrum) to the devastating disease of dementia/Alzheimer’s was due to the loss of brain neurons, a process that begins at birth and continues throughout life. More recently, researchers believe that even in the presences of disease, one can expect to posses healthy neurons throughout life. Normal cognitive loss is now believed to be a result of long-term chemical interaction in the brain. This premise stems from the viewpoint that the brain loses dopamine as it ages, slowing metabolism in the region of the brain responsible for cognition. Another neurotransmitter that decreases with aging is glutamate. Evidence indicates older adults have lower concentrations of glutamate in the motor cortex when compared to younger adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312466869">1</xref></sup> Additionally, there is decreases in the number of the various serotonin receptors and serotonin transporter 5-HTT. Hence, the theory that cognitive decline is due to complex chemical interaction in the brain is becoming more widely accepted.</p>
<p>Other age-related brain changes include decrease in brain weight and volume by approximately 5% to 10% in the hippocampus (the region important for memory); the surface grooves decrease, ventricles enlarge, neurofibrillary tangles increase. The aging brain also displays decaying dendrites and formation of senile plaques throughout the brain. Additionally, the brain reduces its glucose use, which is its main energy source.</p>
<p>The role of genetics, specifically its influence on the rate of brain aging is a focal point of current research. Finally, cognitive decline as a result of neurodegeneration is also associated with the occurrence of oxidative stress, which destroys DNA replication and inhibits repair.</p>
<p>Brain changes and disuse weakens the neuronal connectivity to receive, process, and transmit information. As a result, older adults have difficulty multitasking; they process information slower, have difficulty remembering, take longer to learn new information, and their reaction time is slower.</p>

<title>Environmental and Behavioral Risk Factors</title>
<p>Given the risk for cognitive impairment that accompanies aging, environmental concerns and behavioral risk factors may be contributory but the evidence is not definitive according to the current research literature. These risk factors include diabetes, smoking, hypertension, elevated cholesterol levels, sedentary lifestyle, depression, and infrequent mental stimulation and social inactivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312466869">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Effect of Lifestyle Modification on Brain Health</title>
<p>The aging process with a prescriptive genetic makeup superimposed onto risky lifestyle behaviors can accelerate neurodegeneration. While factors such as genetics and aging cannot be altered, neuroprotective mechanisms can be bolstered by behavioral modification.</p>
<p>An area of inquiry centers on the effects of lifestyle behaviors either slowing down or speeding up the aging process. For example lower body weight due to diet can slow down the inflammatory process demonstrating lower rates of brain aging diseases such as Alzheimer’s. The thinking is that intake of fewer calories results in lower blood glucose levels and blood glucose can be a highly reactive chemical, which is thought to destroy protein in the brain. This notion stems from observations of diabetics who suffered from greater signs of brain aging than nondiabetics. Other cardiovascular conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension need to be controlled to avoid insult to the aging brain. For example, studies suggest hypertension accelerates normal brain shrinkage and impacts mental abilities negatively. Dietary control include limiting total salt intake to one-half teaspoon per day and consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Other dietary tips include decrease alcohol to no more than moderate intake, assuring adequate amounts of vitamins, such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and other B vitamins (folic acid/folate and B6). This prevents macrocytic anemia and lowers homocystiene level. Eating less red meat can not only reduce cholesterol levels but can also keep the homocystiene level in check. Also, the consumption of beans and dark green vegetables (e.g., kale, collards, broccoli, etc.) can boost vitamin B levels. Lastly, the consumption of a colorful diet of fruits and vegetables increase the intake of antioxidants, which help neutralize oxidative radicals.</p>
<p>Education is possibly another factor proving that the adage “use it or lose it” holds true when looking at studies that compared brain function of individuals who completed college versus those who did not. In fact, a recent study showed cognitive challenge in adult rodents’ stimulated development of new brain neurons. One does not have to return to school to maintain a healthy brain. Stimulating or stressing the brain by engaging in mental activities may help to maintain cognitive abilities. Timed games foster the ability to stay focused (pay attention), work faster, and think nimbly. There are many of these games available; from board games to electronic computer–based ones. If games are not attractive, crossword puzzles are an alternative.</p>
<p>Task specific memory strategies to enhance our ability to retain information can help in daily living. One such strategy to enhance daily recall is name association, for example, link a new piece of information (i.e., Florence, a new person you met) with something already familiar (i.e., a tourist spot in Italy). Also the use of “to do” list or calendar books can help with information that is not necessary to memorize.</p>
<p>Another strategy for maintaining brain health is regular aerobic exercise for 30 min per day most days of the week (5 to 6 days/week). Studies that assessed cognition and exercise acknowledged different outcomes for the various cognitive functions (i.e., space, speed, control processes, and executive function), with executive function-control processes showing the greatest improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312466869">3</xref></sup> Exercise also helps to reduce stress, which helps to keep in check the level of cortisol, a hormone shown to shrink the brain and damage the cells in the hippocampus (affecting memory). Other forms of activity to reduce stress include tai chi, yoga, meditation, and so forth.</p>
<p>Getting adequate sleep nightly is also imperative as sleep deprivation increases brain cortisol levels and lowers growth hormone that plays a role in repair/healing. Sleeping a total of 7 to 8 hr per night should be the goal. Establish a routine, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time daily, end daily activities about 1 to 2 hr before going to bed. Take a warm bath with a few drops of lavender in the water, prior to going to bed, or do other relaxing activities, which help to bring on sleep. Avoid activities that might trigger excitability or a surge of physical or mental energy, such as exercise or reading emails.</p>
<p>Preserving cognitive function is the goal of healthy aging. This idea is important especially in a time when individuals are living longer and the population of older adults is growing nationally. The data on preserving brain health continues to support the idea that keeping physically and mentally active is the major imperative outside of one’s genetic predisposition and the aging process.</p>
