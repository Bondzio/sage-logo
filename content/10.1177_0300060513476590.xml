<sec id="sec11-0300060513476590"><title>Objective</title>
<p>To examine factors affecting systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability during a single clinic visit, in treated hypertensive patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0300060513476590"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Hypertensive patients were recruited to this observational study. Blood pressure was measured using an automated blood pressure monitor when each patient arrived at the outpatient clinic and again when they saw the physician. Mean SBP and SBP variability during a single clinic visit were calculated. The cardio–ankle vascular index (CAVI), as a marker of arterial stiffness, was also measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0300060513476590"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 57 treated hypertensive patients (mean age 71 years) were included in the study. The mean SBP was positively correlated with age (<italic>r</italic> = 0.457), while SBP variability was positively correlated with age (<italic>r</italic> = 0.383), CAVI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.330), and glycosylated haemoglobin (<italic>r</italic> = 0.345) and triglyceride levels (r = 0.299).</p>

<sec id="sec14-0300060513476590"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Variability in SBP during a single clinic visit showed better correlations with arterial stiffness and risk factors for atherosclerosis than did mean SBP. Large SBP variability during a single clinic visit may reflect progression of atherosclerosis, in treated hypertensive patients.</p>

<p>Arterial stiffness is attracting attention as an index for assessing atherosclerosis, as it is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, fatal or nonfatal coronary events, and fatal strokes in patients with hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513476590">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513476590">2</xref></sup> The cardio–ankle vascular index (CAVI) is a new index of arterial stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513476590">3</xref></sup> As the most conspicuous feature of the CAVI is a lack of dependence on blood pressure, this index has recently become utilized for assessing arterial stiffness in clinical settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513476590">4</xref></sup> The CAVI is high in ageing patients and in those with atherosclerotic diseases such as coronary artery disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513476590">5</xref></sup> carotid atherosclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060513476590">6</xref></sup> and chronic kidney disease;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513476590">7</xref></sup> the index is also related to many coronary risk factors such as hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513476590">8</xref></sup> diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513476590">9</xref></sup> dyslipidaemia and smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513476590">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513476590">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, the CAVI decreases with control of diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513476590">11</xref></sup> and hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513476590">12</xref></sup> as well as abstention from smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513476590">10</xref></sup> These factors suggest that the CAVI is a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for two or more clinic visits has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of stroke, independent of the mean value of SBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513476590">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513476590">14</xref></sup> However, visit-to-visit variability is not always convenient to measure. During a single clinic visit, multiple measurements of blood pressure in the physician′s office may be subject to the ‘white-coat effect’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513476590">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513476590"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513476590">17</xref></sup> depending on whether medical personnel are present. However, the value of single-visit SBP variability has not been studied: there are few data about the relationships between such data and arterial stiffness, in patients with hypertension.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that SBP variability during a single clinic visit may reflect arterial stiffness as assessed by the CAVI in a better way than the mean SBP value during a single clinic visit. In the present study, the associations between SBP variability and arterial stiffness in treated hypertensive patients were examined during a single clinic visit, and their association was compared with that of the mean SBP.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0300060513476590"><title>Subjects and study protocol</title>
<p>This observational study was conducted between April 2011 and April 2012. This study included consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with hypertension at the Department of Integrated Medicine, Kagawa University Hospital (Kagawa, Japan) and who had regularly visited the outpatient clinic. Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. All patients were treated with at least one antihypertensive drug, with no changes to the antihypertensive drug regimen being made for ≥ 1 year prior to their enrolment in this study, or during the 1-year observation period when blood pressure data were obtained. Patients with a history of heart failure or obvious heart disease were excluded. None of the patients had a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or stroke. Patients with renal dysfunction, with serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.5 mg/dl at the time of analysis, were excluded from the present study.</p>
<p>Blood pressure was measured at the outpatient clinic every 1–2 months during the 1-year observation period for each patient, which started in April 2011. At the end of the 1-year observation period, in April 2012, measurement of the CAVI was performed in each patient (to assess arterial stiffness) and blood samples were taken in the morning after an 8-h overnight fast. Blood was collected into tubes containing 1.8 mg/ml ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and was analysed immediately (serum and plasma analyses), using standard laboratory techniques. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL–C), triglycerides, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), uric acid, haemoglobin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured. Serum creatinine levels were also measured.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kagawa University (reference number: 22-39). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0300060513476590"><title>Blood pressure measurement</title>
<p>All patients measured their own blood pressure when they arrived at the outpatient clinic and again when they saw the physician. When they arrived at the clinic, they measured their blood pressure in the upper right arm, in the sitting position, using an automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer (HEM-1040 OMRON Spotarm™ blood pressure monitor; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) without a human observer. Then, when they saw the physician, they again measured their blood pressure in the supine position using the same automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer, but this time with a human observer. The differences between the SBPs of the two measurements were calculated to assess SBP variability during a single clinic visit. The mean of the two SBP measurements was also calculated. These SBP measurements were performed at the outpatient clinic every 1–2 months during a 1-year period, and the mean of the data was calculated for each patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0300060513476590"><title>Assessment of arterial stiffness by CAVI</title>
<p>The CAVI was measured using an automatic vascular screening system (VaSera VS-1000; Fukuda Denshi, Tokyo, Japan), with the patient resting in a supine position. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was obtained by dividing the vascular length by the time it took for the pulse wave to propagate from the aortic valve to the ankle. SBP and DBP were measured at the brachial artery. The formula used to calculate the CAVI was as follows: CAVI = <italic>a</italic>[(2ρ/ΔP)×ln (SBP/DBP) PWV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513476590">2</xref></sup>]+<italic>b</italic>, where ΔP is SBP – DBP, ρ is blood density, and <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are scale conversion constants to match aortic PWV. The principle underlying the CAVI has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513476590">3</xref></sup> The equation is derived from Bramwell-Hill’s equation and the stiffness parameter ß, and the CAVI was adjusted for blood pressure, based on the stiffness parameter ß. Therefore, the CAVI reflects the stiffness of the aorta, femoral artery and tibial artery as a whole; theoretically, it is not affected by blood pressure. All of these measurements and calculations were performed on a VaSera™ VS-1000 automatic vascular screening system. For each patient, electrocardiogram electrodes were placed on both wrists, a microphone for detecting heart sounds was placed on the sternum, and cuffs were wrapped around both arms and both ankles. After automatic measurements, values of the right and left CAVI were calculated. The mean values of the right and left CAVI scores were then used for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0300060513476590"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS® statistical package, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows®. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean SBP values obtained from the two measurement time points, i.e. when patients arrived at the clinic and when they saw the physician. Correlations between SBP parameters and other variables were assessed by univariate analyses. Subsequently, stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to select factors independently associated with SBP parameters. A <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0300060513476590" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The study included 57 patients (28 males, 29 females) with a mean ± SD age of 71 ± 8 years (range 53–87 years). Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study group at are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300060513476590">Table 1</xref>. The high mean ± SD value of the CAVI (9.0 ± 1.0) indicated the presence of arterial stiffening in the patients as a whole. The overall mean ± SD SBP (126 ± 11 mmHg) during one clinic visit was not particularly high, because blood pressure was appropriately controlled by medication in all patients.

<p>The present study sought to elucidate the factors influencing the mean SBP and SBP variability for two blood pressure measurements during a single clinic visit, in treated hypertensive patients. The present study demonstrated that: (i) a similar proportion of patients experienced an increased SBP as the proportion that experienced a decreased SBP in the presence of a physician (32 patients [56%] versus 25 patients [44%]); (ii) there was no significant overall difference between the mean SBP measurement upon arrival and that when patients saw the physician; (iii) an SBP variability of 11 ± 4 mmHg between the two measurements during a single clinic visit was observed; (iv) the mean SBP during the single clinic visit (mean of two measurements) was positively correlated with age, while SBP variability was positively correlated with age, triglycerides, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and CAVI, which are atherosclerosis-related parameters; (v) only age was independently associated with the mean SBP during a single clinic visit, whereas age and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, which are atherosclerosis-related parameters, were independently associated with SBP variability during a single clinic visit.</p>
<p>In the present study, SBP variability during a single clinic visit did not reflect a ‘white-coat effect’ because while SBP was higher in the physician’s presence in 56% of patients (32/57), it was lower in 44% (25/57). All patients had to walk for some distance before they arrived at the outpatient clinic and measured their blood pressure. Therefore, they were exposed to different potential stressors at both measurement times. This may explain why the overall patient group (<italic>n</italic> = 57) did not show a statistically significant difference of the SBP changes during a single clinic visit, in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513476590">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies demonstrated an association between systemic atherosclerotic change and 24-h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513476590">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513476590">19</xref></sup> or visit-to-visit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513476590">20</xref></sup> blood pressure variability. However, there are few data about the relationship between atherosclerosis and SBP differences between two measurements during a single clinic visit. To our knowledge, this is the first study to present such data. The most striking finding from this current study was that SBP variability during a single clinic visit showed better correlations with arterial stiffness, as assessed by the CAVI, and risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as triglycerides and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, than did the mean SBP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300060513476590">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, considerable SBP variability during a single clinic visit may reflect the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with treated hypertension. Clinical examination and treatment of atherosclerosis-related diseases may be needed in patients with large single-visit SBP variability. Recently, visit-to-visit variability in SBP has been shown to be a predictor of stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513476590">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513476590">14</xref></sup> The present study focused on the associations between arterial stiffness and SBP variability and mean SBP during a single clinic visit. We found that SBP variability during a single clinic visit showed better correlations with arterial stiffness (as assessed by the CAVI) than did mean SBP in patients with treated hypertension. This finding suggests that attention should be paid to the timing of SBP measurement at each clinic visit, because values may easily change according to different stressors in patients with increased arterial stiffness. For example, determination of the timing of SBP measurement during each clinic visit may be needed to assess the visit-to-visit variability in SBP.</p>
<p>In the present study, age and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were identified as independent determinants of SBP variability during a single clinic visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0300060513476590">Table 4</xref>). This is understandable because age is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513476590">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513476590">22</xref></sup> Although the CAVI is a parameter of arterial stiffness, which reflects one important factor of atherosclerosis, this index was not selected as an independent determinant of SBP variability in this current study. It is well known that the CAVI increases with advancing age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513476590">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513476590">4</xref></sup> This may be why the CAVI was eliminated during stepwise multiple regression analyses. However, HbA<sub>1c</sub> as an independent determinant of the SBP variability during a single clinic visit may suggest that single-visit SBP variability in patients with glucose intolerance or diabetes may be an indicator of the progression of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513476590">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, SBP variability during a single clinic visit showed better correlations with arterial stiffness and risk factors for atherosclerosis than did mean SBP. Large SBP variability during a single clinic visit may reflect the progression of atherosclerosis, in patients with hypertension.</p>
