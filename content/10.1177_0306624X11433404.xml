<p>In 1978, China shifted toward an open-door policy aimed at generating opportunities for economic reforms and modernization. The reforms led to significant changes socially and politically, affecting social culture and individual behaviors. The resulting <italic>she hui feng</italic> (i.e., erosion of social convention) changed crime and deviance in Chinese society. Within this climate of change, involvement with heroin use began to increase. <italic>Women and Heroin Addiction in China’s Changing Society</italic> documents the linkages and interrelationships between macro-level changes in Chinese society and individual-level changes, including involvement with crime, illicit drugs, and deviance.</p>
<p>This book presents one of the first systematic studies of heroin use in China. Readers are provided with an insiders’ view of involvement with heroin use and crime among females in China. Through participant observation and qualitative interviews with more than 90 heroin users from the Kunming area of China, a descriptive analysis of this phenomenon is presented. Readers are provided unprecedented access to this hidden phenomenon in this understudied part of the world. They will develop a comprehensive understanding of historical, social, and political changes that have occurred in China over the past 60 years.</p>
<p>This book is divided into seven main chapters. Chapter 1 presents an overview of key social changes that have occurred in China since 1949. Linkages between economic policies, modernization, social and cultural goals, and changes in individuals’ lives are discussed. Trends in the broader global drug trafficking markets, involvement with illicit drug use, and changing roles of women in Chinese society are described.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 presents an overview of the key methodological challenges encountered in the research process and provides a compelling argument for significance of the research site. Yunnan Province was selected due to its geographical proximity within larger drug trafficking routes and history of cultivation and consumption of opium. The chapter ends with a detailed description of the study design and sample.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, a historical analysis of the women in this study in terms of the social institutions of family, school, and life after school is presented to place the later discussion of involvement with heroin into a broader social and lifestyle context. Through the examination of the impact of family, school, and peer influences, the various social and cultural factors that served as preexisting factors to heroin use are described in detail. The significance of family conflict and breakup, parent–child communication, economic hardship, and the challenges faced by <italic>spoiled daughters</italic> is described. The chapter ends with a discussion of the main illegal activities the women in the study were involved with including commercial sex service, selling drugs, and gambling.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 describes the processes through which the women in this study initiated heroin use. The discussion of the initiation of heroin use is placed within the broader context of the popularity of heroin in Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan Province, demonstrating how the women’s recruitment into heroin was linked with the popularity of heroin in the area. The importance of sociological and individual factors in the initiation socialization process is described in rich detail.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, the interconnection between the continued use of heroin and involvement with criminal behavior among women is discussed, with a focus on two main themes: managing drug use and taking care of business. As women became more heavily involved in heroin, they increasingly sought relationships that would allow them access to heroin and began participating in other illicit activities such as the illegal sex service and property crime to support their heroin use. Through their associations with drug using peers and increasing involvement in illicit activities, the female heroin users learned how to survive and maintain their drug use careers. The three tiers of drug selling identified within the sample are discussed in extensive detail.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 examines the social individual factors that contributed to desistance of heroin use among the women in the study. Cessation of heroin use was influenced by social support, including relationships with significant others and family members. The influences of legitimate work and the role of motherhood are discussed. Although health-related concerns become increasingly important for long-term heroin users, chronic diseases and other health concerns seldom translated into the termination of drug use. Chapter 6 ends with a discussion of the role and importance of treatment for desistance from heroin use. There was great individual variation with regard to the types of factors that influenced desistance.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 presents a discussion of the conclusions and policy implications. The importance of social and individual factors as influences on women’s heroin careers is reiterated. The influence of China’s changing social and economic context on cultural changes, including individual heroin use, is discussed. The author concludes by focusing on governmental drug control policies that seem to have a profound influence on the drug using careers of the women in this study. Specifically, the newly enacted drug law that emphasizes community-based drug treatment programs is highlighted as a step in the right direction. The importance of government support for former drug users, including greater opportunities for school, employment, and social welfare, is critical for supporting the transition out of heroin use in China.</p>
<p>While the discussions of theory and the broader drug literature are limited, the macro-level perspective presented in this book extends the value of this research beyond traditional drug studies or criminological research. The study makes a significant contribution toward understanding interrelationships between social and cultural changes as related to involvement with crime and deviance historically and politically.</p>
