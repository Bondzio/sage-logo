<abstract>
<p>For the psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott, living takes place at the intersection of inner and outer worlds, in a space riven by destructiveness and enlivened by love, play and repair. Working with Winnicott’s understandings of empathy and play, this essay explores creative writing’s prompting of a recognition of the not-yet-past, as it suffuses the place where we live. This essay focuses on the rancorous debates among historians and critics that followed the publication of Kate Grenville’s <italic>The Secret River</italic>, a novel about Australia’s settler-colonial past. After pointing to the centrality of empathy within these debates, the essay examines Winnicott’s exploration of destructiveness as the precursor to empathy and reparation. The essay continues by examining the different modes of acknowledged and disavowed empathy associated with historiography and fiction, exploring, in particular, <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s engagement of empathy. The essay concludes by suggesting that Grenville’s work of ‘historical’ fiction ‘contributes’ (in Winnicott’s terms) by provoking an awareness that the violence that was part of Australia’s settler-colonialist history cannot be simply consigned to the past but lives on – and requires recognition – in the place that is Australia today.</p>

<p>At last year’s Adelaide Festival, the Australian author Kate Grenville <italic>almost</italic> slipped up by beginning to describe her novel <italic>The Secret River</italic> as ‘historical fiction’. Just in time, Grenville corrected herself, referring to her work, not in those seemingly appropriate and uncontroversial terms, but instead, as ‘writing about the past’. This essay reflects on this correction by placing it in the context of the rancorous debates that sprang up among historians and commentators following <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s publication. <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s engagement with the violence perpetrated against Australia’s indigenous communities by White convict settlers may have unsettled, I suggest, not only because it imagined those acts of violence from the point of view of those early settlers, and not only because it engaged its readers <italic>empathetically</italic> with the perpetrators of that violence, but because of the entanglement of empathy itself with destructiveness. In the following, I explore the controversies associated with <italic>The Secret River</italic> in light of Winnicott’s insights regarding destructiveness and the origins of empathy. In the course of this investigation, I connect those controversies with writing about the past’s linking of the psychical and historical dimensions of empathy/destructiveness – an association that, in the case of <italic>The Secret River</italic>, militates against the consignment of ‘settler-colonial’ violence straightforwardly to Australia’s past.</p>
<p>Grenville’s correction took place in 2012, during one of the Adelaide Festival’s literary evenings. In his introduction to this event, the Australian journalist and commentator David Marr emphasized each author’s nationality, birthplace and home, telling the audience that he had invited the panel to think about ‘why indeed they think it is, [that] they, as writers, raise the dead?’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698013485180">1</xref></sup> Grenville’s slip occurred in response to a question that Marr had been raising with each of the novelists about how their work spoke <italic>of</italic> the past but <italic>to</italic> today. Turning to Grenville, Marr asked, in general terms, about the problem of ‘attitudes of today, attitudes of the past’. How, he asked, did Grenville draw characters ‘in a novel that was set in the past but written to be read today? And what do you do’, he went on, ‘about what now seems ugly, in retrospect?’ Marr’s task, the motivation for his careful and almost ambiguous prompts, was to sustain a conversation amongst authors whose works ranged across the diverse fields of Spain’s dictatorship years, Europe in the 1930s, early Australian settler-colonialism and the American deep South. No shortage of ‘ugliness’ there. However, for readers of Grenville’s recent fiction – including, we might surmise, many of the audience gathered that night in Adelaide’s Elder Hall – there would have been little doubt about the places, the times, the events, to which Grenville was being led. For, by 2012, Grenville had completed three novels that together comprise a trilogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013485180">Grenville, [2005] 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698013485180">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013485180">2011</xref>), describing White settler encounters with indigenous communities in the early years of Australia’s colonial history – some of them of such violence that ‘ugliness’ stands almost as a euphemism. From the outset, reviewers of <italic>The Secret River</italic>, the first in Grenville’s trilogy, had underscored its ‘chilling, meticulous account’ of colonialism’s ‘sorrows and evils’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698013485180">Poster, 2006</xref>), and violent pasts had already been placed squarely on the table that night. By the time Marr turned to Grenville, the conversation had encompassed Javier Cercas’ fictional engagements with post-dictatorship Spain and Jenny Erpenbeck’s East German, post–World War II fictions. So there’s no doubt that Marr’s question pivoted on <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s confronting of its readers, ‘today’, with a ‘bloody, terrible, knowing violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013485180">Bedell, 2006</xref>) lying closer to – no, <italic>at</italic> home.</p>
<p>On a festival season autumn night in a hall in the University of Adelaide’s grounds – grounds whose ancestral indigenous owners she, alone of the speakers, had begun by acknowledging and thanking – Grenville was called on to speak of Australia’s past. In the midst of novels speaking of the unspeakable in distant Europe and America, speaking of home exerts particular pressures. For Grenville’s trilogy, as well as her opening acknowledgement to country,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698013485180">2</xref></sup> evoked, that night, a violence both as near as the ground under that audience’s feet, and yet strangely remote – too close for comfort, but unimaginably distant too. It is this paradox in all of its many dimensions – mnemonic, affective, ethical and historical – that Grenville’s trilogy comprising <italic>The Secret River, The Lieutenant</italic> and <italic>Sarah Thornhill</italic> so powerfully works through. But that night, there, in the cultivated and comfortable ambience of the Elder Hall, deflected, we might hazard, by the difficulty of speaking to and beyond that comfort, Grenville may have seemed set on avoiding the ugliness to which Marr had gestured. But as I’ll go on to argue, when Grenville responded to Marr’s question about ‘what now seems ugly, in retrospect’ by speaking about what fiction does, her account of writing about the past’s strategies for forging connections between characters and readers spoke to the <italic>heart</italic> of that violence to which Marr had alluded.</p>
<p>A novel, Grenville proposed ‘is about an individual, whereas our thoughts about the past are about a collectivity – a sort of stereotype or a cliché about the past’. Elaborating on this theme, she added that<disp-quote>
<p>one of the great freedoms about writing fiction about the past is that you are taking an individual … and so the freedom of writing historical – er – writing a novel set in the past, is that you can write about an individual. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013485180">‘Raising the Dead’, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To those who have not followed the critical and academic reception of Grenville’s <italic>The Secret River</italic>, this correction, together with the repetition of ‘an individual’ might go unnoticed – this is spontaneous speech, not written prose, after all. And anyway, within what possible context could the intrusion and then erasure of ‘historical’ possibly constitute a slip of any significance?</p>
<sec id="section1-1750698013485180">
<title>Whose story to tell</title>
<p>Adelaide’s Elder Hall sits in the green pleasantness of the grounds of Adelaide’s oldest university, on North Terrace, also known as the boulevard of culture and learning. Founded in the colonial era, the university’s website speaks proudly of its historic campus, its sandstone heritage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750698013485180">3</xref></sup> and its membership of the group of eight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750698013485180">4</xref></sup> However, by 2012, within this refined setting and across Australian universities, halls, newspapers and journals, too, no less than four fiercely fought and fiery battles had been raging for some time, every one of them catching <italic>The Secret River</italic> up in its flames.</p>
<p>Several years earlier, I’d felt the warmth of those flames when a friend suggested that the story told in <italic>The Secret River</italic> wasn’t Grenville’s to tell. I heard this response, accurately, I think, as a statement regarding Australia’s Indigenous peoples’ singular rights to the telling of their history, but such were and are the extent of the bushfires surrounding Grenville’s novel that it could have meant other things too.</p>
<p>In what has become known as Australia’s ‘history wars’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750698013485180">5</xref></sup> politicians and historians continue to line up around interpretations of Australia’s past. Focused particularly on the early days of settlement, debate encompasses the extent of settler violence and whether, and if so, what manner of redress should be offered to Australia’s Indigenous peoples for their suffering and loss. In a speech delivered in 1996, John Howard, Australia’s Prime Minister during the fiercest years of the history wars,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750698013485180">6</xref></sup> famously termed researchers seeking to bring Indigenous suffering and settler violence to light ‘black armband’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750698013485180">7</xref></sup> historians – a description in keeping with Howard’s resolute refusal to apologize on behalf of the nation for any wrongdoing perpetrated against Australia’s Indigenous peoples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1750698013485180">8</xref></sup> With its harrowing account of the massacre of an Indigenous community by a group of convict settlers, <italic>The Secret River</italic> was wearing, so it might seem, its armband on its sleeve – an armband that <italic>connected</italic> the Thornhill’s failed attempt to forget their own participation in violence with an ongoing failure in the present both to remember the violence and inequalities of the past and to acknowledge their persistence in Australia today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013485180">Mitchell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As the particular case of Australia’s ‘Stolen Generations’ controversy shows,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1750698013485180">9</xref></sup> when academic historians manoeuvred in the history war’s trenches, disputes over what happened ignited battles over the historian’s craft and the methods deployed in finding, reading and interpreting the evidence of the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1750698013485180">10</xref></sup> For history to sustain its status as an authoritative narrative, argued one historian, it needed – particularly where violence and victimhood were at issue – to combine the proximities of perspective provided by oral history with the reflective distance afforded by positivist historical archival research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698013485180">Attwood, 2008</xref>: 78). The introduction – particularly in relation to histories of settler-colonial violence – of methods, including oral history and testimony collection, and one might add, the writing of novels about that past, had brought about a shift in focus from ‘things that happened’ to ‘things experienced’ (p. 79). The result, argued Attwood, is a new emphasis on ‘subjective states of mind and heart [and] a renewed role for empathy … in historical research’ (p. 79). One problem with this approach, Attwood went on to argue, was that it compelled identification on the part of settler Australians with Aboriginal victims, ‘diminishing the prospect of settler Australia working through this past’ (p. 92) and, most crucially, ‘obscuring <italic>continuities</italic> between white settler <italic>mentalités</italic> of yesterday and today’ (p. 92, emphasis added). The waning of the historian’s authority, Attwood suggested, had been accompanied by the rise of these modes of experiential ‘public history’ (p. 78). Although finding expression in written form, on these terms, <italic>The Secret River</italic> belongs to this ‘public history’. Engaged with the past and intensively researched,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1750698013485180">11</xref></sup> but not the work of an academic historian, it finds itself under attack now not just as ‘black armband history’ but for belonging to those experiential modes of public history that are weakening academic history’s influence. For Attwood, the most troubling aspect of this experiential history is its tendency to compel empathy only with settler-colonialism’s indigenous victims. In what follows, one of my aims will be to argue that this is not a charge that can be levelled at <italic>The Secret River</italic>.</p>
<p>If, on Attwood’s account, it is public history in general that needs tempering by the cool gaze of the historian, other interventions, including those of another historian, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Inga Clendinnen (2006)</xref> and several of her colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1750698013485180">12</xref></sup> took direct exception to <italic>The Secret River</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen (2006)</xref> questioned Grenville’s temerity in daring, in a radio interview, to describe her work as doing a new kind of history. Historians and novelists can both ‘play’ with the past, she argued, as long as they stay on their sides of the ravine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen, 2006</xref>: 31).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1750698013485180">13</xref></sup> However, for Clendinnen, it was in claiming to achieve what was, on Clendinnen’s terms, an illusory empathy with her fictionalized historical subjects that Grenville committed her gravest act of trespass: ‘The historians are doing their thing’, Grenville’s perhaps unwary comment had begun, ‘but let me as a novelist come to it in a different way, which is the way of empathising and imaginative understanding of those difficult events’ (Grenville quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen, 2006</xref>: 20). Once again, it is empathy, bracketed, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen’s (2006)</xref> terms with ‘<italic>untutored</italic> subjectivity’ (p. 2) that comes under attack. Although reviewers of Grenville’s novels and particularly <italic>The Secret River</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1750698013485180">14</xref></sup> have praised them for their eliciting of readerly empathy, for Clendinnen, the problem with this empathy arises from what Grenville herself described as ‘<italic>the experiential theory of writing</italic>’ (Grenville quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen, 2006</xref>: 24; emphasis in the original); as far as possible, explains Grenville, she did the things that she then went on to describe. But, argues Clendinnen, the flaw at the heart of this exercise lies in the assumption that the present-day writer (and by extension the present-day reader) <italic>can</italic> put herself into the shoes of her characters. This assumption disregards the gulf that separates ways of thinking and feeling that belong to the past from those that constitute the experiences of contemporary authors and readers. Once on dry land, Clendinnen points out, the seafarer whose experience Grenville hoped to experience herself on her own crossing of Sydney Harbour ‘thrashed’ the ‘Sarjeant’ who had clung to him in the waves. It is the meting out of this <italic>violence</italic> that leads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen (2006)</xref> to conclude that the past is ‘another country’ (p. 25) that cannot be understood or ‘experienced’ by means of Grenville’s ‘untutored’ experiential theory. But why should it be violence – as it is in all of Clendinnen’s examples – that signifies the distance of the past from the present? This is a question to which the remainder of this essay responds.</p>
<p>In the midst of these heated debates, it is surely no wonder that Grenville stumbled. Grenville’s correction of ‘historical fiction’ to ‘writing about the past’ was linked, surely, with the virulence<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1750698013485180">15</xref></sup> of historians’ responses to her ‘historical’ fictions. Yet, it repeated, too, the offence with which historical fiction – and Grenville’s <italic>The Secret River</italic>, in particular – had been charged: the ‘offence’ of claiming empathy with historical individuals. The novelist, suggested Grenville, approaches the past by ‘writ[ing] about an individual’ and in order to do that, her response so inflammatorily implied, the author – and then her readers – has to get close to that individual. Warming to <italic>her</italic> theme, Grenville, more explicitly than the other authors on the panel, began in her turn to ‘knock history around a bit’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1750698013485180">16</xref></sup> Unlike the novel, with its focus on the individual, Grenville argued, ‘our thoughts about the past’ – surely an indirect reference to historiography – ‘produce stereotype and cliché. I resist the label historical fiction’; Grenville went on, distancing herself from the many reviewers who had blithely described <italic>The Secret River</italic> in just those terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1750698013485180">17</xref></sup> ‘That summons up a kind of museum diorama … every detail precise’, Grenville continued. ‘The problems of <italic>my</italic> characters’, she concluded, ‘are the problems that we solve in Australia today’ (Grenville in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013485180">‘Raising the Dead’, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In these exchanges, Grenville and her critics accuse each other not of ‘raising the dead’ but of destroying life. In response to critiques of her work from historians, Grenville accuses historiography of producing stereotypes, figures frozen behind glass in the museum diorama; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen (2006)</xref> responds that the novelist’s imagination, far from ‘giv[ing] history life and flesh’ (p. 17) peoples fiction with mere ‘puppets danc[ing] on the very edge of the history-fiction ravine’ (p. 31). It is not just their shared vitriol that renders these exchanges uncanny. It is also the doubling performed by their emphatic location of <italic>destructiveness</italic> exclusively in the other, so that what is taken to be a view of the other across the ravine turns out to be the self, reflected in a fairground mirror. There is something to be reflected on, here, about the fierceness of this exchange on empathy’s relations with historiography and fiction. Glimpsed here only through a glass darkly, this trenchantly disavowed ferocity, if approached directly, might shed light on <italic>The Secret River</italic> and other books like it. But only if we let those figures dancing at the ravine edge lead and follow them into the mirror.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1750698013485180">
<title>Whole worlds for us to play in</title>
<p>Doubtless, Clendinnen’s critique of <italic>The Secret River</italic> and other responses like it must be factored into Grenville’s slip. But if <italic>we</italic> step down from the ladder<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1750698013485180">18</xref></sup> and into the mirror, following Clendinnen’s and Grenville’s paths, then the possibility emerges that what novels like <italic>The Secret River</italic> do <italic>is not</italic> best described by the term ‘historical fiction’. Down here, in the debate over <italic>The Secret River</italic>, what we have stumbled on is a disavowed destructiveness projected <italic>into</italic> the other – by historiography <italic>into</italic> ‘the novel about the past’ and vice versa – and an association between this destructiveness and empathy. Taking these disavowed associations seriously means attending to historiography’s and ‘writing about the past’s’ relations <italic>with</italic> destructiveness and empathy.</p>
<p>Not all historians agree that there is no place for empathy in any properly practiced historical research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen’s (2006)</xref> submission to the tyranny of distance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1750698013485180">19</xref></sup> and her loss ‘of any residual faith in the utility of empathy’ (pp. 21–22) followed from her realization that the minds and the emotions of the Aztecs were ‘ordered differently from mine’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698013485180">Barbara Taylor (2012)</xref>, however, has recently argued, conversely – and controversially, given the current dominance of constructionism within the discipline of history – that ‘a core feature of the historical imagination [is its] grounding in an empathic connection between the historian and her subjects – a connection made possible by the species similarity between human subjectivities across place and time’ (p. 199).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1750698013485180">20</xref></sup> Wading into the Clendinnen/Grenville dispute, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698013485180">Brian Crozier (2008)</xref> suggests, indeed, that Clendinnen’s own historiography reveals nothing less than her ‘passionate efforts to achieve just this kind of empathy …’ (p. 13.3).</p>
<p>If Taylor and Crozier are right, then far from being separated by a ravine, historiography’s and fiction’s play with the past turns out to be connected by the thread of empathy. But perhaps there is more to Clendinnen’s refutation of empathy than disavowal, for historiography and ‘writing about the past’ mobilize empathy <italic>differently</italic> and for different ends. As Clendinnen emphasizes, the historian wrestles with the difficulty of doing justice to a past that evades easy comprehension and that threatens, always, to remain obscure or slip from view. On Clendinnen’s account, it’s the revealed distance and difference of past from present that measures the authenticity of historical representation. It isn’t that empathy plays no <italic>role</italic> in Clendinnen’s research. Empathy is <italic>tried</italic> and it falters; empathy’s frustration, rather than its absence, signals that the profundity of the past’s difference and distance from the present has been plumbed.</p>
<p>So what of <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s relations with empathy and the past? Grenville herself has stressed that <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s responsibility is <italic>to</italic> the present: ‘The problems of <italic>my</italic> characters are the problems that we solve in Australia today’ (Grenville in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013485180">‘Raising the Dead’, 2012</xref>). In <italic>The Secret River</italic>, the past is imagined, therefore, ‘as if it were happening here and now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698013485180">Grenville, 2006</xref>: 47),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1750698013485180">21</xref></sup> and the present becomes quite explicitly the <italic>location</italic> of Grenville’s fiction. In contrast with historians’ responses, literary critical engagements with <italic>The Secret River</italic> have tended to share with Grenville a view of the novel as addressed to – and about, indeed – contemporary White settler Australia’s continuing enmeshment <italic>with</italic> settler-colonial violence. For one commentator, the empathetic identifications proffered by <italic>The Secret River</italic> provoke awareness in readers of their shared complicity with colonialism understood as an ahistorical structure, rather than an event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698013485180">Probyn-Rapsey, 2007</xref>: 68). For another, <italic>The Secret River</italic> ‘dramatizes not only frontier conflict, but also the attempt to forget this past <italic>and white Australians</italic>’ <italic>complicity in its ongoing, structural effects</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013485180">Mitchell, 2010</xref>: 254, emphasis added). <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s achievement, argues Mitchell, is to link past with present by writing the past into cultural memory. The novel, Mitchell proposes, referencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013485180">LaCapra (2001)</xref>, ‘courts the reader’s … empathy of the “unsettling” kind’, inhabiting the space between ‘(contemporary white Australian) self and (nineteenth-century British colonial) other’ (pp. 264–265) in order that ‘readers can … acknowledge a present relationship to a difficult past’ (p. 273). Far from branding it historically naïve, these literary critics link <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s provocation of empathy with an ethics of recognition and a politics of reconciliation. But to my mind, they do not <italic>quite</italic> explain how readers of novels, including <italic>The Secret River</italic>, come to empathize unsettlingly <italic>with</italic> perpetration, or why empathy has been the cause of such fierce dispute in the debate between historians and novelists. To come at this question more fully, we need to return to Clendinnen’s encounters with the violence of the past. Clendinnen’s empathy failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen, 2006</xref>: 22–23) when she was confronted with her historical subjects’ violence, whether in the dedication of male newborns to death in battle by the Aztecs, or the head tossing of Ilongot men. But to repeat the question I have already begun to ask, why should it be violence – hardly rare in today’s world – that became the marker, for a historian, of the distance between ‘then’ and ‘now’ and of the impossibility of empathy across that gulf?</p>
<p>For the British psychoanalyst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">D.W. Winnicott ([1971] 1991)</xref>, the path to empathy begins in the mirror, or to begin with, in the mother’s face, which, in early infancy, acts as a precursor of the mirror (p. 111). When the baby looks into that mirror, suggests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott ([1971] 1991)</xref>, what it sees ‘is himself or herself. In other words the mother is looking at the baby and <italic>what she looks like is related to what she sees there</italic>’ (p. 112; italics in the original). Only gradually, suggests Winnicott, does the infant begin to understand its separation from the mother whose face has been mirroring its own – a process in which play, understood in the Winnicottian sense, performs an enormously significant role. Winnicottian play takes place in an ‘intermediate area’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 11–14) straddling inner and outer reality. Likewise, the ‘transitional objects’ and ‘transitional phenomena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 1–25) with which infants play are both, in a sense, found <italic>and</italic> created by the infant, belonging to both inner reality <italic>and</italic> external life. The development of a sense of the separation of ‘me’ from external reality depends, argues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott ([1971] 1991)</xref>, on the degree to which the mother is able to disillusion the infant of its fantasy that external reality is its own omnipotent creation (pp. 12–13) and the degree to which objects, including the mother, therefore come to be perceived as having an independent existence. A growing awareness of the mother’s survival of the rage prompted by the inevitable frustration of its wishes, or the destructiveness, in the form of oral sadism that is part of primitive loving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1986] 1990</xref>: 84) begins to awaken, in the infant, a sense of the mother’s independent existence. There follows, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750698013485180">Winnicott (1965)</xref> argued, ‘a gradual recognition of the difference between fact and fantasy, and of the mother’s capacity to survive the instinctual moment, and so to be there to receive and understand the true reparative gesture’ (p. 24). As Taylor explains, at this stage, ‘[a]mbivalence emerges, and guilt at destructive urges, and reparative impulses; and with these the baby discovers his capacity to gratify his mother, to “contribute” to her [and to] “step into the mother’s shoes”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698013485180">Taylor, 2012</xref>, quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750698013485180">Winnicott, 1965</xref>: 90).</p>
<p>If destructive rage constitutes empathy’s foundation, it plays a crucial role, too, in ‘making the reality, placing the object outside the self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 91). Although the rage and aggression felt by the infant are real, the acknowledgement of reality’s – and the mother’s – independent existence stems from a realization that the utter destruction the infant felt and believed itself to have perpetrated was, in fact, a fantasy: ‘Here fantasy begins for the individual. The subject can now <italic>use</italic> the object that has survived … but the price has to be paid in acceptance of the <italic>ongoing destruction in unconscious fantasy relative to object relating</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 90; emphasis added). For Winnicott, the processes described here are not confined solely to infantile life. Adulthood – involving in psychoanalytic understandings, the ongoing unconscious presence of infantile life – presents a continuing challenge to integrate the destructiveness at play <italic>in</italic> engagements with the world, and, in particular, in those ‘adult’ modes of play that include creativity and cultural activity.</p>
<p>The cultural field that is adult creativity includes both historiography and fiction, and empathy with its roots in and recapitulation of the destruction <italic>and then</italic> the use of the object plays across both. Yet, as we have seen, in the debate around <italic>The Secret River</italic> and in the Australian ‘history wars’, historians, including Clendinnen, have sought to distance their practice <italic>from</italic> empathy, citing, by way of explanation, the impossibility of empathizing with those subjects whose distance from today is borne out by <italic>their</italic> destructive violence. One answer to the question of why it is <italic>violence</italic> that is conceived of, here, as thwarting empathy might be found in the different temporalities of history and of writing about the past. As we have seen, empathy and reparative ‘contributing to’ follow on from acts of powerful but survivable destruction – destruction that has been more powerful in fantasy than in reality. Empathic reparation goes back over destruction, constructively contributing to that which has survived. But for history, faced as it so often is by ‘what now seems ugly, in retrospect’ and committed, as it is to the historical tracing of the path <italic>between</italic> then and now, there can ultimately be no reversal of time’s arrow, no ‘going back over’, no ‘raising the dead’, even if the creativity and constructiveness that belong to history draw on an energy linked with reparation. And then, the violence that history confronts has, in reality, occurred. No surprise, then, that it is the violence of perpetration that gets cited, here, as stopping empathy in its tracks, perhaps for the very reason that in doing or reading history, that violence risks becoming a point of identification (empathy, even) from which there can be little reparative escape. Even if ‘the living mind of the historian, encountering the inert and unrecoverable, positions herself to deliver a kiss of life to her <italic>material</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750698013485180">Taylor, 2004</xref>: 120; emphasis mine), the dead represented by that material remain, in reality, dead. No wonder, either, then, that from the point of view of writing about the past, the figures who people history may <italic>appear</italic> dead, or that the empathetic mode of novels including <italic>The Secret River</italic> appears from the point of view of history ‘false’.</p>
<p>But what then of writing of the sort represented by <italic>The Secret River</italic> – writing that is more closely associated with memory than with history and that belongs, within Attwood’s paradigm, to the realm of the experienced, rather than the domain of the happened? The term ‘experience’ plays a central and complex role in Winnicottian theory. Often italicized, experience seems to designate, for Winnicott, that which differentiates living from existence. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott ([1971] 1991)</xref>, it is play, in all its myriad creative, cultural and practical forms, that breathes life into experience, its difference from mere existence deriving from its location in the potential space between mother and baby (p. 53), or in adulthood, in the space between inner and outer reality.</p>
<p>For Winnicott, then, potential space is the ‘Location of Cultural Experience’ and ‘the Place where we [truly] Live’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1750698013485180">22</xref></sup> Put otherwise, it is playing <italic>in</italic> transitional space that creates a world in which we <italic>can</italic> truly live. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013485180">Clendinnen (2006)</xref> describes novels such as <italic>The Secret River</italic> as creating ‘whole worlds for us to play in’ (p. 31). In my view, history and fiction <italic>both</italic> constitute forms of play. But Attwood’s distinction between history’s concern with ‘the happened’ and contemporary and more experiential engagements with the past – or, better put, the past in the present – may nevertheless prove illuminating. For his stress on the experiential can shed light on the creativity of <italic>The Secret River</italic>, namely, its contribution to the production of contemporary Australia in the terms of Winnicottian potential space as ‘a place where we [can] live’.</p>

<title>Taking up land</title>
<p>In her book about writing <italic>The Secret River</italic>, Grenville recounts the novel’s genesis by describing two moments in which she caught herself reflected, one might say, in mirrors constituted by the eyes of Aboriginal Australia. On 28 May 2000, crossing Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of reconciliation between black and white Australians, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013485180">Grenville ([2005] 2006a)</xref> describes an exchange of looks and a moment of recognition between herself and an Aboriginal woman that, though<disp-quote>
<p>it should have made me feel even better about what I was doing … sent a sudden blade of cold into my warm inner glow … the knowledge that my ancestor had been here too … within twenty years of that first convoy. (p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later, when Murri writer Melissa Lucashenko asks Grenville where her family was from, Grenville’s reply that her great-great-great grandfather had taken up land elicits the response: ‘what do you mean “took up?” … “He took”’, words that Grenville describes experiencing as a punch to the stomach and as grenades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013485180">Grenville, [2005] 2006a</xref>: 28–29). Grenville’s deepening recognition of her own relations with the historical and continuing violence suffered by Australia’s indigenous communities is signalled here, as an embodied experience – both a stepping into the shoes of those against whom violence has been perpetrated and a new recognition of what it meant to be standing in ‘settler’ shoes in the ‘settled’ land of Australia. It was this moment that led Grenville to research her ancestor’s story and begin <italic>The Secret River</italic>. With its culmination in the agonizing scene of a massacre of Indigenous people perpetrated by convict settlers, including the novel’s central protagonist Thornhill, through whom the narration has been focalized, <italic>The Secret River</italic> has been read, as we have seen, in terms of ‘unsettled’ empathy. So how might Winnicott help illuminate the novel’s ‘contributing in’ to contemporary Australia’s present and future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750698013485180">Winnicott 1990</xref>: 87–88)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1750698013485180">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>If ‘settling in’ and making home in a new land revises the establishment of an external reality confirmed by the survival of the destroyed object, what then, where that settlement has been at the cost of the (near) annihilation of that land’s indigenous peoples? How in the aftermath of that real destruction can a nation come to life, rather than simply exist – particularly given fellow feeling’s dependence on the evidence of <italic>robust</italic> survival? This is the question through which <italic>The Secret River</italic> feels its way. And even if this question is (has to be) felt through via the perspective of white settler Australia, the terms of that feeling through serve the interests of reconciliation and renewed life for all those who call Australia home.</p>
<p><italic>The Secret River</italic>’s devastating final pages imaginatively remember what post-massacre ‘existence’ feels like for the perpetrator, in the terms of Winnicott’s account of things gone awry in the baby’s earliest experiences with the mother. Before any kind of place can be established, before play, comes the mother’s face that, in ordinary circumstances, acts as mirror: ‘the mother is looking at the baby <italic>and what she looks like is related to what she sees there</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 112; emphasis in the original). But where the mother cannot respond, it is as though the baby ‘looked into the mirror and saw nothing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 116). Babies<disp-quote>
<p>look and they do not see themselves … The mother’s face is not then a mirror. So perception takes the place of apperception, perception takes the place of what might have been a significant exchange with the world, a two-way process in which self-enrichment alternates with the discovery of meaning in the world of seen things. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 112–113)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is this ‘going awry’ that the ending of <italic>The Secret River</italic> evokes.</p>
<p>In the concluding pages of <italic>The Secret River</italic>, William Thornhill sits on his property scanning the ‘ancient landscape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698013485180">Winnicott, [1971] 1991</xref>: 116) through a telescope:<disp-quote>
<p>Watching the light on the cliffs was like watching the sea. Even after so long of living with them, their face was as unknowable as ever … Sometimes he thought he saw a man there, looking down from the clifftop … [t]old himself that was a man, a man as dark as the scorched trunk of a stringybark … Finally he had to recognise that it was no human, just another tree … Each time, it was a new emptiness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013485180">Grenville, [2005] 2006b</xref>: 332–333)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We don’t <italic>need</italic> Winnicott to <italic>perceive</italic> the devastating effects of settler violence in the early days of Australian settler-colonialism and today. But what Winnicott’s theory can do, I think, is shed light on the means through which <italic>The Secret River</italic> prompts recognition of the ongoing structural, psychical and historical <italic>presence</italic> of that violence – a necessary precursor of any <italic>real</italic> reconciliatory and reparative impulse. As we’ve seen, others have explained <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s positioning of its readers in terms of complicity or unsettled empathy. But what Winnicott can contribute to these analyses is an account of the dynamics through which that uncomfortable positioning is secured. Winnicott’s contribution to this account rests on his insights regarding the aggression that is empathy’s precursor, prerequisite <italic>and continuing companion</italic>. In <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s final pages, the empathetic positioning of the reader is with a character that has <italic>actually</italic> destroyed the object. But empathetic connection is secured on the basis of – to misquote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013485180">LaCapra’s (2001)</xref> useful and problematic distinction between different types of trauma – a structural rather than historical destructiveness that has occurred in fantasy, rather than in reality. Maybe then, it is here that we have stumbled on the source of <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s capacity to move, or what I’ll call, in Winnicottian terms, its ‘contributing in’. For readerly empathy secured on the basis of ‘structural’ destructiveness then becomes the vehicle – the Trojan Horse, if you like – for an empathetic connection with actual <italic>historical</italic> destruction. But at the same time, the ‘structure’ upon which readerly empathy is first secured can be understood in terms of the psychical <italic>and</italic> the sociopolitical for as we have seen, for Probyn-Rapsey, settler-colonialism is a structure, rather than event.</p>
<p><italic>The Secret River</italic> isn’t history. Its time and its place is contemporary Australia, ‘remembered’ through its evocation of the past: ‘This is us now’, said Grenville, of ‘Thornhill’s Phyrric victory, a silence he doesn’t know how to fill’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1750698013485180">24</xref></sup> ‘Violence’, Grenville argued, ‘has created a no-go area around itself where the past can’t be re-lived or shared with others or even looked at straight on … As I wrote this scene’, Grenville concluded, referring to the passage quoted earlier in which Thornhill surveys the empty landscape, ‘it felt to me that it was the way non-indigenous Australia has been until recently: in that unresolved state between knowing and not-knowing’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698013485180">Grenville, 2006c</xref>). Much of the commentary on <italic>The Secret River</italic>, including Grenville’s, has remarked on the ‘known alreadyness’ of the story (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013485180">Bedell, 2006</xref>): ‘People said they stopped reading because they knew the massacre was about to happen … the fact that they knew revealed to them that they already knew that story, knew what was there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013485180">‘Raising the Dead’, 2012</xref>, my transcription). The dead cannot be raised, but <italic>The Secret River</italic> does more than repeat something already known. Though the novel’s alleged othering of Indigenous Australia has proved deeply controversial, its no less controversial focalization through its convict settler central protagonist Thornhill contributes to the creation of mirror within which to glimpse an emerging ‘place where we live’. This is a process that, apart from encouraging a re-consideration of ‘reflection’ as a critical rather than outmoded concept, might otherwise (and rather loosely) be termed remembering.</p>
<sec id="section4-1750698013485180">
<title>Coda</title>
<p>On my first viewing of the ‘Raising the Dead’ event, Grenville’s chosen reading from her latest book <italic>Sarah Thornhill</italic> appeared incongruous. Had this anodyne passage been selected, I wondered, to avoid any controversial association with the ferocious debates that had flamed up around <italic>The Secret River</italic>? The passage Grenville read describes the first pangs of love, the first feelings of connection or of standing in the other’s shoes felt by William Thornhill’s daughter Sarah for the whaler Jack Langland, son of a convict settler father and an Aboriginal mother:<disp-quote>
<p>We’d walked up that track together a hundred times but I’d never had to think before how you walked beside someone. How much space did you leave between you? Did you touch them as you walked, did your hand brush against theirs as it swung backwards and forwards, and how did you breathe? … But Jack was smiling at the fire, and I was the only one who knew why he wasn’t listening, because my hip was jammed up tight against his and where we touched something was running from his body into mine, from mine into his. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013485180">Grenville, 2011</xref>: 46–47)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Now, when I look again, I wonder how I could have been so blind, for how could any other passage have evoked so well and with such brevity all that animates <italic>The Secret River</italic>, Australia’s politics of reconciliation, the history wars and the strange and violent eruptions around empathic connection that followed in <italic>The Secret River</italic>’s wake? Bringing her reading to a close, Grenville addressed the Elder Hall’s audience directly with the following words: ‘I can only hope that all of you in this room have had that experience’.</p>
