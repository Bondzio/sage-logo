<p>The 3 leading causes of aortic stenosis (AS) in adults are calcific degeneration of a normal trileaflet aortic valve (AV), calcific degeneration of a congenital bicuspid AV, and rheumatic AS. Therapeutic options in patients with severe AS include aortic valve replacement (AVR), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), or aortic valve bypass (AVB). An AVB involves the placement of a valved conduit between the apex of the left ventricle and the descending thoracic aorta. AVB serves as a useful alternative to treat severe AS in patients deemed high risk for conventional AVR (ie, porcelain aorta, previous cardiac surgery) or TAVI (ie, severe aorto-iliac disease, limited experience, lack of hybrid operating room). Advantages of on-pump AVB include the avoidance of aortic cannulation, cross-clamping, and cardioplegic cardiac arrest. The procedure can also be performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. In this article, the authors review the circulatory physiology, perioperative anesthetic management, the role of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, and surgical considerations of AVB surgery through 3 cases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 3 leading causes of aortic stenosis (AS) in adults are calcific degeneration of a normal trileaflet aortic valve (AV), calcific degeneration of a congenital bicuspid AV, and rheumatic AS. The average rate of progression is a decrease in valve area of 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup> per year. Severe symptomatic AS (aortic valve area &lt; 1 cm<sup>2</sup> or aortic valve area index &lt; 0.6 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> or mean gradient &gt; 40 mm Hg or jet velocity &gt; 4 m/s, New York Heart Association functional class ≥ II) is associated with a very poor outcome unless an aortic valve replacement (AVR) is performed. A recent study found a 29% mortality rate at 6 months among medically treated AS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253211434565">1</xref></sup> Conventional AVR carries a finite risk especially in the elderly, high-risk patient population. Renal failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, sternal wound infection, and respiratory failure may occur postoperatively. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an emerging treatment modality, but it is associated with a wide range of vascular and nonvascular complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253211434565">2</xref></sup> Moreover, long-term outcomes of the valves have not yet been investigated.</p>
<p>An aortic valve bypass (AVB) involves the placement of a left ventricle apical aortic conduit that shunts blood from the left ventricle through a stentless bioprosthetic valve and connects into the descending thoracic aorta. AVB is an infrequently performed procedure with approximately 150 cases reported worldwide. It can be performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), thereby avoiding sternotomy, aortic cannulation, ascending aortic cross-clamping, valve debridement, and cardioplegic arrest in high-risk patient populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253211434565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253211434565">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-1089253211434565">
<title>Circulatory Physiology of the AVB</title>
<p>Balaras and colleagues have used computational fluid dynamic modeling to investigate the effects of AVB on cerebral and aortic blood flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253211434565">4</xref></sup> They have also applied computational modeling to characterize the effect of conduit size on the distribution of cardiac output between the conduit and the native aortic valve. The diameter of the conduit has been found to have a relatively small effect on the gradient across the native aortic valve. Doubling the diameter of the conduit (from 10 to 20 mm) has been shown to decrease the mean gradient by only 30%. Blood flow through a 20 mm conduit constitutes 55% of the cardiac output, whereas blood flow through a 10 mm conduit constitutes 40% of the cardiac output, assuming an aortic valve area of 0.65 cm<sup>2</sup>. Computational fluid dynamic modeling has also demonstrated that cerebral blood flow has been provided entirely by the antergrade flow across the stenotic aortic valve and has only been minimally affected by the size of the AVB conduit (20, 16, and 10 mm). Peak systolic instantaneous flow patterns and velocities revealed flow reversal in the descending aorta immediately cephalad to the distal anastomosis of the 20 mm conduit. This finding, in addition to showing competitive flow in the aortic arch, has recently been confirmed by cine magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253211434565">5</xref></sup> While the clinical relevance of flow reversal is not yet fully understood, stagnant flow in the ascending aorta might lead to occlusion of coronary ostia and saphenous venous grafts with subsequent myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253211434565">6</xref></sup> or thrombosis of the aortic arch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253211434565">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Role of Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography</title>
<p>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide crucial information before, during, and after placing an AVB. The preprocedure exam should confirm preoperative echocardiographic findings (aortic valve area and peak and mean pressure gradients) and it should also exclude potential contraindications of the procedure (severe aortic insufficiency, severe mitral regurgitation, heavily diseased descending aorta, and left ventricular thrombus).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253211434565">8</xref></sup> Correct placement of the inflow cannula and laminar flow through the proximal anastomosis can be visualized in the transgastric long-axis view. TEE is also important in choosing the appropriate site for the distal anastomosis (descending aortic long-axis view). The lack of turbulent flow by color flow Doppler at the distal anastomosis is important to exclude anastomotic stenoses. TEE can also provide vital information about the distribution of cardiac output between the native valve and the conduit itself. Quantitative assessment of stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) can be carried out by continuous wave Doppler. The radius of the conduit can be measured ex vivo. The surface area of the conduit multiplied by the conduit velocity time integral (VTI) yields the SV of the AVB. The native aortic valve area multiplied by the VTI of the aortic valve equals the SV going through the aortic valve. Total CO can be calculated by adding the individual stroke volumes and multiplying those by the heart rate.</p>

<title>Perioperative Anesthetic Management</title>
<sec id="section5-1089253211434565">
<title>Preoperative Visit</title>
<p>A thorough preoperative assessment is undertaken to ensure patient optimization prior to surgery. A careful review of past medical, surgical, and anesthetic history is obtained. An extensive assessment of the patient’s cardiovascular status is key to successful completion of this procedure. All available imaging studies must be carefully reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253211434565">9</xref></sup> Cardiac catheterization may reveal coexisting coronary artery disease, the presence of stents, and the location of arterial or saphenous venous grafts in patients with prior open-heart surgery. An elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) may indicate restrictive diastolic dysfunction. Several contraindications to AVB could be excluded by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); moreover, biventricular systolic function and left ventricular diastolic function may also be evaluated. Computed tomography angiograms may delineate aortic atherosclerosis, emphysema, atelectasis, and pericardial or pleural effusions. Preoperative optimization of respiratory function is very important as postoperative pulmonary complications lend to significant morbidity. Risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], older age, body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, poor nutrition, hypercapnea, and cigarette smoking &gt;40 pack/year) should be identified. Antibiotics should be given if infection is suspected; COPD should be optimized by the administration of steroids and bronchodilators. Smoking cessation for at least 8 weeks should be encouraged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1089253211434565">
<title>Intraoperative Management</title>
<p>Patients with severe or critical AS require meticulous attention during anesthetic induction. Their myocardial oxygen demand is increased (being directly proportional to the area of the left ventricular pressure–volume loop), whereas the supply is limited due to a higher LVEDP. This delicate balance can easily be upset by hypotension and tachycardia. On the day of surgery, large bore intravenous access is established, standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors are placed in the operating room (OR), and transcutaneous pacing/defibrillator pads are applied. A right radial arterial line is inserted, and baseline arterial blood gas and activated clotting time (ACT) samples are drawn. A right internal jugular multilumen central line is placed and an oximetric pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is advanced into the superior vena cava (the PA catheter is floated into the PA once the pericardium is opened). Some patients may not tolerate induction without vasoconstrictors and/or inotropes. Phenylephrine and epinephrine infusions may help maintain systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and contractility in this period. A combination of etomidate, fentanyl, and midazolam is used for induction and the trachea is intubated with a left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) after adequate neuromuscular blockade is achieved. In patients with difficult airways an endobronchial blocker (Arndt, Cohen, Fuji Uniblocker) or a Univent Tube may serve as alternatives. Maintenance of anesthesia can be carried out with a combination of any volatile anesthetic, opiod, and benzodiazepine as long as the hemodynamic goals of AS (slow sinus rhythm, maintained contractility, increased preload, and SVR) are met. The stomach is decompressed with an orogastric tube and a TEE probe is inserted into the esophagus. A comprehensive TEE exam is preformed (see above). Nasopharyngeal and bladder temperature probes are inserted to monitor cerebral and core body temperatures. The patient is positioned in a right lateral decubitus position with all pressure points padded appropriately. One-lung ventilation of the right lung is instituted at the time of thoracotomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1089253211434565">
<title>On-Pump AVB</title>
<p>Correct position of the distal tip of the femoral venous cannula is verified by TEE. Heparin is administered (300 U/kg) and an ACT is checked 3 minutes thereafter. Application of the partial occlusion clamp to the descending thoracic aorta increases SVR and may result in either hypertension (to be treated with short-acting vasodilators) or hypotension (to be managed with inotropes). The partial occlusion clamp is released once the proximal anastomosis is complete. Removal of the clamp may result in hypotension that can be treated with volume, vasoconstrictors, and inotropes. CPB is initiated through the side branch of the conduit and the right lung is deflated with cessation of ventilation once full flow is established. Placement of the left ventricular apical myocardial sutures may precipitate ventricular arrhythmias necessitating antiarrhythmics, electrical cardioversion, or defibrillation. Coring out the apical myocardial plug may result in transient ST-segment changes and arrhythmias. After placing and de-airing the apical conduit, flow is established. TEE is crucial at this stage to rule out intraventricular air and for weaning off CPB. Patients with long-standing AS, severe diastolic dysfunction, and low preoperative ejection fraction (EF) may require inotropic support (epinephrine, milrinone, or both), vasoconstrictors (phenylephrine or vasopressin), or inhaled nitric oxide in order to be successfully weaned off CPB. Patients with preserved EF and minimal diastolic dysfunction may be weaned off bypass without any support. A second comprehensive TEE exam is performed to verify forward flow through the conduit, assess volume status, and exclude the presence of myocardial ischemia and/or aortic dissection. Anticoagulation is reversed with protamine and the chest is closed with resumption of 2-lung ventilation. The DLT is changed to a single-lumen tube over a tube exchanger.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1089253211434565">
<title>Off-Pump AVB</title>
<p>This procedure may also be performed without the use of CPB; however, it should be immediately available should the patient develop significant hemodynamic instability. Special consideration to maintenance of normothermia should be pursued, in light of the inability to actively warm the patient without bypass. The OR, the OR table, and all intravenous fluids should be warmed. The requirement for anticoagulation is significantly less during off-pump AVB with a target ACT of 150 to 250 seconds that can be achieved in most patients with 5000 U of heparin at the time of guidewire placement in the femoral vein. Placement and release of the side-biting clamp on the descending aorta, application of the ventricular apical sutures, myocardial coring, and insertion of the apical conduit may be accompanied by the same hemodynamic changes as for on-pump cases. Patients can be extubated at the conclusion of the procedure if all extubation criteria are met.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1089253211434565">
<title>Postoperative Care</title>
<p>The postoperative management of these patients should focus on maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion, while strictly controlling blood pressure to prevent conduit disruption and bleeding. Short-acting antihypertensive agents (nicardipine, esmolol) are titrated to limit stress on the anastomosis, while assuring adequate end organ perfusion. Thromboelastography may help guide component-specific therapy of coagulopathies. Postoperative pain control is of paramount importance in this patient population. A thoracic epidural catheter can be placed before induction (off-pump AVB cases) or after extubation if the patient is not coagulopathic (on-pump AVB). Paravertebral catheters may provide equal or slightly better pain control with better preservation of pulmonary function (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and peak expiratory flow rate) and a lower incidence of side effects (nausea/vomiting, itching, hypotension, respiratory depression) than epidural analgesia. Incentive spirometry should be started to prevent pulmonary complications. A predischarge TTE is performed to quantify the distribution of CO between the conduit and the native aortic valve and to establish postoperative cardiac function. Patients are usually discharged home on aspirin.</p>

<sec id="section10-1089253211434565">
<title>Surgical Considerations</title>
<p>Aortic valve bypass may be a reasonable alternative when conventional AVR is considered to be excessively risky. The procedure can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass or off-pump. For on-pump AVB, femoral venous cannulation is established after a fifth or sixth intercostal space left anterolateral thoracotomy is performed. The pericardium is opened longitudinally anterior to the phrenic nerve and the apex of the heart is exposed. The procedure has 3 primary components: (<italic>a</italic>) construction of an outflow graft (Vascutek Gelweave) containing a (Medtronic Freestyle) stentless bioprosthetic valve, (<italic>b</italic>) anastomosis of the outflow graft to the descending thoracic aorta, and (<italic>c</italic>) implantation of the (Medtronic Hancock) apical connector and anastomosis to the outflow graft.</p>
<p>First, a Dacron side branch graft is measured for length and divided to allow the graft to reach from the descending thoracic aorta to within 5 to 10 cm of the LV apex. Care is taken to divide the graft so that the side branch is as proximal as possible to facilitate insertion and removal of the arterial cannula if the procedure is to be performed on-pump. Once the proper graft length has been established, the stentless bioprosthetic valve is anastomosed to the proximal end of the side branch graft on the back table. Next, a partial occlusion clamp is placed on the descending thoracic aorta, the aorta incised, and the distal graft is sewn to the aorta in an end-to-side fashion. Because the graft has an aortic bioprosthesis on the proximal end, it does not need to be clamped for control. Next, CPB is instituted via left femoral venous drainage and side branch graft cannulation for arterial inflow to the patient. Approximately 12 horizontal mattress, pledgetted sutures are placed circumferentially around the LV apex and through the corresponding locations in the sewing ring of the LV apical connector. An incision is made in the apex and a coring knife is used to remove a cylindrical segment of myocardium. If CPB is used, the apex can be cored while in normal sinus rhythm. Alternatively, rapid ventricular pacing (~300 bpm) or controlled hypotension (systolic blood pressure = 70-80 mm Hg) may be used to reduce blood loss during off-pump implantation. The apical elbow connector is quickly implanted into the apex and the previously placed sutures are tied snugly. The outflow graft of the apical connector is trimmed to length and anastomosed to the proximal end of the stentless bioprosthetic valved conduit. The graft is de-aired prior to completion of this anastomosis. The lungs are reinflated and the patient weaned from CPB.</p>
<sec id="section11-1089253211434565">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 67-year-old male with a history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; ×3), ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement (2005), and renal transplant (2007) was admitted with a 7-month history of increasing dyspnea. Cardiac catheterization revealed 3 widely patent grafts including a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery graft. Transthoracic echocardiography showed progressive stenosis of the 25-mm Carpentier–Edwards bioprosthetic aortic valve (peak and mean gradients = 67 and 31 mm Hg, respectively). To avoid redo sternotomy and to preserve the integrity of the bypass grafts and the ascending aortic graft, we performed an aortic valve bypass.</p>
<p>A 16-mm Hancock ventricular apical connector (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN) was sutured to a stentless 19-mm freestyle aortic root valve and the valve was then sutured to an 18-mm Vascutek graft. Following left posterolateral thoracotomy and single lung ventilation, a partial occluding clamp on the descending aorta facilitated the construction of the distal anastomosis between the Vascutek outflow graft and the descending thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253211434565">Figure 1</xref> and Supplemental Movie I). Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated through a left femoral venous cannula (with the distal tip in the SVC/atrial junction) and the 8-mm side branch of the Vascutek graft. The apical myocardial plug was cored out and the apical connector was quickly inserted and secured in place (Supplemental Movie II). Total CPB time was 61 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253211434565">Figure 2</xref>). Intraoperative Doppler graft flow measurements showed an output of 3.2 L/min through the graft and 1.95 L/min through the stenotic bioprosthetic valve; thus, 62% of the total cardiac output was shunted through the apicoaortic conduit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253211434565">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253211434565">4</xref>). The patient was weaned off CPB without inotropic support. A thoracic epidural catheter was inserted on postoperative day 1 to alleviate postthoracotomy pain. Postoperative course was uneventful, apart from a temporary increase in serum creatinine, and the patient was discharged home 11 days after the operation.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 78-year-old male with significant coronary artery disease (2 previous myocardial infarctions, CABG ×6 in 1998, percutaneous coronary intervention ×2 in 2000), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented with congestive heart failure to an outside hospital. Cardiac catheterization showed a patent left circumflex coronary artery and open saphenous venous grafts to LAD, D1, and PDA. Transthoracic echo revealed critical AS (aortic valve area = 0.7 cm<sup>2</sup>), global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 37%), and restrictive diastolic dysfunction. A redo sternotomy for aortic valve replacement would have required the surgeon to navigate the multiple patent grafts without injury or embolization, reopen the aortic root including possibly redoing proximal anastomoses, and would have incurred too much risk to justify the procedure.</p>
<p>The surgical approach and construction of the apicoaortic conduit were the same as described earlier. However, the venous cannula could not be positioned adequately to obtain full flow on CPB; therefore, the right lung had to be ventilated throughout the procedure. The patient developed severe pulmonary hypertension (PA systolic pressure in the 80s) after the initial attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass. TEE examination of the proximal anastomosis demonstrated a segment of the apical ventricular core retained in the apex. The presence of the ventricular core was clarified with epicardial ultrasound, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253211434565">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253211434565">6</xref> and Supplemental Movies III and IV). After surgical removal of the core, the patient was weaned of cardiopulmonary bypass with heavy pharmacologic support including epinephrine, vasopressin, milrinone, and nitric oxide. He died of multi organ failure on postoperative day 1.</p>

<title>Case 3</title>
<p>A 64-year-old male with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, type 2 diabetes mellitus, COPD, coronary artery disease, prior CABG×5 (1996), and several subsequent PCIs to his saphenous venous grafts (2006, 2008, and 2009) presented with worsening chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, and near syncopal episodes. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area = 0.9 cm<sup>2</sup>) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (50% to 55%). Traditional aortic valve replacement with redo sternotomy versus aortic valve bypass with thoracotomy was discussed with the patient.</p>
<p>A left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed after the induction of general anesthesia and single lung ventilation. The conduit was constructed using a 16-mm Hancock ventricular apical connector (Medtronic Inc), a stentless 19-mm freestyle porcine valve, and an 18-mm Vascutek graft. After systemic heparinization, a left femoral venous cannula was placed and a partial occlusion clamp was placed on the descending thoracic aorta. The distal anastomosis was constructed. CPB was initiated through the left femoral venous cannula and the 8-mm side branch of the Vascutek graft. The apical myocardial plug was removed and the apical connector was inserted and secured in place. Total CPB time was 52 minutes. The patient was weaned off CPB without difficulty on epinephrine and vasopressin infusions. Peak and mean gradients through the conduit were 4 and 2 mm Hg, respectively. The intraoperative course was complicated by severe bronchospasm during chest closure that resolved after appropriate treatment. He was discharged home on postoperative day 11.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aortic stenosis remains the most common acquired degenerative valvular disease in the elderly. Surgical correction of AS is usually achieved by AVR. Medical management of patients with severe AS is associated with dismal prognosis. TAVI is an emerging, less-invasive treatment alternative to AVR. A recent study assessed midterm clinical outcomes in 3 groups of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253211434565">10</xref></sup> At 1 year, 92.3% of AVR patients and 93.1% of TAVI patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (NYHA functional class I or II) compared with 70.8% of patients allocated to the medical treatment (MT) arm. The MT group displayed a significantly higher incidence of major adverse cerebro-cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, major stroke, or death) up to 30 months of follow-up than the AVR or TAVI groups. Despite these promising results, long-term durability of the valves is not yet established and vascular complications involving the ileofemoral vessels or the ascending aorta may occur in 15% to 30% of the cases. Injury to the mitral valve apparatus, incorrect positioning, and deployment have also been reported. Paravalvular leaks, coronary artery obstruction, and complete heart block may cause significant hemodynamic compromise as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253211434565">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to AVR, TAVI, and MT, there is another alternative to treat AS. An AVB involves the placement of a left ventricle apical aortic conduit that shunts blood from the left ventricle through a stentless bioprosthetic valve and connects into the descending thoracic aorta. The principle of an apicoaortic conduit was first conceived by Carrell in 1910.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253211434565">11</xref></sup> The first human AVB was reported by Cooley and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253211434565">12</xref></sup> The procedure can be performed with CPB or off-pump and it offers several benefits for high-risk patients: sternotomy, aortic cannulation, aortic cross-clamping, valve debridement, and cardioplegic arrest can be avoided. Certain parts of the operation, namely, creating the distal anastomosis, can be carried out using robotic telemanipulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253211434565">13</xref></sup> A recent retrospective study of 47 octogenarians found that native valve AS progression has stopped after AVB, and in accordance with computational modeling, approximately two thirds of the cardiac output was directed through the apicoaortic conduit. Mean aortic valve gradient was found to decline by almost 70% and mean total stroke volume increased by 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253211434565">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>AVB yields acceptable midterm survival results in high-risk patient cohorts. Perioperative mortality was 13% and median postoperative survival was 29 months in 31 patients undergoing on-pump and off-pump AVB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253211434565">3</xref></sup> In a retrospective review of 21 off-pump patients, in-hospital mortality was 14% and two thirds of the patients were alive at 16 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253211434565">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Successful perioperative management is a challenging task for the anesthesiologist. A thorough preoperative assessment, cardiopulmonary optimization, and a review of all available cardiac imaging studies is a key to success. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia can be carried out with a combination of any volatile anesthetic, opiod, and benzodiazepine as long as the hemodynamic goals of AS (slow sinus rhythm, maintained contractility, increased preload, and SVR) are met.</p>
<p>TEE plays a pivotal role in the perioperative management of AVB patients. Apart from confirming the findings of the preoperative exam, it is also beneficial to exclude any potential contraindications of AVB. TEE helps choose the appropriate site for the distal anastomosis on the descending aorta and can verify correct placement of the inflow cannula. The distribution of cardiac output and stroke volume between the native valve and the conduit itself can be quantitatively assessed by continuous wave Doppler.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when surgical AVR or TAVI are not feasible, AVB provides a safe and reliable alternative in high-risk patient populations.</p>
