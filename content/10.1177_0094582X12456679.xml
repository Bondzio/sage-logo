<abstract>
<p>The social mobilization against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in Costa Rica between 2002 and 2007 was the strongest of any nation associated with the treaty. The popular opposition was able to delay for years and nearly stop its ratification. It did so by amassing support from the public at large and, in preparation for a national referendum, adopting a strategy of complete decentralization and horizontal, voluntary work at the grassroots level. This strategy ultimately led to a loss of the battle against the agreement, but it avoided costly clashes over leadership and forced the Costa Rican government to become more open and transparent vis-à-vis the popular organizations and the public.</p>
<p>La movilización social costarricense contra el CAFTA entre 2002 y 2007 fue la más contundente en cualquier país asociado al tratado. La oposición popular logró detener el proyecto por varios años y casi evita su ratificación. Su éxito se basó en el apoyo general del público y, en preparación para un referendo nacional, la adopción de una estrategia descentralizada y horizontal fundamentada en el voluntariado de grupos de base. Esta estrategia finalmente resultó en la pérdida de la batalla contra el tratado, pero evitó costosas desavenencias en torno al liderazgo y obligó al gobierno costarricense a abrirse y dar cuentas más transparentes a las organizaciones populares y el público en general.</p>

<p>Every country that became a signatory of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12456679">1</xref></sup> in 2004–2005—Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United States—experienced a measure of social and political activity against ratification of the treaty. Yet the only two nations in which confirmation was ever seriously in doubt were Costa Rica and the United States, seemingly the most unlikely ones given the consistent stance in favor of free trade by their leaders and the highly institutionalized quality of their democratic political systems. In the United States, opposition was mainly political and institutional, the result of a shift on the issue of free trade on the part of several leading Democratic figures and of localized pressures in former manufacturing-heavy areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12456679">2</xref></sup> In Costa Rica it was both political and social, institutional and extrainstitutional. Indeed, its development represents one of the most distinctive national mobilizations against free trade in Latin America in recent years. This paper presents a thorough account of the origins, development, and main characteristics of the Costa Rican popular movement against CAFTA. Its goals are to document a critical juncture in contemporary Costa Rican politics and to examine in depth the choices that led to the successes and failures of the movement.</p>
<p>CAFTA was ratified by the Costa Rican Legislative Assembly following a binding referendum on October 7, 2007. That ratification was ever in doubt, however, and that the referendum took place at all when the treaty enjoyed the support of two successive presidents and their cabinets, a sufficient majority of legislators, strong financial capital, the country’s major media conglomerates, and the United States, is testimony to the effectiveness of the opposition through five years of intense struggle. So is the result of the vote itself, with a margin of victory of roughly 52 percent to 48 percent for the pro-CAFTA camp. The unexpectedly strong challenge posed by the opposition received repeated mention in the international media, which normally contented itself with ignoring this small Central American nation (e.g., <italic>New York Times</italic>, October 8, 2007).</p>
<p>The dynamics of the opposition to CAFTA in Costa Rica can be neatly divided into two stages. Between November 2002 and February 2007 there was a continuing effort to pressure policy makers to remove CAFTA from their agenda characterized by large popular demonstrations and a series of maneuvers by opposition legislators intended to delay or block the law from being put to a vote. Despite significant success, particularly in 2004–2005, the varied organizations and individuals who stood in opposition to CAFTA were unable to create a unified coalition and were often beset by internal divisions and competition for leadership among leading figures. After the election of Oscar Arias to the presidency in early 2006 it became apparent that the impact, though not the size, of the mass mobilizations was decreasing, but the prospect of political deadlock and, worse, civil unrest loomed on the horizon. Through a fortuitous series of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12456679">Frajman, 2008b</xref>), the referendum option suddenly became viable and was welcomed by most interested parties.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12456679">Mercedes Alvarez (2011)</xref> characterizes the campaign against CAFTA as a “new social movement” because of its diverse composition, the multiplicity of points of view it represented, and the high levels of middle-class and youth participation. She notes also its decentralized and participatory nature. Yet this last characteristic, also identified by other Costa Rican scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12456679">Salas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X12456679">Sánchez, Zúñiga, and Cambronero, 2010</xref>), raises important issues. Alvarez is most concerned with the failure of the organized opposition to CAFTA to create “a vision and a proposal for the future that went beyond the defensive character of collective action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12456679">2011</xref>: 225). This common complaint of social movement activists, however, overlooks the fact that the movement had explicitly rejected unification.</p>
<p>The referendum option transformed the debate over CAFTA into an electoral campaign. For opponents of the treaty the need to act together became more pressing as the vote (and the need to campaign for the NO side) was increasingly perceived as an all-or-nothing end game. Yet the various groups that had positioned themselves in the opposition adopted a singular strategy: rather than solidify their organizational ties to maximize their resources for the task of winning on October 7, they delegated virtually all activities—demonstrations, campaigning, recruitment—to hundreds of grassroots, neighborhood-based “patriotic committees” (<italic>comités patrióticos</italic>). Each committee saw itself as an independent entity that functioned solely according to the decisions made by its members (at most a few dozen and in some cases four or five) and was encouraged to do so by the dominant social organizations and political parties opposed to CAFTA. The heart of the NO campaign was the independence of the patriotic committees. This strategy of complete decentralization in collective action and decision making appears self-defeating, and, indeed, electoral defeat led to a rapid dissolution of mobilized opposition to ratification. Yet it was the result of a well-thought-out analysis of current conditions in the country and, though ultimately unsuccessful, probably the best choice available to the national social movement.</p>
<p>A thorough examination of the recent history of social mobilization in Costa Rica is crucial for understanding the choices made by movement leaders. The first section of this article traces the creation of strong informal ties among Costa Rican opposition activists following massive nationwide protests in 2000. The next presents the framing of the anti-CAFTA movement’s positions and aims expressed in the public declarations of its leading figures and organizations. Presenting the struggle as one between the citizenry and the government, they unwittingly precluded the option of one social movement’s taking the leading role. The following section documents how, despite a common understanding of the struggle at hand, the power of their opponents, and the crucial importance ascribed to CAFTA by the movement and despite the very real successes in delaying ratification of the treaty, the various attempts at creating an anti-CAFTA coalition failed. The concluding section argues that, despite the ultimate defeat and dissolution of the movement, its strategy was appropriate and had positive effects on Costa Rican political life.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12456679">
<title>The Birth of the National Social Movement</title>
<p>During the 1980s and 1990s Costa Rica saw significant social mobilization on the part of organizations, particularly labor unions, demanding that the state slow or abandon the neoliberal structural reforms begun in 1982. These actions were often successful even though cooperation among organizations was rare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X12456679">3</xref></sup> During this period Costa Rican policy makers engaged in dialogue with civil society in implementing changes in social and economic policy, addressing social mobilizations by showing interest in and responsiveness to their claims. Yet the response was a marked decline in trust of government officials, the result of a number of corruption cases involving leading political figures and a general perception of economic decline for the middle and lower classes. The major political parties—the Partido Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Party—PLN) and the Partido Unidad Social Cristiana (Social Christian Union Party—PUSC)—were seen by many to enjoy the benefits of an established elite pact and had been unable to produce the charismatic leading figures that had attracted citizen allegiance in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X12456679">Rodríguez and Castro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12456679">Seligson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The growing social opposition to structural reform and the declining support for the two-party status quo were crucial factors in the unexpected outbreak of massive protests in early 2000 opposing the elimination of the monopoly on electricity and telecommunications held by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (Costa Rican Electricity Institute—ICE), known as the Combo protests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X12456679">4</xref></sup> The opposition was composed primarily of labor unions, particularly from the public sector, student groups from state universities and public high schools, and left-wing intellectuals, but eventually contributed to the rise of alternative, left-leaning political parties and also attracted many apolitical individuals. Propelled by their distrust of political leaders, the belief that the Combo initiative itself was the product of shady, under-the-table deals, and the affection felt by the populace for the ICE as a symbol of an expansive welfare state that had brought prosperity, peace, and stability to the country, Costa Ricans took to the streets in unprecedented numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12456679">CME-ICE, 2001</xref>). The protests came to be framed by leaders and rank-and-file activists alike as a citizenry defending its national patrimony against political and economic elites intent on selling it off to foreign corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12456679">Frajman, 2008a</xref>). The opposition movement to the Combo positioned itself as “the people versus the leaders” and took the large numbers of demonstrators as incontrovertible proof that the Combo was unwanted. By mid-April President Miguel Angel Rodríguez of the PUSC took the initiative off the table and publicly recognized the need for the government to pay heed to “the voice of the people” (<italic>La Nación</italic>, December 1, 2000). This victory greatly increased the opportunities for collective action in the future.</p>
<p>The Combo protests revealed that a large-enough show of popular opposition could force the government to retreat. The dominant democratic political culture of Costa Rica made it unlikely that political leaders would take steps that were opposed by a majority of the population. The strategy of the opposition to CAFTA from its beginnings in 2002 until the vote on October 7, 2007, would be based on this idea: in order to defeat the imposition of CAFTA in the country, it had to be unambiguously established that most citizens did not want it. This could presumably be done, as the 2000 demonstrations had shown, with sufficient participation in public demonstrations. The framing of the opposition to the Combo would be reworked to fit the actions against CAFTA: that the nation’s democratically elected leaders did not in fact represent the opinions, values, and interests of the majority and therefore lacked the legitimacy to enter into an international agreement that would shape the future of the country.</p>
<p>The Combo protests paved the way for a strengthening of the social network of movements and organizations ideologically opposed to the neoliberal policies underlying both the Combo and CAFTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12456679">Garita, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456679">Franceschi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12456679">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12456679">Mora, 2004</xref>). The effectiveness of cellular phones and electronic communication in organizing joint actions across groups and in attracting unaffiliated individuals to participate in collective action was evident. Dozens of web sites, chat rooms, and blogs detailing the battle against the Combo and looking to create strategies for the future came into being in the following months. Cooperation in protest actions increased as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12456679">Franceschi, Raventós, and Zamora, 2003</xref>), as labor unions commonly at odds came to see the benefits of joining forces for specific goals.</p>
<p>But more than this, out of the Combo emerged the idea of a “national popular movement” that, while disorganized, became the de-facto protagonist (at least in the eyes of its participants) in the struggle over CAFTA that would follow. Most political parties, unions, and social organizations made their views and plans of action public online, and this is where much communication between formerly isolated activists came to take place. When President Abel Pacheco of the PUSC (2002–2006) entered into negotiations with the United States and the rest of the Central American nations that would eventually lead to CAFTA, most participants in the Combo protests were ready and eager to act, and they knew precisely where to find each other.</p>

<title>The Framing of the Struggle</title>
<p>In early 2002, the administration of President George W. Bush in the United States abandoned attempts to forge a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in favor of regional deals with specific partners. Central America was at the top of the agenda. Official preliminary contacts between the United States and Costa Rica began in October of that year, and a number of organizations immediately made their opposition known. The Asociación Nacional de Empleados Públicos y Privados (National Association of Public and Private Workers—ANEP), a large public-sector union that was at the forefront of the Combo protests, was one of the first: “The neoliberal sectors in our country have launched their new privatizing offensive,” it announced, calling for an immediate mobilization of rejection against a treaty that had not even begun to be negotiated (<italic>Diario Extra</italic>, November 6, 2002). Given the shared experience of the popular response to the Combo initiative, it proved quite easy for the intellectual leaders of the opposition to articulate the basic view of CAFTA that would predominate, virtually unchanged, until 2007 and beyond. José Merino, a vocal political figure of the left put it thus (<italic>Semanario Universidad</italic>, December 6, 2002):
<disp-quote>
<p>The country is being brought into compromises that are not resultant of internal democratic debate, in which the Assembly has no say, and that are under the control of a group of technocrats who have long advocated the deregulation and privatization of our economy. The hour to resist is coming! The Bush administration sees CAFTA and the FTAA as a war of conquest of national markets designed to impose a stronger hegemony in the region. There is nothing positive in this framework for Latin American nations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This declaration includes all the major points that came to dominate the discourse of the opposition: that the market deregulation and privatization that were central to CAFTA were negative for Costa Rica and its neighbors because they represented a surrender of national resources to the United States and its allies, the dominant classes within the country. The complaint (as during the Combo protests) was knowingly couched in nationalist rather than class rhetoric, since Merino and his allies correctly believed this attitude to be more palatable to the general population. Calls for revolt or revolution or against existing liberal democratic institutions were virtually nonexistent. An early event that aimed to bring together as many groups from the “social sectors” as possible expressed itself in almost identical language: “The national interests, a function of the desire for a developed society that provides economic and social welfare to all its people, demand that all possible steps be taken to confront the challenge posed by this treaty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12456679">ANEP et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>For the early participants in the movements, the heterogeneity and ideological variety of opponents of CAFTA were a given. Therefore, there was never an attempt by the movement as a whole to frame the struggle in terms of a larger ideological worldview. This allowed the unions to work with feminists and environmentalists who had strongly criticized them in the past as well as with the centrist opposition Partido Acción Ciudadana (Citizen Action Party—PAC). As Eugenio Trejos, an academic and leading figure of the movement, put it in his speech announcing the launch of the NO campaign, on June 23, 2007: “Thank God we have CAFTA to unify us, to allow all of us—the different sectors, groups, political parties, civil society organizations—to sit at the same table and realize we have a common denominator: love for Costa Rica, the desire to defend the national patrimony, and that we all are willing to play our part.” Again, the key was not the political position of any group but protecting the motherland, implicitly placing supporters of CAFTA as “sellouts.” Through more than four years, the opposition’s rhetoric changed little. Over time, as the particulars of the treaty came to light, opposition intellectuals and leading figures expressed specific ways in which the treaty would be harmful to Costa Rica and to the majority of its citizens: on issues including the privatization of state assets, intellectual property rights, sovereignty (particularly in respect to national waters), the future of the nation’s health, pension, and insurance systems, and so on. But the movement remained remarkably consistent in its main goals and their articulation. Nevertheless, every attempt at forming an anti-CAFTA coalition failed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0094582X12456679">
<title>The Growth and Dynamics of the Anti-Cafta Movement</title>
<p>Within weeks of the first declarations opposing CAFTA in late 2002, a significant group of unions, environmental organizations, women’s groups, and student federations, all of whom were protagonists of the 2000 protests, called for “the people”’ to take to the streets, but the resulting mobilizations in November and December amounted to a few hundred individuals at most. The ensuing disappointment was expressed by a participant in Pro-ICE, an Internet message board: “Unfortunately few of us attended the march, in part—as I learned during the event—because coordination with the unions became difficult and because Costa Ricans always like to leave things to the last minute, as happened with the Combo.” This became the standard explanation for the scant support that opposition organizations received from the general public in 2002 and 2003: the opposition was too decentralized, coordination was nonexistent, and therefore it was difficult to awaken an apathetic public.</p>
<p>The Pacheco government, cognizant of the charges of secrecy that surrounded the Combo, sought to preempt criticism. The Ministry of Foreign Trade announced that it would open up communication lines with civil society so that all views on CAFTA could be heard and taken into account. Most opposition organizations took advantage of the opportunity, but by January of 2003 they were accusing the Ministry of ignoring their objections and once again calling for an outright rejection of CAFTA. Had the CAFTA negotiations and subsequent ratification taken place promptly and efficiently, it is possible that the opposition would not have been able to pose a real threat to ratification. It was backed by the president and his cabinet and was known to be supported by enough legislators to insure ratification if put to a vote as well as by the majority of citizens who expressed interest in such matters in public opinion surveys. But the American involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq turned the Bush administration’s attention away from free-trade deals, and as a result negotiations ground to a halt.</p>
<p>In May 2003, ICE workers declared a general strike demanding increased government funding. In an unprecedented move, most public-sector unions—the largest of which were the ANEP, the Asociación de Profesores de Segunda Enseñanza (Association of Secondary Education Professors—APSE), and the Asociación Nacional de Educadores (National Association of Educators—ANDE)—and many nonunion groups such as the environmentalist Federación para la Conservación del Ambiente (Federation for the Conservation of the Environment—FECON) joined the strike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12456679">ANEP, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12456679">CNC, 2003</xref>), exerting enough pressure with threats of mass “civil disobedience” that the government ceded to the workers’ demands. Astrid Fischel, Pacheco’s minister of education, resigned her post lamenting the presence of “some individuals and sectors intent on causing chaos . . . and an environment of tension and instability” (<italic>La Nación</italic>, June 3, 2003). By the time CAFTA returned to the center of public debate some months later, a precedent had been set. Public mobilization could effect a reaction from the government, and Pacheco was seen as weak within his own administration. The ANEP, for its part, exulted in the “unprecedented alliance forged during the strike” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12456679">ANEP, 2003b</xref>), though opinion polls showed a clear majority of the citizenry claiming to support CAFTA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X12456679">5</xref></sup> and street demonstrations late in that year still attracted relatively few. Lack of leadership and coordination were widely blamed, and, under the auspices of former President Carazo, a number of opposition figures produced the first significant attempt at a real coalition, the Comisión Nacional de Enlace (National Linkage Commission—CNE).</p>
<p>Despite an increase in the number of public demonstrations against CAFTA on the part of several organizations new to the opposition—including the most significant opposition political party, the PAC—and despite the fact that other nations accused Costa Rica of “dragging its feet” at the negotiating table (<italic>La Nación</italic>, December 16, 2003) (a clear sign that Pacheco was wavering on his support of the negotiating team),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094582X12456679">6</xref></sup> Costa Rica became a signatory to CAFTA in January 2004. The CNE, which counted the largest labor unions as members, publicly called for mobilizations against ratifying the treaty. On May 1 and May 31 of that year the first significant demonstrations against CAFTA took place, convened by the CNE and widely supported by opposition organizations. <italic>La Nación</italic>, Costa Rica’s most important newspaper and a strong backer of CAFTA, as well as the major television stations in the country, concentrated on union participation in the marches and were widely criticized by opponents of CAFTA for underrepresenting the number of participants (<italic>La Nación</italic>, May 2, 2004).</p>
<p>Later that year, a general strike by public-transportation unions decrying a monopoly on vehicle inspections by a Spanish firm sparked protests and roadblocks that rivaled those of the Combo 2000 protests in size and intensity. Almost simultaneously, corruption charges against three former presidents rocked the country, leaving a general public feeling betrayed and powerless. New coalition organizations—the Movimiento Cívico Nacional (National Civic Movement—MCN) and the teachers’ unions’ umbrella organization the Coordinadora de Unidad Sindical, Magisterial y Comunal (Coordinator of Magisterial, Union, and Communal Unity—CUSIMA)—gained significant attention during the transportation strike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12456679">MCN, 2004</xref>). A number of opposition leaders expressed the hope that the MCN would become the axis for the opposition movement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Informa-tico.com">Informa-tico.com</ext-link>, September 6, 2004) but later admitted that the “isolation of the unions” would remain virtually unchanged (José Antonio Barquero, interview, July 23, 2007). When the dust settled, the Pacheco government had lost all credibility, fears of serious social unrest were rampant, and CAFTA supporters were accusing protesters of disrespecting democratic norms of behavior by engaging in roadblocks and clashes with police. Several members of the cabinet had resigned over the president’s apparent unwillingness to stand up to protesters. Against the advice of CAFTA supporters, Pacheco continued to resist sending the treaty to be voted on by the Legislative Assembly, claiming that fiscal reform should be the national priority. This prompted more resignations, including that of the trade minister Alberto Trejos.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the successes of the aforementioned Combo protests in 2000 and the 2004 protests were the result of disruptive actions, particularly roadblocks, virtually all of the large public demonstrations were peaceful and orderly. Costa Ricans, even those sympathetic with the opposition, seemed not to welcome calls for civil disobedience and street battles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0094582X12456679">7</xref></sup> In 2005 and 2006 this became accepted as a truism by the opposition, and the debate between the government and the social movement often revolved around who was more or less respectful of “democratic institutionality.” Because the national movement’s fundamental aim was to attract as many adherents as possible, disruptive actions were rejected as counterproductive despite the fact that certain important groups, particularly the most combative of the ICE unions, the Frente Interno de Trabajadores del ICE (Internal Front of ICE Workers—FIT-ICE) and the CNE, frequently made ambiguous pronouncements promising peaceful demonstrations but warning that the opposition would do “everything necessary” to stop ratification (<italic>La Nación</italic>, September 11, 2006).</p>
<p>Among the opposition, the mood was one of elation over a new victory against the government and its supporters, though activists still saw as crucial the creation of a unified national organization to coordinate further actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12456679">Grau, 2004</xref>). In fact, tensions between the CNE and the MCN became apparent almost immediately. Pacheco and several editorialists at <italic>La Nación</italic> inflamed these when they accused the MCN of having attempted a coup d’état during the protests. The MCN leadership (never clearly defined to the general public) proved to be difficult and combative even with its presumed allies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0094582X12456679">8</xref></sup> On November 5, 2004, a march convened by the MCN was attended by few others, and the organization grudgingly merged with the CNE soon after (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12456679">MCN and CNE, 2005</xref>). On April 14, 2005, the umbrella organizations CNE, MCN, and CUSIMA convened a national meeting of social groups, but the “national summit” produced a serious misstep when in its public declaration it affirmed that it would not accept the results of the upcoming presidential election (because the expected winner was former President Oscar Arias of the PLN, an ardent supporter of CAFTA) and, somewhat ambiguously, called for popular revolt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12456679">CNE, 2005</xref>). <italic>La Nación</italic> and government officials immediately pounced on the declaration, driving the new coalition into retreat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12456679">Arroyo, 2007</xref>; <italic>La Nación</italic>, April 24, 2005). Most major labor unions and social groups severed official ties with the CNE soon afterward.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0094582X12456679">9</xref></sup> The possibility of a referendum over CAFTA, initially raised by the former PLN figure José Miguel Corrales—who attempted to launch yet another coalitional entity, the Movimiento Nacional de Convergencia Patriótica (National Movement of Patriotic Convergence; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12456679">MCPN, 2007</xref>) with little response from the rest of the movement—and echoed by a number of PAC officials in the first months of 2005, exacerbated divisions within the opposition. The FIT-ICE was particularly strong in its rejection of the referendum as anything but “a tool of the dominant classes to quell popular revolt” (<italic>Semanario Universidad</italic>, April 7, 2005). When it became clear that the idea of the referendum enjoyed broad citizen support, the FIT-ICE retracted its rejection, but much damage had been done (<italic>El Nuevo Herald</italic>, July 24, 2005).</p>
<p>Late in 2005 a new organization emerged out of the CNE, the Coordinadora Nacional de Lucha contra el TLC (National Coordinator of the Struggle against CAFTA—CNL), which would officially convene most public events protesting the treaty thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12456679">APSE, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0094582X12456679">10</xref></sup> In most media reports, the positions of the CNE and CNL were expressed by the activists Jorge Coronado and Ricardo Segura, though they were never identified as the leaders of the organizations. Along with the ANEP leader Albino Vargas and the FIT-ICE head Fabio Chávez, the two are usually named in relation to the failure to pull together a national movement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12456679">Arroyo, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0094582X12456679">11</xref></sup> The labor leaders were constantly criticized both by the pro-CAFTA camp in the media and by left-wing organizations for caring primarily about their own organizations and their personal positions of leadership. Whatever the truth of these assertions, virtually all of the individuals interviewed for this study agreed that most Costa Ricans had never heard of the CNE and the CNL and assumed that the anti-CAFTA camp belonged mainly to “the unions and the universities.”</p>
<p>Despite this internal turmoil, the opposition had much to celebrate. Public opinion seemed to be moving strongly toward rejection of CAFTA. A UNIMER poll from March 2004 showed 64 percent of interviewees supporting CAFTA versus 18 percent opposed (<italic>La Nación</italic>, March 17, 2004). A similar poll just over a year later showed supporters outnumbering opponents by just 49 percent to 46 percent (<italic>La Nación</italic>, May 6, 2005). Public marches were ever larger, a sign that internal unity or lack thereof within the movement had little to do with socialization and recruitment of new participants. Pacheco virtually insured that his successor would be the one to send CAFTA to legislators when he announced that he would convene a “commission of notables” to analyze and advise him on the treaty.</p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, former President Arias encountered stiff opposition in the 2006 presidential election. Ottón Solís, the PAC candidate, received virtually as many votes as Arias in an election that had revolved around whether CAFTA was good for Costa Rica. It is widely accepted among Costa Rican scholars that Solís’s unexpectedly strong showing was the result of public distrust of the established party structure and his opposition to free trade (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12456679">PENDHS, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X12456679">Vargas, 2007</xref>). For a time, it seemed to open the door to his becoming the leader of a unified opposition, but this did not happen. Solís opposed CAFTA but remained an advocate of free trade. He was perceived by the social organizations as being too similar to those already in power to be trusted and out of line with the movement’s ideology (i.e., too far to the right).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0094582X12456679">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arias, for his part, showed from the start that he would not be pushed around as Pacheco was. Although demonstrations against CAFTA became progressively larger throughout 2006, culminating in what some have called the largest march in the nation’s history on February 26, 2007, the president lost no time in debating with protesters. He correctly anticipated that, despite their size, the public actions would be peaceful and raised virtually no obstacles to massive marches, instead publicly extolling their democratic principles. The only demonstration during his tenure in which police repression was reported took place on August 16, 2006. Subsequent and much larger marches occurred with nary an incident of violence. His chief of police adopted a policy of placing unarmed and female police officers precisely in the areas in which the largest concentrations of protesters were expected. Since the PLN, the PUSC, and the smaller pro-CAFTA parties had enough votes to ratify the treaty once it was finally voted on, the opposition, enjoying its largest numbers, appeared suddenly to have become a spectator in the “chronicle of a treaty foretold.”</p>
<p>Fortunately for CAFTA opponents, José Merino’s Partido Frente Amplio (Broad Front Party—PFA), created specifically for the 2006 election, won one legislative seat, occupied by Merino himself. Along with several PAC legislators, Merino spent the second half of 2006 keeping the treaty from coming to a vote. When 2007 came along without a vote on CAFTA, the country’s electoral tribunal accepted Corrales’s request for a referendum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12456679">Frajman, 2008b</xref>). Rather than give ammunition to his opponents, who regularly referred to him as a tyrant, Arias acquiesced, still confident of victory.</p>
<p>In sum, the social movement in opposition to CAFTA experienced significant growth from its beginning in late 2002 and could boast of significant successes. At the same time, internal divisions and the insistence of certain organizations and leaders on acting without first seeking consensus made the creation of a coalition impossible. The question that many opposition figures asked themselves was whether this was a problem. Could a coalition have accomplished anything more? As has been pointed out, the inability to establish a unified coalition did not seem to hinder the movement’s capacity to attract increasing numbers of individuals to public demonstrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0094582X12456679">13</xref></sup> If anything, the largest marches, in October 2006 and February 2007, were characterized by lack of leadership or any unique message beyond the rejection of CAFTA. The idea that diversity was strengthening the movement was becoming entrenched. The last significant entity created as an attempt to coordinate actions against CAFTA reflected this change. The Frente Nacional de Apoyo a la Lucha contra el TLC (National Front for the Support of the Struggle against CAFTA—FNA) was, as its name suggests, designed to support and not lead the movement. Its leader, Eugenio Trejos, the chancellor of one of Costa Rica’s largest public universities, became the spokesman for the movement during the referendum campaign precisely because he had no ties to any other organization, no past behavior to justify, and no apparent political aspirations. Despite the lack of centralization, by April of 2007 Corrales could claim that “for the first time in history all the social sectors are unified, united behind the citizen referendum” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Informatico.com">Informatico.com</ext-link>, April 23, 2007).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0094582X12456679">
<title>The Referendum and the Patriotic Committees</title>
<p>Corrales’s claim proved correct, but it would take time for this to become clear. While the PAC, FNA, ANEP, and APSE immediately embraced the referendum, a number of organizations publicly rejected the idea, claiming that it was a sign of desperation on the part of the dominant classes, who could see no way to avoid a “confrontation in the streets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12456679">CNL, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12456679">FIT-ICE, 2007</xref>). As late as May 2007, Trejos was calling for an end to distrust among opposition organizations, while Jorge Arguedas of the FIT-ICE, originally opposed to the referendum, was one of the first to take what was to become the default position: “Each one of us should work with his own group. We have different ways of dealing with things, but deep down we’re all trying to do the same thing” (<italic>La Nación</italic>, May 17, 2007). Ultimately, once again, it was the understanding of popular opinion that pointed the way. Once it was clear that Costa Ricans were for a referendum, virtually all participants in the social movement began to campaign for the NO vote, regardless of their views of the legality or advisability of participating in the vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12456679">OS-ICE, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The next step was to choose a campaign strategy, but to do so would inevitably bring new leadership claims from various actors, now including Trejos and the FNA. Instead, the strategy developed organically. Given the recognition that the opposition had no material resources at its disposal to pay for advertising in the media, placards, or even T-shirts and bumper stickers, a number of organizations began to advise their members to act locally and independently. Ironically, Carlos Denton, the head of Cid-Gallup in Costa Rica and a supporter of CAFTA, was one of the first to hit on the answer. In a newspaper interview he suggested that the opposition was not at a disadvantage at all, since “publicity campaigns are not as good at promoting ideas as conversations between friends, family, and workmates” (<italic>La República</italic>, May 2, 2007).</p>
<p>Between mid-April and mid-May, dozens of local “fronts,” “coordinators,” “assemblies,” and “patriotic committees” appeared across the country. On May 22 the FNA and the CNL jointly announced that more than 100 committees were already in existence: “The committees work with the community, and form workgroups to divulge information as widely as possible. One of the first actions was a visit of the committee in the township of Desamparados to an agricultural fair to converse with people about CAFTA. Eugenio Trejos affirmed that each committee was responsible to attract more members” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.radioeco.com">http://www.radioeco.com</ext-link>, May 22, 2007). The unions and the PAC quickly followed suit. Union members were encouraged to participate in their local committees rather than reinforce the union groups already present across the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0094582X12456679">14</xref></sup> When a group tried to take initiative away from the committees, as the FIT-ICE (then led by Jorge Arguedas) tried to do when it announced on May 24 that its members would take to the streets if the YES won the referendum, it was publicly pressured to recant and invariably did so. Web sites reported the meeting times of committees and pointed interested individuals to their local entities. Leadership of the movement was not an issue discussed in the months before the referendum, though it is clear that Solís and Merino, the main political figures, and the union heads took a back seat and let Trejos be the face of the campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0094582X12456679">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The committees themselves functioned as neighborhood meetings among friends.</p> <p>“I have lived next door to many of these people all my life,” a member of the Curridabat committee told me, “and not until now have I seen that we have so much in common.” Most of the committees had contacts with the CNL, the FNA, the PAC, and the PFA, but these entities mainly provided informational resources for the committees to use as they chose. The primary strategy of these groups was to reach, face-to-face, as many Costa Ricans as possible. Subcommittees were created so that the <italic>compañeros</italic> could organize their visits to public health centers, agricultural fairs, and private residences, door-to-door. Ottón Solís and the leadership of the PAC announced a plan to visit 600,000 homes in the months preceding the referendum. When some activists questioned whether this meant that the PAC was seeking to control the movement, Solís was quick to clarify that he and his legislators would do the legwork, and so they did (Ottón Solís, interview, July 18, 2007).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0094582X12456679">16</xref></sup> Funds were scarce, and the sight of committee members selling homemade food at meetings and assemblies was common.</p>
<p>There were virtually no mass mobilizations on the part of the NO campaign in the months prior to the referendum. Occasionally, individual groups held protests. The most notable of these was conducted on July 5 by an organization called Mujeres de Blanco (Women in White), whose members marched to the building of the Constitutional Court (which had announced CAFTA to be constitutionally acceptable) and pelted magistrates with coins. Most opposition groups publicly expressed support for the action, but there was no significant street march protesting the ruling. Most leaders and activists argued that the effort to bring people to the polls should not be derailed. The CNE, as usual, made the strongest statement of repudiation of the court—“the Court does not deserve our respect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12456679">CNE, 2007</xref>)—and this was taken by the pro-CAFTA camp as another opportunity to charge opponents with not respecting democratic institutions. The subsequent backlash against the CNE from within the anti-CAFTA camp was predictably swift (<italic>La Nación</italic>, July 7, 2007).</p>
<p>The Arias government and the pro-CAFTA camp’s strategy focused mostly on media outlets. Full-page ads extolling CAFTA were present in almost every edition of the major daily newspapers in Costa Rica, as were large signs and paid ads on television. The YES camp also seemed to hold the lead, according to a number of opinion polls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0094582X12456679">17</xref></sup> At the same time, there was a sense that the Arias government and its allies were feeling pressure. A memorandum signed by the high-ranking government officials Kevin Casas and Fernando Sánchez was unearthed that argued that the YES campaign was lacking in direction and that the government should not be in charge because it enjoyed little legitimacy. It pointed to the success of the opposition in framing the struggle as “the people against the government” and recommended that “fear become a central element of the YES campaign” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12456679">ANEP, 2007</xref>). The “Memorandum of Fear” became a fixture of opposition speeches thereafter. On October 3, just days before the referendum, <italic>La Nación</italic> published a surprising poll in which the NO led the YES by a whopping 55 percent to 43 percent (<italic>La Nación</italic>, October 3, 2007).</p>
<p>Yet the NO camp was ultimately unable to bring enough people to the polls. Despite the intensity of the campaigns and the ubiquity of CAFTA as a topic of conversation across the country, only about 60 percent of Costa Ricans voted in the referendum. The tallies were close, and some within the NO side questioned whether better organization (on transportation, for example) could have put them over the hump. Whatever the reason, the loss was felt heavily, and the tenuous peace between the organizations broke down the very night of October 7. Trejos was booed by his former allies for accepting the referendum results too quickly as television reporting showed Solís and Merino unsure of how to address the angry crowds of activists. Solís, in particular, fell precipitously out of favor with anti-CAFTA organizations. Days later, the Federación de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Costa Rica called a national assembly of the opposition, which was attended by almost no one. The patriotic committees vowed to continue fighting against the passage of the parallel laws, and several national assemblies of committees took place in late 2007 and early 2008. But the sense of defeat was palpable, and mobilizations during negotiations over the parallel laws were, at most, a nuisance to legislators and the Arias government.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>After the defeat in the referendum, the social movement against CAFTA was exhausted. Recriminations and animosities quickly came to light, and, lacking any solid leadership, the movement was unable to recover. Yet, just as the Combo protests had provided the ground on which the anti-CAFTA movement flourished, its demise was followed by aftershocks that have been felt in Costa Rican political life ever since.</p>
<p>Much has been made in the literature of social movements opposed to neoliberalism of the benefits of heterogeneity and decentralization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12456679">Mertes, 2004</xref>). Certainly, conditions have to be adequate for such a strategy, and they seem to have been so in Costa Rica, which fits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12456679">David Meyer and Sidney Tarrow’s (1998</xref>: 3) notion of a “social movement society,” in which “the social movement form of representing claims is becoming largely institutionalized” and social mobilization “part of the conventional repertoire of participation.” Participants in mass mobilizations could expect respect for their rights to congregate and express their opposition to the government. In addition, the Combo protests offered a precedent for both the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>Two factors made seeking to build a centralized entity in preparation for the referendum unpalatable. First, all attempts to build an official anti-CAFTA coalition during the first stage of the struggle (late 2002 to early 2007) had failed. Competition among organizations and leading individuals was acute. Moreover, through the maneuvering of a minority of activists, the coalitions had tended to adopt much more radical positions than those held by most opponents of CAFTA, leading to massive desertions and eventually disintegration. CAFTA supporters routinely took advantage of the radicalization of the coalitions to denounce them as undemocratic and as puppets of organizations that were disliked by the general public. This was perceived by anti-CAFTA leaders as weakening the movement as a whole. Finally, it was clear that the absence of a coalition did not hinder the growth and intensity of anti-CAFTA mobilizations. This shows that the networks of communication underlying the struggle were strong enough not to require formal coalitional ties.</p>
<p>The second factor was the lack of material resources. Given that one of the main attractions of acting together, the potential to pool assets, was absent, activists in Costa Rica concluded that existing conditions called for more diffuse and decentralized action. This was in accord with the universally held view among movement participants that they would be successful only if they gained the active support of a critical mass of Costa Rican citizens—that CAFTA had to be defeated by “the people,” not “the movement.” Thus, the campaign for the referendum was framed so as to coincide with the attitudes of unaffiliated Costa Ricans opposed to the treaty as these were understood through the vibrant informal social networks: the referendum was an opportunity to show that the anti-CAFTA camp was composed not just of union activists and radical troublemakers but of the people of Costa Rica seeking to defend their national patrimony. What better way to do this than by making the opposition campaign as personal, as local, as possible?</p>
<p>There were certainly critics within the opposition who believed that it was too tame, too wedded to existing institutions to effect any real change. Yet, other than calling for a “battle in the streets,” there was little in the way of a real plan of action coming from this camp. The very real successes of the decentralized opposition suggest that the restraint and adaptability of the different organizations involved led them to make the correct choice under the circumstances. They lost the battle against CAFTA, but in so doing they avoided costly clashes over leadership and forced the Costa Rican government to become more open and transparent vis-à-vis the popular organizations and the public.</p>

It was common for radical left-wing activists to call for a vanguardist approach to the struggle, rejection of all compromise with the government (including the referendum), and ultimately revolutionary activity. Given their small size and relative unimportance to the movement, the groups that espoused these views serve mainly as contrast for the deliberative and horizontal nature of the movement as a whole.</p>

<p>Solís and his supporters claimed that the electoral result was fraudulent, and this view was echoed by opposition figures, though without much conviction.
