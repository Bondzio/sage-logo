<abstract>
<p>Despite the importance of literacy skill training for incarcerated youth, a very limited number of empirically based research studies have examined reading instruction in correctional facilities. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Fast ForWord computer-assisted reading program improved the reading and spelling abilities of incarcerated youth. A group of 51 incarcerated male youth identified by facility staff as low performers in reading composed the target group for this study. Both standardized and curriculum-based measures were employed to determine reading and spelling skill growth over an average of 24 sessions in an 11-week intervention. Results indicated no clear literacy skill improvement for the treatment group. Implications for future research are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Concerns regarding the literacy skills of incarcerated youth in the United States are well justified. The related literature has documented that juveniles in correctional settings display basic literacy skills considerably below grade level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362512">Harris, Baltodano, Artiles, &amp; Rutherford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362512">Leone, Krezmein, Mason, &amp; Meisel, 2005</xref>). An associated, disconcerting finding is the overrepresentation of youth with disabilities in juvenile correctional facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362512">Quinn, Rutherford, Leone, Osher, &amp; Poirier, 2005</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510362512">2007</xref>, the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice reported that between 30% and 50% of incarcerated youth are identified with disabilities. Primary disabilities include emotional and behavioral disorders, specific learning disabilities, and mild mental retardation. These young people are at greater risk for academic difficulties and have deficits in critical psychosocial and societal factors that increase their likelihood of very bleak adult outcomes after their release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510362512">Tulipano &amp; Waugh, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One means of ameliorating negative long-term outcomes for this population is the development and implementation of efficacious reading programs. Researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510362512">Drakeford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510362512">Foley, 2001</xref>) have indicated that higher literacy rates lead to lower rates of recidivism and decreased crime rates for juveniles in correctional facilities. A large-scale national study found young prisoners who learned to read while incarcerated were much less likely to return to prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510362512">Tulipano &amp; Waugh, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510362512">Leone, Meisel, and Drakeford (2002)</xref> underscored the importance of literacy skills by stating that improvement in this area for juvenile offenders is associated with less likelihood of returning to the juvenile justice system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510362512">Malmgren and Leone (2000)</xref>, in reference to juvenile delinquency, noted that skill in reading is lauded in our society and seen as crucial for assimilation into the cultural milieu. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510362512">Foley (2001)</xref> noted that educational opportunities while in correctional facilities may prove to be the last, best alternative for incarcerated youth to develop fundamental academic skills needed for successful integration into school and society.</p>
<p>Given the importance of literacy skill training for incarcerated youth, it is surprising that a very limited number of empirically based research studies have examined reading instruction in correctional facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362512">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510362512">Houchins, Jolivette, Krezmien, &amp; Baltodano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362512">Leone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510362512">Shelley-Tremblay, O’Brien, &amp; Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2007</xref>). Researchers in this area alluded to several confounding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362512">Mulcahy, Krezmien, Leone, Houchins, &amp; Baltodano, 2008</xref>). The fluid nature of entry and exit from correctional facilities may affect the instructional models utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510362512">Coulter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510362512">Houchins, Puckett-Patterson, Crosby, Shippen, &amp; Jolivette, 2009</xref>). Also, there are numerous barriers to providing incarcerated youth with a quality education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510362512">Houchins et al., 2009</xref>). For example, there is a continued lack of agreement on how to balance the need to maintain order and provide students with appropriate academic instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362512">Leone et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510362512">Shelley-Tremblay et al. (2007)</xref> posited that budgeting concerns, space and scheduling problems, and staffing instability are hindrances to conducting empirically based research in correctional institutions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the challenges, the empirical examination of literacy skills instruction should be a high priority for practitioners in the juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362512">Leone et al., 2005</xref>). Youth with disabilities may have cognitive and social–emotional deficits that make them particularly vulnerable. With this in mind, determining efficient and effective instructional approaches that can be utilized in correctional facilities is critical to the long-term expectations for juvenile delinquents as they leave the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510362512">Houchins et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510362512">Rozalski and Engle (2005)</xref> stated that because of some of the challenges to conducting empirical research in correctional facilities, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) may be a viable option for literacy skills instruction for incarcerated youth with disabilities. Such instruction may provide facilities with the means of meeting the heterogeneous needs of the transient juvenile justice population. In the present study, the Fast ForWord Literacy and Literacy Advanced programs were used to teach literacy skills to a group of incarcerated juveniles in a long-term correctional facility in central Alabama.</p>

<title>Research on Fast ForWord</title>
<p>According to Tallal, one of the developers of Fast ForWord, of the approximately 25,000 children who were initially trained using the Fast ForWord computer-based program, “90 percent . . . made 1.5 to two years of progress in reading skills” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510362512">Begley, 2000</xref>, p. 64). The What Works Clearinghouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510362512">WWC, 2007</xref>) reviewed 115 studies that used Fast ForWord to determine the program’s effectiveness. Of the 115 studies, 5 met the rigorous standards of the WWC; 1 additional study met the WWC standards with reservations. Of these 6 studies, positive effects were found on phonetic awareness, letter knowledge, and phonics, although this was not determined to be statistically significant. Mixed results on comprehension were identified. One of the studies acknowledged as having met the WWC’s rigorous standards was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510362512">Borman and Benson (in press)</xref>. These researchers used a randomized field trial of 415 students in eight urban schools in the Baltimore City Public School system. Participants were 141 second grade students and 274 seventh grade students. Results revealed no statistically significant differences between the second grade experimental and control participants for language and reading comprehension outcomes. However, statistically significant results were achieved for reading comprehension with seventh grade participants. No statistically or practically significant impact on language outcomes was found.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Fast ForWord computer-based reading program on the acquisition of reading skills of incarcerated youth.</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>The study took place in a long-term maximum-security facility located in a metropolitan city in central Alabama. According to the school district demographic report, the facility had an enrollment of 254 youth at the beginning of the study. District administrators chose this facility as the study site because it houses the largest population of adjudicated youth in the state.</p>
<p>The target population was 51 incarcerated male youth who were identified by facility staff as low performers in reading. Students were selected through teacher recommendations that were determined based on three criteria: low classroom performance, low reading test scores, and/or placement in special education with an identified area of weakness in reading. Of the youth in the final sample, 9 (18%) were identified as having mild disabilities in the area of learning disabilities or mild intellectual disabilities. The remaining 42 (82%) were general education students. None of the study participants had previously participated in the Fast ForWord program.</p>
<p>The population at the facility was separated based on the nature of the offense: sexual offences or delinquency. Both groups were represented in the study: Of the sample, 31 (61%) were adjudicated as sex offenders and 20 (39%) were adjudicated as delinquents. Ethnicity was 45% (23) European American, 53% (27) African American, and 2% (1) Other. Participants’ ages ranged from 11 years 5 months to 20 years 4 months (<italic>M</italic> = 16 years 4 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 1 year 8 months). The experimental group mean age was 16 years 3 months; the control group mean age was 16 years 5 months. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510362512">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of participant demographic data.</p>

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>Interventions used in this study were two computer-based reading programs developed by Scientific Learning Corporation: Fast ForWord Literacy and Fast ForWord Literacy Advanced. Both Fast ForWord Literacy and Fast ForWord Literacy Advanced programs are designed to assist middle and high school students reading 2 or more years below grade level. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510362512">Scientific Learning (2008)</xref>, growth in reading skills of 1 to 2 years is possible in 8 to 12 weeks. Participants in the current study were exposed to Fast ForWord Literacy and/or Literacy Advanced exercises for 48 minutes 5 days a week for approximately 11 weeks, with an average of 24 sessions.</p>
<p>Fast ForWord Literacy includes six exercises designed to improve listening accuracy, phonological awareness, and understanding of language structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510362512">Scientific Learning Corporation, 2009b</xref>). They are Space Racer, Star Pics, Galaxy Goal, Lunar Tunes, Spin Master, and Stellar Stories. Each exercise is designed to develop a combination of cognitive skills, including memory, attention, processing, and sequencing. According to Scientific Learning, the exercises in Fast ForWord Literacy target and develop “the processing efficiency needed for successful reading and learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510362512">Scientific Learning Corporation, 2009b</xref>). The exercises are presented in an interactive video game format. For example, Spin Master exercises a focus on phonological accuracy and fluency across synthetic speech emphasis, presentation rate, and phoneme discrimination. The participant must first initiate the target syllable to match by clicking on a yellow planet in front of an alien disc jockey. The disc jockey plays two syllables on two turntables, and the participant must accurately match the target syllable to one of the disc choices presented (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741932510362512">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0741932510362512-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Fast ForWord Literacy Advanced primarily focuses on strengthening “foundational cognitive and language skills” addressed in the Fast ForWord Literacy program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510362512">Scientific Learning, 2007</xref>, p. 118). Exposure to a multitude of cognitive skills, including sustained attention, ability to sequence multistep instructions, auditory and visual memory, listening comprehension, phonemic awareness, decoding, and word recognition, is addressed in this program. Five exercises designed to enhance these cognitive skills are Sky Rider, Laser Match, Meteor Ball, Lunar Leap, and Galaxy Theater. As in Fast ForWord Literacy, Fast ForWord Literacy Advanced is presented in an interactive video game format. In an example of a Fast ForWord Literacy Advanced exercise, Laser Match, the participant attempts to improve “listening accuracy, word analysis, phonological awareness, and phonological memory by using auditory and visual cues to match pairs of written and spoken words in a grid” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510362512">Scientific Learning Corporation, 2009a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741932510362512">Figure 2</xref> is a screen shot from Laser Match.</p>

<p>Progress was monitored by two general education teachers who were trained in these programs and taught the experimental groups. Group and individual progress was tracked online via Scientific Learning by the teachers of the experimental groups. Fast ForWord provides a variety of group and individual reports, along with diagnostic and prescriptive information, for teachers to determine success levels. Use of the Fast ForWord progress tracker allowed teachers to track the participants’ status. Teachers could determine when to intervene because of a lack of progress, switch a program if the participant was not adequately challenged, or redirect as needed. Participants progressed at their own rate and advanced only if an established proficiency level was achieved. For participants who were not excelling, Fast ForWord identified program remedial activities, and the teachers provided participants with these activities when deemed necessary. No additional reading instruction was provided to participants in the experimental groups during the course of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741932510362512">
<title>Control Group Activities</title>
<p>All instruction for the control group was individualized following typical school procedures. These individual plans were written in behavioral terms and based on a variety of factors: age, academic achievement, grade placement, related needs, and transitional goals. In addition to academic instruction, students ages 16 and older receive vocational training as part of their educational program. Although a variety of content areas was used, the general focus of education for youth in long-term facilities in Alabama is two pronged: development of functional literacy and development of skills to continue formal education. The focus of the educational programs is to provide students with improved academic, life, and job readiness skills to enable them to return to the community better prepared to be law-abiding citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741932510362512">
<title>Fidelity of Intervention and Amount</title>
<p>Fidelity refers to how well intervention implementation was evaluated. In this case, fidelity addressed the degree to which the researchers had trustworthy information that literacy instruction was or was not provided during the study across the treatment and control groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510362512">Dane and Schneider (1998)</xref> suggested that fidelity has five essential components: (a) adherence, (b) intervention exposure, (c) intervention quality, (d) program differentiation, and (e) student responsiveness. The researchers in this study examined treatment fidelity descriptively by focusing on three of these elements to explain what occurred in both groups and to corroborate the veracity of the findings.</p>
<p>Intervention exposure was addressed using computer log information and teacher lesson plans. The Fast ForWord program provides teachers with data on when and how long each student was logged on to the computer. Based on computer log data provided to the authors, students in the treatment group were logged on an average of 24 days (range = 18 days–30 days) within the 11-week intervention window. The mean participation level was 98% (range = 89%–100%). The mean percentage of activities completed was 55.</p>
<p>Adherence was attended to through the structure of the Fast ForWord program. By design, the program provides students with incremental and consistent lessons. It does not allow teachers or students to deviate from the prescribed lessons. The program is manualized in that a prearranged set of lessons is provided based on a student’s needs.</p>
<p>Program differentiation was addressed by ensuring that only the treatment group was given the appropriate number of computers and the Fast ForWord program. The control group, which did not have access to the program or student computers, was provided with the typical educational materials that did not include CAI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741932510362512">
<title>Teacher Training</title>
<p>Two general education teachers, one from the sex offender program and one from the delinquency program, facilitated the Fast ForWord reading instruction. Both teachers were selected by the school principal and both held master’s degrees in education. A Fast ForWord representative trained them in use of the program over 2 days. Training was provided for all six types of exercises within the programs. During the first training session, the trainers reviewed each of the six types in both programs; after each review, the trainer directed the teachers to practice the exercises on the training software.</p>
<p>The 2nd day of training consisted of assessing group and individual progress reports. The teachers were shown how to analyze participant performance and track progress. Training regarding the interpretation of various reports was provided. They were instructed on proper times to intervene, when to switch levels, when to redirect if no progress was being made, and motivation techniques appropriate for keeping participants on task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0741932510362512">
<title>Dependent Measures</title>
<p>The selection of measures used in the study was based on the overall reading needs of struggling adolescent readers and the distal needs of the juvenile justice facility where the study was conducted. Even though the developers of Fast ForWord indicate their program does address phonological awareness, it was not measured because it is typically not used as a reading indicator with adolescent readers. This study focused on overall reading abilities, decoding skills, and spelling. The primary emphasis was on reading comprehension, which was measured using diagnostic and curriculum-based measures (CBMs). The latter are typically more sensitive to small changes in shorter amounts of instructional time as compared to diagnostic instrumentation. Basic decoding skills were measured because decoding is closely related to reading comprehension skills. Spelling was measured because it was a proximal concern for the school system. While reading comprehension and decoding were of primary importance, spelling also was mentioned as an area of interest. Listening skills were not assessed because the researchers understood that the computer program used these types of activities to ultimately concentrate on the other skills assessed.</p>

<title>Standardized measures</title>
<p>Participants were given three pre and post standardized measures: Short Scale of the <italic>Woodcock Reading Mastery Test–Revised/Normative Update</italic> (WRMT-R/NU; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510362512">Woodcock, 1998</xref>), <italic>Test of Word Reading Efficiency</italic> (TOWRE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510362512">Torgeson, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 1999</xref>), and <italic>Test of Written Spelling–4</italic> (TWS-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510362512">Larsen, Hammill, &amp; Moats, 1999</xref>). For the WRMT-R/NU, the subtests administered were (a) Word Identification, (b) Word Attack, and (c) Passage Comprehension. These subtests yield both a basic skill cluster (Word Identification and Word Attack) and a total reading score short scale (Word Identification and Passage Comprehension). The WRMT-R/NU yields standard scores (<italic>M</italic> = 100, <italic>SD</italic> = 15). The TOWRE yields subtests of Phonemic Decoding Efficiency, Sight Word Reading Efficiency, and an overall measure of Word Reading Efficiency. The TOWRE yields standard scores (<italic>M</italic> = 100, <italic>SD</italic> = 15). Standard scores are described as very superior (131–166), superior (121–130), above average (111–120), average (90–110), below average (80–89), poor (70–79), and very poor (35–69). The TWS-4 yields an overall spelling performance outcome (standard score <italic>M</italic> = 100, <italic>SD</italic> = 15). All three standardized assessments were counterbalanced to prevent internal validity questions.</p>

<title>Probe placement</title>
<p>Participant probe placements in reading comprehension were based on the grade equivalency scores of the WRMT-R/NU pre-test Passage Comprehension subtest. If a participant scored a 0.4 or less grade equivalency on the WRMT-R/NU, reading comprehension probes were administered at that grade level. If a participant scored a 0.5 or above grade equivalency on the WRMT-R/NU, reading comprehension probes were administered at that grade level above. For example, a participant who scored a 2.4 grade equivalency on the Comprehension subtest of the WRMT-R/NU was given second grade reading comprehension CBM probes, whereas a participant who scored a 2.5 grade equivalency was given the third grade reading comprehension CBM probes. The decision rule for placing a participant in a specific grade-level probe for spelling CBMs employed the same strategy as noted above for reading comprehension probes.</p>
<p>Both reading comprehension and spelling CBMs were administered individually to participants following the administration procedures as directed in the AIMSweb guide. Youth were tested in a room free from distractions. The treatment group teachers administered three reading comprehension and three spelling probes to their students. A trained facility administrator administered three reading comprehension and three spelling probes to the control group. Probes were administered biweekly.</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Results</title>
<p>This study employed an experimental pretest–posttest design with random assignment to the treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 27) or the control (<italic>n</italic> = 24) group. The standardized and curriculum-based data were analyzed using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510362512">Stevens (1996)</xref> pointed out that “in repeated measures designs . . . variability among the subjects due to individual differences is completely removed. . . . This makes these designs much more powerful than completely randomized design” (p. 250). Means and standard deviations for the scores on the dependent measures (standardized) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741932510362512">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The results of the repeated measures MANOVA for the standardized measures (WRMT-R/NU Short Scale, TOWRE, TWS-4) indicated a significant main effect for time, Wilks’s λ = .27, <italic>F</italic>(5, 45) = 24.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. However, no interaction effect was found for time group (e.g., treatment vs. control). Estimates of effect size (<italic>ES</italic>) indicated a medium effect for time (<italic>d</italic> = .73). Follow-up <italic>t</italic> tests revealed that the treatment group showed statistically significant growth only on the TWS-4, <italic>t</italic>(26) = −2.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>The results of the repeated measures MANOVA for the three CBMs (words spelled correctly [WSC], correct letter sequences [CLS], reading comprehension [RC]) indicated no significant effect for WSC. However a significant main effect was noted for CLS, Wilks’s λ = .83, <italic>F</italic>(2, 43) = 4.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and for RC, Wilks’s λ = .79, <italic>F</italic>(2, 46) = 6.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. No interaction effect was found.</p>
<p>Follow-up pairwise comparisons on CLS and RC main effects showed no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups. However, a statistically significant pairwise comparison (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) was noted for percentage of CLS between Spelling CBM 2 and Spelling CBM 3 for all participants over time, and a statistically significant pairwise comparison (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) was noted between RC CBM 1 and RC CBM 2 for all participants over time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510362512">Table 3</xref> for CBM means and standard deviations).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the clear need to increase the literacy skills of incarcerated youth and investigate the impact of marketed reading programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362512">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510362512">Houchins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362512">Leone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510362512">Shelley-Tremblay et al., 2007</xref>), this study examined the effects of a computer-based reading program for this population. The results indicated no clear skill improvement for the treatment group after approximately 11 weeks of intervention.</p>
<p>Providing incarcerated youth with quality reading instruction can potentially have a profound effect on the outcomes for these youth, with and without disabilities. These students all too often enter the facility with significant reading deficits that put them in jeopardy of being left behind educationally. The instruction they receive while incarcerated may be their last educational opportunity to move ahead in school and in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362512">Leone et al., 2005</xref>). Reading is fundamental to success in life, whereas illiteracy can continue the cycle of failure.</p>
<p>Computer-assisted reading instruction is an appealing method of instruction for students who are incarcerated for multiple reasons. Juvenile justice teachers are faced with the daunting task of providing intensive and targeted instruction to a student population that is ever changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510362512">Coulter, 2004</xref>). The transient nature of these students makes providing homogeneous instruction logically difficult. Computer-assisted reading programs may allow the teacher to have a heterogeneous group of students in a classroom but still provide them with individualized instruction. Thus, students in the same classroom could be provided with the appropriate individualized instructional level while seated next to other students performing at a much different level.</p>
<p>Computer-assisted reading instruction also may allow teachers to make data-based instructional decisions. A computer has an unlimited ability to provide analyzed data that teachers could use to change and alter instruction as needed. Even more so, the computer has the ability to increase or decrease the difficulty of the instructional material as needed by the student. Such instructional decision abilities remove arbitrary guesswork, ensuring that students receive the appropriate level of instruction and that teachers can address behavioral needs of these youth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the results of the current study do not indicate such gains. Perhaps the shortness of the intervention or the broadness of the dependent measures were factors in not detecting better outcomes. In either case, more research is needed with Fast ForWord and juvenile offender populations.</p>
<sec id="section18-0741932510362512">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is the small sample size (51). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362512">Mulcahy et al. (2008)</xref> suggested, this is one factor that makes it difficult to conduct high-quality research in a juvenile justice setting. Students are constantly entering facilities based on when they were sentenced and exiting based on the length of their sentence.</p>
<p>Another limitation was the amount of instruction each student received. Although instruction was received over a 13-week period, we did not control for the precise amount of instruction received. Our analyses did not take into consideration the hourly instruction students received. In addition, limited fidelity of implementation data were obtained. Although the computer program provided evidence that the instruction was adhered to, no information regarding the quality of that instruction was available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0741932510362512">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Fast ForWord program provides students with CAI, which is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510362512">Skinner’s (1953)</xref> technique known as programmed instruction (PI) in which students are provided with systematic instruction without the assistance of a computer. Both CAI and PI are entrenched in a behaviorist view of instruction where operant conditioning is primarily used. Circumstances considered necessary for effective CAI instruction include having a terminal behavior, responding actively, shaping, and reinforcing immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510362512">Ormrod, 1999</xref>). The Fast ForWord program establishes an instructional goal for each student based on his or her pretest data. Students are supposed to be actively engaged in the program through instruction that is meant to be motivational and appropriate. Students are provided with incrementally more difficult tasks as they progress through the program. They are given visual (e.g., picture of a star) and auditory (“Good job!”) reinforcers when they answer questions correctly.</p>
<p>In addition to the foundational theories that support CAI, the WWC provided initial evidence that Fast ForWord may be effective at increasing the alphabetic skills of early elementary students. The findings are mixed when related to comprehension. Although the program has been evaluated primarily for use with elementary students, program developers have recently targeted adolescent juvenile justice facility inmates as a population. Numerous states have adopted the program, and it is increasingly being used widely in juvenile justice facilities. The program thus needs to be evaluated to determine its scientific merit, particularly for the juvenile justice population, which is mobile and has a disproportionate number of youth with basic language and reading skill deficits.</p>
<p>This study sought to determine whether the Fast ForWord computer-assisted reading program improved the reading abilities of incarcerated youth. Unfortunately, we found no difference between the treatment and control groups. Our findings do not support the use of Fast ForWord with this population of students. Although our study findings are tenuous, we should note that they do not support continued funding of the Fast ForWord program. This is not to say that the program does not potentially have merit. Future studies should address the limitations of our study. Juvenile justice facilities across the nation should continue to try to determine how to best meet the reading needs of one of the most difficult student populations in K–12 education.</p>
