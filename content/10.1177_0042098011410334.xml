<abstract>
<p>Urban sprawl is one of the major issues regarding sustainable urban development. In response to concerns about sprawl, compact development strategies have been proposed to promote sustainable development. However, a compact development approach needs to pay attention to the crucial question of commercial profitability. The aim of this article is to inquire into the commercial profitability of compact development strategies by developing different scenarios and to put forward ways to control urban sprawl through certain spatial strategies in the Istanbul case. The results indicate that the current planning approach is not effective in reducing sprawl without setting certain spatial strategies by which development activity is restricted, or imposing additional requirements for new development in certain areas. It is found that urban sprawl can be reduced by up to 62 per cent through setting certain spatial strategies and that uncontrolled urban sprawl might feasibly be shifted from peripheral to central areas.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Urban planning evolved throughout the 20th century and led to a great variety of urban forms which received increasing attention for their impact upon the environment. In the ‘developed world’, the rise of ‘urban sprawl’ as the primary form of urban development has come under increased criticism in recent years because of its negative social, economic and environmental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011410334">Newman and Kenworthy, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011410334">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011410334">Jenks <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011410334">Ewing, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410334">Burton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011410334">Hasse and Lathrop, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011410334">Shen and Zhang, 2007</xref>). The dramatic expansion of development at the expense of open space and natural resource lands has sparked intense interest and debate over the problems relating to ‘urban sprawl’.</p>
<p>The costs and negative externalities of urban sprawl have been widely studied and documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410334">Brueckner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011410334">Kahn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011410334">Freeman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410334">Burchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Of particular concern is the land-consumptive and inefficient nature of this new urban growth, especially greenfield development, in the periphery and the increasing amount of critical land resources lost in relation to population growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410334">Burchell <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011410334">Sierra Club, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011410334">1999</xref>). In addition, greenfield development, which leads to urban expansion, is favoured by developers in a competitive economy because it is simpler and more profitable to develop greenfields that are seen to be a benefit to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011410334">Breheny, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011410334">de Sousa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410334">Oxley, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042098011410334">Williams and Shiels (2000)</xref> stated, patterns of discontinuous growth can emerge with low-density housing which often wastes open space, and the desire of developers for inexpensive greenfield sites often leads to the leapfrog effect as areas mature. This urban sprawl characteristic has emerged primarily due to free-market conditions in which the decisions of individuals are imposed to maximise profit and which favours conversion of rural land due to low land values. Under these circumstances, markets may fail to provide efficient solutions to problems of resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410334">Bramley <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410334">Oxley, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The preferences of households for suburban living and lifestyle choices favouring single-family housing also promote urban sprawl through a demand for suburban and exurban living environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011410334">Breheny, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410334">Downs, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011410334">Gordon and Richardson, 1997</xref>). The decisions of both developers and households impose costs and maximise profit to cause negative externalities such as the loss of farmland and open spaces and increased road congestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410334">Oxley, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410334">Brueckner (2000)</xref> notes three types of market failure which lead to the excessive spatial growth of cities: the first is the failure to take account of the social value of an open space when land is converted to urban use; the second is the failure to account for the social costs of congestion; and the third is the failure to shift the cost of new development generated by their projects onto developers.</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the market failures and promote sustainable development, governments have adopted strategies designed to deal with urban sprawl. Compact development has been widely accepted as a way of achieving more sustainable development. In a series of initiatives, both national and local governments have begun to lay the foundation for a broad policy designed to transform the morphology of urban growth, particularly under the concept of compact development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098011410334">Torens and Alberti, 2000</xref>). Most of the basic public policies to control sprawl can affect the pattern of new development. These include containment policies such as greenbelts, urban growth boundaries and urban service boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011410334">Rogers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410334">Bramley <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410334">Downs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410334">Brueckner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410334">Burchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011410334">Pendall <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098011410334">Talen and Knaap, 2003</xref>), fiscal arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410334">Burchell, <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410334">Knaap <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098011410334">Talen and Knaap, 2003</xref>), land use controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011410334">Landis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011410334">Pendall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410334">Oxley, 2004</xref>), infill development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011410334">Nelson and Wachter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011410334">Smart Growth Principles, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011410334">NAHB, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011410334">Smart Growth Network, 2003</xref>), brownfield development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011410334">Alker <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011410334">Greenberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011410334">Sousa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011410334">Grimski and Ferber, 2001</xref>), the imposition of development fees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410334">Knaap <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410334">Burchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and transferable development rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011410334">Peiser and Frej, 2003</xref>). Planners and policy-makers should be aware of the challenges that some strategies may alleviate sprawl, whereas others encourage it.</p>
<p>One of the basic elements to encourage compact development is that land use planning is often implemented to control development and to alleviate urban sprawl. There are a number of objectives of land use planning such as protecting the rural land, improving the quality of the physical environment and minimising incompatible uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410334">Oxley, 2004</xref>). The objectives of land use planning are precisely specified by the attempts to relate spatially defined policy objectives such as growth control, which represents an important approach in compact development strategies.</p>
<p>Growth control is the essential strategy that encourages compact urban form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011410334">Nelson and Duncan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410334">Downs, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011410334">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410334">Brueckner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410334">Burchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). The methods of growth control such as urban growth boundaries, urban service boundaries and greenbelts aim to direct the new urban development into designated urban boundaries and to limit the occurrence of new development outside these boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011410334">Rogers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410334">Bramley <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410334">Downs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410334">Brueckner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410334">Burchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011410334">Pendall <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098011410334">Talen and Knaap, 2003</xref>). Portland, Oregon, has the best-known example of a UGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011410334">Nelson and Moore, 1996</xref>) and London that of a greenbelt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011410334">Rogers, 1997</xref>). There are also public policy instruments for managing urban growth and protecting open space at various governmental levels which may be identified and briefly described as the inclusion of public acquisition of land, regulatory approaches and incentive-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011410334">Gustafson <italic>et al</italic>., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011410334">Nelson and Moore, 1996</xref>; Weitz and Moore, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011410334">Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011410334">Sierra Club, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011410334">Landis <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref> point out that UGBs seem to be able successfully to redistribute development from urban fringe areas towards more central locations. Such urban containment policies also help inner-city revitalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410334">NAHB, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011410334">Dawkins and Nelson, 2003</xref>) and redevelopment of existing urban areas where the physical urban environment has deteriorated.</p>
<p>There might be some unintended consequences of growth controls. Academics and economists argue that growth controls cause shortages of development land and contribute to low levels of house building, thereby increasing the relative cost of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011410334">Knaap, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011410334">Fischel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011410334">Landis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011410334">Levine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011410334">Pendall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410334">Oxley, 2004</xref>). However, policy-makers and planners should consider the overall costs, including any project’s environmental and social aspects. Environmentally and socially destructive suburban sprawl is seen as a key component of the problem. A set of policy instruments should be integrated with a land use planning approach that considers the reasons of the market failure and sets the regulations to shift the development in favour of sustainable development. If policy instruments such as fiscal arrangements, land use regulation and growth controls, are not co-ordinated, they will not be effective in solving the problems and might lead to market failure, as can be seen in the Istanbul case. Uncontrolled urban sprawl might not feasibly be shifted from the peripheral areas to the centre of the metropolitan areas unless the policy is designed to ensure that the compact form is more feasible than sprawl under free market conditions. This paper attempts to demonstrate the possibilities of how new development can feasibly be shifted from the peripheral to the central areas, and to evaluate the strategies which shift the development in favour of sustainable development under certain spatial strategies. The organisation of paper is as follows. Background information about the historical urban spatial development of Istanbul is given in the second section. In the third section, three scenarios have been developed for the Istanbul metropolitan area to identify alternative development paths. The third section consists of three sub-sections. In the first sub-section, a sprawl index has been calculated to identify the current spatial development pattern of Istanbul and to define the zones. These zones have been classified according to their urban sprawl and urban compaction characteristics. The second sub-section includes the data preparation and explanation of methodology. The last sub-section consists of the calculation and comparison of the housing development potential of the zones under three different scenarios. The final section is devoted to a conclusion and suggestions.</p>

<title>2. The Urban Spatial Development of Istanbul</title>
<p>Istanbul’s urban spatial structure has been dominated by three phenomena since the 1950s. These are: informal housing, unco-ordinated and uncontrolled urban intensification, and mass housing projects.</p>
<p>The nature of the urban spatial structure of Istanbul started to change after the 1950s, when the shortage of affordable housing created informal housing (<italic>gecekondu</italic>) primarily due to rural migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011410334">Keleş, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410334">Bölen, 2004</xref>). Since the informal housing was uncontrolled, unplanned and mostly built on public land, it created unauthorised and illegal housing stock. These settlements, which were located in peripheral areas, were low density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410334">Bölen, 2004</xref>) and accelerated urban expansion. As a consequence of sprawl, these illegal/informal residential areas started to invade the water basins, forests and high-quality agricultural land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011410334">Bölen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The financial cost of informal housing was lower than formal housing and was preferred by migrants. However, the facts of squatter area development have changed and it became the target of land speculation in the late 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011410334">Keleş, 1993</xref>). All these together are the starting-point of unsustainable development in Istanbul.</p>
<p>The general approach to the squatter settlements is that governments have legalised them and provided infrastructure and services for those areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011410334">Ergun, 1990</xref>). Five-year development plans have emphasised the need to upgrade squatter settlements, providing them with infrastructure and services (SPO, 1963, 1968, 1973, 1978). The most important law for squatter areas was passed in 1984 and each squatter was given permission to build up to four floors. As a result, many squatter areas rapidly transformed and turned into high-density areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410334">Bölen, 2004</xref>). Upgrading plans for unauthorised built-up areas were prepared by municipalities, sub-division plans were constituted and the structure of ownership in areas was re-regulated by legalisation, and new urban plots were produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098011410334">Turk, 2003</xref>). These plans led to an intensification of squatter settlements which were located at the urban fringe.</p>
<p>There is also a process of urban intensification through the revision of land use plans within the existing areas close to the urban core. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011410334">Güngör (2003)</xref> pointed out that under market conditions, it was necessary to increase the floor area ratio (FAR) to 2.00 to enable urban renewal projects to be profitable for the private sector in the 1980s. These facts create market force pressures on land use plans to intensify areas close to the city centre.</p>
<p>Since 1980, the housing sector has been recognised as a key employment generator and successive governments have played an important role in mass housing in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410334">Bölen, 2004</xref>). The initial mass housing projects initiated by the public sector are in Levent and Atakoy, on the west side of Istanbul. Especially after economic stabilisation in 2002, both public and private developers started to invest in mass housing projects. This affected the urban spatial structure. The problem of mass housing projects is that they are not co-ordinated through an overall spatial development strategy.</p>
<p>All in all, rapid urban expansion with low-density development towards the peripheries, urban intensification in the central areas due to market pressure and/or land use plans, unco-ordinated mass housing projects within the urban spatial structure, an extension to the west in a linear form along the E-5 highway due to the extension of the urban service areas and multicentre development characteristics supported by the master plans of 1980, 1995 and 2007 which have increased population concentration in the urban core have created an uncontrolled development pattern and tended to produce urban sprawl rather than a compact pattern. Since 1980, free market conditions have dominated the spatial urban development pattern, which has created more feasible conditions for new housing development on the urban fringe while increasing the risk for the redevelopment of existing built-up areas in which physical conditions have been deteriorating. Therefore, a vital need has emerged to intervene with the market through compact development strategies to promote sustainable development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098011410334" sec-type="methods">
<title>3. Data and Methodology</title>
<p>In this paper, three scenarios have been developed for the Istanbul metropolitan area to identify alternative development paths that form the basis for decisions facing the urban planners in delivering a more sustainable Istanbul. The alternatives include an urban development process based on the idea of free market forces (the business-as-usual scenario) contrasting with development paths (the conservative and compact development scenarios) where market intervention is sought in a more environmentally and socially sustainable way through integrated planning.</p>
<p>These scenarios are based on the notion of a comparison between compact and sprawling zones. The zones have been determined by using a sprawl index. This index has been developed by using principal component analysis which analyses a dataset collected for each neighbourhood (ward) within the urbanised area of Istanbul for 2005. The dataset includes 11 variables which have been collected for all the 787 neighbourhoods within the city. These variables are: gross population density, floor area ratio, building coverage ratio, housing unit density, building density, the proportion of residential use, the proportion of commercial use, the proportion of urban facilities, distance to Central Business Districts (CBD), distance to primary centres and distance to secondary centres.</p>
<p>The underlying principles of the principal component analysis, which was used to develop the sprawl index, are to reduce the number of variables into fewer factors and to extract maximum common variance from all variables to put them into a common score. In the index, 11 variables were reduced to three factors which are density, mixed-use and distance to centres. This is explained in detail in the next sub-section. The principal component analysis method assumes several assumptions: there is a linear relationship; there is no multicollinearity; it includes relevant variables in the analysis; and there is true correlation between variables and factors. This analysis also assumes that there is no outlier in data and the case must be greater than the factor.</p>
<p>In this method, sample adequacy for the dataset is measured by using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test, which provides evidence of the appropriateness of the analysis. According to this test, the variable set included in the test should exceed 0.50 of the threshold value.</p>
<p>Using the sprawl index, the Istanbul metropolitan area has been divided into five zones which range from the most compact zones to the most sprawling zones. Therefore, the sprawl index and its results have been evaluated first. This section is followed by a comparison and evaluation of the five zones in terms of housing development potential which represents the commercial profitability of market conditions under the three scenarios.</p>

<p>In the literature survey, various variables have been used to measure urban sprawl and specific indexes have also been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011410334">Bertaud and Malpezzi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410334">Galster <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410334">Ewing <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). In measuring urban sprawl, the first and the most widely used variable is density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011410334">Peiser, 1989</xref>). In the following research, apart from density, the distance to the centres of activity, continuity, concentration, centralisation and mixed land use variables have been used in urban sprawl measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011410334">Gordon and Richardson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011410334">Bertaud and Malpezzi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410334">Galster <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410334">Ewing <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). With advanced spatial analysis techniques, modelling and simulation, more complex measurement techniques have been developed and used to characterise urban sprawl patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011410334">Batty <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011410334">Sudhira <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098011410334">Tsai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098011410334">Torrens, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>An earlier study for measurement of urban sprawl in Istanbul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098011410334">Terzi and Bölen, 2009</xref>) attempts to develop a sprawl index which is based on that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410334">Ewing <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref>. In that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098011410334">Terzi and Bölen, 2009</xref>), gross density and proximity factors (weighted by the power of centres) were used in the calculation of the sprawl index for the years 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2005. Further factors should be useful in explaining the urban sprawl pattern; however, the limited available data restrict the number of variables which can be used to explore and understand the urban sprawl pattern.</p>
<p>In this paper, the sprawl index has been developed using three factors which are widely referred in the literature survey. These factors are density, mixed-use and distance to the centres. Each of these factors was composed of measurable variables. The density and mixed-use factors have been obtained by using the principal component analysis. However, this technique is not suitable to calculate the distance-to-centres factor because it does not fulfil the requirement of the assumption of the principal components analysis that there is true correlation between variables and factors. The reason is that a neighbourhood could be close to the CBD, but far away from the primary centre, or could be close to the secondary centre, but far from the CBD. Therefore, the distance-to-centres factor has been calculated using the Z-scores of all 787 neighbourhoods’ distances to the CBD, primary and secondary centres, and then it is integrated into sprawl index as a negative component. It is accepted as a negative component because of the negative relationship between density and the distance from city centre, which is one of the main characteristics of urban sprawl.</p>
<p>The first factor is density and it has been obtained by five measurable variables which are: gross population density, floor area ratio, building coverage ratio, housing unit density and building density. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) has been found to be 0.746 and the total explained variance is 67.81 per cent.</p>
<p>The second factor is mixed-use and it has been obtained by the proportion of residential use, the proportion of commercial use and the proportion of urban facilities such as hospitals, parks and schools. The KMO has been measured to be 0.571 which is slightly higher than the threshold value of 0.50. The total variance explained is 67.47 per cent.</p>
<p>The last factor, distance to centres, has been calculated as the geographical distance between neighbourhoods and the centres. The strength of central business districts (CBDs) and primary and secondary centres has been determined in accordance with their organised retail areas. The strength of centres has been used to weigh the distance-to-centres variable. All three weighted distances (distance to CBD, primary and secondary centres) of a neighbourhood were standardised and summed. The distance to centres was calculated as follows</p>

<p>Evaluation of the sprawl index is based on the mean of sprawl scores. If a neighbourhood has a sprawl score value defined by 1 standard deviation below the mean of the sprawl index, it is represented as a sprawling neighbourhood; if it has a value defined by 1 standard deviation above the mean of the sprawl index, it is represented as a compact neighbourhood. Each factor has been evaluated as described and visualised to understand its geographical distribution, which gives an idea of its urban development characteristics.</p>
<p>From visualisation of the spatial distribution of the overall sprawl score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011410334">Figure 1</xref>) Istanbul has been divided into five parts. The boundaries of the zones were simplified to provide a clearer view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011410334">Figure 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011410334">Figure 2</xref> represents the development pattern in 2009. The most central zone is called the ‘core’ (black) where the most compact areas in Istanbul are concentrated. The core zone comprises areas that correspond to the old CBD with its 3000-year- old historical areas. The second zone, which is defined as ‘central’ (dark tone), was developed by the city in the 1950s. This zone shows compact development characteristics. Much of the major development of this zone took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This zone is now linked closely to the core and the periphery by a subway, trains, buses and ferries. Most of the buildings in this zone have experienced renewal due to the frequent changes in construction density ratios and it is still in need of further renewal due to deteriorated physical conditions and earthquake damage. This area includes old industrial areas, warehousing and deteriorated dwellings which offer opportunities for urban regeneration. The third zone is called ‘transition’ (mid tone) because it covers the areas between the peripheral areas and the central areas. This zone can be identified as containing neither compact nor sprawling areas. The development of this zone was accelerated after the construction of bridges over the Bosphorus and their associated main motorways in 1973 and 1986. Two major organised industrial areas (İkitelli and Dudullu), mass housing developments and other residential areas are the dominant characteristics of this zone. The fourth zone is the ‘periphery’ (lighter tone) which still continues to expand with the planned and unplanned development of residential and industrial establishments. This zone is characterised by sprawling areas. The rest of the areas are called the ‘outer periphery’and contain the most sprawling areas. This zone has grown in a linear form and has gained an importance due to the extension of the urban service areas of the Istanbul municipality by the act 5216 in 2004.</p>

<title>3.2 Data Preparation for the Urban Development Scenarios</title>
<p>Under the three different scenarios, the five zones have been compared with each other according to their housing development potential which is based on the ratio of housing development profit to housing development cost. This calculation has been implemented in two steps. In the first, the cost of housing has been calculated which includes land value, building cost, soft cost and cost of infrastructure.

<p>Building cost, soft costs and infrastructure costs are assumed to be the same for each zone, since it is assumed that the same housing type is produced in every zone. Therefore, building cost, soft costs, infrastructure costs and floor area ratio have been considered equal for each zone in the initial conditions. These parameters are changed in the zones according to the strategies developed for each scenario. The remaining parameters, of which land value and house price are the main determinants for the calculation of the total cost and housing development potential, vary according to their geographical distribution within the city.</p>
<p>Land values and house prices were collected from the 2008 databases of the three biggest estate web portals in Turkey (Hurriyet Emlak, Milliyet Emlak, and Emlak Net). Land values covering plots 100–1000 square metres in size without any restrictions for building construction have been researched and 3906 units were entered into the database.</p>
<p>From a wide range of different housing types with changing prices, information regarding standard housing units (in terms of the Turkish classification), which covers apartments of 75–125 square metres in size, and which have two or three bedrooms and natural gas systems, has been collected from the databases of the real estate web portals. According to the criteria (standard housing), 23 961 housing units have been found and the prices of 23 961 housing units have been taken for the calculation of housing development potential. All land and housing units have been co-ordinated according to their location to create a database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098011410334">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

From the statistical tests, the resulting values of logarithmic transformation give better results in terms of the distribution of the data. Normal Q–Q plots and Kolmogrov–Smirnov tests have been used to apply linear models rather than the resulting values of non-transformation. Thus, logarithmic values have been taken into consideration to compare the five zones in terms of their housing development potential for urban development scenarios.</p>

<title>3.3 Urban Development Scenarios</title>
<p>Three urban development scenarios have been identified for the Istanbul metropolitan area. They offer a means to discuss alternative development scenarios that form the basis for decisions facing the urban planners in delivering a more sustainable Istanbul. The alternatives include urban development based on free market forces (business-as-usual), contrasting with a scenario where compact development is sought in a more environmentally sustainable way.</p>
<p>The scenarios are compared with each other and evaluated in terms of housing development potential which represents the commercial profitability of market conditions under the three scenarios. For each scenario, two assumptions have been made. The first assumption is that the spatial housing price level will remain unchanged during the implementation period of suggested policies.</p>
<p>In addition, the scenario analysis includes only private costs and benefits of sprawl and compaction; social costs and benefits are not taken into consideration. Therefore, it is assumed that transport infrastructure investments will follow residential density increases, so that social costs due to transport problems (including congestion) will not arise. These scenarios are represented as follows.</p>
<sec id="section7-0042098011410334">
<title>The business-as-usual scenario</title>
<p>This is a market-led development scenario with greater environmental impact and it represents a continuation of rapid growth with high urban expansion towards the periphery. In other words, this scenario represents current urban development trends with current spatial strategies. Growth is mainly concentrated in a number of peripheral nodes and the city moves towards a sprawling development style.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410334">Table 1</xref>, it can be observed that housing development potential is the highest in the peripheral zone followed by the transition zone with 32.75 per cent and the outer periphery with 22.21 per cent. Having very close housing development potential between the zones, developers mostly prefer to develop greenfield sites rather than to redevelop existing areas where the developers are required to put more effort into refurbishing existing buildings and take more business risks associated with tenure patterns, household relocation, etc. Thus, a set of strategies should be established to direct development from the peripheral areas to central areas to avoid market failure.</p>

<title>The conservative scenario</title>
<p>This is a more environmentally sensitive scenario than business-as-usual. This scenario is aimed at protecting agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas against urban development. Using urban containment strategies, it aims to shift the development from the peripheral areas to the central urban areas. An urban growth boundary, density restrictions and development impact fees (as infrastructure cost to finance central areas’ redevelopment) have been set to analyse the profitability of the five zones.

<title>The compact development scenario</title>
<p>This is the most environmental friendly scenario and it aims to decrease the supply for land and housing at the periphery.

This scenario provides more compact development opportunities which limit the occurrence of new development outside the urban growth boundary and redistribute the development from urban fringe areas towards more central locations. Redistributing development towards more central locations also helps inner-city revitalisation and the redevelopment of existing urban areas within deteriorating physical urban environments.</p>

<p>Conservative and compact development scenarios have been compared with the business-as-usual scenario to understand their effects on alleviating urban sprawl and creating a compact pattern. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098011410334">Figure 5</xref>, the results of the housing development potentials for the five zones in the three scenarios have been illustrated. The conservative scenario limits the new development at the periphery in order to create a less feasible environment—reducing housing development potential, in other words. Making the peripheries less feasible can be interpreted as an opportunity to decrease urban expansion. A little increase in the housing development potential in the core and central zone, which represents the compact areas of Istanbul, can be observed, while a dramatic decrease is found in the sprawling areas. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098011410334">Figure 5</xref> shows, housing development potential decreased from 0.46 to −0.31 in the periphery zone and from 0.22 to −0.25 in the outer periphery. This can be interpreted as a sign that the conservative scenario has positive impacts on discouraging new development in the peripheral areas, which helps to direct attention to the central areas to be redeveloped. This scenario can reduce urban sprawl by an average of 0.62 through reducing the incentive for new development at the periphery. Yet, the conservative scenario has no strong impact on creating a compact pattern as it does not provide a more feasible environment in the compact areas. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098011410334">Figure 5</xref>, the housing development potential increases from 0.18 to 0.22 in the core zone and from 0.07 to 0.11 in the central zone compared with the business-as-usual scenario.</p>

<p>The compact development scenario has much more positive effects on promoting a more compact form and providing a less sprawling city in terms of decreasing the housing development potential in the peripheral areas compared with the business-as-usual scenario. In the compact areas, housing development potential increases from 0.18 to 0.67 in the core zone and 0.07 to 0.52 in the central zone, which means that compact development can be encouraged at an average of 0.47. In the sprawling areas, housing development potential remains the same as in the conservative scenario. Consequently, the compact development scenario has a strong effect on encouraging compact development. It makes a contribution of approximately 0.47 to the compact development and 0.62 towards the reduction of urban sprawl.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011410334">Figure 6</xref> represents spatial illustrations of housing development potential in both 2D and 3D views. The darker tones show the areas of higher housing development potential, while the lighter tones represent areas with lower housing development potential. In the compact development scenario, the number of neighbourhoods having higher housing development potential is much greater than in previous scenarios. In this scenario, the neighbourhoods which have lower housing development potential are fewer than in the previous scenarios.</p>

<title>4. Conclusion</title>
<p>The preferences of households for suburban living and greenfield development are favoured by developers in a competitive economy. The decisions of both the developers and the households impose costs and maximise profit that causes negative externalities such as a loss of farmland and open spaces, and increased road congestion. These negative effects produce a need for an inquiry into the planning approach. Freely competitive markets might fail to provide efficient solutions to problems of resource allocation. Therefore governments have adopted urban containment policies to deal with urban sprawl and to promote more sustainable development.</p>
<p>In this paper, three urban development scenarios have been developed for Istanbul to research the opportunities to create a more compact development pattern and to reduce urban sprawl. An attempt to enable the market feasibly to shift the development from the peripheral areas to the central areas has been put forward by setting certain spatial strategies.</p>
<p>The business-as-usual scenario is found not to be sufficient to promote compact development; however, the conservative scenario has a strong impact on reducing urban sprawl through limiting new development at the periphery to protect agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas. The conservative scenario, which requires the implementation of an urban growth boundary, density restrictions at the periphery and an additional infrastructure cost for new development in peripheral areas, has a 62 per cent positive impact on controlling sprawl.</p>
<p>The compact scenario has created more feasible conditions in central areas which would successfully redistribute development from urban fringe areas towards more central locations. Redistributing development towards more central locations also helps the redevelopment of existing urban areas. It can be interpreted that this scenario has a 47 per cent positive impact on creating more compact development compared with the business-as-usual scenario.</p>
<p>Achieving more compact urban development and controlled growth necessitates political agreement on planning and zoning objectives and the means of implementing them, as well as the control of unauthorised and uncontrolled developments.</p>
<p>This paper attempts to underline that controlling urban development processes, driven by market forces and master plans, is essential to promote sustainable urban development, especially under conditions of rapid urban population growth. The findings show the possibilities of alleviating urban sprawl effects at the metropolitan level. In addition, the quantitative methodology provided in the paper can be useful for metropolitan and regional-level administrations to arrange public policies to control urban sprawl. These policies can focus on urban compaction which increases the amount of open space consumed by current urbanisation processes. Since urban development is a dynamic processes, policy-makers, geographers and urban planners are required to monitor developments—for example, by using a sprawl index—and to intervene in the market—for example, providing development scenarios where necessary. Fundamental to the attainment of the future plan’s objectives, there should be a mix of policy initiatives including the re-use of brownfield land, avoidance of expansion and improvement of public transport at the metropolitan, regional and national levels.</p>
