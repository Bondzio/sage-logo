<p>In 2011, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder announced their support of a new initiative that seeks to address the school-to-prison pipeline, the sickening network of federal, state, and local policies that push children of color (predominantly) out of schools and into the criminal justice system. The initiative made national news as the <italic>Huffington Post</italic> and <italic>Education Week</italic> reported that Duncan and Holder’s support “comes amid questions surrounding whether school disciplinary policies are yielding their desired and intended results” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912452697">“Duncan and Holder,” July 21, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The school-to-prison pipeline may have been surprising and disturbing news for Duncan and Holder, but for sociologist Victor Rios, author of <italic>Punished: Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys</italic>, the criminalizing tendency of schools and many other social institutions is most certainly not surprising. Tracing the lives of several young men in and out of the criminal justice system in Oakland, California, Rios thoughtfully and insightfully documents critical components of the school-to-prison pipeline in this book.</p>
<p><italic>Punished</italic> explores the grave consequences of the culture of “punitive social control,” whereby young Black and Latino men are routinely criminalized by their schools, community centers, police, probation officers, parents, peers and even, sometimes, themselves. Rios establishes that Oakland, not unlike many American cities, has a long history of controlling its “racialized populations through punitive force” (p. 30). This phenomenon has emerged as a central part of Oakland’s social order, “a fabric of everyday life” for Black and Latino youth, where young men are “policed, punished and harassed” in all aspects of their lives (p. 27). This societal tendency toward criminalization has a powerful effect on the psyche of young men, forcing them to develop strategies, sometimes self destructive, to counteract the hostile, controlled, and punitive environment. Although Rios does not explicitly and solely focus on schools as his unit of observation, schools are clearly implicated in his work. Rios demonstrates that schools are one of the primary platforms for the punitive control of young people.</p>
<p>Rios investigates, from a structuralist perspective, the relationship of current institutional policies that favor discipline and punishment to the rise of disaffected youth and increased incarceration rates. He is also careful to acknowledge and document the individual agency of many of his 40 research participants, relying on detailed field notes and anecdotal observations to substantiate his findings about the effect of larger social structures on the lives of young Black and Latino men. He divides his work into two parts: first, an exploration of the conditions and circumstances of the social control complex, followed by a rich description of the consequences of this system and responses by the boys in his study to this oppressive structure.</p>
<p>His central argument unfolds with a rejection of many commonly held views about the intersection of adolescence, the state, community, violence, and crime. He asserts persuasively that the “state had not abandoned the poor; it had reorganized itself, placing priority on punitive institutions, such as police and embedding crime-control discourses and practices into welfare institutions, such as schools” (p. xiii). At times though, perhaps as a result of his intention to focus on the complicated and powerful system of “punitive social control,” his argument hinges on this system as the solitary and most pressing cause of injustice. So while schools remain thoroughly implicated in the system of punitive social control, Rios does not fully explore education as one of the primary sites of this system.</p>
<p>In the preface, Rios introduces himself as a product of the environment that he seeks to study as both a cultural “insider” and a social and academic “outsider.” Rios’ unusual capability as a scholar to witness and share the experiences of his subjects affords him, and his readers, a closer look at his research. In fact, during the course of his ethnographic “shadowing,” Rios is stopped and questioned, handcuffed, and arrested along with his research participants, thus underscoring the effectiveness of his liminal space. During one such field visit, Rios is talking with a few of his principal research participants in a neighborhood park when they are approached by two police officers. He writes,
<disp-quote><p>All of us . . . pulled our hands out of our pockets and stood in a position of submission, with our hands open to show that we didn’t have a weapon on us, with our eyes looking at the ground to exhibit a nonthreatening stance, and with our bodies slouched over to show that we were not in a position to run away . . . After a few seconds of silence, I turned around to face the officer, looking him in the eyes; he reacted by yelling, “Get the fuck back on the wall . . . he handcuffed me and threw me in the car . . .” (pp. 125-126)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this instance, Rios is himself a valuable source of sociological data. As a target of police suspicion, Rios is forced to negotiate between his desire to protect his research participants from unlawful police stops, avoid his own arrest, and collect data. He also observes that the freedom and joy of spending time with friends in a local park was not possible for him or his subjects as a result of their age, race, and class.</p>
<p>In the first section of the book, Rios shares some of his reminiscences about his youth and his unlikely avoidance of death or prison time, including the traumatic death of his best friend, Smiley. At the age of 15, Smiley was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in “The Flats,” a neighborhood in East Oakland that also carries the terrifying moniker “The Killing Fields.” The police refused to investigate Smiley’s death, reporting callously that they were waiting for the young men of color of Oakland to “kill each other off” (p. xi). Rios credits this moment for his desire to seek answers to the problems of youth and police violence.</p>
<p>This moment, along with the advice and support of two mentors, Ms. Russ and Officer Wilson, gave Rios access to the “pipeline of opportunities” that street-oriented youths need to make more positive choices for their lives. Rios is struck by the fact that he—with his academic and personal success—is the exception to the rules that govern the lives of young men. The author’s close relationships with his research participants and investment in his subject matter clearly fuel his desire to document and resist the mainstream narrative about poverty, crime, and youth. His work, therefore, has the difficult yet admirable quality of existing not entirely in the scholarly realm.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452697"><italic>Street Life: Poverty, Gangs and a Ph.D.</italic> (2011)</xref>, published as a companion to <italic>Punished</italic> and intended for an adolescent audience, tells the story of Rios’ coming of age and educational highs and lows. Demonstrating his distaste for the cold distancing nature of academia, Rios fashions <italic>Street Life</italic> as a provocative story designed to encourage and inspire. As such, it is entirely suitable and a genuine resource for urban educators and students alike.</p>
<p>In <italic>Street Life</italic>, Rios avoids trafficking in trite stories of easy redemption or the pitfalls of a childhood marked by urban poverty, and instead reflects on his coming of age with honest and digestible anecdotes. For example, on the allure of older gangsters, Rios writes,
<disp-quote><p>I wanted to be like them because they had power, money, girls and protection. I knew I shouldn’t want this; I knew that it was irresponsible to join the gang. I confronted a paradox. On the one hand, I needed to avoid these gangsters in order to protect myself from failing in the future. On the other hand, these guys offered protection that no other group of people had ever offered me, not my teachers, not my mother, not the police. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452697">2011</xref>, p. 41)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In <italic>Street Life</italic>, Rios allows himself to explore his particular circumstances and saves his theoretical frameworks and research conclusions for <italic>Punished</italic>.</p>
<p>In the first half of <italic>Punished</italic>, Rios documents the contributing factors and explains how and why the majority of young Black and Latino men succumb to the “pervasive phenomenon” of petty arrests leading to more substantial charges and lengthy prison sentences. Rios’ subjects have been consistently criminalized, disrespected, and misunderstood, usually beginning at a very young age.</p>
<p>Tyrell, one of Rios’ particularly engaging participants, describes how a growth spurt and personal charisma in elementary school led to his being seen as a threat by teachers and police alike. Jose, who by the end of the book is serving a 5-year sentence at San Quentin State Prison, (California’s only facility for carrying out the death penalty) reported the harrowing experience of being handcuffed by city police after he had lit a bathroom garbage can on fire. He was 8 years old. The vilification by adults in authority played a major role in Tyrell and Jose’s conscious choice to begin selling drugs and acting the part. Jose was forever treated, after this incident, as “the kid who had been arrested” and he performed to meet those violent, disruptive, and criminal expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452697">Rios, 2011</xref>, p. 58). He failed that school year and several subsequent years and would spend most of his time in school either in detention or isolated from his peers. This is one of many examples of how punitive social control within the school system can place students of color on a trajectory of incarceration instead of graduation.</p>
<p>Rios found that community centers also carry out this mission of punitive social control of youth. Budgetary constraints and misguided priorities have led some community centers to be ceded to the criminal justice system. Probation officers use them as home-away-from-home offices, routinely scheduling probationary visits and conferences in them. What makes this practice even more problematic is that community organizations are some of the few remaining social institutions outside of public schools and churches. Many research participants avoided the community centers altogether because they were associated with the criminal justice system. By even entering a community center, a young Black or Latino man was potentially signaling to the community that he had legal problems or was on probation. In some cases, the community centers subsisted on funding from the county probation department, thereby compromising their goals to serve the authentic needs of the community by replacing the traditional objectives with county mandates and oversight.</p>
<p>For Rios, probation officers are incapable of addressing the realities of their young charges’ lives, offering unrealistic, unattainable, and at times, inappropriate guidance and restrictions. In an extreme case, Deandre is arrested by his probation officer after he has failed the difficult conditions of his probation: he was required to pass all of his classes, get a job, and not associate with any of his former friends. His arrest leads to an often overlooked intersection with low academic outcomes. Because he served time in juvenile hall, he missed more than 2 weeks of school and thus failed for the semester. He applied for 12 jobs and was rejected in every one of these efforts; as Rios observes, this was a direct result of Deandre’s lack of cultural capital and education regarding interviewing skills and professional behavior and dress. Finally, Deandre’s home address had not changed. Therefore, despite his attempts to distance himself from his family members and friends who were involved in criminal activity both inside and outside of school, it was impossible for him to entirely disassociate and disentangle himself from his long-standing and enduring relationships. Deandre’s arrest is one example of how probation officers reinforced a punitive climate of social control.</p>
<p>In the second half of the book, Rios capably describes how his research participants responded to and resisted the strict limitations of their particular entrapment in the networks and culture of punitive social control. In many instances, the boys developed deviant behaviors, including breaking rules, not adhering to mainstream social norms, and committing crimes. This deviance quickly becomes habitual and firmly rooted in their sense of self and belonging. In today’s educational contexts, this deviance couples with widespread school disciplinary procedures that increasingly employ zero-tolerance policies and strict reliance on law enforcement to handle trivial school misconduct. The consequences for minor school infractions are severe, resulting in skyrocketing numbers of school suspensions, expulsions, and arrests which, as the research indicates, disproportionately affect young men of color.</p>
<p>For example, Mike resists a store clerk’s suspicion and, after a “face-off” with him, steals a 25-cent bag of chips. He is later arrested, released on probation, and seems entirely comfortable with his decision to commit such a petty crime. Rios explains, in highly convincing detail, Mike’s seemingly irrational decision to steal in the following way: “Mike gained a sense of dignity for himself and his peers which . . . made it worth exchanging his freedom” (p. 107). Young men choose to act “bad” as a conscious choice to refute a system which routinely treats and punishes them unfairly, thus creating a system of interactions that promote and maintain deviant behaviors. This system of interactions is alive in our schools—as reported by the American Civil Liberties Union and others—where students are routinely punished by arrest for “throwing an eraser at a teacher, breaking a pencil, having rap lyrics in a locker” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912452697">“School-to-Prison Pipeline,” 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Legal scholar and civil rights attorney Michelle Alexander’s recently released book <italic>The New Jim Crow</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912452697">2010</xref>) provides a good companion to Rios’ work, tackling the issue of a criminalized racial caste system and hierarchy and characterizing the current rates of incarceration of African American men as a new iteration of racialized social control. Alexander’s study traces the origins of mass incarceration, emphasizing the “War on Drugs” policies of the 1980s and 1990s, sensationalized media reports on urban drug use, and the civil rights community turning a deaf ear to the exponential and disproportionate growth of incarcerated African American men as the primary cause for America’s skyrocketing prison rosters. Alexander’s work complements Rios’: while Alexander challenges the notion of “post-racial” and demonstrates how the system came about in the first place, Rios pinpoints the specific events in young men’s lives that lead to a life that is marked by prison time and probationary periods rather than school time and periods of academic discovery.</p>
<p>The work of Elijah Anderson, sociologist and author of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912452697"><italic>Code of the Street: Decency, Violence and the Moral Life of the Inner City</italic> (2000)</xref>, frequently cited by Rios, also provides a good complement. Anderson agrees that this urban reality and associated behaviors are a product of the widespread alienation from lack of trust in, and failure of, state and local institutions and organizations. The “code of the street,” a complex and rational system of responses by urban youth, “emerges where the influence of the police ends and where personal responsibility for one’s safety is felt to begin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912452697">Anderson, 2000</xref>, p. 34). Rios effectively complicates Anderson’s argument by adding that these same young men are not offered a wide array of “masculinity-making resources” in this era of punitive social control. Instead his research participants learn to depend on strategies of routinized defiance and hyper masculinity. For example, 18-year-old Franky was the head of his household and, after months of saving, is finally able to afford a car for his mother. After an unreasonable request from an aggressive police officer to turn on the lights of his parked car (the car was already parked and headlights would be unnecessary), the police officer pointed a gun at his mother. Franky responded instinctively and pushed the police officer. He was swiftly arrested and his car was impounded. Franky reported,
<disp-quote><p>I was in jail for four months, and they took the car away for thirty days. I had to leave it there because it cost more to take it out than what I paid—the only car my family had. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452697">Rios, 2011</xref>, p. 137)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Rios notes that there is nothing in Franky’s experience that would lead him to believe that if he applied himself more in school or if he had a higher GPA he would have been treated better by the police.</p>
<p>Through this example and others, Rios reinterprets and makes a significant and creative contribution to the literature. He describes J. T.’s strong “navigational skills” that allow him to evade criminalization by leaving his friends at the precise moment when he felt as if it was the “time [when] fools get arrested” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452697">2011</xref>, p. 146). Noting that J. T.’s choices are extremely limited, Rios highlights the intersection of adolescent adaptive behavior and misguided criminal justice policy by acknowledging that J.T. has developed strategies to cope with a hypermasculinized environment. While he avoids arrest, J. T. does not evade the “stigma, exclusion, and punishment” of his peers. And, because being young, male, and Latino in urban Oakland is inherently risky, J.T. also cannot avoid confrontations and arrest by the police. J.T. cannot succeed in most of his endeavors in this restrictive, punitive, and hypermasculinized environment. In the same way, schools are often sites of female power and thus unfavorably looked on by the kinds of people from whom young men draw respect. Because schools often do not provide a space for the healthy development of masculinity, masculine behaviors developed in less healthy contexts may become dominant. Unfortunately, those masculine behaviors that appear adaptive outside of school are less adaptive within school walls.</p>
<p>Rios documents the existing landscape of literature in criminology, sociology, economics, psychology, and history to create a broad theoretical framework that roots this research firmly in theory. Yet this review of the scholarly literature has the effect of leading the reader to consider whether Rios knew the answers to his research questions before he conducted his study. At times, one is left to ponder what was truly surprising about Rios’ findings. In addition, Rios leaves his readers to question if his argument would have been more reliable if his intelligent social critique was more expansive and nuanced, probing more deeply, for example, into the realities of social control inside Oakland’s schools.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <italic>Punished: Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys</italic> has immediate relevance for the urban educator and was written explicitly to encourage educators to “change punitive practices and establish genuine caring relationships with these youngsters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452697">2011</xref>, p. xvi). Rios imagines that an alternative method to nurturing, guiding, and teaching young men is possible. While exploring the lives of young men, primarily outside of schools, Rios establishes a firm foundation of understanding how the criminal justice system is firmly embedded in their lives. His work corroborates the disturbing research on the school-to-prison pipeline and implies how schools are thoroughly implicated in this process. Rios inspires urban educators to question and challenge their complicity in the complex of punitive social control. As such, his message is simultaneously intellectually rich, politically demanding, and inspirational. Through clearly written prose, thoroughly explicated research, and a sophisticated inquiry into the landscape of punitive social control, Rios advocates for courage and compassion from educators. At the same time, he demonstrates that resistance against the reigning criminal justice system is possible and necessary.</p>
