<abstract>
<p>The range of roles and activities undertaken by peak union bodies has recently been conceptualized by Ellem and Shields. This article uses their framework to discuss industrial agency in an Australian regional peak union council. An examination of two locally significant industrial campaigns using historical data specifically considers the impact of the industrial identity developed within the particular locale. These campaigns support the proposal that regional peak union council agency is determined by the geographic and social relationships resulting from local industrial history. In addition, in order to achieve successful outcomes for campaigns, even over local issues, forms of agency should be flexible and operate across scales. This article concludes that extending the Ellem and Shields framework to include more explicit consideration of locale and specific industrial identity as a mediating factor enables a greater understanding of not only the possible roles and functions of, but also those developed in practice by, regional peak union bodies.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185611432387" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peak union bodies have been defined as ‘permanent inter-union organizations directed at furthering defined or assumed common interests or objectives by means of jointly determined strategies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 1996</xref>: 377), providing a means for unions to work together towards ‘common cause’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185611432387">Brigden, 1996</xref>: 365). However, while peak union bodies in Australia operate at a range of scales, interest in peak union power and purpose has only recently emerged in the academic literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185611432387">Brigden, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185611432387">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185611432387">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185611432387">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185611432387">Rathmell, 2007</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields (2004b)</xref>, building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185611432387">Briggs (1999)</xref>, have conceptualized both the actual and the potential roles of peak bodies. This significant theorization of peak union body roles and activities has been used in recent literature on regional trades and labour councils (RTLCs) (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185611432387">Bailey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185611432387">Markey and Nixon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185611432387">Rittau, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These local peak union bodies have pursued a range of agency roles and issues (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185611432387">Nixon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185611432387">Rittau, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185611432387">Webster, 1999</xref>). Despite this, the specific impact of location in relation to the role and function of RTLCs has not been well theorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 2004b</xref>: 39). Rather, place consciousness or identity is an element that has generally been assumed, rather than been made explicit, in RTLC agency.</p>
<p>This article aims to more explicitly locate place and place identity within any consideration of RTLC agency. This will be done through a discussion of two lengthy campaigns in which a particular RTLC, the Gippsland Trades and Labour Council (GTLC),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185611432387">1</xref></sup> was involved.</p>
<p>This article contributes to the literature on peak union agency by explicitly considering RTLC roles within the industrial history and identities that develop from a specific location. It also provides a contribution to the sparse literature on the ‘fourth level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185611432387">Eather, 2004</xref>) of peak union bodies in Victoria, neglected despite their sometimes significant role in local industrial history.</p>
<p>The article begins with a brief description of the theoretical framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields (2004b)</xref>. The influence of place and work on the formation of industrial identity is then discussed. This is followed by a brief overview of the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, and the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) and its relationship with the GTLC. The examination of two of the major industrial campaigns with which the GTLC was involved will allow for the exploration of the actual roles of this RTLC as they were influenced by the industrial identities that had developed around a particular location. This will support the argument that place, which determines the local industrial history and thus the specific industrial identity, requires explicit consideration when considering actual RTLC agency.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185611432387"><title>Theorizing Agency in Regional Trades and Labour Councils</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields (2004b)</xref> have proposed a model of peak union agency that describes three possible types of agency (mobilization, exchange and regulation), each of which can manifest itself in three modes (industrial, political and social) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185611432387">Table 1</xref>). The resulting matrix attempts to analyse and categorize both the actual and the possible range of activities and roles for peak bodies in order to better understand such peak union bodies’ existence, diversity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 2004b</xref>: 32).

</table-wrap></p>
<p>The first type of agency, mobilization, is defined as ‘activity directed towards defining and furthering the “common interests” of affiliate unions, their members and the social formations of which those members are deemed to be a part’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 2004b</xref>: 43). Second, the peak body may also act as an agent of external change and/or representation, that is, it may act as a representative of affiliates in collective dealings with external bodies such as governments and/or employer bodies. The third type of agency in the model is regulation, that is, in the formulation and enforcement of rules, restrictions and penalties that affect its affiliates and their members. The effect of tension between (internal) ‘power over’ and (external) ‘power for’ affiliates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185611432387">Hyman, 1975</xref>: 65) is perhaps most likely to be seen when the peak body acts in this type of agency.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields (2004b: 40)</xref> have suggested that agency roles of RTLCs are more obviously affected by place consciousness than is the case for higher-order peak councils because of the links that regional peak union councils have to the local area. RTLCs are part of ‘the ideas and social practices of working-class families, residential networks and local labour organizations and in a sharing, or enforcement, of these ideas more widely in a particular space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields, 2004b</xref>: 48). Thus, RTLCs may be more influential than state and national peak bodies at a given time because the locally specific nature of the labour market emphasizes the relevance of unions and thus creates greater cohesion among the union rank and file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185611432387">Herod, 1998</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>Work itself provides a social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185611432387">Budd and Bhave, 2008</xref>: 96). Further, workers, as well as workplaces, are usually embedded in a particular location, resulting in ‘lasting local communities and cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432387">Storper and Walker, 1989</xref>: 157). The social and geographic relationships between workplace and community, and between employer and employee, then lead to the development of particular industrial traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185611432387">Darlington, 2005</xref>). These shape the decision-making and actions of both employers and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185611432387">Herod et al., 2003</xref>: 184), and affect how quickly places adapt to the need for different relationships, expectations and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185611432387">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>: 106) when constraints imposed by legacy relationships are no longer appropriate.</p>
<p>These social relationships and interactions combine to form a specific local culture or identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185611432387">Herod, 2001</xref>: 33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185611432387">Massey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185611432387">Wills, 1996</xref>). Such identities help to provide a worker’s sense of self and solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185611432387">Castree, 2010</xref>: 473), with perceptions of self, the group and ‘others’ affecting all local organizations, including RTLCs. A key part of the importance of place lies in its focus on worker agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185611432387">Castree, 2010</xref>: 459). Common aspirations and patterns of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185611432387">Rainnie et al., 2010</xref>: 252) may result from the shared history and geography, with conformity to group norms reinforcing worker allegiance to a particular local identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185611432387">Taksa, 2000</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Place has been acknowledged as a central aspect in considering work, employment and industrial relations (for a comprehensive overview of this literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185611432387">McGrath-Champ et al., 2010</xref>). It then follows that it is also important when considering the roles of local peak union councils. Since place is socially constructed by activities at both local and wider scales, it reflects a specific series of social relationships and the development of a particular industrial identity that will frame industrial relations. Thus the actual roles that RTLCs develop will reflect the constraints (or freedoms) resulting from the particular locale and its attendant historically developed network of relationships.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185611432387"><title>A Note on Method</title>
<p>The GTLC has been operating in the Latrobe Valley for some 80 years. Despite this, relatively little has been written about specific campaigns with which it has been involved. Such material as does exist is useful in locating the GTLC within its industrial context. However, much of the detailed information on the campaigns is only available from primary documentary sources. Those records relating to the GTLC are held by the GTLC office in Morwell, Victoria. Records of the SECV, the VTHC and a number of the unions involved are available in the University of Melbourne Archives and the Public Record Office, Victoria. Contemporary descriptions of the campaigns were also sourced from the <italic>Latrobe Valley Express</italic> and Melbourne metropolitan newspapers. The specific items used from these sources are cited in the endnotes.</p>
<p>This article considers only two campaigns, and a larger selection of examples would assist to make the conclusions more generalizable to both this particular RTLC and to other RTLCs. In addition, a longitudinal study investigating the effect of significant changes to local industrial relationships on RTLC agency over time would provide additional insights.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185611432387"><title>The Latrobe Valley, the SECV and the GTLC</title>
<p>The Latrobe Valley is about 150 km east of Melbourne, Victoria. The SECV, the state-owned monopoly responsible for electricity generation and distribution in the state of Victoria until the early 1990s, was established there after the First World War. The first power stations were built at Yallourn from the 1920s, followed by newer and larger power stations at Morwell and Hazelwood in the surrounding area after the Second World War. The Latrobe Valley became a new industrial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432387">Fletcher, 2002</xref>: 137), with the SECV as the largest employer.</p>
<p>The distance from Melbourne, and the need to improve the poor working conditions in the early years, encouraged local industrial action, often unsanctioned, over local issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185611432387">2</xref></sup> A strong and well-organized shop steward network within the local SECV contributed to its particular industrial relations climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432387">Benson, 1991</xref>: 8), and it developed a reputation for collective strength and militancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185611432387">Fairbrother and Testi, 2002</xref>: 104). The pattern of local action, together with the paternalistic management style within the SECV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185611432387">Serle, 1982</xref>: 457), was established by the time the GTLC was formed in the early 1930s, and it remained a feature of the industrial relationship between the unions and the SECV. The local industrial identity was reinforced by an often-troubled relationship between the unions, the GTLC and the Victorian Trades Hall Council (VTHC).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185611432387">3</xref></sup> This was due in part to a reluctance to acknowledge VTHC jurisdiction by the GTLC, which had claimed autonomy in the handling of local disputes in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185611432387">Plowman, 1979</xref>: 51).</p>
<p>During the 1980s, about 90% of the SECV’s 9000 Latrobe Valley employees belonged to one of six major unions represented there: Municipal Officers’ Association (MOA), Association of Professional Engineers, Australia (APEA) and Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen’s Association (FEDFA), and three of the maintenance unions – the Amalgamated Metal Workers’ Union (AMWU), Electrical Trades Union (ETU) and Federated Ironworkers’ Association (FIA). Overall, union density was more than 95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432387">Benson, 1991</xref>: 9). By the end of 1985, 16 of the 20 unions operating in the SECV were affiliated with the GTLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432387">Benson, 1991</xref>: 98), and an SECV subcommittee provided a focus and coordinating role for union organization and activity. Until the late 1980s, unions and the GTLC were ‘incorporated’ within the SECV organizational framework, through meetings and membership of joint committees and working parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185611432387">Benson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185611432387">Pullin and Haidar, 2002</xref>: 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185611432387">Steel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The GTLC was involved in a range of roles across industrial, political and social agency (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185611432387">Table 1</xref>). The following sections describe two lengthy campaigns of the GTLC, with activity culminating in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the GTLC was arguably at the peak of its influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185611432387">Pullin, 1993</xref>: 16). The two campaigns that will be described focus on industrial agency, but also demonstrate the importance of both political and social agency in significant campaigns.</p>
<p>These two campaigns have been selected on the basis of their significance for, and their impact on, the local industrial climate at the time, particularly for the maintenance unions. The issues involved were long-standing. The first issue, the common award campaign, had a lower profile but was nevertheless a long-standing issue. A common award was viewed as one way to ensure common employment conditions and the retention of wage relativities across classifications within the SECV. The second issue, contract labour, had been contentious for the maintenance unions over a period of about 40 years. Behind the issue lay concerns that the SECV wished to use contract labour for maintenance work at the expense of its day workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432387">Rosenthal and Russ, 1988</xref>: 129). These two campaigns demonstrate the use of agency of various types and modes, as well as at different spatial scales, in order to move towards the desired outcome.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185611432387"><title>Campaign A: The Common Award Campaign</title>
<p>Obtaining a single award for the power industry had been a long-standing issue for the GTLC and the unions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185611432387">4</xref></sup> and it had been a claim in at least one major dispute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185611432387">Benson and Goff, 1979</xref>). The VTHC had first raised the possibility of an award to cover all SECV maintenance employees in 1957, with the SECV giving ‘cautious acceptance in principle’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022185611432387">5</xref></sup> However, the SECV’s offer of a consent award was rejected by the unions in 1960 over the issue of increased margins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022185611432387">6</xref></sup> Later, during the 1960s and 1970s, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (ACAC) on several occasions had suggested that a power industry or SECV award should be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022185611432387">7</xref></sup> A lengthy dispute began in 1977 with the GTLC on behalf of Latrobe Valley SECV maintenance workers serving a log of claims that included a proposal for a common award. This proposal was not supported by all of the state or federal branches of the unions involved in the dispute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022185611432387">8</xref></sup> The ensuing 11-week strike from August that year was well supported by the local community, as well as more broadly. This was despite the SECV imposing extensive power restrictions for more than four weeks, and the Victorian Premier declaring a state of emergency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185611432387">Benson and Goff, 1979</xref>). However, when the dispute went to the ACAC, Commissioner Mansini rejected the proposal for a common award,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022185611432387">9</xref></sup> and a mass meeting of the maintenance workers voted not to take further industrial action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022185611432387">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, the proposal was broadened to encompass the creation of a Power Industry Agreement, which would provide consistent treatment of all employees in the Victorian power industry. This ushered in a long period of negotiations between the VTHC, GTLC, SECV, unions and the state government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022185611432387">11</xref></sup> Input from the latter was required because the SECV, as a statutory authority, was constrained in its ability to negotiate independently over wages and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185611432387">Benson and Hince, 1987</xref>: 141). The VTHC, rather than the GTLC, remained the lead organization in negotiations once exchange moved beyond the local scale to involve the state branches of the unions and the state government.</p>
<p>The political context had changed significantly in 1982 with the election of a Labor state government, providing increased opportunities for political exchange and union influence on political regulation. A prices and incomes Accord between the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party was implemented when federal Labor came to office in 1983. The unions and, by extension, the VTHC were thus constrained by the Accord when negotiating wages or conditions improvements.</p>
<p>By 1983, many of the unions with members in the SECV operated under an SECV-specific award or agreement,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022185611432387">12</xref></sup> and about 88% of the Latrobe Valley workforce was covered by three federal awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432387">Benson, 1991</xref>: 8–9). The SECV proposed a single agreement that would establish new classifications and broad banding arrangements<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022185611432387">13</xref></sup> and incorporate all award pay rates and conditions in one document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185611432387">SECV, 1983</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>The draft industry agreement of December 1983, covering 23 unions, went before the ACAC in 1984 for consideration of alleged anomalies in proposed classifications and payments. These related to some experience payments, the nature of the supervisory structure and some of the metal industry classifications. This hearing on the draft agreement was despite opposition from a number of key unions, including the ETU, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) and the FEDFA,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022185611432387">14</xref></sup> which did not wish wage rates to be incorporated into any Power Industry Agreement. The unions could still not present a united view on this issue, despite impetus coming from both the local level, seeking a single award, and negotiations occurring at the state level. The GTLC continued to inform the local community of progress, via the local newspaper, arguing that any Power Industry Agreement would maintain relativities and reduce anomalies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022185611432387">15</xref></sup> The ACAC, however, expressed concern over the lack of unity, noting that any industry approach to the setting of wages and conditions would only be meaningful if all the key unions were committed parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022185611432387">16</xref></sup> As there was significant opposition to incorporating wage rates in the document, the approach agreed on with the SECV when the next round of negotiations commenced under the auspices of the VTHC in 1986<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022185611432387">17</xref></sup> involved working towards a Common Conditions of Employment consent award, which later became an agreement on common conditions to be inserted into the relevant awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185611432387">SECV, 1986</xref>: 54). This compromise was an attempt to retain unity among the unions at both local and state scales.</p>
<p>By 1987, significant progress had been made. The agreed approach consolidated conditions of employment in the industry and rationalized existing customs and practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022185611432387">18</xref></sup> By June 1988, the five SECV awards that contained conditions of employment<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022185611432387">19</xref></sup> were ready, with approval of the state government, to go to the ACAC for ratification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022185611432387">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>By this time, the political context had again changed significantly. The Labor government in Victoria had started the process of corporatizing the SECV, which would be privatized in the early 1990s. This impacted on the options available to both the SECV and the VTHC. However, the advent later in 1988<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022185611432387">21</xref></sup> of award restructuring as the basis of wage increases reopened negotiations with the unions, GTLC and VTHC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022185611432387">22</xref></sup> The GTLC was formally represented on the union consultative committee, continuing the bi-scalar communication process with the VTHC. While the GTLC and the unions were committed to working towards a single award and a wages increase,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022185611432387">23</xref></sup> the SECV preference was to negotiate on an award-by-award basis. At this time, the SECV was proposing to restructure the state’s electricity industry in such a way that there were likely to be massive job losses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022185611432387">24</xref></sup> The SECV also became more proactive in its handling of industrial relations, heralding a significant change in the local industrial context and relationships. Individual unions became more concerned with protecting themselves and their membership than with making ‘common cause’ with other affected unions.</p>
<p>In September 1989, the MOA (Energy Branch) and the SECV agreed on a new award to be ratified by the ACAC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022185611432387">25</xref></sup> When word of this spread, the ETU became a respondent to the new award (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185611432387">Purdham, 2002</xref>: 171). This was despite the VTHC insistence that all unions would negotiate as one group,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022185611432387">26</xref></sup> and was condemned as an attempt to divide and conquer the unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022185611432387">27</xref></sup> The loss of two major unions from the umbrella bargaining of the GTLC and the VTHC prompted a flood of furious responses from the local unions and the GTLC. Coverage of the issue in the <italic>Latrobe Valley Express</italic> became extensive and ongoing. Industrial action was threatened and, in the ACAC, the excluded unions argued against ratification of the award, expressing their preference for a single award across the SECV.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022185611432387">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>This campaign provides an example of industrial agency that focused on exchange between the GTLC, VTHC and the SECV at the state level. While the issue arose at the local scale, it affected SECV employees state-wide and thus required the input and agreement of the unions at state level. This meant that the scale for negotiations between the unions, the state government and the SECV was at the state level, that is, via the VTHC. The control of the VTHC in negotiations on this campaign was almost complete, and the state government was involved in the exchange process at all times. This illustrates the importance of the political environment at this time, as well as the constraints on the SECV. There was little opportunity or need for industrial mobilization until the loss of unity near the end of the campaign. The expectation that a peak union body would be able to achieve common aims for its affiliates was subject to each affiliate accepting the former’s right to lead such campaigns. This particular issue had divided the unions in earlier years and continued to be divisive. While the GTLC could not always rely on the support of its affiliates to progress common aims, in this instance the lack of unity was also at the state scale. The GTLC kept the Latrobe Valley unions informed, but it could only influence the process by exchange at the state scale. The significant change in the local context, caused by the prospect of restructuring, fractured the Latrobe Valley unions’ industrial identity and adherence to norms of solidarity. This resulted in withdrawal from the ‘common cause’ waged by the GTLC in favour of the agendas of smaller and more cohesive subgroup identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185611432387">Ettlinger, 2002</xref>). In contrast, significant changes to the federal context, such as the Accord and wage indexation, had less effect on the larger group identity because they were more likely to have a common effect on all union-sanctioned action, rather than affecting only particular subgroups of unions.</p>
<p>The next campaign discussed is that over contract labour. This was a very different type of campaign, with greater emphasis on industrial agency focused on mobilization and greater control by the local organizations and rank and file. This campaign was for the most part waged at the local scale, and was thus generally under the control of the shop stewards and the GTLC.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185611432387"><title>Campaign B: The Contract Labour Agreement Campaign</title>
<p>A long-standing area of disputation between the Latrobe Valley maintenance unions, the GTLC and the SECV was over the use of contract labour. While permanent staff had traditionally performed maintenance work, the Latrobe Valley unions and the GTLC believed that the SECV’s ultimate aim was to contract out all maintenance work, leading inevitably to a reduction of the permanent workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432387">Rosenthal and Russ, 1988</xref>: 129). It was an emotive issue since these job losses would impact on the local community, which was largely dependent on the SECV for employment. The shop stewards from the maintenance unions were therefore adamant that there should be full use of the day workforce prior to letting maintenance work to contract.</p>
<p>The origins of the Contract Labour Agreement lay in a long-standing preference of the GTLC,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022185611432387">29</xref></sup> which became policy in 1968, that maintenance work previously carried out by SECV day labour should continue to be carried out by SECV day labour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022185611432387">30</xref></sup> This policy had been reinforced since the early 1970s by annual negotiations between representatives from local trade unions, the GTLC and the SECV, and supported on the unions’ part by mass meetings and bans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022185611432387">31</xref></sup> The VTHC had early supported moves by Latrobe Valley unions and the GTLC to enforce the use of day labour as much as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022185611432387">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In March 1977, the issue was once again brought to a head. The building trades unions refused to discuss the works programme proposed by the SECV and bans were placed on the contracted work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022185611432387">33</xref></sup> A hearing in the ACAC before Commissioner Vosti resulted in what became known as the ‘Vosti principles’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022185611432387">34</xref></sup> which required negotiations between the SECV and the GTLC on works to be let to contract.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022185611432387">35</xref></sup> However, disputes over the use of contract labour continued, and the SECV continued to ask for the VTHC, rather than the GTLC, to lead the negotiations on behalf of the unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022185611432387">36</xref></sup> The GTLC was reluctant to permit this, since the issue was a local one, and local industrial mobilization and exchange had in the past been effective.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce industrial action around this issue, the GTLC, the VTHC, the SECV and 23 unions formalized the maintenance works programme process during 1985 and 1986, with the negotiation of the Contract Labour Agreement. Despite this having been a local issue coordinated by the GTLC, once the issue required the approval of the state branches of the affected unions, the scale of negotiations moved to the state level, that is, to the VTHC.</p>
<p>The GTLC became a signatory to the Agreement, which acknowledged and formalized the previous negotiation process with the GTLC. It provided for the provision of information to unions prior to contract decisions being made via a committee comprised equally of SECV and union representatives, as well as for a consultative process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022185611432387">37</xref></sup> This collective negotiation retained a united front and frustrated management attempts to introduce change concerning the amount of work to be let out under contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185611432387">Pullin and Haidar, 2002</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>However, the unions and the GTLC continued to be concerned about the interpretation of the Agreement, and the SECV acknowledged that the Agreement could work better.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022185611432387">38</xref></sup> Bans and other limitations continued to be in place in the Latrobe Valley on a regular basis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022185611432387">39</xref></sup> The unions had advised the (Labor) state government of the issue and Premier Joan Kirner had given her commitment to the contract labour process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022185611432387">40</xref></sup> As a result, the SECV agreed in November 1991 to insert these contract labour procedures into relevant awards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022185611432387">41</xref></sup> A significant dispute relating to the contracting out of overburden removal occurred in the Latrobe Valley in early 1992, and the relevant state Minister and the Premier were again advised of peak council concerns about the contract labour process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022185611432387">42</xref></sup> The promised insertion of the contract labour procedures into awards had still not happened by April 1992, when 2500 SECV maintenance workers went on strike under the auspices of the GTLC. Picket lines were established and other SECV unions, not just in the Latrobe Valley, provided significant support to the maintenance unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022185611432387">43</xref></sup> The result was a significant threat to power supplies across the state.</p>
<p>Just a few days after the strike commenced, the condition of electricity generating plant was such that restrictions seemed likely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022185611432387">44</xref></sup> The GTLC reminded the Minister and the Premier of government commitments to the consultation process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022185611432387">45</xref></sup> When the SECV agreed that it would make an application to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to have the 1986 Agreement inserted into SECV awards,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022185611432387">46</xref></sup> the workers returned to work. The proceedings that commenced in the AIRC on 14 April 1992 later resulted in a revised form of the 1986 Agreement being inserted into all SECV awards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022185611432387">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>This contentious issue involving regulation of local labour resulted in an outcome that was acceptable to the unions, after a campaign coordinated by the GTLC that lasted decades. It had involved, in varying measures and at various times, industrial mobilization and exchange by the GTLC, as well as significant political exchange by both the VTHC and the GTLC. In addition, it confirmed the impact that industrial mobilization at the local scale may have on a broader scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185611432387">Herod, 2001</xref>: ch. 5), and the need to utilize political agency opportunities available through a Labor state government. Both the VTHC and the GTLC became proactive in political exchange during the latter part of the campaign. During this campaign, the unions demonstrated unity of purpose, supporting the local mobilization and exchange processes. This campaign demonstrated much greater involvement by the GTLC and the shop stewards, and a more subordinate role played by the VTHC, than in the previous campaign discussed. This may be largely due to the nature of the issue, which was both local and high-profile in the Latrobe Valley. However, the later involvement of the state branches of the unions meant that the scale of action required necessarily became broader than that which was possible for the GTLC to maintain successfully.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185611432387" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The two campaigns described demonstrate the effect of campaigns over local issues for GTLC agency. These issues resulted from the local industrial history, and developed around a large paternalistic employer tied to the Latrobe Valley, strong local union organization and a geography that encouraged separation from the Melbourne-based union officials and the VTHC. There was, however, recognition that sanctioned action at a broader scale was required for some local issues. The SECV, as a statutory authority, referred some issues to arbitration, while other issues required the agreement of the state or federal branches of the unions, which would only occur under the auspices of the VTHC. An issue around wages or conditions was likely to require agency at the state level for resolution, increasing the importance of broader political and industrial exchange. This reduced the opportunities for local mobilization and exchange. In contrast, an issue involving regulation of local labour practices could be coordinated within local networks, and through local rank-and-file action. If intervention at a wider scale was required, continued local action and support remained important. Political exchange at both local and state scales regardless of the issue was important, and was assisted when a Labor (state) government was in office. The media were also important for both local and wider scale exchange to relevant unions and the community, despite an inclination to emphasize possible industrial activity. While the GTLC preference was to manage local industrial issues across various scales, in practice the VTHC, the unions and the government saw the GTLC’s role as merely local, and the former assumed responsibility for negotiations.</p>
<p>While agency at the local level is important in maintaining local unity and focus, this account of the campaigns demonstrates that it is important for unions to deploy their industrial and political agency in a coordinated way across multiple scales. Local issues may have ramifications that extend to other scales, requiring multiple scales and multiple forms of agency to operate simultaneously. The two campaigns described illustrate the overlap and ease of flow between types and modes of agency. This facilitates the implementation of the appropriate industrial relations response, at the appropriate time and scale, in order to achieve the aims desired. The Ellem and Shields model is a guide to the forms and types of agency that may operate in conjunction with each other or individually as appropriate. The cells in the model may be viewed as porous, facilitating a transition or overlap as required across the types and modes of agency. This means that in practice the types and modes of agency proposed in the model allow for multiple options. The overlap in types of agency, in particular mobilization and exchange, mean that the importance of, or necessity for, a particular type or mode of agency may reach a peak during different phases of a campaign. The campaigns described have shown how agency may move from mobilization, which involves exchange activity to members as well as to the community, to industrial exchange at local as well as state scales, which may lead to both industrial and political mobilization as a consequence.</p>
<p>Peak union council agency may thus be viewed as a series of possibilities that are arranged along a scale of action, with those possible agencies dependent on the geographical and social relationships that make up the local industrial identity. The agencies utilized by a particular RTLC will depend on the scale of action required, the particular requirements of the campaign at a given time and the specific relationships, including those with other peak councils, which have developed as part of the local industrial identity.</p>
<p>This article has discussed two examples of significant local campaigns in order to argue for more explicit consideration of both place and scale within the theoretical framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432387">Ellem and Shields (2004b)</xref> for classifying peak union agency. Both are important: scale because peak union bodies operate within particular territories that may be contested; and place because it is socially produced and results in a specific local industrial history and thus identity.</p>
<p>The campaigns have illustrated the importance of the particular place-based industrial history in determining local issues and thus the modes, types and strengths of agency available to RTLCs. In the case of the GTLC, the strength of the particular relationships that had developed within this history cannot be fully articulated without explicit consideration of the impact of the specific location on RTLC agency. A more explicit incorporation of place and scale as an extension to the Ellem and Shields conceptual framework for peak union council agency enables a more holistic understanding of the activities of a peak council, providing better consideration of the differences in agency between RTLCs, and of those factors that result in changes to agency roles.</p></sec>
