<p>This study's aim consists of evaluating the adhesion and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from rat bone marrow on nanoparticle Titanium (Ti) surface. Hence, passage 3 MSCs were, respectively, seeded on nanoparticle Ti and pure Ti surfaces and then cultured for 32 h. Cell morphology and viability were separately examined by scanning electron microscopy and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazsol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, the mitotic rate of the attached MSCs was observed through immunocytochemistry. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to determine the adhesion-associated messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), CD44 gene encoding variant isoform 6 (CD44 V6), and the integrinβ1 level. The results showed that MSCs performed better in faster extension on the nanoparticle Ti surface than on the pure Ti surface after culturing for 4 h, and were quicker in fusion patterns after 16 h. Furthermore, cell viability was significantly increased on the nanoparticle Ti surface compared to that of the pure Ti surface 16 h after initial seeding (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the mitotic rate of attached MSCs on the nanoparticle Ti surface was higher than that on the pure Ti surface after 32 h (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). More interestingly, the CD44 V6 and integrinβ1 mRNA in the nanoparticle Ti surface group expressed higher than that in the pure Ti surface group after 4 h (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and positive correlation between CD44 V6 and integrinβ1 was found through statistical analysis (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Our study's result indicates that a nanoparticle Ti surface can significantly promote the adhesion and proliferation of MSCs, and also improve the bioactivity of Ti surface.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211414750" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metallic biomaterials such as titanium (Ti) and titanium alloys (Ti-6Al-4 V) are widely used for arthroplasty in the field of orthopedic surgery. Despite titanium's generally successful clinical applications, problems still arise. For example, because of its bio-inertness, after being implanted, prosthesis made of pure Ti can be encapsulated by fibrous tissue, which can lead to osteolysis and subsequent loosening of the implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211414750">1</xref></sup> To obviate this drawback, it is necessary to modify Ti surface properties to achieve more optimal biological responses.</p>
<p>Numerous approaches have been achieved for the preparation of hydroxyapatite (HA) to improve the bioactivity of Ti surface, such as plasma-spray deposition, sol–gel deposition, chemical vapor deposition, filtered pulsed-arc discharge, and physical vapor deposition (PVD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211414750">2</xref></sup> Among these approaches, plasma-spray deposition offers an attractive prospect of economy and is the only commercially available method to produce HA coatings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211414750">3</xref></sup> Applying a thin layer of HA to the surface of Ti can promote osseointegration and increase the mechanical stability of an implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211414750">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211414750">5</xref></sup> However, the low crystallinity and poor bonding strength of the HA coatings result in degradation, peeling, and fatigue-induced failure under tensile loading,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211414750">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211414750">7</xref></sup> which limits the number of biomedical applications for it. PVD is advantageous because the samples can be kept at low temperatures during treatment while the films can still grow dense with a fine microstructure, leading to improved mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>Plasma-immersion implantation is one of the best-controlled PVD process, in which accelerated ions with high energy are used to bombard the surface. With different levels of energy, the range of ions varies from a few atomic layers to a few hundred nanometers while the bulk properties of the material are preserved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211414750">8</xref></sup> Implantation of Ti surface with an optimal dose of silicon (Si) ion has already been found to enhance the hardness and corrosion resistance <italic>in vitro</italic>. Heating of the Ti alloy samples implanted with Si ions at a temperature up to 500°C has no essential effect upon the gross structure of the surface layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211414750">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, ion-implanted Si nanocrystals can be obtained by implanting Si into some metallic substrates, which is predicted by the Ostwald ripening theory (diffusion of atoms between neighboring nanocrystals).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211414750">10</xref></sup> Therefore, this research has hypothesized that coating surfaces with nanoparticles were available by plasma-immersion implanting Si ion into a Ti surface, and has concentrated on the fact that nanoparticle surfaces affectedthe adhesion, integration, and proliferation of MSCs.</p>
<p>MSCs play a key role in the bone formation process, in which cells residing in the bone marrow along with hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into a variety of tissues including bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211414750">11</xref></sup> However, with increasing age, the numbers of MSCs in the bone marrow decline significantly, at the same time, the progenitor functionality, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation gradually loose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211414750">12</xref></sup> To overcome these limitations, improving osseointegration strategies may be required to improve stem cell survival on a prosthesis surface. Integrin-mediated adhesion is a prerequisite for MSCs survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211414750">13</xref></sup> Also, CD44 V-mediated matrix formation is crucial for the settlement and growth of cells at a secondary site, which has been confirmed by previous experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211414750">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211414750">15</xref></sup> The osteoconduction on the material surface benefits adherence and proliferation of MSCs. The MSCs are then directed to differentiation toward osteogenesis by extracellular matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211414750">16</xref></sup> In this study, adherence-associated gene expressions, CD44 V6 and integrinβ1, were detected to explore the strengthened MSC adhesion mechanism on nanoparticle Ti surface. To examine the expression of cell proliferation-related marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), immunochemistry was employed to confirm MSC proliferation.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211414750"><title>Preparation of samples</title>
<p>Commercial pure titanium sheets of 10 × 10 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> in size were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone before plasma-immersion ion implantation was conducted. One main surface of the sheet was implanted with silicon ion by 0.5 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211414750">17</xref></sup> Si<sup>+</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> dose (with energy of 100 keV) to generate Si nanocrystals. The opposite main surface was intact on a pure Ti crystallographic plane. The implantation procedure was conducted in an implanter (PIIIS-700, China). During the implantation, the sample temperature was not beyond 70°C. The samples were ultrasonically rinsed in deionized water, then rinsed in ethyl alcohol absolute and dried in a 40°C electric oven (Nabertherm, Germany) for 24 h. The successful implantation of Si ion was testified with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AMICUS, Kratos Analytical, UK), and the surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Philips S-570 XL20, Holland).</p>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211414750"><title>Silicon ionic content analysis</title>
<p>After one main surface had been implanted with silicon ions, the metal sheets were washed in 75%, 95%, and 100% ethanol subsequently, for 5 min each. Then, the samples were dried and sterilized for further experiments. Samples implanted with Si ions were divided into two groups: apure Ti group with the pure Ti surface upward anda nanoparticle group with the implanted surface upward. Subsequently, the two groups were put into24-well plastic plates. One milliliter of α-MEM medium was added into each well containing the sheets and incubated for 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 32 h, 64 h, 5days, and 11 days at 37°C. At each time point, samples were taken out of the well and the soaking solutions were diluted by 1:25 ratio with deionized water before being tested by a coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (Vista-MPX ICP, USA) for the concentration of Si<sup>+</sup> ion.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211414750"><title>Isolation and culture of MSC</title>
<p>Two-month-old adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200–235 g, were used in this study, with prior approval by the Ethics Committee of Animal Experiments of Soochow University. Operations were performed under sterile conditions. The rats were placed under general anesthesia by being injected with 3.6% chloral hydrate in the peritoneal cavity. After having soaked the skin and fur below the head in 0.05% povidone iodine solution (The Second Army Medical University, China) for 15 min, the knee joint capsules of the hind limbs were opened under sterile conditions. The articular surface of distal femur was then drilled to make a 2 mm diameter pore, and a bone marrow cavity was exposed. A total of 0.5 mL of bone marrow was extracted from each femur with a 5-gage needle and put into 0.5 mL α-MEM (Gibco, BRL) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, BRL). The bone marrow was then blown into a single cell suspension. This suspension of 1 : 1 ratio was gently added on a lymphocyte separation medium (Gibco, BRL) along the wall of a centrifuge tube. With centrifugation of 1000 rpm/min, within 5 min, the suspension was divided from top to bottom according to the review report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211414750">17</xref></sup> into diluent layer, a mononuclear cell layer, a separated liquid layer, and an erythrocyte layer which was in the bottom of the centrifugation tube. A mononuclear cell was carefully drawn off at the interface of the layer, washed two times with culture medium and α-MEM supplemented with 20% FBS. Then, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL cells were counted using a hemocytometer (Cascade Biologics) and incubated with 20% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 250 µg/mL amphotericin B (Sigma, USA) in α-MEM under a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Every 3 days after the primary culture, the medium was abandoned and replaced with a fresh medium. The growth of cells was observed under a phase contrast microscope (Olympus). When cells reached 80% confluence after 20 days of continuous culture, adherent cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin and passaged. Through repeatedly passaging with a seeding density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL, the MSCs were amplified and purified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211414750"><title>Fluorescent flow cytometry analysis</title>
<p>To determine the antigen expression distribution of the adherent cells derived from bone marrow, passage 3 cells were harvested by trypsinization for 2 min, after which cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm/min for 8 min. The cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS at a density of about 2 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL. Fifty-microliter aliquots of this suspension were then transferred to separated labeled tubes and placed on ice for 30 min with the appropriate dilution of one of the followingantibodies. CD54-FITC-labeled, CD90-PE-labeled, CD45-FITC-labeled, and CD31-PE-labeled (Becton Dickinson). After labeling the samples, they were diluted to 500 µL with PBS. The cells were measured on a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed by the CellQuest software package (Becton Dickinson).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211414750"><title>Cell morphology</title>
<p>The passage 3 cells from the primary culture of rat bone marrow-derived MSCs with a density at 2 × 10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, that were then seeded on the nanoparticle Ti surface and the pure Ti surface in α-MEM supplemented with 15% FBS, respectively, and cultured under standard cell culture condition for 4, 8, 16 and 32 h. Three samples were randomly collected at each time from one of the two groups, washed with PBS, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffered by PBS. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol (25%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) and amyl acetate following critical-point drying. The morphology of the adhered cells was observed by SEM (JEOL-JMS-T33A Scanning Microscope, JEOL-USA Inc., Peabody, MA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211414750"><title>MTT assay</title>
<p>The effect of the nanoparticle Ti surface on MSC proliferation was measured using MTT assay. In brief, passage 3 MSCs were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on coverslips, the nanoparticle Ti and pure Ti, respectively, in 24-well plates. One milliliter culture medium, α-MEM supplemented with 15%FBS, was added to each well. Cells grew on the plates for 4, 8, 16, and 32 h in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the pre-determined time points, 50 µL of freshly prepared MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL, Sigma) was added to each well containing the sample, and the plates were further incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The supernatant of each well was carefully removed and 500 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide was then added to solubilize the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured with an EL800 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). All measurements were performed in triplicate. Cell number was determined by using a linear correlation between absorbance and MSC concentration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211414750"><title>Immunocytochemistry staining</title>
<p>The passage 3 MSCs of all experiment groups were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 15% FBS and seeded onto the nanoparticle Ti and pure Ti sheets, respectively, on 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. Cells were cultured on the plates for 32 h in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Three samples with cells of each experimental group were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescent staining. The samples were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. These samples were further blocked in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum (Sigma–Aldrich, Inc., USA) at room temperature for 20 min and then incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibody against PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) diluted in PBS (5 µg/mL). After being washed three times with PBS, the samples were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with FITC-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) diluted in PBS (1:500). Finally, for nuclear staining, 1 mg/mL of Hoechst 33238 (Sigma–Aldrich, Inc., USA) was diluted 1:100 in PBS and loaded into samples for 15 min. Images were captured in a confocal microscope (Eclipse TE200, Nikon, Japan). The proliferative cells were quantified by counting positive cells under the fluorescent microscope. The mitotic rate was the ratio of positive anti-PCNA to Hoechst 33238 labeling cell numbers, which was calculated by the count of positive cells in five randomly selected 200 × powered microscope fields in each sample.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328211414750"><title>Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>The total RNA was extracted from experimental groups cultured for 4, 8, 16, and 32 h, respectively, using the RNeasy Mini Protocol (Qiagen, Holland). The concentration of RNA was quantified using the absorbance value at 260 nm and the quality of the sample preparation assessed using the <italic>A</italic>260/<italic>A</italic>280 ratio. All RNA preparations were diluted to a final concentration of 10 ng/µL. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction mixture volume (50 µL) consisting of 2 µL complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) in 1 × PCR buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.4) and 50 mM KCl) containing 0.2 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate mix, 4.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 ng each forward and reverse primers, and 1 U Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Gibco/Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized and amplified using specific primers including CD44 gene encoding variant isoform (V6), integrinβ1, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (forward and reverse). The sequences of the primer pairs are listed as follows: CD44 V6-5′-TGGGCAGATCCTAATAGCAC-3′ and 5′-TCACATGGGAGTCTTCACTTG-3′, Integrinβ1-5′-GAGAGAGATTACTTCAGAC-3′ and 5′-AGCAGTCGTGTTACATTC-3′, GAPDH-5′-TCAACGGGAAGCCCATCA-3′, and 5′-CGGCCTCACCCCATTTG-3′.</p>
<p>Real-time PCRs were performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and carried out on the Mx3005Pt qPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The reaction volume (25 µL) included 12.5 µL SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 5 µL diluted cDNA (30 ng), and 0.2 μM of each primer. To standardize mRNA levels, we amplified GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, as an internal control. The amounts of target cDNA were determined using the comparative threshold (Ct) method. For each assay, standards, a no-template, and no-RT controls were included to verify the quality and cDNA specificity of the primers. Levels of RNA expression were determined according to the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211414750">18</xref></sup> The results of three independent repeated assays, performed in different plates, each using different cDNAs from the samples analyzed, were averaged to produce a single mean quantity value for each experiment group.</p>

<p>The low-magnification SEM image examination of the specimens showed no obvious difference on the surface layers between the nanoparticle Ti sample and the pure Ti one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211414750">Figure 1(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211414750">c</xref>)). Therefore, a high-magnification SEM image analysis was undertaken to assess the samples. The high-power image observation showed that implantation with a dose of 0.5 × 10<sup>17</sup> Si<sup>+</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> resulted in the uniform formation of silicon nanoparticles throughout the surface. The nanoparticle diameter was 100–200 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211414750">Figure 1(d)</xref>). However, no obvious nanoparticles were observed on the pure Ti surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211414750">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211414750">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates the XPS chemical analysis of both the sample surfaces.

<p>Loosening at interface between prosthesis and bone claims to be one of the main reasons for the failure of biological arthroplasty. Being observed over a specific time span, the progression of prosthesis loosening can be divided into early and late stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211414750">23</xref></sup> One of the key factors causing early stage prosthesis loosening is insufficient osseointegration growth on the prosthesis surface affecting new bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211414750">24</xref></sup> Late stage loosening is mainly attributed to osteolysis induced by wear debris. Formation of strong osseointegration at the interface between prosthesis implant and bone depends on the optimal choice of surgical indication and surgical technique, as well as the biocompatibility of implant material itself, and especially prosthesis surface structure. It has been proved that surface characteristics significantly enhance MSCs adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, and further help shapes a solid combination of prosthesis and bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211414750">25</xref></sup> Therefore, the increase of surface roughness with nano-based surface modification is a new pivotal strategy for improving artificial joint materials. Previous studies showed that the existence of free nanoparticles state such as silica, titanium dioxide, and other inorganic nanoparticles were cytotoxic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211414750">26</xref></sup> However, our study found silicon nanoparticles fixed on the surface of titanium were unharmful to MSCs, which can be reflected by the MTT assay. Based on our present results, no signs showed that MSC proliferative activity was inhibited by fixed Si nanoparticles. Neither nuclear condensation nor chromatin condensation marginalization was found in our observation. In summary, our findings showed that the silicon nanoparticles surface could perform universal biocompatibility on MSCs.</p>
<p>Silicon is an essential trace element for human beings. If daily silicon intake is insufficient, a series of effects will take place, including slow bone growth, cortical thinning of long bone, and structural disorder of bone trabecula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211414750">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211414750">28</xref></sup> On the one hand, it has been confirmed in previous studies that implant with silicate coating can effectively promote the proliferation of osteoblasts, osteogenic differentiation, and mineralization of calcium deposition, mainly brought about by the rich content of silicon ions in such coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211414750">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211414750">30</xref></sup> On the other hand, high concentration of silicon ions can also lead to local inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211414750">31</xref></sup> In our present experiments, we found the concentration of Si<sup>+</sup> ions was low. Such Si <sup>+ </sup>ions were released from the silicon nanoparticle surface that was formed by 0.5 × 10<sup>17</sup> Si<sup>+</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> implantation. Though the concentration was increased over time, it was only found to reach the peak level of 0.243 mg/L on day 11. Furthermore, the increasing trend was weakened after 1 week. Such concentration is even lower than that in drinking water in many American cities, such as Boston, Chicago, Washington DC, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211414750">32</xref></sup> Therefore, based on the above discussion and all lines of evidence in our experiment, we can see that the silicon ion content extracted from a silicon nanoparticle surface does no harm to MSCs.</p>
<p>MSC proliferation plays an important role in theprocess of new bone formation. In this study, a higher optical density value was recorded by the MTT analysis. Together with our SEM image observation, it was indicated that compared to the pure Ti surface, living MSCs on the nanoparticle Ti surface were higher in number and stronger in integration capability. From another angle, cyclin (PCNA) is a novel central component of the pathways that controls cell proliferation in vertebrates. PCNA is a specific protein that ubiquitously and tightly regulates cell cycle. It plays a key role in chromosomal DNA replication and is a late obligatory component of the mitogenic response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211414750">33</xref></sup> Through analyzing the mitotic rate between the nanoparticle Ti group and the pure Ti group, we found that the nanoparticle surface promoted MSC proliferation better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211414750">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Cell adhesion to the matrix is believed to be a decisive factor for intracellular signals, which influences subsequent cell–matrix interaction and cell differentiation. Adhesion directly affects the MSC proliferation on the metal prosthesis surfaces, hence weakening MSCs' performance in further osteogenic differentiation, calcification, and subsequent integration between the prosthesis and the bone tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211414750">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211414750">35</xref></sup> Our experiment <italic>in vitro</italic> indicated that MSCs on a nanoparticle Ti surface can stretch out multiple pseudopodia, closely attach to a metal surface, and reach earlier confluence. Such phenomenon may be attributed to the mRNA expressions of CD44 V6 and integrinβ1, stimulated by the nanoparticle Ti surface. CD44 molecules vary considerably by N- and O-glycosylations and by insertion of alternatively spliced variable exon products in the extracellular domains of the molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211414750">36</xref></sup> A multitude of isoforms are generated in this way, which corresponds to a multitude of functions. One of the most important function is cellular adhesion. Previous experiments indicated that attachments can be strengthened under the cooperation of CD44 V6 isoform and integrins. Moreover, CD44 V6 binds P- and L-selectins, which can promote the hematogenous spread of tumor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211414750">37</xref></sup> Some other experiments also showed that through binding hyaluronan, CD44 can trigger tumor invasiveness by stimulating the production of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211414750">38</xref></sup> CD44v6 has also a higher binding affinity for hyaluronate than CD44 standard isoform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211414750">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211414750">40</xref></sup> These discoveries helpfully disclose the detailed mechanism of CD44 V6-mediated cell adhesion. Integrins are obligate heterodimers containing two distinct chains, called α (alpha) and β (beta) subunits. The role of an α-subunit is unknown, but it may stabilize the folds of the protein. The β subunits are directly involved in coordinating at least some of the ligands that integrins bind. β1 integrins interact with many α integrin chains. In this study, integrinβ1 is selected mainly because it mediates cell–cell or cell–extracellular matrix interactions by binding cells to the extracellular matrix proteins of collagen I and fibronectin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211414750">41</xref></sup> In bone cells, β1 and α1 (or α2) are involved in binding collagen. In addition, β1 and α5 subunit bind fibronectin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328211414750">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the following, we will look at several advantages of the Si nanoparticle Ti surface. Osseointegration is available by optimally implanting plasma Si-ion on Ti to generate surface topography with nanoparticles. First of all, the distribution of nanoparticles on pure Ti greatly increases the surface roughness, providing extra area to absorb some matrix proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin-binding protein, vitreous extracellular matrix protein, etc. Such matrix proteins contain arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328211414750">43</xref></sup> Second, the electrochemical property changes of nanosurface causes extracellular matrix proteins with RGD sequence to expose more binding sites for integrin to connect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328211414750">44</xref></sup> The Si nanoparticles with positive charge can easily absorb hyaluronic acid that contains negative charge in culture media. Hyaluronic acid is the ligand for CD44 V6 to bind. As a result, the adhesion of MSCs is developed on implanted metal materials. Third, CD44 v6 may also cooperate with β1-containing integrins to permit cells to bind with osteopontin independently of an RGD sequence, thereby stimulating cell spread.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328211414750">45</xref></sup> Real-time PCR analysis not only indicated that both integrinβ1 and CD44 V6 expressions were up-regulated by the nanoparticle Ti surface at earlier stage, but also illustrated that positive correlation existed between mRNA expressions of CD44 V6 and integrinβ1. Last but not least, the nanoparticle surface shaped through plasma ion implantation method provided a lively interface containing an alloy grain boundary, which also impacted the initial protein interaction and mediated the subsequent cell adhesion and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328211414750">46</xref></sup></p>
