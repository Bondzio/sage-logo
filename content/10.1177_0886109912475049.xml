<abstract>
<p>This article presents the results of a study with providers of domestic violence and sexual assault services in Kansas. In recent years, the changing demographics of the U.S. Midwest have required community-based organizations to adapt their services quickly to “new” immigrant populations, many of whom are Spanish speaking and perceived as “illegal” and thus face numerous barriers to accessing services. We examine how intersecting and interlocking oppressions shape the delivery of services to immigrant women who are facing violence and discuss what strategies advocates use to support women’s safety and self-determination in an intense and at times hostile anti-immigrant environment.</p>

<p>You know, you find somebody that’s willing to help in one area and so, that’s one dragon sleigh [speaker laughs], and you go on to the next and try to find a resource for that. (Excerpt from an interview with an anti-domestic violence advocate)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The metaphor of a dragon sleigh may seem incongruous with the delivery of anti-violence against women services, yet, in the text just quoted, the domestic violence advocate depicted the insurmountable challenges that service providers perceive when supporting immigrants who are undocumented or have temporary or dependent immigration status. In the past decade, there has been considerable advocacy and scholarship at the intersection of violence against women and immigration in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109912475049">Acevedo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475049">Erez, Adelman, &amp; Gregory, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475049">Hass, Dutton, &amp; Orloff, 2000</xref>). Although this research illustrates how many immigrants who are vulnerable to abuse have few rights to seek protection and security from law enforcement or social and health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475049">Bhuyan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886109912475049">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886109912475049">Salcido &amp; Adelman, 2004</xref>), there is a need to understand how hostility toward undocumented immigrants affects the capacity of service providers to support them.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus on domestic violence and sexual assault as part of a spectrum of systemic gender-based violence (including intrafamily members’ or intimate partners’ use of physical assaults or threats; patterns of intimidation or control; sexual abuse, rape, or reproductive violence; forced marriage; trafficking; or economic abuse or neglect) in the lives of immigrant women. Although gender-based violence affects all populations, research has found that immigrant women and racialized minorities may experience higher rates of violence but are less likely to seek support services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886109912475049">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2003</xref>). General population surveys have consistently reported that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in the United States will be exposed to some form of intimate partner violence in their lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109912475049">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). In comparison, studies that have used community samples of immigrants have found higher rates of intimate partner violence. For example, 40.8% of South Asian immigrants in Boston reported experiencing intimate partner violence (e.g., physical, sexual, or psychological abuse from their husbands or partners) but had little knowledge of domestic violence or sexual assault services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886109912475049">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2003</xref>, p. 435). Research on intimate partner violence among Latinas has also suggested high rates of intimate partner violence; 51% of Latinas in a study in Indianapolis reported experiencing some form of intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>Community activism and scholarship highlight the intersection of gender inequality within immigrant communities as compounded by the social and economic marginalization of racialized immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475049">Abraham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109912475049">Moreno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886109912475049">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2002</xref>). The context of immigration contributes to women’s isolation; economic dependence on abusers; lack of knowledge of social services; and fear of deportation, also called “removal” (the enforced <italic>deportation</italic> or expulsion of foreigners from the state). We use the terms <italic>deportation</italic> and <italic>removal</italic> interchangeably, while emphasizing that practices of “removal” are inextricably linked to the reaffirmation of state sovereignty in U.S. law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475049">Bui, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475049">Erez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886109912475049">Salcido &amp; Adelman, 2004</xref>). In a community-based study with Latino immigrants in Washington, DC, 48% of Latinas reported that their partners’ violence against them increased after they emigrated to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475049">Dutton, Orloff, &amp; Hass, 2000</xref>). In the same study, 72% of the Latinas who were abused reported that their spouses never filed their immigration applications, even though half of them were qualified to become permanent residents; of the Latinas who reported abuse, 21.7% stated that their fear of deportation was the primary reason they remained with their abusive partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475049">Dutton et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This article reports the findings from a study with domestic violence and sexual assault advocates in Kansas. The study explored how advocates in this state have responded to immigrant women who are contending with abuse. We use the term <italic>advocate</italic> to reflect service providers’ self-described commitment to supporting women’s self-determination when navigating multiple systems (e.g., criminal justice, family and immigration law, health care, and social assistance). Through analyzing advocates’ perspectives, we illustrate how the production of “illegality” and deportability contributes to the perceived “cracks” that immigrant women fall through when responding to violence.</p>
<p>In the following section, we discuss the social and political context of immigration in Kansas. We then illustrate our framework for theorizing intersecting and interlocking oppressions in the context of advocacy against domestic violence and sexual assault, with attention to the production of “illegality” and deportability. We present our research design and methods; we then present our analysis of advocates’ narratives within the following themes: (1) responding to intersecting and interlocking oppressions, (2) the impact of surveillance of immigrants’ illegality and deportability, (3) leveraging regional and national resources for legal support for immigrants, and (4) advocating for women in an anti-immigrant environment. We conclude with recommendations for coalition building, mobilization, and policy change.</p>

<title>Social and Political Context of Immigration in Kansas</title>
<p>Like other states in the Midwest, Kansas has a small but rapidly growing immigrant population. According to the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey, the foreign-born population in Kansas increased from 62,840 in 1990 to 186,942 in 2010—a change of 38.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886109912475049">Migration Policy Institute, 2010</xref>). Similar to trends across the country, the foreign-born are contributing to increased ethnic and racial diversity in the state; in 2010, an estimated 1 of the 9 Kansans were Asian or Latino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109912475049">Immigration Policy Centre, 2010</xref>), and 54.3% of the foreign-born individuals in Kansas were Hispanic or Latino in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475049">Migration Policy Institute, 2008</xref>). The phenomenon of new immigrant communities in the United States has contributed to waves of immigrants who are settling in regions of the country outside historically “traditional” destinations (e.g., New York, California, and Texas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475049">Gouveia &amp; Saenz, 2000</xref>). The growth in migration includes both legal and undocumented immigrants; the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that from 2002 to 2004, 55,000 to 85,000 undocumented immigrants resided in Kansas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886109912475049">Passel, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although urban areas have received the largest share of recent immigrants, a significant portion of this population growth has taken place in rural areas of the state; the migration of Latinos to rural communities in the Midwest is associated with the demand for cheap labor (such as in the meat-packing industry), thus contributing to higher rates of poverty among Latino immigrants in the Midwest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886109912475049">Crowley &amp; Lichter, 2006</xref>). For example in Garden City, a meat-packing town located in southwestern Kansas, the Hispanic population grew from 25% of the town’s population in 1990 to 43%, in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475049">Institute for Public Policy and Business Research, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886109912475049">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). With the economic recession of 2007–2009, however, some communities experienced a drop in their immigrant populations. When Tyson Food suddenly closed a meat-processing plant in Emporia, Kansas, a large number of resettled Somali refugees, who had been employed at the plant, left the town (Berlin, 2008).</p>
<p>Most of the recent immigrants in Kansas come from Spanish-speaking countries, primarily Mexico, followed by Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua, and El Salvador; there are also significant pockets of Russian-speaking immigrants and German Mennonite, Somali, Vietnamese, Lao, and Hmong refugees scattered throughout the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109912475049">Immigration Policy Centre, 2010</xref>). Advocates also reported working with women from Russia or Vietnam who were facing abuse from spouses they met through the Internet or through a marriage service (i.e., mail-order brides), a phenomenon that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886109912475049">Narayan (1995</xref>) identified as increasing women’s risks for domestic violence.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we focus on advocacy with recent immigrants, including temporary or undocumented immigrants, who are commonly referred to as people who are “foreign-born” in policy circles. People who are undocumented or have a form of precarious immigration status are not considered “immigrants” in the legal sense or with regard to social policy. They may include unauthorized immigrants; people with nonimmigrant resident visas for work, study, business, or travel; people with incomplete or lost applications for permanent residence; and people who are dependent on their spouses or family members to regularize their status. While the terms <italic>foreign born</italic>, <italic>illegal,</italic> or <italic>unauthorized</italic> circulate in public policy and the mass media, we call attention to the dehumanizing affects of this discourse that mark some residents as not part of the nation. At the same time, we note that women who reside in multigenerational immigrant communities may face similar barriers to accessing services because of isolation, racism, limited English, and or culturally insensitive service delivery. Thus, although this article focuses on the delivery of services to recent immigrants with particular attention to persons with undocumented or precarious immigration status, we recognize that service delivery with racialized, non-English-speaking, or other populations who are “minoritized” (i.e., groups that are marginalized because they are seen as not conforming to dominant ideologies of race, class, gender, or other social identities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475049">Burman &amp; Chantler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475049">Chanter, 2006</xref>) groups may encounter similar challenges.</p>

<title>Theorizing Intersecting and Interlocking Oppressions</title>
<p>Black feminists in North America are credited with conceptualizing <italic>intersectionality</italic> as a means to explore “intersecting patterns of racism and sexism and how these experiences tend not to be represented within the discourses of either feminism or antiracism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475049">Crenshaw, 1991</xref>, pp. 1243–1244). Thus, intersectionality emerged as both a political and epistemological intervention; activists and scholars have sought to disrupt white, patriarchal, and heteronormative hegemony while articulating the standpoints of women of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475049">Collins, 1990</xref>). Following the lead of activist scholars in the United States and Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109912475049">Razack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886109912475049">Smith, 1999</xref>), we call attention to the context of white settler colonialism in North America to highlight that the abuse that women suffer at home cannot be separated from the ongoing violence of colonization and exploitation that is produced through state policies that allocate differential rights to individuals within the boundaries of a nation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886109912475049">
<title>The Production of “Illegality” and Deportability as Violence Against Women</title>
<p>Several scholars have sought to disrupt the perceived dichotomy between documented and undocumented, calling attention to how perceived “illegality” intersects with perceptions of racialized immigrants as “other” people from “other” places (where “other” is equated with deviance and threat; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886109912475049">Bhuyan &amp; Smith-Carrier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475049">Coutin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886109912475049">Jiwani, 2001</xref>). Although authorization to reside in the United States remains a significant marker of one’s legal status, the passage of anti-immigrant laws at the state and municipal levels has blurred the lines between legality and illegality in everyday life.</p>
<p>Toward conceptualizing the constant threat of deportation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109912475049">De Genova (2002</xref>) suggested that we look specifically at an individual’s “deportability” (i.e., the right of the state to <italic>remove</italic> someone from the state’s social and political space), as opposed to his or her legal immigration status. For women who are facing violence, the threat of deportation may occur through the criminal justice system as a consequence the involvement of the police in incidents of domestic violence or sexual assault, as well as through everyday surveillance of immigrants when driving without a license, in workplace raids, and at times through information sharing between social service providers and immigration officers.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, any person without authorization to reside in the United States or who violates the terms of his or her nonimmigrant resident visa or permanent residence may be detained and deported. In 1996, the U.S. government reinforced the notion of people as illegal with the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). IIRIRA expanded the types of crimes for which noncitizens may be removed, including nonassault-related crimes (e.g., violation of a protection order); it also expanded the category of persons who could be detained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475049">Erez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475049">Kerwin &amp; Yi-Ying, 2009</xref>). The proliferation of cooperation agreements between local law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also led to more frequent detentions of people who are presumed or suspected to be undocumented (e.g., the Secure Communities program prioritizes the removal of “criminal aliens”; 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act empowers local law enforcement officers to enforce civil immigration law). Deportations have risen under the Obama administration, with an estimated 400,000 people deported from the United States in 2010 (55% for criminal charges); up to 8% of the deportees have been parents of U.S.-born children who are citizens (Wessler, 2011).</p>
<p>Considering that grassroots advocates and service providers play a significant role in linking women and their children to community resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886109912475049">Nankani, 2000</xref>), the research reported here explored how the production of illegality and deportability shapes the delivery of services to immigrant women. While research has explored immigrant women’s perspectives on violence and the barriers they face, this research focuses on the perceptions of “illegality” and deportability among service providers to illustrate how social and structural factors affect women’s response to violence while illustrating advocates’ strategies to support women’s safety and self-determination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886109912475049" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Methods</title>
<p>The study was undertaken in collaboration with the Kansas Coalition against Sexual and Domestic Violence (KCDSV), a network of 29 providers of sexual assault and domestic violence services in Kansas. One of the central concerns of the project was to forge academic and community partnerships through community-based research methods that would increase the feasibility of research and enhance the relevance of the findings. The coalition’s staff provided technical support to develop the research questions and recruit the participants. Toward preserving the confidentiality of the participants, the staff were not involved in analyzing the data; however, we presented the key findings to the coalition staff and received feedback from the staff members on this article and a report that was distributed to all member organizations. During the year following the study, the second author worked with KCSDV’s bilingual advocates as a social work practicum student, which provided more nuanced insights into the delivery of services to non-English speakers across the state. We also consulted with two advocates from the study; consultation with these “key informants” was instrumental to contextualizing and enhancing the relevance of the findings.</p>
<sec id="section5-0886109912475049">
<title>Participants and Interviews</title>
<p>The participants were recruited using a purposive sampling method as approved by the human subjects review board at the University of Kansas. The executive directors of 30 organizations that were affiliated with the KCSDV were contacted by the lead researcher and requested to identify advocates who were employed in a direct service capacity. The advocates who were employed at one of the member organizations were contacted by telephone or e-mail to participate in the study and discuss informed consent prior to taking part in focus groups. The focus group participants were subsequently invited to participate in semistructured one-on-one interviews. All participation was voluntary. Some identifying information about specific organizations and individual participants has been altered to maintain confidentiality.</p>
<p>Twenty-four service providers from large cities, small towns, and rural areas from 15 organizations took part in the study. We convened three separate focus groups in Dodge City, Wichita, and Kansas City. Of the 24 participants, 23 were female and 1 was male; they ranged in age from 23 to 59 years. Thirteen focus group participants identified as Caucasian, three as African American, and eight as Latina/Hispanic. All eight Latina/Hispanic participants and two Caucasian participants referred to themselves as “bilingual advocates” and provided services in English and Spanish. The participants’ professional roles included shelter manager, shelter advocate, nonshelter domestic violence advocate, sexual assault advocate, court advocate, social assistance advocate, and outreach worker. Three advocates worked in organizations that focused on sexual assault; one advocate worked in an organization that addressed violence and hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons.</p>
<p>After the focus group interviews, each participant was invited to take part in a one-on-one interview by telephone to explore topics that were raised in the focus groups. Eleven participants took part in these interviews, which lasted 25–55 min; two participants declined, nine did not respond, and two could not be contacted. The participants who identified as Latina were more likely to take part in both the focus group and the individual interviews; they comprised one third of the focus groups, but accounted for almost half the participants in the individual interviews (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886109912475049">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Analytic Methods</title>
<p>The interviews were conducted in English, tape-recorded, and transcribed verbatim (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886109912475049">Table 2</xref> for the transcription key). The transcripts were organized using the qualitative analysis software, HyperRESEARCH. Following Gee’s (1999) typology of discourse and social languages, we focused our analysis on the advocates’ language-in-use and language-as-representation, on the premise that individuals do not create meaning through their use of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475049">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>) but are participants in social conversations or discourses. Thus, although 15 individuals took part in the interviews, numerous discourses related to advocacy against domestic violence, immigration, and social rights were represented across all the interviews. We used an iterative analysis process that drew on our professional experience in advocacy against domestic violence, observations during fieldwork, repeated listening to the audiorecorded interviews, the reading of interview transcripts, and consulting with participants about preliminary analytic themes. We examined narratives that reflect both dominant ideologies and counternarratives (e.g., an alternative story that explains social reality in ways that challenge dominant ideologies; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109912475049">Allen, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Responding to Intersecting and Interlocking Oppressions</title>
<p>The key issues that emerged from the focus group and individual interviews were consistent with common barriers that have been identified in previous research: language and interpretation, problems in dealing with the legal and criminal justice system, the mixed role of faith communities, and access to social assistance and child protection. The participants reported regional differences in immigrant women’s access to services and outcomes for immigrant victims. Depending on the context and circumstances, a resource for immigrants could equally represent a barrier or even increase a woman’s risk for deportation. In this section, we focus on how challenges related to access to language through bilingual staff or the use of interpreters were compounded by immigration status, systemic racism against immigrants, and inadequate institutional support for bilingual or interpreter services.</p>
<sec id="section9-0886109912475049">
<title>Addressing Language Barriers</title>
<p>Access to the English language has long been recognized as a major obstacle to accessing services, affecting women’s ability to learn about social and health services, while compromising the quality of service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475049">Bui, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475049">Menjivar &amp; Salcido, 2002</xref>). At the time of the study, several organizations that dealt with violence against women across Kansas had recently hired bilingual or bicultural advocates (English and Spanish speakers, some of whom identified as immigrants from Latin American countries) in response to the visible growth of Latin American immigrants. Bilingual advocates provided interpretation when responding to police calls and interpreting for clients in courts or when accessing social services. They also coordinated with non-Spanish-speaking advocates in their own and other organizations.</p>
<p>The hiring of bilingual and bicultural advocates has contributed to a marked increase in the number of Spanish-speaking people who access services. One bilingual advocate reported: “[Our stats] tripled since I got here,” remarking that “We have somebody that speaks Spanish here, and [women] feel more comfortable. We have gotten other calls from other shelters, people wanting to come here because they don’t have somebody that speaks Spanish” (individual interview). The Latina advocates also noted that a sense of trust has been fostered within the Latino community through hiring bilingual/bicultural staff, resulting in the greater use of services that are offered.</p>
<p>Although the increased visibility of Spanish-speaking immigrants has resulted in more resources for interpretation in some organizations, some of the smaller organizations—in both urban and rural areas—were serving few, if any, immigrants. For example, one advocate reported that her organization had almost no contact with Latina or Spanish-speaking women, even though census data estimated that the town’s population was approximately 30% Hispanic at that time. The advocates also reported difficulties with language barriers when reaching out to newly settled Somali refugees. Advocates who were not bilingual or who were working with non-English- and non-Spanish-speaking women spoke of struggling to communicate. Where no interpreters were available, some advocates relied on a friend of the victim to translate or use the language line, both of which had limitations.</p>
<p>While the hiring of bilingual staff represents a significant shift toward more inclusive and responsive services for Spanish-speaking women, the bilingual advocates said that they faced a significant strain on their time and resources. In addition to providing the same services as those given to English-speaking clients, they were often required to provide additional interpretation and translation for fellow staff members in their own organizations or when interfacing with staff in other organizations who were either unable or uninterested in working with Spanish-speaking clients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886109912475049">
<title>Blurring the Boundaries Between Interpretation and Advocacy</title>
<p>The bilingual advocates described significant consequences of misinterpretation when supporting women within the legal system. Advocates who accompanied women to court described needing to interpret both the social and legal systems that women must navigate toward supporting a woman’s self-determination. This blurring of lines, however, was not always well received in legal settings. One advocate in a rural area reported that she was prohibited by her organization from interpreting for her clients in court, although she regularly interpreted for her clients when visiting welfare and other social service offices. Another advocate in an urban area described clashing with a court-appointed interpreter who, in her view, failed to interpret important information for the client:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was helping a client; I was doing the interpretation. And the interpreter was like, he wouldn’t let me interpret for the client … . I mean, “Can you please give me a minute, can you please let me do this? I’m trying to help the client.” And he didn’t like that … . The interpreter is not supposed to advocate. The interpreter is supposed to interpret. So we go, and the client often is standing there with a puzzled look on her face about the legal process, and we can explain kind of what’s going on … . But a lot of times, if an advocate can’t be there, … interpreters, although it’s not technical to advocate, <italic>have</italic> <italic>to</italic> in order to interpret. They <italic>have to</italic> inform the client about the system and go beyond just communicating what’s said, but also the whole process around those words and what’s behind them and in between them (bilingual advocate, focus group interview).</p>
</disp-quote>In the situation just described, the advocate’s approach to interpretation from an empowerment standpoint was deemed incongruous with the standard practice of interpretation as impartial and apolitical. Professional interpreters who are employed by the legal system also restrict how advocates can support women’s decision making in court, representing a political struggle over whose knowledge is deemed acceptable in legal settings. The silencing of advocates for women in court, even when a court-appointed interpreter inadequately interprets a woman’s narrative, signifies a challenge to an advocate’s professional authority while further marginalizing immigrant women within the legal system.</p>

<title>The Impact of the Surveillance of Immigrants’ Illegality and Deportability</title>
<p>The advocates described the surveillance of women’s immigration status and perceived illegality as involving the police, social and health services, and even members of women’s faith communities. In most organizations, advocates apply unofficial “don’t ask, don’t tell” practices that do not require service users to disclose their immigration status as a means of developing rapport and trust. One advocate, for example, said that she never asked women to disclose their status, but discussed all the legal options for people with different statuses for a woman to consider. Some advocates took proactive steps to “screen” how an agency works with undocumented immigrants or limited English speakers prior to referring a client. The advocates also established connections with service providers who did not require the women to disclose identifying information and, when possible, accompanied the women to other agencies to ensure that they were not made to fill out portions of a form that might jeopardize their status.</p>
<sec id="section12-0886109912475049">
<title>Uncertainty of Police Protection</title>
<p>The advocates remarked that when they interfaced with the criminal justice system, they were uncertain and unable to ensure women’s safety from deportation. In areas that have had longer histories of refugees from Southeast Asia, the advocates worked closely with Vietnamese or Lao police officers who spoke the language and were seen as “really concerned about people’s safety” (focus group interview). Police cooperation with immigration enforcement, however, has been well documented as contributing to women’s fear of reporting abuse. The advocates reported that community attitudes toward the police shifted with the ebb and flow of national and regional events, such as the counterterrorism activities following September 11, 2001, and the large-scale immigration raids that have taken place across the Midwest since 2008, both of which increased the advocates’ fears that turning to the police as first responders could result in deportation (of an abuser or a victim of violence).</p>
<p>Although deportation poses an overt threat to women’s safety, the advocates reported other examples of regional variations in the criminal justice response to undocumented or temporary immigrants. Bias against immigrants as “foreign” or as temporarily in the United States, in combination with misogynist attitudes toward victims of abuse, affected how both the police and judges would respond to immigrant crime victims. For example, an advocate who worked in a rural area shared that a judge refused to give a Protection from Stalking Order to a woman because she “had been back too many times,” whereas judges in urban areas commonly granted these orders to immigrants (focus group interview).</p>
<p>In another example, the police did not complete a report following a sexual assault incident with an international student. According to this woman’s advocate, “the legal process wasn’t taken seriously because this person was going, she wanted to return to her country. So the legal process, I didn’t feel happened in the same way it would if this was someone based in the community” (focus group interview). Protection orders were often denied to women if their abusers fled to their home countries following an arrest or if their abuser was deported; the judges argued that a victim is no longer at risk if her abuser has left the country. Thus, while undocumented or precarious-status immigrants have a constant fear of being deported, they also are denied basic protection offered to other victims of violence.</p>
<p>The advocates also expressed frustration at police who withheld support from women who were seeking to regularize their status through the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) as “battered immigrants” or to apply for U-visas as crime victims. A Latina advocate, who had been working with women who were eligible to apply for VAWA since 2000, was not able to complete an application until 2008 after finally locating “one nice law enforcement officer” (individual interview). Resistance to implementing VAWA provisions was seen as related to the overall anti-immigrant climate and racism against nonwhite residents of the state. As another Latina advocate from a rural area noted, “When all the new laws come over, [you] try to educate the people. They are not interested. You know why, because we are third- or fourth- [class] citizens” (bilingual advocate, focus group interview). The anti-immigrant and racist climate against Latinos thus affected both victims of abuse and their advocates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886109912475049">
<title>Social Assistance and Surveillance</title>
<p>The advocates reported several cases in which the surveillance of immigration status interfaced with access to social assistance. The Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS), which administers state and federally funded social services, scrutinizes immigration status in screening for eligibility for benefits and child protection (e.g., benefits for citizen children living in mixed-status families in which one or more parents or guardians are undocumented). Advocates in Kansas City were able to leverage support from Legal Momentum—a national women’s rights organization—to pressure the SRS to amend its policy regarding documentation requirements based on equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Amid the anti-immigrant politics in Kansas, however, the use of legal or policy advocacy for immigrants’ access to public benefits is considered risky for violence against women programs that rely on state funding.</p>
<p>The advocates reported incidents in which service providers were either directly or indirectly involved in immigration enforcement. In one case, a shelter-based advocate recounted how housing authorities reported an undocumented woman to ICE after she had helped the woman submit a housing application:
<disp-quote>
<p>We didn’t know; she didn’t tell us all this stuff, and we went ahead, and she filled out low-income housing paperwork … . Consequently, they researched her social security number and then she was deported, … and had we known this, then we wouldn’t, you know, we wouldn’t have done this. Now the sad thing is, she has six children who are in the United States … fostered out, and she is gone.” (focus group interview)</p>
</disp-quote>This advocate inadvertently facilitated a woman’s deportation, in part because she did not inquire about the women’s status, but also because she did not perceive the woman’s vulnerability to deportation. According to the advocate, this woman did not “appear” to be undocumented; she was a young woman who had grown up in a nearby state and spoke and acted like an “American.” Thus, while “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies seek to encourage access to services, the vulnerabilities associated with deportability may require cautious information gathering to minimize the risk of deportation.</p>
<p>In another example, an advocate worked with a woman who was deported after reporting her spouse to Child Protective Services (CPS) for sexually abusing their daughter. While investigating the alleged abuse, the CPS worker who was assigned to the case learned that the mother was undocumented and reported her to ICE. After the mother was deported, the father retained custody of both children, and the investigation against the father’s alleged sexual abuse was dropped. Studies with CPS workers in other states have suggested that there are numerous cases in which children of undocumented parents are taken into custody by CPS, resulting in the termination of parental rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475049">Garcia, Aisenberg, &amp; Harachi, 2012</xref>). This example highlights the serious implications that occur when service providers use deportation as a tool to penalize the illegality that surrounds undocumented immigrants in the “best interest” of a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475049">Glenn-Levin, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Leveraging Regional and National Resources on Immigration Law</title>
<p>Advocates’ ability to support immigrant women who are undocumented or have temporary resident visas often pivots on the advocates’ knowledge of immigration law or access to competent (and affordable if not pro bono) legal advice. Kansas City, the largest metropolitan center in the state, operates as the hub for both immigration advocacy and legal support. One of the problems that was identified in the focus groups was the lack of legal support and services offered in rural areas for survivors of domestic violence. Agencies in rural areas also depend on large organizations for funding and legal assistance and rely to some extent on KCSDV for technical assistance.</p>
<p>Even in Wichita—a midsized city—legal support for immigrants is often unavailable or unreliable. In the following excerpt, a bilingual advocate described how a well-regarded immigration attorney, who offered pro bono legal representation, discouraged the woman from applying for a U-visa, stating that “It wasn’t worth it,” even though the advocate later found that her clients were in fact eligible to apply. As the advocate recounted,
<disp-quote>
<p>We went with this family and we talked to this lawyer, about [the] possibility of a U-visa. She told us that really it wasn’t worth it to file U-visa … because [the] abuse happened to her children, because he might call immigration, because mom and dad were undocumented, and the children were undocumented, too, … so she was like, you know, it is better to stay like that under the radar. So, a year later, we went to a BIA [Board of Immigration Appeals] accreditation for immigration appeals, when I found out, no, it was worth it to do the U-visas; … so, it’s just the lack of knowledge even from the people who might be able to [or] who are willing to help someone [who is] undocumented. (focus group interview)</p>
</disp-quote>Considering their uncertain and uneven knowledge of immigration, advocates use a range of strategies to secure competent and affordable legal support for their clients, sometimes traveling more than 200 miles to meet with lawyers in Kansas City. In the excerpt just quoted, an advocate received training from the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allows nonattorney staff in nonprofit agencies to be accredited to practice immigration law before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the immigration courts (see http://cliniclegal.org/resources/toolkit-bia-recogition-accreditation). Support from Kansas Legal Services or a pro bono attorney is also an uncertain resource; legal services personnel in some parts of the state interpret their mandate as precluding helping undocumented immigrants. The significant variation in legal support was most evident in the use of VAWA remedies, which requires access to legal representation and cooperation from local law enforcement.</p>

<sec id="section15-0886109912475049">
<title>Advocating for Immigrants in an Anti-Immigrant Climate</title>
<p>While each advocate remarked that the unstable and at times hostile anti-immigrant politics contributed to a constant state of fear for women, some advocates recognized that public opinion on immigrants was complex, with both pro- and anti-immigrant sentiment circulating in their communities. As one advocate noted, sentiment on immigrants varies:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are lots of folks out here who are very friendly toward anybody and wouldn't wish anybody any harm. And then there are those that are more your traditional racists that are so shut down to immigrants and are so … anti-immigrant … that would, well, just to say it bluntly, that would be very happy to see all the immigrant population go back to their countries, like this is not a nation built on immigrants. (focus group interview)</p>
</disp-quote>On the one hand, the advocates acknowledged the strong leadership of Hispanic Americans in communities with long histories in the state. In contrast, an advocate reported that white residents in her small town openly complained about the Somali refugees who had been settled there, at least until the local meat-packing factory that had been employing refugees shut down, forcing them to relocate.</p>
<p>The anti-immigrant politics that affect women’s ability to seek safety from abuse are also linked to the overall economic distress that women experience as part of the economic downturn that has affected the entire country. In Kansas City, for example, many low-income citizens blame immigrants for the loss of their jobs, believing that immigrants are a drain on the economy and that it is not possible to be a victim of a crime if one was illegally present in the United States. Furthermore, the advocates noted the troubling way in which the local media represented illegal immigrants, causing some advocates to be uncertain whether they should report an abuser to the police because doing so might lead to media coverage that could trigger both an abuser’s and a victim’s deportation.</p>
<p>Although violence against women services agencies have more work to do to address intersecting and interlocking oppressions within their organizations, the advocates called for systemic changes to support women’s rights, recognizing there is only so much that already underfunded community-based organizations can do to address the structural barriers that affect immigrant women who are facing violence. As one advocate noted, “Domestic violence and sexual assault, we know affects everyone … . So, if we want [to] punish the crimes, and if we want to not keep them isolated anymore, then we need to accomplish change in policies. At least give them [a] driver's license. So, that's what I would like to see” (a shelter advocate).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Through interviews and focus groups with service providers in Kansas, we have illustrated how language barriers, deportability, and the broader anti-immigrant climate shape the delivery of anti-violence services to immigrant women. Consistent with previous research, the anti-violence against women advocates in this study discussed a host of social and legal barriers that impeded their work, including inadequate resources for non-English-speaking immigrants, the lack of organizational support for bilingual advocates, limited access to legal support for immigration, inadequate legal aid, and the unstable political and economic climate. The limited resources and divisive immigration politics across the state have resulted in immigrant women having unequal access to services.</p>
<p>Although the hiring of bicultural and bilingual staff has led to significant growth in Spanish-speaking women’s ability to access services, there is a continued need to develop an infrastructure within organizations to strengthen support to bilingual and bicultural staff who may be at a higher risk of burning out as a consequence of overfunctioning to address systemic barriers and oppression. Advocates who identified as immigrants themselves shared how systemic racism affects them both in the workplace and when they interface with multiple service systems. Although the state coalition had a program to support ethnic and cultural diversity, these efforts did not directly challenge the systemic forms of oppression that affected both service providers and women who were seeking services. The advocates in this study felt little support in addressing the racism that service providers who are racialized face in organizations, as well as in targeting systemic racist or sexist practices within social and legal systems across the state.</p>
<p>To address the challenges facing immigrant women, it is essential for agencies to begin by assessing their capacity to serve immigrants who have limited English and who are undocumented or have temporary status. As one advocate suggested, although organizations may want to provide equal access to services, they may not be ready to or have the capacity to do so. In an effort to save face, many agencies may be reluctant to admit that they need help, that they are not providing equal services, and that they do not even know where to start. This problem is made worse by the competition that often exists among agencies that are seeking funding in a competitive arena. Agencies remain fragmented in their approach, rather than collaborating with each other to advocate for policy changes or to provide services that would benefit all their clients.</p>
<p>While immigrant rights advocates have partnered with anti-violence advocates to address public policy and service delivery in different regions of the United States, there has been relatively little overlap between advocacy for immigrants’ rights and anti-violence against women in Kansas. The lack of accessible services, access to translators, and systemic racism all contribute to invisible barriers for immigrant women who are seeking safety and support. Considering how undocumented immigrants are veritably excluded from society as racialized and “unworthy” outsiders, we argue that anti-violence against women services need to reconceptualize what forms of violence are recognized in their advocacy work toward attending to violence that is produced through immigration and deportation policies.</p>
