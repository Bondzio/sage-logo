<abstract>
<p>Using data collected as part of a larger, four country, international comparative study, the challenges and strengths of rapid ethnography (RE) are explored. To deepen and enhance the study, in each case study (nine completed to date) an insider is paired with an outsider researcher in order to draw on a comparative perspective from the researcher team involved in each individual case study, as well as across the four countries and nine studies. The article concludes that because of its strengths and rapid turnaround, RE provides a way for international comparative studies to continue despite sharp decreases in research funding and, in our case, produced important insights for those seeking to understand and derail the seemingly unstoppable impacts of neoliberalism and managerialism in social service delivery.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011419053" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ethnography is a complex and heavily debated research method and space restrictions prevent a full discussion of its multiple aspects, philosophical positions and contestations. In brief, ethnography is a method used to study social phenomena and human society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011419053">Brewer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011419053">Fine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011419053">Seale, 2004</xref>). In one of its strongest streams, cultural anthropology, it usually involves fieldwork of at least a year’s duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011419053">Geertz, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011419053">Naroll and Cohen, 1973</xref>) though in social sciences and business research, ethnography is more commonly associated with an enhanced, team-based, intensive case work style in which findings are iterated into subsequent data collection and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011419053">Millen, 2000</xref>). Rapid ethnography (RE) is a form of multi-method ethnography involving data collection from numerous sources over a relatively short period of time including interviews, participant observations, document review and sometimes surveys and focus groups. The goal of this method is to produce a multi-layered, textured analysis of a slice of life in an organization, environment or some part of society, intertwining the structure and consciousness with the larger socio-political context shaping social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011419053">Handwerker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011419053">Szebehely, 2007</xref>). Though some cultural anthropologists are sceptical about whether short-term data blitzes can produce enough depth, RE lends itself well to social science questions because of its capacity to collect sufficiently <italic>complex</italic> descriptions of social life to permit the exploration of surface and deeper themes within the organization of everyday life, and in our case, an interpretation of workplace culture and social organization (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011419053">Szebehely, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As part of a larger research project, we have used RE in nine intensive case studies of nonprofit social services agencies (NPSS) in four countries with relatively similar welfare states (namely New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Scotland) and feel familiar with our research study and the method. However, we encountered some new challenges when we undertook RE in a large, multi-service, nonprofit, <italic>religious</italic> social service agency. Though faith-based organizations (FBO) form a significant portion of the nonprofit sector in all four countries, this is the first time we have used RE in an organization in which <italic>explicit spiritual practices</italic> were part of everyday work life. Our previous case studies involved agencies with moderately religious roots but wholly secular practices. This article will address comparative perspective RE as a valuable method for social work and comparative studies as well as some specific challenges we encountered using RE to explore workplace experience within a faith-based provider.</p>
<p>The article begins with a discussion of RE and ethnography and moves on to a discussion of our multi-country study and the larger context of the NPSS and liberal welfare states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011419053">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>). The article then proceeds to explore the advantages and challenges of undertaking comparative perspective REs in nonprofit agencies in general and in one Christian agency in specific. The article concludes with insights and recommendations for further investigation.</p>
<p>We argue here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011419053">Baines and Cunningham, accepted</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011419053">Baines, Cunningham and Fraser, 2011</xref>) that international comparisons using data collected through REs provide a useful tool for those seeking to understand and resist oppressive social relations within and across welfare states, as well as within and outside the workplace. The data reported on in this article are drawn from a larger study of the local experiences of front line social service workers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325011419053">1</xref></sup> in comparison to the experiences of similar workers in countries with distinctly similar welfare states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011419053">Esping-Anderson, 1999</xref>) that nonetheless sustain differences in the face of the monoculture of global capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011419053">Giroux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011419053">Harvey, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011419053"><title>Ethnography and rapid ethnography in brief</title>
<p>Like traditional ethnography, RE is naturalistic, in that it permits the collection of data within the everyday world of social relations and lived experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011419053">Fetterman, 2010</xref>). Naturalistic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011419053">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>) allow researchers to document social processes and interactions as they unfold, providing validity of findings through repeated interactions in the same environment with the same or similar individuals. Moreover, RE usually involves participant observation, which ‘enables us to juxtapose what people say they are up to against what they actually do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011419053">Burawoy, 1991</xref>: 2), permitting greater analytic depth and complexity.</p>
<p>Like any ethnography, researchers using RE need to be aware of their personal and professional boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011419053">Seale, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011419053">Brewer (2000)</xref> asserts, when entering other people’s life worlds it is important to try to understand that world from their perspective while still holding on to one’s perspective and analytic capacity as a researcher. Overly rigid boundaries can mean that researchers overlook opportunities for data collection or miss data altogether by failing to grasp the importance placed on various aspects of the work culture, organization, and relations. Too much permeability and the researcher is ‘captured’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011419053">Larson, 2005</xref>) or surrenders to the culture of the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011419053">Jules-Rossette, 1978</xref>), reducing or losing their capacity to explain, theorize and critique. To avoid the dangers of too much distance or over identification, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011419053">Burawoy (1991)</xref> advocates for ‘dialogue’ between the researcher and research participants, in other words ‘participation, not immersion, observation but not marginality’ (p. 5), producing a data collection that is ‘emergent rather than conclusive, critical rather than cosmetic, involving reconstruction rather than deconstruction’ (p. 7).</p>
<p>Reflexivity is the best tool to achieve the goals set by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011419053">Burawoy (1991)</xref> and is a central part of all ethnography, including RE. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011419053">Hammersley and Atkinson (2007)</xref> note ‘the concept of reflexivity acknowledges that the orientations of researchers will be shaped by their socio-historical locations, including the values and interests that these locations confer on them’ (p. 15). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011419053">Hammersely and Atkinson (2007</xref>) also argue that reflexivity is also a process that ‘bring(s) spoken and unspoken discourses and common sense ways of knowing the world on the part of the researcher and the research participants to the surface for dialogue and analysis’ (p. 15).</p>
<p>Unlike traditional ethnography, RE involves <italic>at least two researchers</italic> in all aspects of data collection. Usually these researchers are both from the same location though often one is more of an insider to the study site, while one may be less familiar with it. Familiarity with the sector requires a heightened awareness from the insider researcher regarding their preconceived notions while outsider perspectives provide an opportunity to question taken-for-granted assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011419053">Fetterman, 2010</xref>). Shared and individual reflexivity act as an effective counter-balance to, as well as a synthesis of, these two perspectives. Providing us with sharpened reflexivity and unique to this study, in all of our case studies a researcher living in the country in which the study was located was twinned with a researcher from one of the other countries. The benefits of this method are discussed in greater detail later in the article.</p>
<p>Also differing from ethnography, the presence of two (or more) researchers is key to data <italic>analysis</italic>, ensuring opportunities for shared reflection and critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011419053">Cefkin, 2009</xref>). Findings <italic>and</italic> analysis are collectively drawn from multiple data sources such as interviews, documents, participant observations, ongoing data discussions among researchers and iteration of preliminary themes through research participants. Data collection and themes iterate and compound into and enhance each other as data collection progresses. These multiple forms of data and analysis triangulate to provide for greater validity and data integrity. RE’s multiple visits also permit <italic>interactive</italic> validity testing with research participants in which preliminary themes are woven into discussions and interviews with participants and their ongoing feedback is probed (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011419053">Szebehely, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, RE has much tighter timelines than traditional ethnography. One of the techniques for speeding up data collection without sacrificing complexity and depth is the considerable amount of research work that takes place before the on-site data collection begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011419053">Millen, 2000</xref>). A substantial amount of time needs to be undertaken in detailed reviews of websites and reviewing any available reports, documents, handouts, and so forth. Pre-interviews with as many interviewees as possible are also recommended. These are often undertaken through telephone or email. The goal of pre-interviews is to ensure that participants are clear on the purposes of the study, and familiarized with ethical issues, aware of likely questions that we will ask, and how the study is likely to unfold. At this point, research participants often take the opportunity to ask questions and make comments, starting a conversation that continues and deepens during our multi-day data collection. An additional RE method involves discussions with informants outside of the agency. The goal of these discussions is to gather a larger impression of how the agency fits with the rest of the sector, in terms of notable similarities, unique aspects and so forth. In this context the insider perspective provided by the local researcher is helpful in linking the study to local concerns and debates, as well as helping people feel comfortable and willing to talk more freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473325011419053">Shah, 2004</xref>), while the outsider researcher provides a fresh set of eyes on the local way of being and is often the object of considerable interest among research participants. The opportunity to compare the perspectives of the insider and outsider researcher as well as to compare data across countries, is another way that analysis is deepened within the local context and extended beyond the single case to larger connecting and contrasting themes.</p>
<p>Though not yet widely used in the social sciences or social work, rapid ethnography (RE) is a method that is increasingly used in studies of public health, information technology and corporate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011419053">Antin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011419053">Cefkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011419053">Handwerker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011419053">Millen, 2000</xref>). Like traditional ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011419053">Brewer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011419053">Hammersley and Atkinson, 2007</xref>), RE or the blitz method focuses on: observing and interacting with research participants in their natural environment; generating an interpretation of a culture; giving voice to people in their own contexts while simultaneously placing their voices within a socially relevant context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011419053">Cefkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011419053">Szebehely, 2007</xref>). In addition to being a valuable method for exploring everyday practices and the larger social relations that shape them, RE permits international, comparative studies to flourish in a context of constrained research funding and expectations of rapid and practical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011419053">Millen, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325011419053">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011419053"><title>The study</title>
<p>Welfare state restructuring is well studied at the level of policy and theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011419053">Clarke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011419053">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>) though less is known about the impact on those working and seeking care in these new environments. For the purposes of our study we wanted to produce macro as well as fine grain analysis relatively quickly in order to share findings with the communities studied, hence we turned to qualitative methods and RE in specific. RE is an effective method for questions about pressing social problems that require relatively immediate solutions as well as contributions to a larger body of knowledge. RE is appropriate to questions involving the intersection of policy and practice (such as the impacts of funding regimes and new managerial modes on NPSS workers), as well as to questions seeking to extend theory in any number of directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011419053">Szebehely, 2007</xref>). RE is less suitable for questions requiring exclusively numerical data, longitudinal studies, or with organizations that are very insular, closed, and about which little is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011419053">Handwerker, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our larger study involves three intensive, RE case studies of nonprofit social service agencies in each of the four countries involved in the study (for twelve case studies in total; nine completed to date – three in each of Canada and Australia, two in Scotland, one in New Zealand). As noted earlier, to sharpen our international comparative analysis, for each case study, a local researcher is paired with a researcher from another country in order to provide a local, grounded perspective as well as an unacclimatized, outside perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011419053">Rubin and Rubin, 2005</xref>). The outsider-insider pairing provides an additional level of comparative perspective.</p>
<p>The agencies studied are selected on the basis of similarity and difference as we are seeking the richest possible data across the four countries and twelve agencies. All the agencies studied were fairly typical, large-sized, multi-service, multi-site agencies, providing a range of NPSS including: housing; addictions’ services; food; budgeting and income support; child and family services; elder supports; policy analysis; and referrals. The agencies all received some funding through government contracts but are also involved in fundraising to cover the costs associated with nonprofit service provision. Like the rest of the sector, the workforce is overwhelmingly female and poorly paid.</p>
<p>In RE, the goal of data collection is saturation and given the depth of literature already available on issues abutting our research question, our research question itself, extensive preparation before we enter the field and focused data collection, we find that we reach saturation relatively quickly. For example, in the case study used as an exemplar in this article, the bulk of data collection took place over one week though background information and three pre-interviews took place the week prior and one interview took place the week after. In addition, various questions were clarified with key informants over the course of the next couple of weeks as we processed the data further and sought more fulsome responses to a number of issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473325011419053">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The agency used as an exemplar in this article has an explicitly Christian mission though it claims to provide services to those of all faiths. As noted earlier, this is the first case study we have undertaken in an explicitly and actively Christian agency. To our knowledge, this is one of the first times the agency has opened itself to outside researchers. It has a long history as a closed organization – management are hired from the church and trained internally. A recently hired manager who came from the public sector facilitated our study in hopes of beginning to address the agency’s insularity. In this article, we draw heavily on the FBO case study because we found that the challenges of RE were amplified in this inward looking social services agency. However, we will also draw on findings from some of our publications on the comparative case studies, all of which followed the same methodology with only minor adaptations for local context and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011419053">Baines and Cunningham, accepted</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011419053">Baines, Cunningham and Fraser, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011419053"><title>Context of this study and the nonprofit social services</title>
<p>The larger four country, comparative study, of which this example is a part, explores changing work relations in the nonprofit sector in four countries with notably similar, but still distinctive, highly restructured and retrenched liberal welfare states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011419053">Epsing-Andersen, 1999</xref>), namely Canada, New Zealand, Scotland and Australia. In all four countries governments have moved towards privatizing human services through contracting-out. Previously a sector supplementing and extending government provision through speciality services, advocacy and community development, the NPSS has increasingly become the arm of government, providing social care and supports at lower costs to a wide range of excluded and mainstream populations no longer serviced by the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011419053">Evans and Shields, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325011419053">Van Til, 2000</xref>). Nonprofit FBOs have formed part of this outsourcing due to their reputations for thrift, flexibility in service provision and a focus on individual responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011419053">Cameron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325011419053">Smith and Sosin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Globally, social workers and other social service workers operate within a context of neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011419053">Harvey, 2005</xref>) where the private marketplace is valorized as the solution for social and personal distress, individuals are exhorted to minimize and manage their own risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011419053">Beddoe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011419053">McDonald, 2006</xref>). New Public Management (NPM) and managerialism, forms of work standardization and cost control, have become the global, hegemonic model of social service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011419053">Clarke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011419053">Ferguson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011419053">Baines and Cunningham, accepted</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011419053">Baines, Cunningham and Fraser, 2011</xref>) from our four country study highlight similarities as well as ongoing differences between and among welfare states and delivery systems suggesting that globalization is not monolithic and that some jurisdictions have experienced significant success in defending services, pre- or post-neoliberal philosophies and/or resisting New Public Management’s narrow, standardizing service models. Across the board, commonalities between and among the study sites include: increased pace and volume of work; increased use of a flexible and impermanent labour force such as contract, part-time, casual, split shift and on-call; increased workplace violence against workers; a growing sense among workers that they have few opportunities to use social justice skills or analysis on the job; and an overall increase in workplace stress, illness, burn out and staff turnover. In addition to answering our research question, these findings and examples of resistance to these trends provides valuable opportunities to build theory and practice and provides ammunition to those seeking to turn the tide of neoliberal social welfare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011419053"><title>Advantages of RE: Illustrations from the field</title>
<p>Our experiences in the FBO discussed in this article were certainly illustrative of the advantages and challenges of RE. Similar to traditional ethnography, many advantages focused on the way that naturalistic methods provide opportunities to quickly connect with participants and the data. However, the shorter timeline of RE, the pre-interviews and conversations we hold with participants ahead of time and our capacity to compare with international data seems to mean that we are folded quickly into the study site. For example, at the setting in which we had conducted some of the preliminary interviews, we were subsequently greeted by name when we arrived, asked how things were going, we were often told that various people wanted to talk to us about something they had been thinking about or discussing informally before we got there. After only a day or two, we became relatively naturalized within the setting to the point where we were invited to informal events that were peripheral to the main ‘business’ of the agency such as a tea party, a cooking class and an impromptu interview with a graduate student doing a placement in the agency. Staff often offered us additional thoughts when they bumped into us around the agency, providing us with titbits of information, gossip and analysis. These interactions contributed to our knowledge of the agency and ways to identify, understand and probe emerging themes and issues, and our sense of the culture. Though these same interactions are likely within traditional ethnography, the timeline would be much longer.</p>
<p>A further advantage in ethnographic data collection occurs when researchers are naturalised within the study site to the point where they find themselves part of everyday events, conflicts and struggles. Our preparation work facilitated this transition in a way that likely would take longer with traditional ethnography. For example, we had the opportunity to observe staff dealing with a client exhibiting challenging behaviour. This occurred when we were observing a very busy waiting room late on a Friday at the end of the month, a time when many service users are out of food and money, and housing crises occur. Our note taking was sufficiently similar to the actions of those filling out help forms that we received and exchanged several sympathetic nods from others in the waiting room. Most of the women in the waiting room had tired young children with them and exchanged knowing smiles and shrugs with our female researcher when the children needed a cuddle or did something amusing.</p>
<p>The informal connections between the researchers and service users became more palpable when an intoxicated individual began speaking loudly and inappropriately to a baby sitting on the floor. The tension in the overcrowded room rose as everyone watched the interaction in alarm and wondered who should intervene. The tension fell precipitously when two skilled staff people quietly talked the belligerent client out of the front door and arranged for transportation elsewhere. Relieved glances and rueful head shakes were exchanged among those in the waiting room. This interaction let us see staff in action in a conflicted and potentially volatile situation and not only to document the interventions but to be part of them. This kind of data is very difficult to access in its fullness and complexity through others means but in our case, it could be iterated into subsequent interviews, conversations and observations, strengthening the RE endeavour.</p>
<p>Similar to traditional ethnographic method, using multiple forms of data collection typical of RE provided effective insights into the impact of the financial disciplines of NPM on FBOs and nonprofit social service agencies in this region, though as noted earlier our preparation work and capacity to compare international insights, hastened these types of findings. One example occurred during a visit to a government funded project providing temporary accommodation for ninety homeless men. The service manager initially told us that they had funding problems and ‘limited programming for service users’. During our subsequent tour of the project, we observed multiple instances of men lying on beds or crouching in courtyards, smoking and gazing vacantly into space. The manager later confirmed that rather than limited programming, lack of resources actually meant that there was no programming available. Comparative international and insider-outsider perspectives were useful here as our international data included similar stark examples of the impacts of welfare state cutbacks on service provision which we could use to contrast and compare. On the other hand, our ‘local’ researcher was able to confirm that this phenomenon was not limited to this FBO, rather, it was prevalent throughout the nonprofit sector in that particular country. The outsider researcher was jarred by the depth of under-servicing having not encountered it to the same degree in his jurisdiction, prompting us to delve even more deeply into this issue in subsequent data collection and producing a rich line of exploration we might otherwise have missed.</p>
<p>Unlike ethnography which focuses in-depth on one site, undertaking multiple RE case studies permitted us to uncover new and often unanticipated findings, collectively analyse them, fold them into data collection, dialogue and apply international comparisons. One such finding was that agencies in Canada and Scotland experienced much higher levels of client violence against workers than either New Zealand or Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011419053">Baines and Cunningham, accepted</xref>). Subsequent data collection probed this area closely, sought explanations for these differences, and explored strategies that have been successful in addressing this complex issue. Similarly, RE permitted us to discover unique strategies workers were using to resist managerialism such as social unionism among some nonprofit agencies in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011419053">Baines, 2010</xref>). In an Australian case study we found a group of workers subversively continuing to provide ‘care’ to service users rather than the taylorised ‘technologies of support’ they had been explicitly directed to provide to highly marginalized service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011419053">Baines, Cunningham and Fraser, 2011</xref>). These findings were iterated into the case study written about here, opening new veins of data collection and analysis. In addition to being academically interesting, the common problems and unique resistance strategies displayed across the four countries studied provide useful insights for social workers and others seeking to understand and derail the seemingly unstoppable impacts of neoliberalism and globalization in social service delivery.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1473325011419053"><title>Challenges when using RE</title>
<p>Though all ethnographies face challenges with distance/closeness between the researcher and the research participants, in organizations such as the ones we studied, maintaining a credible distance/closeness is not straightforward. First, the organizations are committed to the kinds of issues that most of society seems to ignore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325011419053">Van Til, 2000</xref>) and most work under demanding conditions with poor pay. This can make it easy to over-identify with those doing a good job in difficult circumstances and/or disenchantment with and hence too much distance from, those perpetrating intended or unintended harm on vulnerable service users, co-workers and even researchers. Collective reflexivity throughout and at the end of each day was our best tool to maintain a productive distance/closeness to the data and research participants.</p>
<p>Second, nonprofit social service organizations demand a high level of altruism and commitment from their staff and staff demands the same of themselves and each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011419053">Nickson et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, employers depend on this commitment to take the edge off low wages and suboptimal working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011419053">Baines, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011419053">Evans and Shields, 2002</xref>). In a myriad of forms, this same demand for commitment to care was subtly as well as more explicitly extended to researchers as they became more naturalized within the study site. For example, the FBO agency placed great emphasis on being caring people, who ‘worked from the heart’. The researchers received instant accolades when they said or did something that was seen to be ‘from the heart’. These stories were then repeatedly and warmly told around the agency in front of the researchers providing them with an obvious cue as to the values and culture of the agency, but also how to be embraced within it.</p>
<p>In order to probe the practices of faith in the workplace, one of the researchers had developed a gentle way of posing questions about the role of prayer in everyday work. Religious staff warmed to this question and the researcher’s delivery, returning to religious themes throughout the interview generally making eye contact at these moments exclusively with the researcher who posed the original question. Not all the staff were religious but those that were seemed to want the researchers to ‘out’ themselves as Christian or at least as spiritual. This ‘outing’ of ourselves as either Christian or willing to convert seemed to contain an implicit promise that we would gain access to more interesting data, which we were very keen to get. At the same time, we wanted to avoid the marginality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011419053">Burawoy (1991)</xref> warns against (p. 5) which could easily have happened if the researchers ‘came out’ as atheists (which we are and though it likely would have endeared us to non-religious staff who similarly felt hard pressed to convert). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011419053">Burawoy’s (1991)</xref> notion of participation rather than immersion was a useful adage to remember in this context (p. 5).</p>
<p>An additional challenge lay in the fact that sometimes it was very hard to restrain incredulity and the sense that spiritualism overrode good social service practice and equal and fair access to services. Data collected early in the study and probed throughout showed that prayer and other religious practice often seemed to substitute for basic social service practices, supervision and/or human management practices. We were alerted to this issue by a mid-level supervisor during our third interview and followed it up closely with religious and non-religious staff in subsequent data collection. Though both researchers grew up in religious homes and found the spiritual ground not unfamiliar, we felt that we had to continually monitor ourselves to ensure that we did not miss things and that the views of the spiritual and non-spiritual staff were robustly presented in our data. We worked hard to connect with all participants on multiple levels despite our differences from many of them. For example, though neither author is a sports enthusiast, sports are very important in the antipodes and it tends to be an easy subject on which to build an opening rapport or to bridge a slow moment, hence we quickly became adept at talking about sports which hitherto we knew very little about.</p>
<p>A visit to an addictions rehabilitation centre permitted us a deeper understanding of the application of faith to service provision in the FBO. During agency tours researchers entered rooms that were used for individual and group therapy. The walls of the rooms were covered with religious artefacts and symbols of Christianity as well as writings reminding service users that they could not succeed in becoming addiction-free without personal spiritual transformation, Divine support and guidance. A tour of the large on-site chapel confirmed this further when we were told that it was compulsory for service users to attend regular services and prayer meetings throughout the week. A number of the research participants seemed convinced that overtly religious practices were the norm within NPSS, above criticism, and wholly legitimate, professional practice. These practices included but were not limited to: inviting clients to pray as part of initial visits and all subsequent interactions; insisting that service users attend church; and making spirituality a mandatory part of their treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of supervisors told us (and staff confirmed) that they encourage staff to join them in prayer when staff seek supervision or problem solving on their often complicated and difficult caseloads. Rather than pursue concrete changes in the workplace, supervisors and staff told us that supervisors invite staff to seek Divine intervention. In this case, our discomfort with some of the religious assertions challenged our skills at maintaining appropriate closeness and distance to the data and religious research participants. Again, team and individual reflexivity, ongoing dialogue and processing with research participants and intensive note taking throughout and after the study was the best way to remain productively connected to the project and participants.</p>
<p>On occasion we have also found it difficult to establish inter-subjectivity with unpleasant or challenging research participants. For example, in the FBO, one man was very interested in being interviewed and preliminary conversations revealed that he had an outsider’s perspective on most issues in the agency. Unfortunately, he adopted an inappropriate interest in the female member of our research team, insisting that the interview take place in the evening over drinks and making suggestive comments. Though we were very interested in his outsider’s perspective, it was hard to understand the world from his perspective when he seemed so intent on overstepping professional and personal boundaries. Though the ‘local’ researcher was inclined to normalize and ignore the participant’s behaviour, the international researcher was not and repeatedly pointed out that we had not encountered this phenomenon at other study sites and it merited more investigation in order to understand it as an exception or as a possible larger trend within the agency and country studied. In this context, the outside perspective provided by the international researcher was useful in bringing ‘to the surface taken-for-granted meanings, which tend to be assumed and glossed over when the interviewer and the interviewee are from the same culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473325011419053">Sands et al., 2007</xref>: 355; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011419053">Rubin and Rubin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The iteration and week-long intensity of the data collection seemed to amplify the challenge of maintaining appropriate levels of distance versus closeness. Increased familiarity with the agency and staff meant that intersubjectivity seemed easy to establish as all parties became acclimatized to each other (with the exception noted in the preceding paragraph). At the same time boundaries became more permeable (one of the researchers began to wonder out loud about applying for a job in a model social justice program in the agency) and practices that might have seemed incomprehensible or inappropriate at the beginning of the week (a staff member interrupting an interview to consult one of the interviewers on social work issues; researchers openly congratulating people on their hard work in a very difficult centre; one researcher tolerating harassment) become the natural extension of the relationships researchers built. Fortunately as the week went on, the credibility and richness of the data and our emerging portrait of workplace culture and relations were confirmed as we iterated preliminary findings through the research participants and received their feedback.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011419053"><title>Insularity, complexity and reflexivity</title>
<p>As noted earlier, RE is not recommended in closed and insular organizations as generally, there will be less background literature available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011419053">Handwerker, 2001</xref>). Nonetheless, in the FBO studied, we felt the potential benefits outweighed any drawbacks and we took on the challenge. Though a credible literature exists on the history of the agency, there is little or no research on its workplace functioning, service delivery or social dynamics. Compared to other RE case studies, we found we needed more time for reflexivity and processing our field notes and data. Insularity seemed to add a layer of complexity to the study. This complexity was seen in the areas of commonality among the staff and researchers as well in areas of difference. Commonalities included respect for the hard work of respondents and the care missions they took on as well as the warmth and humour exchanged throughout the project. Differences included the belief spirituality could cure the social problems of marginalized and exploited people and should be assertively offered to all of them. Boundaries of closeness and distance were more difficult to negotiate given implicit invitations to share religious commitments with some research participants and our ongoing concern that we might not be getting the whole picture at the agency because of our failure to identify as Christian, convert or at the very least identify as spiritual.</p>
<p>Though we have suggested that commonly accepted techniques (such as reflexivity, team critique and data analysis and ongoing dialogue with research participants about our sense of the workplace, its culture and larger social relations) effectively addressed these challenges in our project, further research is needed to explore the dynamics of workplace REs in the context of religious and other insular organizations. Unfortunately, our search of literature did not uncover any concrete concepts, language or measures of faith that can be applied to research across different faith traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011419053">Jeavons, 2004</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473325011419053">Sider and Unruh, 2004</xref>), making comparative studies more difficult for studies undertaken in a single country as well as those undertaken across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011419053" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Though the larger social forces known as globalization and neoliberalism have been debated at length in the social work literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011419053">Baines, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011419053">Payne and Askeland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325011419053">Wilson and Whitmore, 2000</xref>), less is known about the front line experiences of workers delivering social services in the restructured contexts shaped by these international forces, particularly in a comparative context. We argue here and elsewhere that international comparisons provide a useful tool for those seeking both to understand and resist global and local forces, and to challenge oppressive social relations within and across welfare states and workplaces.</p>
<p>RE has proven to be an effective method for our international case studies, enhancing and extending the data collection, analysis, conceptualization, and dialogue loop beyond what could be achieved through a basic qualitative study. It is possible with any method that important points may be missed or incorrect interpretations developed. In RE these potential pitfalls can be addressed in the ways discussed in this article – collective/team data collection and analysis, extensive pre-study preparation, triangulation of the data, ongoing shared and individual reflexivity and iterating preliminary findings through dialogue with research participants to further focus data collection and so forth. In our case, it also includes international comparisons and twinning an insider researcher with an outsider. This insider-outsider perspective gives the project a greater capacity to explore taken-for-granted explanations which outsiders might misinterpret and insiders might gloss over. The insularity of the FBO discussed in this article, made the case study more of a challenge and underscored the importance of RE’s emphasis on: involving more than one researcher in all aspects of data collection and analysis; ongoing shared data processing, analysis, iterating preliminary themes through subsequent data collection and comparing data internationally to sharpen data collection and analysis. In this study, this included international comparisons of the data on: funding cuts and service loss; workplace harassment; lower levels of workplace violence; and differences resulting from the explicit religious mandate of the agency.</p>
<p>Benefits of RE include depth and complexity of data, and a credible capacity to compare and contrast findings across and within countries. Global comparisons are becoming increasingly important as social problems are increasingly local and global in nature as are their solutions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011419053">Burawoy et al. (1991)</xref> assert, ethnography can be used to examine macro social relations such as neoliberalism and globalization as well as the micro, everyday relations that are shaped and respond to these dynamics. REs can do the same and in the context of increasingly tight research timelines and budgets, they contribute to theory and analysis as well as generate examples for activists and policymakers to draw on and from which to build innovative solutions and nurture hope.</p>

<fn id="fn2-1473325011419053"><label>2</label><p>The term ‘social service worker’ is used in this article as well as the term ‘social worker’. These terms have become increasingly contested as the risk society expands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011419053">Beddoe, 2010</xref>), resources shrink and elite and exclusionary forms of professionalization prevent those without formal, domestic university credentials from using the title ‘social worker’. This struggle is particularly acute in the nonprofit sector which has often employed those with foreign credentials, college or trade credentials and/or years of front line practice experience in social work positions. These groups are generally composed of racialized people, recent immigrants and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Their exclusion from the broader field of social work has broad implications, reproducing colonial, imperial and racist relations.</p></fn>
