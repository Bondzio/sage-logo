<p>5C11 antibody is a novel monoclonal antibody against human BST2 and can be used to detect activation of interferon-producing cells (IPCs). Activated IPCs, which produce large amounts of interferon-α (IFNα), are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

<p>Interferon-α (IFNα) is a type Ι IFN that not only has antiviral properties, but also causes a break of tolerance in adaptive immunity. Specifically, it promotes the differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells (DCs), and DCs strongly act as antigen-presenting cells. IFNα also activates auto-reactive T and B cells and, as a consequence, auto-antibodies are produced and immune complexes are formed.</p>
<p>IFNα is mainly produced by IFN-producing cells (IPCs), which are also called plasmacytoid dendritic cells. IPCs comprise only 0.1–0.5% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but produce 100- to 1000-fold more IFNα than other cells in response to many agents, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and TLR7 agonists such as viruses and bacterial cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs, and IFNα itself. Activated IPCs efficiently migrate from the blood or lymphoid tissues to inflammatory lesions and produce IFNα. IPCs have been identified as lineage (CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56)–/ CD4+/HLA-DR+/CD11c–/CD123+ phenotype. In 2000, blood dendritic cell antigen (BDCA)-2 (CD303), a type Π c-type lectin, was discovered as a specific marker of human IPCs. BDCA-2 is constitutively expressed in IPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312463620">1</xref></sup> Since BDCA-2 does not have an intrinsic signaling motif but rather a putative mannose specificity due to an EPN motif in its C-terminal, BDCA-2 signaling plays a role in Src family kinase-dependent calcium influx and protein tyrosine phosphorylation and results in the inhibition of IFN-α/β production in stimulated IPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312463620">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312463620">2</xref></sup> Moreover, BDCA-2, which is associated with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM)-containing signaling adapter FcR γ-chain, signals via Syk, Slp65 and PLCγ2 within a B cell receptor (BCR)-like signalsome, and the phospholipase C (PLC)γ2-protein kinase C (PKC) axis has negative regulatory effects on the nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway and inhibits type I IFN genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312463620">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, a novel 5C11 antibody has been identified that can be used to detect activated IPCs when used in combination with anti BDCA-2 mAb (Supplemental file 1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312463620">4</xref></sup> 5C11 antibody recognizes human bone marrow stroma cell antigen 2 (BST2). The expression of BST2 mRNA was observed in several immune cells including IPCs stimulated by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells and monocytes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the number of 5C11-positive cells in IPCs remarkably increased in response to stimulation with both IFNα and CpG. Consequently, 5C11 antibody turned out to be a marker for the increased expression of BST2 in activated IPCs. 5C11 antibody was also shown to have the ability to inhibit the production of IFNα by HSV-1-stimulated IPCs.</p>
<p>The administration of type Ι IFN in patients with hepatitis C, chronic myeloid leukemia, melanoma, etc. is known to induce systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome in 0.15 to 0.70% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312463620">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312463620">6</xref></sup> SLE is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by changes in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Patients with SLE have increased serum levels of IFNα, which correlate with disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312463620">7</xref></sup> Increased serum levels of IFNα in SLE patients are associated with fewer IPCs, as BDCA-2+/CD123+/HLA-DR+, in the peripheral blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312463620">8</xref></sup> In addition, the number of IPCs in PBMCs decreases as the disease gets worse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312463620">8</xref></sup> In contrast, IPCs infiltrate inflamed tissue, such as a skin lesion in SLE or tubulointerstitium and glomeruli in lupus nephritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312463620">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312463620">13</xref></sup> Cells that express intracellular IFN-alpha protein and those that contain IFN-alpha mRNA have been detected in dermal lesions as well as noninflammatory skin, and a high number of cells that expressed the IFNα-inducible protein MxA have been shown to be accumulated in affected skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312463620">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312463620">10</xref></sup> In the renal tubulointerstitium of patients with lupus nephritis, cells that were positive for BDCA-4, another surface marker of IPC, were localized more frequently in class III/IV than in class I/II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312463620">12</xref></sup> The glomerular accumulation of IPCs, as CD123+/BDCA2+ cells, was correlated with a deficient number of peripheral IPCs in lupus nephritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312463620">13</xref></sup> Based on these findings, IPCs migrate from the peripheral blood to injured tissues and produce IFNα mainly in those tissues in SLE. Therefore, activated IPCs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE.</p>
<p>Blomberg et al. also reported that PBMCs from SLE patients contained fewer BDCA-2-positive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312463620">14</xref></sup> Moreover, anti-BDCA-2 mAb inhibited the production of IFNα by PBMCs that had been stimulated by HSV-1 or SLE serum containing an endogenous IFNα-inducing factor, consisting of immune complexes containing immunoglobulin G (IgG) and DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312463620">14</xref></sup> Based on these findings, it would be ideal if anti-BDCA-2 mAb that selectively acts on activated IPCs could be obtained.</p>
<p>In this study, using this novel 5C11 antibody, we investigated the frequency of 5C11-positive cells and the effect of 5C11 antibody on the inhibition of IFNα in SLE patients.</p>

<p>We studied 39 patients (31 women and eight men) with SLE (median age 46 years; range 23–74 years). They were hospitalized or received constant outpatient treatment at the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 2005 and March 2006. All of the patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1982 revised criteria for the classification of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312463620">15</xref></sup> We excluded patients who had received a change in the dosage of steroids or immunosuppressants within the previous month, or who showed infection within the previous month, pregnancy, or serious anemia at the time of blood extraction. Twenty-nine patients were treated with prednisolone (median dosage 8 (range 0–25) mg/day), and six were treated with immunosuppressants (azathioprine in three patients, mizoribine in two, cyclosporin A in one). A modified SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) (range 0–105), which is an index of disease activity, was elevated in 34 patients (median score was 7 (range 0–27)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312463620">16</xref></sup> Nephritis was present in 16 patients, arthralgia in nine, alopecia in nine, new skin rash in seven, fever above 38°C in six, oral ulcer in three, pleuritis in three, myalgia in two, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in two. Biochemical data showed the elevation of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNA) in 28 patients (median 23 (range 0–400) IU/ml), hypocomplementemia (CH50 below 31.8  units/ml, C3 below 65 mg/dl or C4 below 13 mg/dl) in 21, leukocytopenia (white blood cell count below 3000/mm<sup>3</sup>) in three, and thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) in one. Seventeen healthy volunteers (13 women and four men) were members of our department, and their median age was 40 years (range 31–79 years). The Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, approved this study protocol, and all of the subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961203312463620"><title>Preparation of PBMCs</title>
<p>Blood samples, obtained from SLE patients and healthy controls, were collected in heparinized syringes (30-ml syringe, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), and PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation. Cells were washed twice with RPMI1640 medium (Sigma, Irvine, UK) through 70 µm cell strainers (BD Falcon, NJ, USA) and suspended at a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 unit/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), HEPES (10 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (50 mM) (Sigma), L-glutamin (200 mM) and pyruvate (100 mM) (Gibco, Aukland, NZ).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312463620"><title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>The isolated PBMCs were applied to sample tubes at 5 × 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/tube, centrifuged at 80 <italic>g</italic> × 5 minutes, and washed twice, and buffer for flow cytometry (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) + 2 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) (Gibco)) 8 μl + FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) (2 μl) was added to each tube. The antibodies listed below were each added at an appropriate concentration that was determined previously, and PBMCs were incubated at room temperature under shaded conditions for 20 minutes. The cells were collected and washed twice, and buffer was added to give a final volume of 400 μl/tube. At least 1 × 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were acquired. Three- or four-color staining was analyzed by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD). The antibodies used for flow cytometry were as follows: 5C11 (produced by SBI Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) labeled by an Alexa Flour 488 Protein Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA), anti-BDCA-2-phycoerythrin (PE) (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), anti-CD3-PE, anti-CD19-PE, anti-CD14-PE and anti-CD69-allophycocyanin (APC), and, as isotype controls, rat IgG2a, κ isotype control-Alexa Flour 488, mouse IgG2a, κ isotype control-PE, mouse IgG1, κ isotype control-PE, and mouse IgG1, κ isotype control-APC (BD Pharmingen). Propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to eliminate dead cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312463620"><title>IFNα induction cultures</title>
<p>PBMCs were suspended in 96-well U-bottom plates (BD) at a final concentration of 1 × 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/250 μl/well. To eliminate azide, 5C11 antibody, anti-BDCA-2 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) and, as an isotype control, purified rat IgG (MP Bio Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were dialyzed by Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce Biotechnology, IL, USA). Each antibody was added to the cell medium at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml (only anti-BDCA-2 mAb) or 20 µg/ml. Thirty minutes later, CpG2216 (5′-ggGGGACGATCGTCgggggG-3′, 1 μM, Fasmac, Kanagawa, Japan) was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C in 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> in air for 24 hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203312463620"><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p>The concentration of IFNα in the supernatant after centrifugation was measured by ELISA, using an IFNα module set (Bender MedSystems, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by a microplate reader (Wallac ARVO sx1420 MULTILABEL COUNTER, PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203312463620"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between SLE patients and the healthy controls. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlations between the number of 5C11-positive cells and SLE parameters (SLEDAI, dsDNA, serum IFNα, dose of prednisolone and age), and the Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the correlations between the number of 5C11-positive cells and SLE symptoms. The entire analysis was performed using JMP6 software (SAS Institute, NC, USA). <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0961203312463620"><title>5C11 antibody inhibited the production of IFNα by CpG-treated PBMCS</title>
<p>Since 5C11 antibody inhibited the production of IFNα by HSV-1-treated IPCs from healthy controls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312463620">4</xref></sup> we investigated whether it has a similar effect on stimulated PBMCs from SLE patients. We stimulated PBMCs from SLE patients and healthy controls by treatment with CpG2216 (a bacterial DNA that contains unmethylated CpG motifs) as a TLR9 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312463620">Figure 3</xref>). 5C11 antibody (20 µg/ml) significantly inhibited IFNα production under stimulation by CpG in both groups (inhibition rates were SLE: 27% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), control: 24% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007)), but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In addition, anti-BDCA-2 mAb (5 µg/ml) significantly inhibited the production of IFNα (inhibition rates were SLE: 93% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), control: 62% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003)), and its inhibitory ability was superior in SLE patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016). In both groups, the inhibitory effect of 5C11 antibody (20 µg/ml) on IFNα production was inferior to that of anti-BDCA-2 mAb (5 µg/ml). Thus, 5C11 antibody inhibited the production of IFNα from PBMCs stimulated by CpG, and its inhibitory ability in SLE patients was similar to that in healthy controls.

<p>This study demonstrated that SLE patients had a significantly higher proportion of 5C11-positive cells, especially among BDCA-2+ cells. The 5C11 antibody is a monoclonal antibody against human BST2 and detects activation of IPCs. The greater proportion of 5C11-positive cells among BDCA-2+ cells in SLE patients was considered to be due to the greater amount of IFNα and the higher activity level in SLE. However, in contrast to our expectations, there was no correlation between the proportion of 5C11-positive cells in BDCA-2+ cells and either the level of serum IFNα or indicators of disease activity, such as titers of SLEDAI and dsDNA. Since the number of IPCs is decreased by steroids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312463620">17</xref></sup> 5C11-positive cells are also considered to be affected by steroids or immunosuppressants. Unfortunately, we couldn’t analyze above correlation by dividing patients into groups of steroid-treated or steroid-naïve because of the too small number of patients of the latter.</p>
<p>5C11 antibody significantly inhibited the production of IFNα by CpG-treated PBMCs of SLE patients. Under stimulation with CpG, the percent inhibition of IFNα production by 5C11 antibody was 27%, and was inferior to that with anti-BDCA-2 mAb (93%). This result suggests that the major IFNα-producing cells are 5C11-negative-BDCA-2-positive cells under stimulation via TLR9. Our result regarding the effect of anti-BDCA-2 mAb agrees with a previous report in which the same TLR9 ligand HSV-1 was used to stimulate SLE-PBMCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312463620">14</xref></sup> Therefore, 5C11 antibody inhibited the production of IFNα by PBMCs in SLE, and it had only a partial effect under stimulation by a TLR9 agonist.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the inhibition of IFNα by 5C11 antibody has not been clarified. However, recent reports showed that BST2 serves as the ligand for immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312463620">18</xref></sup> The interaction between BST2 and ILT7 initiates signaling via the ILT7-FcεRiγ complex and strongly inhibits production of IFN by IPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312463620">19</xref></sup> Therefore, the binding of the 5C11 antibody to its target BST2 may cause activation of BST2. This effect is not specific to SLE patients, as the decreased production of IFN by the 5C11 antibody was also observed in control patients.</p>
<p>The proportions of 5C11-positive cells among T and B cells were also significantly increased in patients with SLE. BST2, the target of 5C11 antibody, is expressed on various cells, including IPCs, T cells, B cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312463620">Figure 1a</xref> of the Supplemental file 1). In addition, Blasius et al. reported that the expression of BST2 is up-regulated on most cell types after stimulation with IFN in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312463620">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the high proportion of 5C11-positive T and B cells may reflect the activation of T and B cells in patients with SLE. To specifically detect the activation of IPCs, 5C11 antibody should be used in combination with anti-BDCA-2 mAb.</p>
<p>More recently, treatments that seek to reduce IFNα in SLE have been performed. In particular, the injection of anti-IFNα mAb in SLE patients resulted in a reduction of clinical disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312463620">21</xref></sup> Anti-BDCA-2 mAb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312463620">14</xref></sup> anti-type Ι IFN receptor mAb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312463620">22</xref></sup> and targeting of TLR7 and TLR9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312463620">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312463620">24</xref></sup> are also considered to be candidates for therapy in SLE. BST2, an antigen of 5C11 antibody, is expressed on various immune cells, and therefore we speculate that 5C11 antibody also affects the production of other cytokines or other functions that play important roles in the pathogenesis of SLE. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of 5C11 antibody in the function of each type of cell in SLE.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides new information that 5C11 antibody may be a useful marker for examining the number of activated IPCs in patients with SLE. Moreover, 5C11 antibody does not completely inhibit the production of IFNα, and therefore it may be useful to combine standard therapies with 5C11 antibody. Further investigation of 5C11-positive IPCs in both peripheral blood and injured tissues, or of the subset of 5C11-positive cells among T and B cells and other immune cells, may help to establish 5C11 antibody as a useful biomarker in patients with SLE.</p>
