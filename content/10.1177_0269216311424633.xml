<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) was first introduced by Anderson and Downing in 1996 as a new tool to measure the performance status of palliative care patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311424633">1</xref></sup> and has been used for communication, analysis of home nursing care workload, profiling admissions and discharges to the hospice unit and prognostication. The PPS has been translated into other languages, including French, Japanese, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Thai. The Thai version is known as the Thai PPS Adult Suandok, where the word Suandok is representative of the University Hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand and means ‘field of flowers’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311424633">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several articles on the reliability and validity of the PPS have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311424633">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311424633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311424633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311424633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311424633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311424633"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311424633"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311424633">10</xref></sup> A formal study by Ho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311424633">11</xref></sup> showed high intraclass correlation (0.96) and consistency (Cohen’s kappa 0.67). Other documented areas where the PPS is used include monitoring the impact of disease progression and care planning. In the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311424633">12</xref></sup> on Collaborative Care Plans, the PPS was one of the assessment tools recommended. In another article on advance planning and palliative care in nursing homes in the USA, Levy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311424633">13</xref></sup> also used the PPS for prognostication and palliative care interventions. The BC Pharmacare Program of British Columbia, Canada, contains a guideline for their Palliative Drug Benefit Program, stating that eligible patients have to be in the terminal stage of illness with a six-month prognosis, and the entry point is usually PPS 50% or lower.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311424633">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Ho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311424633">11</xref></sup> demonstrated PPSv2 as reliable and valid, it is unclear if the Thai PPS Adult Suandok translation has similar values in the Thai culture for palliative care patients. PPSv2 is a new tool in several medical and nursing schools in Thailand. The Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai (MNCM) hospital is the first hospital to use the Thai PPSv2 Adult Suandok translation for assessing the performance status of palliative care patients. They identify three groups of palliative care patients in the MNCM hospital: patients with incurable and serious illness who are terminal; cancer patients at all stages; and non-cancer end-of-life patients. Currently, MNCM hospital is the first known hospital globally to use the PPS regularly for these three groups of patients in their 1400-bed hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311424633">15</xref></sup> PPSv2 has already been found useful as one component of the Suandok Palliative Care Model, which includes a palliative care Collaborative Care Plan-Lite (CCP) modified from that of Queen’s University in Canada and Cancer Care Ontario.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311424633">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311424633">16</xref></sup> This CCP divides palliative care patients into three categories using PPS levels: PPS 100%–70% as stable, PPS 60%–40% as transitional and PPS 30%–0% as end of life.</p>
<p>The Thai PPS Adult Suandok now requires reliability testing and the specific objectives are to examine the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the Thai PPS tool by clinicians using a set of simulated palliative care patient case scenarios and to examine the validity of the Thai PPS by content validation and surveying clinicians on its purpose and usefulness.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216311424633">
<title>Research design</title>
<p>The study used a case format similar to Ho et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311424633">11</xref></sup> translated to Thai language. A set of 22 simulated palliative care patients’ cases were based on real patient scenarios but modified for anonymity and contained brief descriptions of each case’s demographics, primary diagnosis, medical, social and family history, signs and symptoms, medications and care plan. The cases from the Ho et al. study were reviewed and reaffirmed by the authors. An early version of the Thai translation of PPSv2 was completed a year prior to the study by the palliative nursing team. A back translation was completed and corroborated by an academic expert at Chiang Mai University, which was then reviewed and accepted by palliative experts in Victoria. Two interpretive changes were made to create the official Thai PPS Adult Suandok, which did not alter the meaning of the Thai table: ‘total care’ was translated as ‘total assistance’ and ‘mouth care only’ as ‘nothing per oral.’ A few changes in the instructions and case examples were minor and not substantive. PPSv2 is shown in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0269216311424633">Appendix</xref> to demonstrate where these interpretive changes were noted in context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311424633">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited via purposive and convenience sampling consisting of staff nurses in palliative care units, general medical and surgical, gynecology, radiation therapy and orthopedic departments, and also oncology nurses and physicians who work in MNCM hospital and care for palliative care patients. They may or may not have been currently using the Thai PPS. Sample size calculations were based on the Ho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311424633">11</xref></sup> study with a minimum required of 44 raters. Letters of Invitation were sent out to staff until a maximum of 70 participants were enrolled.</p>
<p>In Part A participants reviewed and scored the 22 cases (Time-1 data). Two weeks later, all participants were sent a second package to complete a re-test of the same cases but re-ordered at random (Time-2 data). The data was entered into an Excel spreadsheet and anonymized before analysis. In Part B participants were surveyed to elicit feedback on their perceived usefulness and to determine the validity of the PPS. A thematic analysis process was used in initially transcribing the results and after repeated readings of the data, meaning units were identified, reviewed and grouped by the word and meaning patterns into themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216311424633">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data was analyzed for inter- and intra-rater reliability using the single rating intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for absolute agreement and for consistency using two-way random-effects models. The ICCs were obtained for each time period. Single rating measures were used because interest in this study is on ICC measures for individual raters rather than averages of independent measures.</p>
<p>Participant reliability was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa, which is a chance-corrected measure of agreement between two participants. Strictly speaking, the derivation of the standard error for kappa depends on the raters acting independently of one another.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311424633">17</xref></sup> Therefore, the standard errors are subject to error since here the same rater is used at the two time periods. Rater reliability was also evaluated using a randomized block analysis of variance (ANOVA) incorporating the rater as a random effect. This analysis accommodates the dependent nature of the data, where the same rater is providing observations for both time points. It allows evaluation of the effects over time and possible interactions of time with the cases.</p>
<p>Individual case results are also shown by cross-tab table, box plots and comparison for each case with the previous expert group’s indication of PPS scores. The data for the reliability portion of the study was analyzed using SPSS 15.0 and R version 2.11.0 software. Part B of the validation section was performed through content validation of surveys with palliative staff at MNCM hospital, discussing their experiences using the PPS. The study was reviewed by and received ethics approvals from both the Chiang Mai University Faculty of Medicine and the University of Victoria Research Ethics Boards.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 70 participant raters consisting of 51 nurses and 19 physicians who completed both time periods. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311424633">table 1</xref> the Time-1 ICC for absolute agreement is 0.911 (95% CI 0.86–0.96) and for consistency is 0.92 (95% CI 0.87–0.96). The Time-2 ICC for agreement is 0.905 (95% CI 0.85–0.95) and for consistency is 0.912 (95% CI 0.86–0.96). These findings indicate good agreement among participants and the scores are somewhat higher in the Time-2 re-test phase. Cohen’s kappa score is 0.55, which demonstrates a moderate agreement according to Landis and Koch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311424633">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>Example quotes from thematic analysis show the PPS as useful for decision making and care planning where one physician stated that when the PPS level was below 30%, he would ‘advise the patients and family members about palliative care.’ Three respondents said they ‘use the PPS level as the cut point for the treatments of the patients: surgery or no surgery; curative treatment or palliative care.’ Another noted that ‘when the PPS level is lower quickly, it means that the patients have lower self-care. We will provide more nursing care and health education to the patients and family members.’ Several nurses stated that the PPS level ‘helps us to provide palliative care as a guideline of multidisciplinary collaborative care plan’ where they categorize three groups of PPS scores, 0%–30%, PPS 40%–60% and PPS 70%–100%, to guide information and care plans.</p>
<p>Regarding nursing care, one person stated that ‘the PPS level can be used in the plan for nursing and nursing productivity, prognosis and the symptoms of the patients when we transfer the patient to another ward’ and another nurse said, ‘when the patients have a PPS score in the lower level, the nurses will recognize that these patients need more nursing care than usual.’</p>
<p>Some problems were also noted by 39% of those using the PPS. Although several people felt the instructions and definitions were too long or unclear (four people), others wanted more details to help determine the PPS level in patients with jejunostomy tubes or who are paraplegic. One nurse felt that it was hard to assess in cerebrovascular disease patients and requested ‘more explanation about movement and eating for using in these patients.’ Another thought it difficult to decide the PPS level in patients who have unstable symptoms. Four people found it hard to make decisions about ‘which PPS level is the best fit, what to do with PPS % level scores that fall in between two levels’ and requested finer gradations of PPS percentage. In addition, four nurses found occasional differences between the first and the second nurse when assessing the PPS level in the same patient.</p>
<p>Finally, although acknowledging its value as a communication tool, one nurse noted that ‘many physicians and medical students did not know about PPSv2 and thought there should be more teaching about PPSv2 to have much benefit in clinical care.’</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the inter- and intra-rater reliability testing indicate that the Thai PPS Adult Suandok is a reliable tool and consistent with the original expert group’s determination of correct PPS scores in the Ho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311424633">11</xref></sup> study. This is of particular note in that this study included more participants and each participant completed all 22 cases as compared to one-half of that in the other. The kappa score of 0.55 is somewhat lower than that in the Ho et al. study of 0.67 and 0.71, and although 0.55 is acceptable as moderate agreement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311424633">18</xref></sup> a future detailed study of psychometric properties of the Thai version would help to clarify. Although 39% of survey participants noted some difficulty in using the PPS, it is unclear whether translation accuracy, cultural influences or varying familiarity with the use of the PPS may account for this. However, with only two interpretation issues during the back translation, both palliative groups felt the Thai translation was accurate. In addition, there were only minor word alterations in the 22 cases and the Thai palliative team was confident with the types of cases and issues within the study, thereby reducing the likelihood of cultural misinterpretation. Although 33% of participants were new or had used the PPS for less than six months, 99% felt it was clinically useful and 81% agreed the instructions were adequate and useful.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, there is face validity that Thai clinicians find the PPS a useful tool for care planning, transition and disease monitoring, prognostication, discharge planning and for information for patients and families. The difficulties in using the PPS in patients with neurological deficits or intake diversion (e.g. J-tubes) are not unique to the Thai culture. The Ho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311424633">11</xref></sup> study found similar challenges and, as a result, a Q&amp;A document is available with details and cases that were sent by clinicians to Victoria over several years, and many have found these clarifications helpful in teaching and to enhance accurate usage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311424633">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of additional note is that in the MNCM hospital, the PPS is currently being used for patients on many wards on a weekly or a daily basis. This is unique and the authors are unaware of such use anywhere else globally. Although there has been anecdotal criticism on various wards in using a ‘palliative’ tool for all patients, it can be implemented when viewed as a functional assessment tool only and consideration could be given to using the term ‘patient performance scale’ to reduce concerns. In those situations, patient PPS scores may well improve post-operatively or following stroke or vehicle accidents. This area of use is new and unexplored.</p>
<p>A significant limitation of this study is that the cases are paper based. Even though they were drawn from real patient situations, it is unclear whether similar reliability would occur if clinicians had actually examined the patients. This would have been impractical and unethical to have 70 people do this, especially on two separate occasions, but does limit the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>In summary, these results affirm that clinicians can use the Thai PPS Adult Suandok tool with reasonable confidence in its reliability when assessing the functional status of palliative care patients. Although fairly simple to learn and use, some staff at the MNCM hospital felt more details and instructions are needed, but then found it useful for daily or weekly practice. PPSv2 helps to monitor the progress of functional ability and disease trajectory. PPSv2 is very useful in communication about palliative care patients among nurses and physicians. It has been incorporated into a collaborative care plan guideline based on three groups of PPS levels. Future studies should assess its clinical value, both in hospital and community settings, for communication, functional assessment and prognostication within the Thai culture.</p>
