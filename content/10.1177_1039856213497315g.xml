<p>This is a momentous year for The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) as the College celebrates its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The College was officially incorporated in Sydney in October 1963, evolving from the earlier Australasian Association of Psychiatrists which was established in 1946.</p>
<p>There have been many events held already to celebrate this wonderful milestone and there are more planned for the second half of the year. Central to our celebrations was our annual Congress – appropriately themed <italic>Achievements and Aspirations</italic> – which was recently held in Sydney, Australia from 26 to 30 May 2013. As part of the Congress 2013 program the College hosted the first RANZCP Asia-Pacific Mental Health Forum (APMHF).</p>
<p>The Forum was a culmination of the focus and work on increasing our links with the Asia-Pacific and was aptly planned to occur at the 2013 Congress in Sydney celebrating our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Presidents of regional psychiatric associations, Chief Psychiatrists and other leaders in mental health from the Asia-Pacific region were invited to attend the Forum, with College support to those individuals from poorly resourced nations. The Forum offered an opportunity to discuss the most urgent issues and priority areas in mental health, and for the profession of psychiatry, in each country.</p>
<p>We hoped that the Forum would facilitate the development of regional partnerships and linkages and identify ways in which we can work together in the future. The response from our regional partners was enthusiastic and identified an acceptance that Australia and New Zealand was a part of the Asia-Pacific community. Almost all that were invited accepted the invitation, or sent a representative to attend in their place.</p>

<p>The Asia-Pacific Mental Health Forum was held on Tuesday 28 May 2013 over three sessions in order to accommodate a presentation from all the countries represented. On the day of the Forum there were 22 representatives from 14 regional nations giving presentations, plus a presentation from Australia and New Zealand, and the President of the Asian Federation of Psychiatric Associations. The 14 regional nations were: Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan, India, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Papua New <italic>Guinea</italic>, Vanuatu, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan. A trainee psychiatrist from Samoa, who was in Sydney for Congress, also attended the Forum and gave insights into the mental health service delivery challenges in Samoa. Some individuals were unable to attend due to visa difficulties or obligations to their Ministries, which highlighted some of the additional burdens some of our neighbours face.</p>
<p>All of the presentations were thought provoking and highlighted the challenges faced by our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. The issue of a lack of mental health services and workforce is a common issue affecting our region, but we in Australia and New Zealand are relatively well supplied. The presentation from India noted a treatment gap of between 50–90%, and while there are currently 3000 psychiatrists in India, to meet demand for services they need at least 11,500. Furthermore the majority of psychiatrists trained in India migrate to work in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. In Vanuatu, there are no psychiatrists practising at all. Statistics such as these were a common theme emerging from the Forum. They show that there is a great need for improved mental health services across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Geographical challenges, including large rural populations, stigma surrounding mental illness and poor funding for mental health services were also significant issues that were discussed during the Forum. The delegate from Bangladesh, Professor Rabbani, noted that 72% of the population live in rural areas; however, there were no psychiatrists practising outside the major cities. During the Papua New Guinea presentation by Dr Hagali, it was noted that there are 860 languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, a fact which obviously poses challenges for their five active psychiatrists.</p>
<p>However, while the challenges facing mental health in the Asia-Pacific region are significant, there was also a genuine sense of hope and optimism amongst those that gathered in Sydney. The numbers of psychiatrists in the region is low; however, the work done by so few with so little to help so many, is inspiring. There are also some positive signs that change may be on the horizon. The presentation from Professor Hong from China noted that after 13 years in development, new mental health legislation has recently been introduced.</p>

<p>The Forum participants discussed what types of collaborations could be beneficial across the region. It was agreed that a central, online resource containing both educational and clinical information would be useful. Improving access to information and learning materials was mentioned many times throughout the Forum, and the College is committed to developing a resource to facilitate this.</p>
<p>The delegates also agreed to investigate ways to support students, trainees and young psychiatrists and share resources that will help up-skill the regional mental health workforce. The College will soon be developing a Diploma in Mental Health and a Certificate in Mental Health for use in Australia and New Zealand, and it is hoped that these may also be able to be adapted for use in the wider Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Building the RANZCP’s links with the Asia-Pacific region has been one of the key projects of my presidency, and it was gratifying to see this Forum come to fruition. I am confident that the College and the new President Dr Murray Patton will continue to grow and strengthen these partnerships in the years to come.</p>
