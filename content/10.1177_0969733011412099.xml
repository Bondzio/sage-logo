<abstract>
<p>When people die suddenly and unexpectedly ethical issues often come to the fore. The aim of the study was to describe experiences of members of stroke teams in stroke units of ethical problems and how the teams manage the situation when caring for patients faced with sudden and unexpected death from stroke. Data were collected through four focus group interviews with 19 team members in stroke-unit teams, and analysed using interpretive content analysis. Three themes emerged from the analysis characterized by information, decisions about care and support for the next-of-kin in the changing and uncertain situation, with mutual trust as the core. Mutual trust, both within the stroke team and with next-of-kin was seen by the stroke-team members as a way of handling ethical problems by administering care with the patient’s best interest at heart.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The focus of this study is sudden and unexpected death due to stroke and the ethical problems experienced by stroke-team members working in this care context.</p>
<p>By 2004, cerebrovascular diseases were, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the second leading cause of death in the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412099">1</xref>
</sup> In Sweden, the UK and the USA, stroke is the third leading cause of death.<sup>

</sup> More than 33,000 people in Sweden suffered a stroke in 2008,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412099">5</xref>
</sup> of whom 80% were over 65 years of age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011412099">4</xref>
</sup> During 2005–7 over 22%, or about 6000, first time stroke victims died per year in Sweden, approximately 3400 of them being cared for in hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412099">5</xref>
</sup> Approximately 1900, or 7.8%, of nearly 25,000 patients recorded in the Swedish National Stroke Register in 2008, died during the first week after the onset of stroke. Strategies for stroke management have been set up by WHO and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare covering five aspects: organization of services, management of acute stroke, prevention, rehabilitation and evaluation of outcome, and common goals for stroke unit care in Europe for 2015.<sup>

</sup> It is highly recommended that care in stroke units (SUs) should be provided by teams comprising stroke physicians and trained nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011412099">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412099">7</xref>
</sup> The participating countries have reached various stages towards achieving the goals.</p>
<p>There is much research focusing on ethical problems in the care of dying patients both in general and in specific care contexts such as palliative,<sup>

</sup> and next-of-kin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011412099">18</xref>
</sup> Within the area of stroke, studies focus on ethical aspects of the medical treatment of stroke,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412099">19</xref>
</sup> that is the possibilities of obtaining informed consent to participate in studies due to cognitive impairment<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011412099">20</xref>
</sup> or making decisions concerning one’s own care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412099">21</xref>
</sup> Research into sudden death (sudden infant death excluded) has been carried out mainly in the context of acute or critical care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011412099">22</xref>
</sup> No studies have been found focusing specifically on patients dying as a result of acute stroke from any perspective at all. The question, therefore, is what experience the SU teams have of managing ethical problems in the care of patients facing sudden and unexpected death due to stroke. According to Doane et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412099">23</xref>
</sup> neither ethical ‘knowledge-in-action’ nor how ethical praxis is shaped by different contexts and situations have been widely studied. Knowledge concerning ethical problems in the area of stroke, or arising as a result of acute stroke, is lacking. Findings from other areas cannot simply be transferred to this context since stroke seems to influence the situation in specific ways, not least since it can affect a person’s cognitive functions. Is it the suddenness and unexpectedness of the occurrence or is it the unpredictability of the outcome that affects the situation? Is it the general view in the public that stroke is a subversive and debilitating, but not fatal, illness? Since stroke is a common disease worldwide, this is an issue of widespread interest.</p>

<title>Focus group</title>
<p>Focus group interviews (FGIs) were chosen as the method for collecting data from team members in stroke care units. FGIs are interviews focused on a predetermined topic for discussion. In this study the topic was experiences of ethical problems among stroke-team members. FGIs are led by a moderator<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412099">24</xref>
</sup> and the first author (ÅR) took on this role. Since the FGIs had a limited number of participants no co-researcher participated during data collection. In FGIs, participants have something in common<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412099">24</xref>
</sup> and in this study it was the context of stroke care and the experiences of ethical problems associated with sudden and unexpected death from stroke. This common factor is fundamental for the sharing of experiences and for encouraging the participants to feel comfortable in the situation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412099">24</xref>
</sup> FGIs are used in several disciplines and have been shown to be useful in qualitative research since they can generate valuable knowledge in a care context and deal effectively with sensitive issues.<sup>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was carried out in SUs in four collaborating county hospitals in western Sweden, which provided both acute and rehabilitative stroke care following national and international guidelines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412099">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011412099">8</xref>
</sup> The collaboration has been in place for several years and concerns both clinical and practical issues, and they had developed a common local care programme. All patients within the catchment area afflicted by stroke were cared for on these SUs. No selection was made according to factors such as age, stroke severity, co-morbidity or previous vitality. The SUs differed in size and had 8–18 beds. The teams consisted of physicians, nurses and enrolled nurses, and represented one way of working together since they were loosely assembled from staff on duty that particular day and shift. Therefore, the staff that constituted the teams changed from day to day and shift to shift.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733011412099">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Nineteen team members caring for patients who are dying due to acute stroke participated in the focus groups. All team members working in the participating SUs were offered the opportunity to participate. Those who were interested in participating were included and comprised four men and 15 women, physicians, nurses and enrolled nurses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011412099">Table 1</xref>). Team members from all professions participated in each focus group. This was a conscious decision since it was the teams' overall experiences of ethical problems that were of interest. Three focus groups were of mixed gender and one consisted of women only. As the participants knew each other it was possible to establish an open and permissive climate in the interview situation, intended to encourage the emergence of different approaches.<sup>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The FGIs were conducted in premises near the respective SUs by the first author, and lasted for 52–78 minutes (median 65 minutes). They were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim shortly afterwards. The questions used were developed in the research group following Krueger and Casey,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412099">24</xref>
</sup> using what is called the ‘questioning route’. The FGIs started with an opening question where all the participants were asked to tell a little about themselves and their background as team members in the SU. The question was designed to give everyone an opportunity to speak and break the ice. The main question then asked was: ‘Can you describe a situation or event where you experienced an ethical problem while caring for patients faced with sudden death due to stroke?’ The FGIs proceeded as conversations where the participants talked about situations when they had experienced ethical problems and how they had managed them. The conversations flowed easily and almost without the moderator having to interfere. The moderator could thus be relatively passive except for asking some follow-up or clarifying questions or bringing the participants back to the subject as the participants spoke spontaneously and in an involved way about the subject. While ethical problems are generally defined as problems where core values or fundamental obligations are present,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412099">28</xref>
</sup> in this study the participants' own sense of what constituted ethical problems was not questioned since it was their experience that was of interest, not the ethical validity of the problem. The participants' way of talking about what they thought of as ethical problems was that these were problems experienced in care where two or more ideas about how the situation should be solved were present and where, from the team members' view, competing values were set against each other.<sup>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Interpretative content analysis was used for the analysis, in this case on transcriptions of FGIs, based on Krippendorff’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011412099">29</xref>
</sup> and Baxter’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011412099">30</xref>
</sup> descriptions of content analysis. The focus was ethical problems experienced by the team members. The aim when using content analysis is to understand the significance for the team and what this understanding means. The analysis was inspired by Baxter’s description of a thematic analysis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011412099">30</xref>
</sup> having a red thread linking all the themes. Initially the texts from each FGD were read separately by the different authors from their various perspectives and each made their own analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011412099">29</xref>
</sup> The aim was to read the texts as researchers not as nurses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011412099">29</xref>
</sup> and awareness and use of pre-understanding was important. The transcripts were read as a whole and summarized. Semantic meaning units were selected, guided by the aim of the study, and then condensed, abstracted and coded. Codes from all FGIs were brought together and sorted, resulting in a total of 290 codes, which were grouped into preliminary themes, tested and modified. The second and third authors checked the first author’s analysis. This procedure is called analytical induction<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011412099">30</xref>
</sup> and allows the discovery and testing of themes emerging from the data. The themes were considered in relation to each other to find what differentiated them and finally three themes remained. The ‘red thread’ tied the themes together and a core emerged.</p>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board, Gothenburg, Sweden (dnr 615–08) and permission was obtained from the director of each SU. The FGIs were carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011412099">31</xref>
</sup> where oral and written information was given to each participant and informed consent was obtained. The voluntary nature of participation and the possibility to withdraw without prejudice was explained to the participants. Confidential handling of the data to protect the identity of participants from those outside the FGIs was ensured but the participants were made aware that it would not be possible to create confidentiality within the FGIs.</p>

<sec id="section11-0969733011412099">
<title>To give information when conditions are unstable</title>
<p>To give information in situations of sudden and unexpected death from stroke was experienced by the team members as central and related to several ethical problems since the situation was experienced as unstable. When patients have been afflicted by severe stroke, the team members initially experienced uncertainty about the patients' survival. Stroke can lead to either sudden death or to the patient’s survival, which for the team makes giving information to next-of-kin very important. Team members stated that the next-of-kin were unprepared for the stroke and were in shock, which was experienced as creating difficulties regarding what they understood and could come to terms with. The teams' experiences were that information needs to be given repeatedly if the next-of-kin are to understand and have faith in the care team:<disp-quote>
<p>If it doesn’t work that day, maybe you should have the same discussion the day after because then it might have sunk in for the next-of-kin, then they have so to say been thinking about what kind of life you actually save them [the patients] for. (Enrolled Nurse, FGI:4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The team members wanted to create confidence in the next-of-kin by providing information early on in the treatment. They experienced that this facilitated continuous contact and avoided conflicts arising:<disp-quote>
<p>If you don’t take time with them [the next-of-kin] there are just hassles afterwards with questions and notifications and all sorts of things and then it will be even worse so you have to bear that in mind too that the next-of-kin must have full information, they need to be on track, if they aren’t there’s a lot of notifications and paperwork and clutter with discontented relatives. (Physician, FGI:2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The team members explained that they did not have time to establish a relationship with the dying person because of the suddenness of the incident. Through information from the next-of-kin, they felt able to share in the patient’s history, which was stated as important for giving individualized care:<disp-quote>
<p>Patients who are so bad, those we don’t get any contact with in a conscious state and then we don’t get to know the patient. In that sense we are very dependent on next-of-kin telling us what the patient was like before or how they want things because you don’t meet them when they’re healthier. (Nurse, FGI:1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Since the prerequisites for patients' survival were perceived to change as their condition was critical and unstable, the teams said it was important that all staff gave information continuously, and emphasized that decisions made could be changed if the patient’s condition changed. These strategies were used to assure the next-of-kin that the best care was being given in the current situation. The teams experienced that the next-of-kin responded to different messages in the information and held on to what they wanted to hear. They said they needed to be clear about what they knew and did not know, to dare to say that they were not certain what the outcome would be and to avoid giving mixed messages:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s very unfortunate if the next-of-kin gets different messages from different doctors, they are torn between hope and despair then. (Physician, FGI:3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The purpose of giving information was said to be to create agreement about decisions but, in the teams' experience, it was related to difficulties when the situation is uncertain. The team members said they experienced it as difficult also because it is time-consuming and it was therefore not always prioritized. Instead of spending time and effort developing a trusting relationship with the next-of-kin, the team members might resort to treatments such as intravenous fluids. This means the next-of-kin never get the opportunity to discuss and agree upon reasons for giving or not giving various treatments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733011412099">
<title>To decide on care when the situation is changing</title>
<p>The teams said they experienced difficulties in making decisions about care for those patients suffering from severe stroke because of the changing and uncertain situation. Decisions were said to be easier to make when the diagnosis was certain. Prognosis and discussions about meaningful actions were then possible. When the outcome for the patient is uncertain and there are various care options, there might be discussions. Postponing decisions concerning care and treatments was one way the teams used to deal with the situation, hoping that time would help them decide. Decisions regarding care depended on information about the patient’s own will and desires. If these were well-known the teams experienced it as easier to decide, from an ethical view. The team members said they could give the dying persons care decided on in consultation with the next-of-kin, taking their wishes and the patient’s uniqueness into account:<disp-quote>
<p>You do what the next-of-kin want, this really close caring, you do that specific thing that they really want, then I think it feels better for them. (Nurse, FGI:3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The next-of-kin were often considered the representatives of the patients, who were unable to communicate because of their condition. The teams wanted to have a dialogue with the next-of-kin about decisions, but found it difficult and time-consuming. They emphasized the need to agree about the care decided on in order to avoid suspicions arising and making care difficult. By gaining approval from the next-of-kin for decisions made, the teams felt the next-of-kin had the chance to be involved in decisions without having to feel the responsibility. The teams also stated that next-of-kin and patients might have different or even conflicting interests about an issue. The team members wanted to trust the next-of-kin to provide the opinion of the dying person but felt that instead some presented their own opinion. In such cases the situation was expressed as ethically problematic since they wanted the next-of-kin’s approval:<disp-quote>
<p>Often the next-of-kin would say, ‘My mum never wanted to become a vegetable, she has said so explicitly’, and some of them say, ‘Well, mum is so active she is going to live forever’. (Enrolled Nurse FGI:2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The teams said they wanted neither over- nor under-treatment to be given, but when the situation was uncertain they felt it was difficult to achieve this balance. The team members felt that once decisions about palliative care had been taken it was desirable to withhold treatment. Initiating a treatment was considered as giving hope to the next-of-kin while discontinuing the treatment took it away. Withdrawing a treatment was experienced as a more active action than withholding treatment in the first place:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s always more difficult to withdraw intravenous fluids that you have started in some kind of hope, especially if you have discussed it with the next-of-kin and then maybe they [the dying person] get worse and then you have to discontinue, that is harder. (Nurse FGI:1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The teams experienced that decisions concerning nutrition encompassed several ethical problems. Problems related to intravenous infusions with fluids and the impact of different decisions were discussed within the team but the final decision rested with the physician. According to the teams, the next-of-kin often believed intravenous infusion was life-saving or at least reduced the sensation of thirst. The team members, however, felt that infusions do not affect survival; on the contrary, they might prolong the dying process and cause severe suffering. The teams said they viewed such treatment as primarily a symbol of life and did not want to be part of decisions that prolonged the dying process. The teams wanted the next-of-kin to feel they could influence the care given but, simultaneously, the teams felt they might be forced to choose between letting the dying patient have the drip, allowing the next-of-kin to have their way and feel that the care was good, or terminate the drip, as the teams' own inner conviction and knowledge dictated that the drip would not benefit the dying person:<disp-quote>
<p>The drip isn’t what decides if you survive. It might possibly prolong life, [but] not in the long term. (Physician FGI:3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There was consensus within the teams concerning decisions on care strategies although they also said there was room for disagreement. Disagreement might cause team members to feel bad and lead to conflicts if different views were not accepted. This could happen when the opinion among team members diverged from the decisions taken and they felt they ought to act differently. The team members also said they found it ethically difficult when physicians unfamiliar with stroke care made decisions about patients. Team members could then feel forced by their ethical responsibility to fight for the care and treatment for the patient’s best:<disp-quote>
<p>My task isn’t to please the doctor, I’m speaking for the patient’s best and then there might be conflicts for that reason between me and the doctor because I have a different view… I certainly can fight. (Nurse FGI:4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Team members could also choose to decide to deviate from and change routines in order to maintain a proper ethical stance based on the patient’s situation and the team’s experience and ethical sense. Discussions expressing different views were experienced as a possible way of reaching a solution, a mutual agreement.</p>

<title>To support when uncertainty prevails</title>
<p>In striving to support next-of-kin in the changing and uncertain situation surrounding sudden and unexpected death, the teams said they felt the patients slipped into the background and the focus moved to the next-of-kin. The teams found it easier to take care of the patient than to care for the next-of-kin. They said they needed to create confidence so the next-of-kin thought of them as competent and able to take proper care of the dying person:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s really important that you communicate that we can handle this, we are good at it. We can take care of your mum or dad and we promise that we’ll do everything. So they [the next-of-kin] really feel, ‘Yes, they can handle this, they are in good hands.’ So they can go away and are able to leave their sick relative, trusting us to look after them. (Nurse FGI:4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The teams' experiences were that they can support next-of-kin better when a trusting relation is established and the next-of-kin feel secure. Without trust, the experience was that support was hard to give. Creating a relationship was considered requiring the teams to have time to spend with the next-of-kin initially. The teams found this difficult since it competed with the patients' initial need for care on arrival at the SU. The teams wanted to be present, listening and answering questions, and offering the possibilities of face-to-face meetings with the next-of-kin to allow the possibility of building trust. Based on what was felt as ethically correct, the teams tried to offer for the next-of-kin to be close to the patient, which was thought to make them feel better. However, the team members sometimes felt the next-of-kin were in the way when they wanted to participate and be of help in the care. Next-of-kin sometimes expressed feelings of guilt or had the idea that had they acted differently they could have influenced the outcome of the stroke. In order to support and not blame the next-of-kin, the teams might choose to confirm what they had done for the dying:<disp-quote>
<p>Even if it would have changed something you don’t say that because you don’t want them to blame themselves and have to live with it. (Nurse FGI:3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>On occasions when team members found the patient’s situation uncertain, they experienced it as ethically difficult to support the next-of-kin when they wanted to leave the SU temporarily and sought support from the team members for their decision. The team members wanted to try to mediate the uncertainty of the situation but simultaneously assure the next-of-kin that they would be contacted if there was any change. If death occurred while the next-of-kin were absent the team members felt guilty for having given the wrong advice, when their intention had been to provide support:<disp-quote>
<p>One lady who was really sick…she had a husband, they had no children…he was really concerned about her but they had two cats at home and the cats needed food. Then I said, ‘But go home and feed the cats and then you can come back while we stay with your wife’ and so he went and she died. Then I felt like – No! (Nurse FGI:2)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study suggests that caring for patients afflicted by sudden and unexpected stroke is experienced as being complicated by the changing situation and the prevailing uncertainty. This uncertainty, created by the suddenness and unexpectedness of the incident ran like a ‘red thread’ through all the themes and linked them together. Facing the unpredictable means being open and ready to take a risk and requires the staff to have confidence<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412099">32</xref>
</sup> in themselves and their own expertise. The study clearly indicates that suffering a stroke, very rapidly puts both the patient and their next-of-kin into an entirely new life situation where the future is uncertain. While this is similar to previous findings concerning stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412099">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011412099">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011412099">34</xref></sup> this study suggests that it also applies in situations when stroke leads to sudden and unexpected death. It indicates that even in the face of death, confidence is needed within the team, as well as openness, both towards the situation and to the next-of-kin. The team members' experiences were very similar and were that ethical problems were more likely to arise when the period of care was long as there is more time for conflicts to arise. If the outcome was certain and death was the reality or came quickly this was less pronounced. Perhaps this common way of apprehending the situation and the ethical problems depended on the vital collaboration between the participating SUs.</p>
<p>
<italic>To give information when conditions are unstable</italic> was experienced by the teams as central in the care of those faced with sudden and unexpected death and their next-of-kin. It was considered important that the team members could give time to the next-of-kin as soon as possible after their arrival at the SU. If the patient’s condition declined rapidly, there was limited time available, which made creating a caring relationship difficult. The teams struggled to use the time with discernment as indicated in previous research.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011412099">35</xref>
</sup> In the experience of the teams, being realistic and honest are requirements for information given to be ethical. To achieve this, teams need skills in communication, knowledge of stroke as a disease, and in dealing with changing and uncertain situations. The teams experienced mutual exchange of information between the team members and next-of kin of great importance and was thought to be possible only if there was mutual trust. Mutual trust, emerging as the common core of the themes, has been shown to be important in communication between clinicians and patients when exchanging information<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011412099">36</xref>
</sup> and within teams in the context of rehabilitation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011412099">37</xref>
</sup> in line with what this study suggests. Mutual trust might be created through asking for and utilizing next-of-kin’s knowledge about the patient. This is in accordance with what has been shown concerning patients' own competence in co-creating their own care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011412099">35</xref>
</sup> Next-of-kin’s knowledge thus guides the care decisions in a way that resembles the findings from a palliative care context focusing on patients afflicted by stroke.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412099">21</xref>
</sup> This study shows that trust is essential for communication with next-of-kin. It has been proposed earlier that trust enhances communication for care providers working in stroke teams and affects their relation to the patients in a positive way.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011412099">38</xref>
</sup> In the teams' experience, information aimed at creating faith and trust needs to take next-of-kin’s beliefs and knowledge about health care into account. This means that a caring relationship with both patient and next-of-kin might be achieved even when stability is lacking.</p>
<p>
<italic>To decide on care when the situation is changing</italic> was, in the teams' experience, associated with several ethical problems. In agreement with previous findings,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412099">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011412099">39</xref>
</sup> the teams considered it best if decisions could be made together with next-of-kin. Ethical problems could be avoided by shared decision making,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011412099">39</xref>
</sup> but trust was a prerequisite. In the teams' experience, decisions about treatments, for example withholding and withdrawing, need to be made together with the next-of-kin. Previous research in end-of-life care is not consistent regarding the possibilities of using the next-of-kin as proxies to provide reliable information as grounds for decisions about care on behalf of their relative.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011412099">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011412099">41</xref>
</sup> Doing things that are unnecessary or that may not provide any benefit or relief to the patient created a feeling within the teams of having prolonged the patient’s suffering and was experienced as ethically problematic. Giving care experienced as futile or ineffective is ethically challenging<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733011412099">42</xref>
</sup> and shown to create ethical distress in health-care staff.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733011412099">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733011412099">44</xref>
</sup> There is evidence from previous research<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011412099">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011412099">41</xref>
</sup> that the team must thoroughly examine the views of the next-of-kin concerning what is in the patients' best interest. Ethical values<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733011412099">45</xref>
</sup> could be a guide in ensuring that decisions are made putting the patient’s best interest first. A number of ethical problems experienced concerned nutrition and hydration, known to be common in stroke care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412099">21</xref>
</sup> The teams often used these as areas to exemplify and make concrete ethical problems experienced in relation to decision making. The idea that food and water are always to be offered has deep roots in many cultures<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733011412099">46</xref>
</sup> and affects people’s views. The possible negative side effect of hydration and positive side effect of dehydration for patients expressed by the teams is discussed within palliative<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733011412099">46</xref>
</sup> and critical care,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733011412099">47</xref>
</sup> as well as in the context of stroke,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412099">21</xref>
</sup> and provides ethical grounds for withholding fluids in situations where death suddenly approaches. The teams' idea about the drip being mainly important as a symbol of life is also based on the view that withholding the drip forces the next-of-kin and care providers to accept that death is imminent. This makes the decision about whether or not to set up a drip much more crucial and complex than it first seems. For the next-of-kin, it is bound up with a situation in which they were unprepared for death. They now have to accept that someone close to them will die. This acceptance is the goal the teams strive for and want to achieve, but mutual trust and confidence is essential for their success.</p>
<p>The study suggests that confidence created through mutual trust helps in avoiding ethical problems and enables the teams to support the next-of-kin. <italic>To support when uncertainty prevails</italic> was in the teams' experience marked by trust. In previous studies, trust has been found to be essential for next-of-kin in a palliative home-care context,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733011412099">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733011412099">49</xref>
</sup> where it contributed to care providers' feelings of security. Support of next-of-kin requires mutual trust, which can be created through information as well as allowing them to be present and near the patient, as has been shown from intensive care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733011412099">50</xref>
</sup> Creating a relationship with the next-of-kin is essential for establishing trust, but the teams experienced it as difficult to achieve because of the speed and the unexpectedness of the stroke. When two different views, the next-of-kin’s and the teams', about the needs of the dying patient, do not match or are perhaps even contradictory concerning how the dying patient feels, ethical problems arise. This leaves the teams facing questions about whose interests should guide the care. To whom should the teams be loyal? To act against the wishes of next-of-kin who will live on was perceived by the teams as difficult. The teams wanted to support next-of-kin so they could experience the patient’s dying as good, although sudden. The teams tried as far as possible to comply with the wishes of next-of-kin concerning how caring should be carried out. When they felt that the next-of-kin’s views were not in the patient’s best interests they tried to change the next-of-kin’s minds through providing information. In such situations decisions taken in the patient’s best interests are, from the teams' perspective, ethical.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733011412099">45</xref>
</sup> Their ethical values and inner ethos could force the teams to stand on the side of the dying person and choose to oppose the wishes of the next-of-kin in favour of the patient’s best interest.</p>

<title>Strength and limitations</title>
<p>Only a limited number of SU team members participated in the study due to its voluntary nature. The diversity represented in the FGIs on the other hand is a strength. The participants were men and women, represented all professions, and covered a wide age range with both short and long professional experience. Gender distribution in the FGIs was uneven but reflects accurately the gender distributions among professionals in healthcare. Traditional hierarchical structures could be seen in the FGIs where physicians and men took and were given more space and attention. The interviewer was aware of this, and handled the situation by stressing the importance of everyone having the opportunity to be heard. At the same time the benefits of discussion in groups could be seen as ideas unfolded through the dynamics of the conversations. The moderator tried to encourage everyone to share their experiences, listened and asked for clarifying statements if things seemed unclear. One may wonder whether what the stroke-team members talked about were really by definition ethical problems, but it seems that their comprehension resembles known definitions. It seems possible that they, as members of stroke teams, and we, as researchers and ethicists, do not necessarily have the same definition of what ethics is and of what it comprises. We chose to accept as ethical problems the experiences the stroke-team members told us about. Trustworthiness within this analysis was achieved through the researchers' commitment to the steps in the methods chosen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733011412099">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733011412099">52</xref>
</sup> Trustworthiness was also enhanced by the authors' differing pre-understandings of the phenomenon and independent performed analysis. The first author’s longstanding familiarity with the care context and the phenomenon discussed provided an understanding of the context and the language used. This meant that things were caught that could otherwise have been missed but it was also a challenge to see the subject in new ways. This challenge was enhanced by discussions among the researchers. The extensive quotations used aim to give the readers the possibility of judging the trustworthiness of the themes. The findings might be transferred to similar contexts dealing with ethically problematic situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0969733011412099">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study suggests that mutual trust, both within the stroke team and between them and the next-of-kin, could be seen, in the view of stroke teams, as a way of handling ethical problems that arise in creating care that has the patient’s best interests at heart, in the face of sudden and unexpected death. Ethical problems might constitute ethical dilemmas but not all problems are dilemmas. Issues experienced as ethically problematic require reflection and cooperation with next-of-kin and other team members. To be able to inspire feelings of security in next-of-kin in unstable situations, when there are uncertainties about what the outcome will be, is demanding. A mutual exchange of information forms the basis for decisions that need to be made when uncertainty prevails. Through trust, a relationship can be constructed that enables the stroke-team members to support the next-of-kin. Although team members' perceived mutuality as key, one can glimpse them thinking that they know best. It is a challenge for the stroke teams to create mutuality, the basis of trust, when conditions are changing. The greatest challenge, however, may be to make genuinely equal cooperation with the next-of-kin a reality. The experiences of next-of-kin remain unknown and further research on this aspect would be welcome.</p>
