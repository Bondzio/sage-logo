<p>How has the research mission of universities evolved over time? Why has there been a shift toward a greater emphasis on “applied” forms of research? What has this meant for the organization and work of research centers?</p>
<p>These are just three of the many questions explored in David Cooper’s ambitious research monograph <italic>The University in Development: Case Studies of Use-Oriented Research</italic>. The book is divided into three parts: the first part develops a theoretical framework and explanation for institutional changes in research emphases, the second part examines a number of case studies of research organizations in South Africa, and the third part interprets the cases in light of the theoretical framework, and presents conceptual and policy implications of the work.</p>
<p>The book entails a wide-ranging analysis of the development of both the mission and practice of university research from a macro-political economic perspective down to the more micro-level dynamics of the university research grouping. At the broadest level, Cooper attempts to explain and synchronize several different historical trends that have produced the current state of affairs involving the rise of applied forms of academic research. More specifically, he contends that the applied-side orientation has its roots in the changing post-1970s global political economy toward neo-liberalism (though he rarely uses this term), which stimulated the activation of the university’s “third mission” involving socioeconomic development. He labels the former the “third capitalist industrial revolution” and the latter the “second academic transformation.”</p>
<p>This is the most coherent and interesting theoretical proposition advanced throughout the monograph. The emerging research paradigm, which Cooper prefers to label “use-inspired basic research” (UIBR), is driven by the relationship between the university, industry, and government—the U-I-G “triple helix.” As a response to the economic crisis of the 1970s, there is a movement toward university research that has greater commercial application and transferability to enhance national competitiveness and the privileging of the university–industry (U-I) linkage. Cooper examines the historical evolution of the research mission at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford to demonstrate the hypothesized trends.</p>
<p>The primary data that are brought to bear on the hypothesized developments in university research are the case studies of 11 research groupings at universities in the Western Cape of South Africa. The groupings are largely based in the natural and physical sciences focusing on agricultural, technology, engineering, and sustainability applications. Cooper conducted interviews with the research unit’s leaders and also examined the formal organizational structures of the research groupings. There is a great deal of sociologically rich information presented in this series of case studies.</p>
<p>For each case, there is an attempt to determine how the changing mission and purpose conforms to the larger theoretical model positing the U-I linkage as well as, secondarily, establishing what organizational factors might contribute to the success and sustainability of the research grouping. Cooper includes many details about each of the research groups, some idiosyncratic, that occasionally distracts from the larger narrative of the study. Further, the various organizational structural characteristics and “micro-contradictions” that are highlighted are not well-situated within any particular organizational theoretical model.</p>
<p>What relevance does this study have for applied social science research? As noted, most of the raw material used to evaluate the larger theoretical proposition comes from natural science-based research activities. If the trend is toward meeting the needs of industry through commercial development and technology transfer, it is these disciplines that are most likely to be tapped and given the opportunity to contribute to the “third mission.” In the United States, this is clearly demonstrated in the priority given to the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines in relation to, and at the expense of, the social sciences and the humanities. This development is consistent with Cooper’s thesis and the broader neoliberal shift toward privileging private corporate interests over public social needs and aesthetic sensibilities.</p>
<p>As a part of UIBR, Cooper introduces a conceptual opening for the social sciences in his expansion of the triple helix to include a “fourth helix”—civil society—and the establishment of a university–civil society (U-CS) linkage. This would connect university research to community and labor organizations, NGOs, and social-movement-based organizations through “civic engaged” scholarship. But Cooper is surprised that this U-CS connection is absent in much of the literature on new directions in university research and that it has an “orphan status” in relation to the U-I linkage.</p>
<p>This reflects one of the central weaknesses of Cooper’s analysis. He is perplexed to see the marginalization of civil society needs and priorities in the “third mission” of the university, and believes these need to be included, but this is, in fact, perfectly consistent with his larger theoretical model and the rise of the neoliberal political economic paradigm. It is unrealistic to assume that U-CS will receive equal billing with U-I under economic regimes that pursue supply-side “trickle-down” economic policies determined by the interests of capital. In this sense, Cooper fails to pursue the full implications of his model that would logically predict such differential research and funding priorities of the university favoring U-I relations.</p>
<p>A further extension of the model would also require a much deeper appreciation for the distinction between the social sciences and the natural sciences. The social (not technical) problems that the social sciences seek to address through applied or “public” research are often the direct product of the same “third capitalist industrial revolution” that spawns the U-I research/funding opportunities for the natural sciences and STEM disciplines. These include poverty, inequality, economic insecurity, exploitation, deteriorating public health, environmental degradation, and various forms of social/community disruption. Therefore, Cooper’s claim that there are “no fundamental theoretical differences” between industry-engaged scholarship and civic-engaged scholarship is difficult to sustain since they may be meeting the needs and interests of different social groups and classes.</p>
<p>In the final chapters of the book, Cooper provides some insightful interpretations of the research group findings and also advances a broader mission for the “second academic revolution” that includes and expands the U-CS linkage. There is no doubt that Cooper sees the value of applied and public social science research and scholarship; but one must be equally aware of the strong counterforces that have to be confronted to sustain this agenda.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for anyone interested in the research function of institutions of higher education, how they have changed, and how these changes impact the organizational and micro-level dynamics of research groups and centers, this study will prove invaluable.</p>
