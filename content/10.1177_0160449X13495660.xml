<p>This booklet, which was originally published in 2001 in <italic>Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor’s Last Century</italic>, packs a surprising amount of information about history, union organizing, social theory, work in the retail trades, gender, and much more in a small readable package that brings the actors to life. It is a model of the adage, “Show the reader—don’t tell the reader.”</p>
<p>The book includes a 2011 interview with the author where she discusses “the parallels between the Occupy Wall Street protests and the great workplace occupations carried out by workers in the 1930s in their fight for union rights” (pp. 1-10). Both in that interview and in the text of the book, Dana Frank provides a rich context for the events that play out during the successful 1937 sit-in strike at a Detroit Woolworth’s store. The interview provides a theoretical context in which both to place occupations and to situate other watershed events, such as the NAACP sit-ins during the 1960s.</p>
<p>The Woolworth’s sit-down strike took place in the shadow of many more well known worker actions at that time. Perhaps that is why it has been more of a footnote to the industrial strikes in that era, even though it sparked similar actions in other parts of the country. Was the different treatment due to the gender of the strikers, the smaller size of the workforce, the nature of craft unions versus industrial unions, the character of leaders and decision makers, the fickleness of reporters, or just chance?</p>
<p>What is most surprising about the book is how packed its 60 pages are with telling details that add context and interest to the story, while not feeling rushed. For example, the book draws parallels between the operation and effects of Woolworth’s stores in the1930s and WalMart and Costco in the early 21st century. In doing so, it implicitly raises questions whether conditions today could lead to widespread worker actions in our time.</p>
<p>The author weaves the story of “the poor little rich girl,” Barbara Hutton (granddaughter of founder Frank Woolworth and niece of broker E. F. Hutton), through the very different lives and experiences of the women sitting in at the first Woolworth’s store to be occupied. Frank reminds us that the poor working conditions at the Woolworth’s stores provided the wealth that supported Hutton’s profligate and unhappy life. Although the names and lives of those sit-down strikers are now mostly forgotten, Frank helps us see them as whole people with anxieties and hopes but also courage and humor. She helps the reader visualize what the workers did during the first moments of the sit-in and how they passed their days and kept up their spirits when success was not a certainty.</p>
<p>Frank’s accessible style and coverage and the parallels between life in the Great Recession and the Great Depression make this book a good introduction to classes such as labor studies, sociology, history, and women’s studies.</p>
