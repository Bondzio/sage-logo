<p>In his comments on our paper, Wendler raises questions about the likely utility of the therapeutic misconception (TM) scale we described. The focus of his remarks is not on use of the instrument as a research tool, that is, to enable investigators who study informed consent to test interventions that may reduce TM in groups of subjects. Rather, Wendler questions whether the TM scale will be useful to researchers in identifying subjects who require additional education regarding the nature of the study they are entering. He suggests that what he calls a ‘study specific consent process’ would do better at that task. In this brief response we want to focus on three issues arising from Wendler’s comments: (1) practical aspects of administering the TM scale, (2) the value of the information derived from the scale for the consent process; and (3) whether ‘study specific consent’ is a viable alternative.</p>
<p>With regard to the administration of the scale, which Wendler anticipates will take 15 min, we would envision a very different process. Although for the purposes of this study, the questionnaire was read out loud, the final version with its 10 Likert-scale items can simply be handed to subjects and should not take more than a minute or two for them to complete. We anticipate that this would usually occur after the initial consent disclosure and review of the consent form. No coding by the researchers is required. At most, it should require a few seconds of time on the part of a researcher to total the score and identify those areas in which a subject had difficulty. For the purposes of dealing with an individual subject, whether that person’s TM score exceeds some arbitrary cut-off is less important than having data that enables the researcher to spot and address the subject’s misconceptions. Wendler imagines that this part of the process will take another 15 to 40 min. In contrast, we envision that targeted clarification of the subject’s misconceptions will in general require only a few minutes of explanation and discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, even this highly efficient process will be of little use if the information itself is irrelevant to the quality of a subject’s appreciation of the study that he or she is about to enter. That is, if it does not matter whether a subject grasps the difference between being in research and in ordinary treatment, there is little point spending any time correcting misconceptions in that regard. Indeed, Wendler challenges the importance of subjects knowing that a statement such as ‘Being in a research study almost always provides the best possible treatment for a sick person’ is false. Of these more general items he says, ‘they are not things potential subjects need to understand to give consent for specific studies’. This view defines a fundamental difference in perspective between those people who see therapeutic misconception as an important issue and skeptics of the concept, like Wendler. We would suggest that knowing that research studies are not intended to – and usually do not – provide the best possible treatment for sick people is essential to appreciating what is involved in participation in a clinical trial. If research studies were, in fact, designed to that end, they would never use placebos, restrict dosage adjustments, limit adjunctive treatments, choose treatments at random, or blind physicians to the treatments being administered. However, all of these methods that deviate from the basic principle of clinical care that treatment should be individualized to the needs of each patient are used routinely to protect the validity of research findings. We believe that is something that every research subject should appreciate.</p>
<p>In place of an effort to dispel TM, Wendler suggests something that he calls ‘study specific consent’, which he describes as involving ‘explanation of the study’s purpose, procedures, risks, potential benefits, alternatives, and the fact that participation is voluntary’, followed by clarification of specific items that subjects do not understand. Wendler does not say how those items needing clarification would be identified, for example, by a study-specific questionnaire or by less formal probing, or how long the testing and redisclosure process would take. If study-specific consent sounds familiar, it should, because it is exactly the model of what investigators are supposed to be doing today: relevant study-specific information is disclosed, efforts are made to ensure that the subject understands, and if not, additional information is provided. An extensive body of data, however, suggests that this system has not succeeded. Not only is comprehension wildly variable and often poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512464312">1</xref>], but as noted in our paper, it results in rates of TM in the range of 50%–70%. Moreover, efforts to improve on this performance without directly addressing TM have usually been disappointing, and the most promising approaches require substantial investments in staff time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512464312">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512464312">2</xref>].</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that it is unimportant for subjects to understand information specific to the studies in which they are about to enroll. Indeed, information about the risks and benefits of a particular study, to take one example, is essential to a meaningful consent. But focusing solely on those details has failed to produce consistently knowledgeable research subjects, and more often than not yields subjects who fail to recognize the crucial differences between being in a research study and receiving ordinary treatment. It may even be, although it remains to be demonstrated, that reducing TM will help subjects better understand the information specific to their studies by giving them a conceptual framework with which to process the information they receive. It is not, therefore, an either/or choice: either help subjects better understand the information specific to their study or reduce their tendency to view that information through therapeutic lenses. Both elements are important to achieving a meaningful appreciation of the issues involved in research participation. We believe that a scale that helps to identify subjects’ tendencies to conflate research and treatment can play a role in the process of improving informed consent to research.</p>
