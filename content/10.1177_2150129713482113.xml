<p>Welcome to our adult issue of <italic>JAAE</italic>! This month we have an impressive lineup of articles and departments that focus on asthma in the adult population. Adult-onset asthma is defined as asthma in adults more than or equal to 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis. However, the majority of adult-onset asthma actually represents persistent asthma that began during childhood years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713482113">1</xref></sup> In 2011, 8% of adults had asthma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713482113">2</xref></sup> and in 2008, 3262 adults died from asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713482113">3</xref></sup> Therefore, it stands to reason that we would devote an entire issue to the topic. However, asthma educators are not the only group in need of more information about the subject. In a review article, Evers et al report that adults do not perceive themselves as being susceptible to asthma and they lack understanding regarding asthma symptoms. Therefore, the authors argue that social marketing should be used to increase asthma knowledge in this vulnerable population. Shendell et al, through their work with the New Jersey Safe Schools Task Force, also highlight the importance of increasing self-awareness of safety and health risks in the field of cosmetology with a goal of minimizing exposures among cosmetology professionals and their clients. In the article by Vine et al, the authors aim not only to increase public awareness of asthma, allergies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but also to improve patient education. Their findings demonstrate that participants had improved knowledge after their educational intervention.</p>
<p>As asthma and allergy educators, we know the importance of education for <italic>all</italic> our patients; of course, how we provide education has implications for its success. In a qualitative study, Andrews et al found that adults viewed their asthma as individualized, and thus, self-management training should be based on the patient’s disease experience and environmental context rather than generic recommendations. This finding emphasizes the importance of building a partnership with our patients.</p>
<p>And finally, what adult issue would be complete without addressing the topic of smoking? In 2011, 19% of adults 18 years of age and older were current smokers and 21% were former smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713482113">3</xref></sup> It is known that people with asthma who smoke experience an accelerated deterioration in FEV1 compared with those who do not smoke. Additionally, having asthma and smoking increases asthma symptoms and negatively effects the short-term response to corticosteriods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713482113">1</xref></sup> In our Product Showcase, Adib et al provide us with an overview of Varenicline (Chantix), a smoking cessation aid. In addition, in this issue we are lucky to have the expertise of Drs Gorin and Gomez-Villabolos. In our Roundtable, they tackle the topic of smoking cessation in the adult asthma population, and they provide us with their view of adult asthma management.</p>
<p>Akin to the fact the kids are not just little grown-ups, adults are not just big kids. Our patients with asthma are adults, and they live in an adult world. As such, their asthma educational plan should be developed in the framework of their adult world; this consists of taking into consideration all aspects of that world—including but not limited to family, friends, work, culture, religion, and finances. Only then can we, asthma educators, truly make an impact on the lives of our adult patients.</p>
