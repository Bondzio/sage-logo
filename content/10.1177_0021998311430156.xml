<abstract>
<p>Aluminum (Al) alloys started replacing cast iron and bronze alloys in the manufacture of wear-resistant parts and are materials of interest owing to their low density, higher strength to weight ratio, which is an additional advantage in aerospace, marine and automotive applications. Al-metal matrix composite (MMC) materials are very much popular due to the reason that these composites possess good mechanical properties and higher wear resistance. This article is aimed to present the experimental results of microstructure, hardness, tensile, yield and compression strength, percentagage elongation, volumetric wear loss, and wear rate of Al6061-Tungsten Carbide (WC)–Graphite (Gr) reinforced hybrid MMCs. The composites were prepared using the liquid metallurgy technique, in which 0 to 4 wt% of WC particulates were dispersed into the matrix alloy in steps of 1 wt% by maintaining the Gr to 4 wt% constant. The experimental results indicate that the density of the hybrid-MMCs increases with increased WC content and further, agree to the values obtained through the rule of mixtures. The physical, mechanical and the tribological properties of the Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid MMCs were found to increase with increased WC content in the matrix at the cost of reduced ductility. The WC and Gr reinforcements contributed significantly in improving the wear resistance of Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid MMCs.</p>

<p>Aluminum alloys are the commonly used matrix materials for the preparation of the Al-based composite materials. Al6061 is heat treatable, highly corrosion resistant and possess excellent extricable and have moderate strength. Al6061 alloy is used in applications like building and construction, high way, automotive, and in marine applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311430156">1</xref></sup> They are widely used as high-speed rotating or reciprocating mass items such as pistons, connecting rods, drive shafts, brake rotors, and cylinder bores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311430156">2</xref></sup> Compared with the corresponding monolithic alloys, Al-MMCs are attractive because of their improved strength, stiffness, creep behavior, wear resistance, and low thermal expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311430156">3</xref></sup> Moreover, they are lightweight and their applications will be greatly expanded in the near future if problems like cost and fabricating are well resolved.</p>
<p>From the recent past there has been several studies on the wear behavior of Al-based hybrid MMCs, which are reinforced with more than one species of reinforcing phases such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiC, C, or Gr, having different forms, such as particle, whisker, long or short fiber. In all the investigations, an improvement in wear resistance has been reported for the hybrid composites as compared to the composites reinforced with a single species. The introduction of a small volume fraction of hard reinforcements into the matrix materials has been reported to improve wear resistance. Researchers observed that the addition of SiC particles to Saffil short fiber reinforced Al-MMCs gives rise to a remarkable improvement in wear resistance. They attributed it to the considerable reduction in the change in orientation of the Saffil short fibers brought out by the introduction of SiC particles in the hybrid composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311430156">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Du Jun et al. developed Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and carbon short fibers reinforced Al-12Si hybrid composites and concluded that the friction coefficient and wear rate of the hybrid composites decreased with the increase in carbon fiber volume fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311430156">5</xref></sup> Basavarajappa et al. studied dry sliding wear behavior of Al2219-15SiC MMCs and Al2219-15SiC-3Gr hybrid MMCs. Dry sliding wear tests were conducted using a pin-on-disc machine and concluded that the addition of SiC to Al2219 alloy increases the wear resistance of the composites. The addition of graphite reinforcement in Al-SiC composites further increases the wear resistance and effectively avoids the occurrence of severe wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311430156">6</xref></sup> Fu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311430156">7</xref></sup> investigated the wear properties of Saffil/Al, Saffil/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al, and Saffil/SiC/Al hybrid MMCs and confirmed that under dry sliding condition, Saffil/SiC/Al showed the best wear resistance under high temperature and high load. Naplocha and Granat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311430156">8</xref></sup> in their studies on wear behavior of Al/Saffil/C hybrid composites with various amounts of graphite and alumina fibers concluded that reinforcing with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fibres only prevents adhesion and seizure. Introduction of graphite improves co-operation of the friction couple and reduces the wear. Graphite fibers prevent hybrid composites from wear much better than graphite flakes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311430156">8</xref></sup> Basavarajappa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311430156">9</xref></sup> conducted dry sliding wear tests on Al-MMCs reinforced with SiC and Gr particles and showed that Gr particles are effective agents in increasing dry sliding wear resistance of Al/SiC composites. The above discussion and literature survey reveals meager data on the mechanical and tribological properties of particulate reinforced Al6061-hybrid MMCs. Hence, this article presents the experimental results of mechanical and tribological properties of Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid MMCs.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311430156"><title>Composite preparation details</title>
<p>The fabrication of hybrid composites has been done through liquid metallurgy route via stir casting technique. Preheated WC and Gr reinforcement particulates of laboratory grade purity were introduced into the vortex of the molten metal after effective degassing with solid degasser hexachloroethane tablet. Mechanical stirring of the molten alloy was achieved by using ceramic-coated steel impeller for duration of 8 min at a speed of 500 rpm. A pouring temperature of 720°C was adopted and the molten composite was poured into the pre-heated cast iron moulds. The extent of incorporation of WC in the matrix alloy was varied from 0 to 4 wt% in the steps of 1 wt% by maintaining the graphite reinforcement to 4 wt% constant. The cylinders of 22 mm × 210 mm cast hybrid MMCs of Al6061-Gr-WC were obtained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311430156"><title>Testing of composites</title>
<p>The cast hybrid MMCs were machined to prepare the test specimens according to ASTM standards. The density of material, which is ratio of weight to volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311430156">10</xref></sup> was obtained by accurately measuring the weight and the volume of the composites. The prepared test specimens were subjected to hardness, tensile and wear tests, and metallographic examination. Carefully polished and mirror finished specimens were examined under NIKHON, Japan make, ECLIPSE 150 model up right metallurgical microscope to obtain micrographs. MRB 250 model of Meta test make Brinell hardness tester served the purpose of measurement of hardness using a load of 500 kg for 30 s with a 10-mm steel ball indentor. The mechanical properties were evaluated using Fine Spavy Associates model TUE – 400C of 400 kN capacity with least count of 4 N, fully computerised universal testing machine. Wear tests were conducted using a Ducom, Bangalore make computerized pin-on-disc machine. The test specimens were in the form of pins of diameter 10 mm and height 25 mm, while the disc was high carbon EN31 steel having a hardness of HRC 60. The wear height loss of the pin in microns was recorded during each wear test using an LVDT transducer of accuracy 1.0 µm. Due to wear of the pin surface during rubbing with counter disc, the pin continuously moves down to re-establish the contact with the disc surface. This linear downward movement of the pin is a measure of the wear height loss and is recorded by the LVDT. During wear testing height loss experienced by the pin specimen is measured in microns. Volume loss (mm<sup>3</sup>) was calculated by multiplying the height loss with the area of cross-section of the pin. The wear rate, defined as the ratio of wear volume (in mm<sup>3</sup>) to the product of applied load (in N) and sliding distance (in meter), is an important parameter, which quantifies the wear resistance. The surface roughness of the test pin specimen and the disc were maintained at 0.1 µm <italic>R</italic>a. Load on the pin was varied from 10 to 40 N while the sliding distance of 3 km was maintained.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311430156"><title>Results and discussions</title>
<p>The test results of Al6061 alloy and its WC and Gr reinforced hybrid MMCs containing various weight percentages of WC are presented in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311430156"><title>Density</title>
<p>This section presents the comparison of theoretical density obtained by rule of mixture and measured density values by experiment for the hybrid composites studied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311430156">Figure 1</xref> shows the experimental density values of the hybrid composites containing various WC wt% filler percentages. From the figure, it can be concluded that the experimental and the theoretical density values are in line with each other and confirm the suitability of the liquid metallurgy technique for the successful composite preparation. It can also be observed that the density of hybrid composites are higher than that of the base matrix. Also, the density increases with increased percentage of WC content in the composites. A similar result was obtained by several researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311430156">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311430156">12</xref></sup> This increase in density of the Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid composites is mainly attributed to the higher density of WC than that of the Al6061-alloy.

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311430156"><title>Microstructure studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311430156">Figures 2</xref>(a)–(e) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311430156">3</xref>(a)–(e) show the optical and scanning electron micrographs of Al6061 alloy and Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid composites. Micrographs reveal that there is fairly uniform distribution of WC and Gr particulates throughout the matrix alloy. It is also being observed that porosity is lower. It is reported that higher hardness is always associated with lower porosity of hybrid metal matrix composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311430156">13</xref></sup>

<p>Further, from the optical and scanning electron micrographs, it can be seen that there is good bonding between the matrix and the reinforcement particulates, hence better load transfer from the matrix to reinforcement material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311430156"><title>Brinell’s hardness</title>
<p>The Brinell’s hardness test was performed in accordance with ASTM E10-07a standard at room temperature condition (the diameter of the test specimen was 20 mm and 15 mm in length). Five hardness readings were taken for each specimen at different locations to circumvent the possible effects of particle segregation and each value is an average of five readings. The variations in hardness of the composites with varying wt% of WC particulates were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311430156">Figure 4</xref>. From the figure, it can be observed that the hardness of the hybrid composite is greater than that of its cast Al6061 alloy. The hybrid composites containing 3 wt% WC filler content exhibits higher hardness than the other composites studied. The improvement in the hardness can be attributed to the fact that the WC particulates possess higher hardness and its presence in the base matrix improves the hardness of the hybrid composite. The trend is similar to results of other researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311430156">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311430156"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311430156">16</xref></sup> Hardness of the hybrid composite material increases monotonically and significantly by an amount of 38% as the content of WC particulates increased to 3 wt%. Beyond 3 wt% WC the improvement in the hardness was very marginal. This decrease in hardness beyond 3 wt% WC is mainly due to the fact that the larger differences in density between the matrix and reinforcement materials and fine size of WC and also due to the agglomeration of reinforcement particulates. Therefore based on the experimental results obtained it can be conclude that, up to 3 wt% of WC can be successfully incorporated into the Al6061 matrix material.

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311430156"><title>Tensile strength</title>
<p>The tensile test was performed in accordance with ASTM-E8/E8M-08 standard (the gage diameter of the test specimen was 12 mm and 60 mm was the gage length with 50 mm gripping surface). The experiments were conducted at room temperature. For each composite, five tensile test specimens were tested and the average values of the UTS and ductility (in terms of percentage elongation) were measured. The variations in tensile strength of the composites with varying wt% of WC particulates were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311430156">Figure 5</xref>. From the figure, it can be observed that the tensile strength of the hybrid composite is greater than that of its cast Al6061 alloy. The hybrid composites containing 3 wt% WC filler content exhibits higher tensile strength than the other composites studied. The improvement in tensile strength can be attributed to the fact that the WC particulate possesses higher tensile strength and its presence in the base matrix improves tensile strength of the hybrid composite. This increase in tensile strength of the composite may also attributed to increase in the hardness values of Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid MMCs. Tensile strength of the hybrid composite increases by an amount of 73% as the content of WC particulates increased to 3 wt%. The trend is similar to results of other researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311430156">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311430156">18</xref></sup> Beyond 3 wt% WC filler content the improvement in tensile strength was too little. The decrease in tensile strength of the composites beyond 3 wt% WC is attributed to the fact that the composite has reached saturation point and leads to improper bonding between the matrix and reinforcement materials.

</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021998311430156"><title>Yield strength</title>
<p>The variation in yield strength of the composites with varying wt% of WC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311430156">Figure 7</xref>. It was observed that the yield strength of the composites increase with increase in the wt% of WC particulates up to 4 wt%. It was also observed that the increase in the yield strength beyond 3 wt% of WC particulates is marginal. The yield strength of the hybrid composite material increases significantly by an amount of 89% as the content of WC particulates increased to 3 wt%. At 4 wt% WC composite the decrease in the strength is mainly due to the improper bonding between the matrix and reinforcement materials. The structures and properties of the reinforcements control the mechanical properties of the composites that are reasoned to the strong interface that transfers and distributes the load from the matrix to the reinforcement, exhibiting increased elastic modulus and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311430156">19</xref></sup> The strength of ceramic particle reinforced Al-composites are found to increase by increased ceramic phase and by decreasing the size of the reinforcement in the composite, at the cost of reduced ductility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311430156">20</xref></sup>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311430156">Figure 8</xref> presents the effect of WC content on the ductility of cast Al6061-WC-Gr particulate composites (measured in terms of percentage elongation). It can be seen from the figure that the ductility of the composites decreases monotonically and significantly with the increase in WC content. The ductility drops as the WC content is increased from 1 to 4 wt%. This is mainly due to the fact that the composite is becoming more and more brittle because the WC is very brittle than the matrix material and Gr. The ductility drops by about 66% as the WC content is increased from 1 to 4 wt%. These results tally with those obtained by other researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311430156">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311430156">22</xref></sup> who also observed the drop in ductility. This decrease in ductility in comparison with the matrix alloy is a most commonly encountered disadvantage in discontinuously reinforced MMCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311430156">21</xref></sup>

<p>The reduction in ductility can be attributed to the presence of a hard ceramic phase that is prone to localized crack initiation and increased embrittlement effect due to local stress concentration sites at the reinforcement–matrix interface. Hence, the introduction of this hard secondary ceramic phase creates slip regions. Moreover, the reinforcing particulates resist the passage of dislocations either by creating stress fields in the matrix or by inducing large differences in the elastic behavior between the matrix and the dispersoid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311430156">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>The compression test was performed in accordance with ASTM-E9-89 a (2000) standard (the diameter of the test specimen was 30 mm and 26 mm was the length with approximately 0.8 L/D ratio). The experiments were conducted at room temperature. The variation in compressive strength of the hybrid composites with varying wt% of WC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311430156">Figure 9</xref>. It was observed that as the wt% of WC is increased from 1 to 4 wt%, the compressive strength value improved up to 4 wt% WC and the compressive strength decreased beyond 3 wt% WC. Better compressive strength was found at 3 wt% WC. The compressive strength of the hybrid composite material increases by an amount of 61% as the content of WC particulates increases from 0 to 3 wt%. The increase in the compressive strength is mainly due to the WC reinforcement because the WC is having very high compressive strength then the matrix and graphite materials.

<p>Dry-sliding wear experiments were conducted using a computerized pin-on-disc wear-testing machine at constant sliding velocity of 2.62 m/s. The wear tests were conducted at room temperature in accordance with ASTM-G99 standard. The cast pins of 10 mm diameter and 25 mm length were the specimen for the tribological test. During wear testing height loss experienced by the pin specimen is measured in microns. Volume loss (mm<sup>3</sup>) was calculated by multiplying the height loss with the area of cross-section of the pin. For the base alloy and its hybrid composites, the height loss experienced by the specimen was recorded, as a function of material parameter (filler content) and the test parameters (sliding distance of 3 km) for various applied load (10–40 N in steps of 10) and with 500 rpm rotational speed and are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430156">Figure 10</xref>.

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430156">Figure 10</xref>(a)–(d), it can be observed that the volumetric wear loss experienced by the hybrid composites are lesser than that of the base alloy and also it can be found that the volumetric wear loss for the composites decreases as a function of filler content. Further, it can also be observed from the figure that, for given filler content, the hybrid composites volumetric wear loss increases with increased sliding distance. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430156">Figure 10</xref>(a)–(d), it can be observed that the trend of volumetric wear loss of the base alloy and composites are more or less same as compared to the trend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311430156">Figure 10</xref>(a). From the above discussions, it can be concluded that the composites containing higher filler contents exhibits decreased volumetric wear loss and hence exhibits improved wear resistance. The highest wear resistance is exhibited by the composite containing 3 wt% WC.</p>
<p>The improvement of the wear resistance can be attributed to the fact that the filler improves the hardness of the composites thus further contributing to the improvement of the wear resistance of the composites. Also from the graph it can be seen that the Al6061-4%Gr-4%WC hybrid composite has higher volumetric wear loss, it is even more than the base material. This is mainly due to the lower hardness of the Al6061-4%Gr-4%WC composite, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311430156">Figure 4</xref>. Further, it can be concluded that lower hardness means higher volumetric wear loss or lesser wear resistance. It has been found that the applied load affects the volumetric wear loss of alloy and composites significantly and is the most dominating factor controlling the wear behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311430156">23</xref></sup> The volumetric wear loss varies with normal load, which is an indicative of Archard’s law, and is significantly lower in case of composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311430156">24</xref></sup></p>

For a given composition of the composites, the wear rate increases for a given sliding distance with increase in load and the wear rate decreases for a given load with increase in sliding distance.

<p>The particle reinforcements are the most effective in improving the wear resistance of MMCs provided that good interfacial bonding between the reinforcement and the matrix exists. The particle reinforcement has the effect of preventing the plastic flow and the adhesion of matrix material, the particle shape was of great advantage for carrying a contact load compared to whisker and fiber reinforcements. The wear resistance of the composites is improved by preventing direct metallic contacts that induce subsurface deformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311430156">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>Cast Al6061-Gr-WC composites were prepared successfully using liquid metallurgy techniques. The properties of the cast Al6061-Gr-WC composites are significantly improved by varying the amount of WC. It was found that increasing the WC content within the hybrid metal matrix material that contained 4% Gr, resulted in significant improvement in properties like density, hardness, tensile strength, yield strength and compressive strength. Highest values of mechanical properties like hardness, tensile strength, yield strength and compressive strength were found at 3% WC at the cost of reduced ductility. The wear resistance of the hybrid composites is higher than that of base alloy. Increased applied loads and sliding distances resulted in higher volumetric wear loss. Further, the WC and Gr reinforcement contributed significantly in improving the wear resistance of Al6061-WC-Gr hybrid composites. From the studies and the test results it can be concluded that upto 3 wt% WC can be incorporated into the Al6061 and 4 wt% Graphite composites by liquid metallurgy technique.</p>
