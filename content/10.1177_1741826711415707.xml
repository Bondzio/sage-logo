<p><bold>Background/objectives:</bold> To describe the evolution of the therapeutic practices over 10 years of follow-up of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Charleroi and to analyse the factors influencing the choice of treatments and the mortality of these patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The Charleroi register of ischaemic cardiopathies is the oldest register of infarctions in the French-speaking community of Belgium and is one of the very rare registers that allows identifying tendencies over 25 years. Analyses presented hereafter relate only patients in the 25–69-year age range over time from 1998 to 2007. The data were analysed in five periods of 2 years. Treatment evolutions over time were analysed using chi-squared tests for trend and logistic regression analyses identify factors influencing the type of treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The present study shows a marked increase in the utilization of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) between 1998–1999 and 2006–2007. The use of thrombolytic agents on approximately one-third of the patients treated remained fairly stable between 1998 and 2007. A lower proportion of patients with a history of AMI received thrombolytic agents. Thrombolysis seems beneficial for men and without effect for women. The use of β-blockers continued to increase until the 2000–2001 period and remained fairly stable for the two following periods. 42% of patients were administered three medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiplatelet drugs, and β-blockers). Association of PTCA with antiplatelet drugs, β-blockers, and thrombolysis was observed for 58.7, 50.6, and 25.7%, respectively. These associations were still observed after adjustment for gender, age, and comorbidity. The factors associated with fatality were specifically old-aged patients, antecedents of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and oral antiplatelet drugs, and β-blockers therapies and PTCA.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The evolution of the therapeutic data on AMI in this register confirms the use and the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy. PTCA becomes the main coronary reperfusion treatment with less risk of bleeding. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were without effect on mortality.</p>

<p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711415707">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711415707">2</xref></sup> The incidence of AMI and mortality attributed to this disease has declined markedly in Northern and Western Europe over the past 35–40 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711415707">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711415707">4</xref></sup> Noteworthy advances in the treatment, care, understanding, and prevention of AMI have taken place over the past several decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415707">5</xref></sup> This tendency has been observed since the beginning of the 1980s, with the increased utilization of several pharmacological treatment and coronary intervention reperfusion strategies. The decrease in mortality can be also explained by primary and secondary prevention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711415707">6</xref></sup> as well as the discovery of a sensitive marker for infarction; i.e. troponin that allows better risk classification and early diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711415707">1</xref></sup> The number of patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased steadily during the past 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415707">7</xref></sup> Primary PCI often remains the best treatment for patients with ST-elevation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711415707">8</xref></sup> Numerous clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of several cardiac medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiplatelet drugs, and β-blockers, on patient outcomes for patients with or without ST-elevation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711415707">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711415707">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Charleroi register of ischaemic cardiopathies is the oldest register of infarctions in the French-speaking community of Belgium and is one of the very rare registers that allows identifying tendencies over 25 years. In the Charleroi MONICA register, we observe the same decrease of AMI mortality by 40–50% between 1986 and 2007. This unique database allows assessing the time trends in fatal and non-fatal AMI, as well as the evolution of its 28-day case fatality. The standardization of the procedure allows ascertaining trends in the evolution of AMI and analysing, among others, epidemiological repercussions of therapeutic progress, of early care intake of patients, and of other secondary prevention measures adopted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711415707">11</xref></sup> The aim of the register is to contribute to the promotion of the quality in medical care provided by health professional generalists and specialists and to improve health system management and plan prevention programmes. This publication aims to analyse the evolution of treatment in men and women using data collected between 1998 and 2007 by the Charleroi MONICA register. This paper analyses more specifically the demographic and clinical profile of patients, the effects of comorbid diseases as well as the temporal evolution of treatment, therapeutic management and predictors of 28-day case fatality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711415707" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Full details of the design and methods have previously been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711415707">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711415707">13</xref></sup> Briefly, the defined geographic entity for the collection of coronary events, ‘MONICA’, is composed of 15 municipalities in Charleroi. Analyses presented hereafter relate only patients in the 25–69-year age range over time from 1998 to 2007.</p>
<p>The data sources for hospitalized patients are seven hospitals within the study region. A medical doctor checks up the documents of all fatal and non-fatal suspect cases of coronary thrombosis hospitalized in the intensive care unit of all hospitals in the city. Since 1998, the Minimum Clinical Summary (MCS) permits an extra validation of every suspect case, using the codes of the International Classification of Diseases: ICD 410–414 (ischaemic heart disease). AMI diagnoses were based on five criteria: symptoms, electrocardiograms, cardiac enzymes (including troponin), previous coronary artery disease history, and necropsy findings (if required). An event was considered as new if its apparent date of onset was more than 28 days after any previous CHD event.</p>
<p>For fatal cases, the 10th revision of ICD has been used since 1998. The death certificates are collected by the Ministry of Health of the French speaking community. All death certificates are validated and checked up with the hospital file of hospitalized subjects, and the documents from the ambulance and intensive cares. Fatal events are considered if they result in a person’s death within the 28 days from the onset of the first symptom. The data are coded according the MONICA criteria (F1, F2, F9: fatal CHD; NF1, NF2, and NF3: non fatal CHD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711415707">11</xref></sup> In this analysis, definition for AMI was used (corresponding to non-fatal ‘definite’ myocardial infarction, plus fatal ‘definite’, ‘possible’, and ‘unclassified’ myocardial infarction). During the whole period, no changes in the criteria for definition of myocardial infarction were made. The register included both out-of hospital as well as hospitalized events and our analyses include all events (community events). For descriptive analysis, the number of patients in the study is 2936 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711415707">Table 1</xref>). For logistic regressions the number of patients included correspond about half of the total of patients. That is explained by the statistical method used and described below.

<sec id="sec4-1741826711415707"><title>Characteristics of the study population</title>
<p>Women represented only 25.5% of all AMI events, and this percentage remained stable over the ten-year period. Women were, on average, older than men (57.9 vs. 55.3 years, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>A significant number of AMI patients presented with comorbidity in the form of a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes. Among patients with AMI, there was a higher prevalence of current smokers than in the general population. This prevalence remained stable over the 10-year period. Also noted was an increase in the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia from 2004. Whatever the period, all these comorbidities were in good agreement with another registry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711415707">14</xref></sup> and higher than in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415707">15</xref></sup> The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was higher for women (54.4 and 30.4%, respectively) than for men (42.9 and 21.0%, respectively). In contrast, the prevalence of antecedents of myocardial infarction and current smoking was higher in men (23.3 and 63.9%, respectively) than in women (16.0 and 51.0%, respectively). There was no gender difference concerning hypercholesterolaemia. Older patients were more likely to suffer from hypertension (16.7% for the 25–34-year range vs. 55.0% for the 65–69-year range). The prevalence of hypertension increaseed regularly according to age. There existed a high prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia for the 45–54-year-old subjects (52.0% against 39.0% and 45% at 25–34 and 65–69 years, respectively). The number of subjects in the various age groups remained stable throughout the period, with 1.8, 11.0, 28.8, 34.7, and 23.7% of the subjects in ranges 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65–69, respectively. The ageing of the subjects of the study was thus not responsible for the increases in comorbidities.</p>

<p>A marked increase in the utilization of PTCA was observed between 1998–1999 (25.5%) and 2006–2007 (63.4%) with the most rapid increases beginning in 2002–2003.

This difference was still observed after adjustment (OR = 1.32, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022). As expected, many co-medications were observed. For the two last periods (between 2004 and 2007), associations of ACE inhibitors/antiplatelet drugs, β-blockers/antiplatelet drugs, and β-blockers/thrombolysis were observed for 50.6, 78.4, and 30.6% of patients, respectively. Forty-two per cent of patients were administered three medications (ACE inhibitors, antiplatelet drugs and β-blockers). Association of PTCA with antiplatelet drugs, β-blockers, and thrombolysis was observed for 58.7, 50.6, and 25.7%, respectively. These associations were still observed after adjustment for gender, age, and comorbidity.</p>
<p>Significantly lower proportions of patients with antecedents of myocardial infarction received thrombolytic therapy. It was the most marked effect observed concerning the association of known comorbidity with treatment. To a lesser extent, higher proportions of patients with hypertension received β-blockers.</p>

<p>The factors found, in this study, to be associated with 28 day-case fatality were specifically old-aged patients, antecedents of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and antiplatelet drugs, and β-blocker therapies and PTCA. After adjustment for gender, age, and comorbidity, treatment with antiplatelet drugs and with β-blockers was associated with lower 28-days case fatality. ACE inhibitors and thrombolysis had no significant effects. After adjustment for all covariates, age was strongly associated with mortality. After univariate analysis and sex stratification, thrombolysis decreases mortality in men (OR = 0.39, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) but has no effect in women (OR = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.846).</p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to describe the evolution of the therapeutic practices over 10 years of monitoring of AMI in Charleroi and to analyse the factors influencing the choice of treatments and the mortality of these patients. The treatment of AMI has changed markedly since 1980. The use of effective therapies with positive effects, as demonstrated in clinical trials, has increased. These changes in treatments could, to a great extent, explain the decrease in 28-day mortality.</p>
<p>The present study shows a marked increase in the utilization of PTCA between 1998–1999 and 2006–2007 with the most rapid increases beginning in 2002–2003. According to the Belgian working groups (BIWAC and BWGIC), the primary PCI often remains the best treatment for patients with ST-segment-elevation MI (STEMI), and 60% of patients (data from the national STEMI register) received this treatment in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711415707">12</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of 11 randomized clinical trials that compared primary PCI with fibrinolytic therapy demonstrates that PCI was associated with a reduction in mortality, reinfarction, and stroke at 30-day follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711415707">16</xref></sup> Although the clinical superiority of primary PCI is clear, the main challenge lies in the ability to implement such a strategy promptly (maintaining a first medical contact-to-balloon time of<italic> </italic>&lt; 90 minutes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415707">17</xref></sup> Concerning PCI, we cannot evaluate whether it is a primary PCI, facilitated PCI, or rescue PCI, nor the time elapsed between the primary symptoms, the first contact with the medical doctor, and the intervention. We encounter the same problem for the analysis of thrombolysis.</p>
<p>For the same Belgian population, some data show an increase of the use of thrombolytic agents in 1991 (32.8%) compared to 1986 (22.4%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711415707">18</xref></sup> These changes seem to follow the publication of landmark trials reporting the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415707">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711415707">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711415707">21</xref></sup> The use of thrombolytic agents on approximately one-third of the patients treated remained fairly stable between 1991 and 2007. This data is very much in line with the Belgian STEMI register but not with international studies describing an increase between 1986 and 1995 and a marked decrease thereafter. One explanation is that PCI becomes the main coronary reperfusion treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711415707">22</xref></sup> with less risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>In the present study, elderly patients were less likely to receive thrombolytic therapy. These findings agree with the results of other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711415707">23</xref></sup> A lower proportion of patients with an antecedent of AMI received thrombolytic agents. Contrary to certain studies, our analysis does not show a positive effect of thrombolysis. It is increasingly accepted, however, that thrombolysis is contraindicated in non-ST-segment-elevation MI (NSTEMI) due to the lack of benefit and the increased risk of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711415707">23</xref></sup> After univariate analysis, thrombolysis seems beneficial for men and without effect for women. Clinical studies did not show any differences in efficacy between men and women. One explanation for the lack of efficacy of thrombolysis in women could be that thrombolysis must be initiated soon after symptom onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711415707">8</xref></sup> For Bouma et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711415707">24</xref></sup> there is a longer pre-hospital delay in AMI in women due to a longer decision time before going in an hospital service.</p>
<p>De Henauw et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711415707">18</xref></sup> showed an increase of the use of β-blockers in Belgium for patients with AMI from 1986 to 1991. These changes seem to follow the publication of studies reporting the efficacy of this therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415707">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711415707">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711415707">26</xref></sup> The use of β-blockers continued to increase until the 2000–2001 period and remained fairly stable for the two following periods. In accordance with guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711415707">27</xref></sup> higher proportions of patients with hypertension received β-blockers. This drug should be administered to patients with STEMI whatever the reperfusion strategy planned. In our analysis, we cannot distinguish between STEMI/NSTEMI cases, and consequently, we cannot say with precision if the various therapies were correctly selected.</p>
<p>For the whole study period, approximately 50% of patients received oral ACE inhibitors. This estimate is twice the rate of use by the same population in 1991.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711415707">18</xref></sup> This change corresponds with the publications of results confirming the benefits of these therapeutics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415707">19</xref></sup> These data are in conflict with other studies reporting no effect of ACE inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711415707">28</xref></sup> In the present study, ACE inhibitors were without effect on mortality. These data were maintained after sex stratification.</p>
<p>Less than 10% of patients did not receive antiplatelet drugs. Dual oral antiplatelet therapy, and other medications provided maximum protection against thrombosis in patients undergoing PCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711415707">10</xref></sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711415707">29</xref></sup> Unfortunately, only the medication category is available in the register under study. Consequently, it is not possible to check whether this beneficial association is applicable to the present population. Women were older, presenting such comorbidities as hypertension and diabetes. In contrast, men were more likely to be smokers and to have a history of AMI. This is greatly in agreement with previous results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711415707">25</xref></sup> Hypercholesterolaemia was associated with lower 28-days case fatality. This result is also reported by Hanania et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711415707">30</xref></sup> One explanation could be that patients with hypercholesterolaemia are more prone to being treated with statin. According to Ferrières et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711415707">31</xref></sup> intensive statin therapy reduces all-cause of mortality. Statin stabilizes the artherome plaque and decreases the level of CRP concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711415707">32</xref></sup></p>
