<abstract>
<p>In this article we provide a comparative analysis of qualitative, semistructured interviews with 24 women who had undergone different forms of cosmetic breast surgery (CBS). We argue that women must negotiate three types of risk: potential medical risks, lifestyle risks connected with choosing “frivolous” self-enhancements, and countervailing social risks affiliated with pressures to maximize one’s feminine beauty. In addition, we highlight the challenges faced in negotiating these risks by examining the limits to traditional forms of medical informed consent provided to the women, who received little information on the medical risks associated with CBS, or who were given uncertain and contradictory risk information. Even respondents who felt that they were well informed expressed difficulties in making “wise” choices because the risks were distant or unlikely, and hence easily minimized. Given this, it is fairly understandable that the known social risks of “failed” beauty faced by the women often outweighed the ambiguous or understated risks outlined by medicine. We argue that traditional notions of informed consent and risk awareness might not be adequate for women choosing CBS.</p>

<body>
<p>Cosmetic surgery is an increasingly normalized aspect of beauty rituals within many modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421774">Blum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311421774">Sullivan, 2004</xref>). In particular, the pursuit of beauty through surgical means is now big business within Western cultures (Sullivan). Americans spent close to $10.5 billion on cosmetic procedures in 2009, and more than 10 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421774">American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery [ASAPS], 2009</xref>). Although men are increasingly undergoing cosmetic procedures, women accounted for more than 90% of the total procedures performed in 2008 and 2009 (ASAPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421774">American Society of Plastic Surgeons [ASPS], 2008</xref>). The most popular cosmetic surgery procedure is breast augmentation, and there were more than 300,000 breast augmentations performed in 2009 in the United States alone (ASAPS).</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of cosmetic surgery procedures over the last few decades has not gone unnoticed by social researchers and theorists, and in particular many feminist theorists have examined cosmetic surgery in relation to issues of agency, choice, social control, and idealized femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421774">Blum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421774">Davis, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421774">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311421774">Gimlin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421774">Jeffreys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311421774">Morgan, 2003</xref>). However, these theorists have not fully examined these issues in relation to risk theory and personal responsibility discourse. It has been argued that we are currently living in a “risk society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421774">Beck, 1992</xref>). Within a risk society there is a large emphasis on individual responsibility and choice, and this means we are expected to be aware of risks and to make informed decisions to avoid harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421774">Lupton 1999</xref>). The current literature on cosmetic surgery does not adequately address how living in a risk society shapes, and is shaped by, decision making in relation to cosmetic surgery. We contribute to the literature by investigating how women negotiate risk and exercise choice in a risk society, while also addressing the social risks and rewards women face within a punitive culture of beauty that benefits women who comply with strict beauty norms and sanctions those who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311421774">Wolfe, 1991</xref>). Drawing on qualitative, semistructured interviews with 24 women who had undergone cosmetic breast surgery (CBS), we explore how these women negotiated the tensions between the medical, social, and lifestyle risks associated with CBS. In the following sections, we discuss each of these types of risk as they relate to CBS and examine how the respondents interpreted, assessed, and managed these interrelated types of risk.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311421774">
<title>Medical Risks</title>
<p>When doctors and surgeons explain medical risks to patients they draw mainly on framings of risk as a potential harm, which emphasizes not only the importance of managing potential harms to the self, but also of making prudent decisions as a patient and consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421774">Lupton, 1999</xref>). Given that the potential medical harms attached to CBS are quite high, it is important for women to make fully informed choices. This becomes a complex task, however, in terms of the challenges faced by any individual seeking to reduce medical risks; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421774">Beck (1992)</xref> has noted, medicine comprises a closed information system, making risk assessment difficult for patients. As we highlight in this article, women’s risk evaluations are also complicated by social risks that can seemingly outweigh medical ones, and by perceptions of lifestyle risks that can blame and sometimes even endanger women who make “bad” choices.</p>
<p>The medical risks associated with CBS include excessive bleeding, hematoma, infection, complications from anesthesia, changes in nipple and/or breast sensation, difficulty or inability to breastfeed, breast asymmetry, disfigurement, and keloid scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421774">ASPS, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421774">Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons [CSPS], 2006</xref>). Women who have breast implants can also experience rupturing, wrinkling, or deflation of the implant(s), chest wall deformity, tightening of the scar tissue surrounding the implant(s), and difficulty detecting cancer through mammograms because of the placement of the implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421774">Health Canada, 2005</xref>). Women who have silicone rather than saline breast implants might encounter autoimmune symptoms and diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and Sjogren’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421774">Mellican, 1995</xref>). Finally, although the fatality rate is low, like any major surgery, CBS does carry risks of death. Still, most of the medical risks attached to CBS are potential and long-term, so that women must evaluate medical risks that are neither imminent nor pressing.</p>
<p>When the respondents were asked to recall the information they were provided during their consultations prior to surgery, the majority discussed the medical risk information they received. Given this, the medical risk section outlined in this article is more detailed than the other two sections on social and lifestyle risks. In exploring risk more broadly, however, we hope to illustrate that this primary focus on medical risks during the consultation prior to surgery is a significant shortcoming in the medical encounter, and to highlight the possibility that informed consent should be expanded to include social and lifestyle risks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732311421774">
<title>Social Risks</title>
<p>The social risks that bring women to consider CBS in terms of “failed” beauty are both obvious and immediate. Current ideals of femininity demand that women conform to an increasingly narrow type of normative body; today’s ideal beauty must appear to be eternally young, innocent yet sexually available, very thin, yet full breasted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421774">Bordo, 1995</xref>). In addition, this strict standard of beauty narrows further when we acknowledge that “the hegemonic heterosexist ideal of feminine beauty is essentially a white standard” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421774">Gagne &amp; McGaughey, 2002</xref>, p. 826). Achieving this standard is also difficult for women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, because they are less likely to have the economic capital to engage in more expensive beauty practices, like cosmetic surgery. Thus, these strict beauty ideals clearly disadvantage some women more than others; however, these standards are difficult for any woman to attain, and are increasingly difficult to sustain as women engage in childbearing and begin to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421774">Blum, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty of achieving these ideals, there are considerable rewards attached to “successful” femininity; women who are conventionally attractive are more likely to be in romantic relationships, have friends, and enjoy advantages in workplace earnings and promotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311421774">Weitz, 2003</xref>). Thus, the seemingly frivolous or pathological choices women make concerning their bodies and appearances are often conscious or unconscious responses to a culture that offers them significant rewards for compliance. In addition to rewards for achieving ideal feminine beauty, women who fail to conform to these norms can experience significant censure. Women who resist or fail to achieve an approximation of ideal feminine beauty can be perceived as unattractive, unfriendly, or sexually unavailable, experiencing significant negative social outcomes for their noncompliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311421774">Nelson, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311421774">
<title>Lifestyle Risks</title>
<p>Whereas there are social risks attached to failed feminine beauty, there are also lifestyle risks attached to choosing cosmetic surgery as the means of attaining that beauty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421774">Lupton (1999)</xref> argued that lifestyle risks are those associated with consuming commodities such as foods and drugs—or indeed cosmetic surgeries—that are deemed to be unhealthy or dangerous. Lifestyle risks are perceived as being “internally imposed” by individuals who incur risks by choosing to engage in particular practices, especially those closely associated with consumerism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421774">Lupton, 1999</xref>, p. 13). Even in a consumer society, an individual has the freedom to choose lifestyle risks, but he or she is also expected to act as a rational consumer and to objectively assess risks to make wise consumer choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421774">Giddens, 1994</xref>). Within this context, individuals are held responsible for the negative consequences of making an unwise consumer choice. Given that CBS is largely understood as an individual consumer choice, it is also likely that when things do go wrong it will be the individual, rather than medicine or the beauty system, that will be held liable for the negative outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311421774">
<title>Cosmetic Surgery and the Canadian Context</title>
<p>Before discussing the data, it is important to understand the context in which these women made their decisions. In Canada, health care coverage is only available for certain cosmetic surgeries. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421774">Conrad and Leiter (2004)</xref>, health care coverage, or third-party payers, are important agents in legitimizing certain medical treatments, because they are able to define and then pay only for those procedures that they have deemed medically necessary. Within this framing, medical procedures like reconstructive breast surgery following mastectomy and breast reduction surgery, because they are often fully or partially covered by Canadian public health care, are constructed as legitimate, medically justified procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421774">Boulton, 2007</xref>). All of the women (13) who had reduction surgeries had their surgeries subsidized by the health care system. Conversely, in all but one case, the women who had breast augmentation did not receive financial assistance, because their reasons for surgery were defined as aesthetic rather than medical. These differences impacted the women’s assessments of risks and rewards, and their defenses of choosing cosmetic surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311421774" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Prior to sampling and data collection the research was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Lethbridge. As part of good ethical practice, all of the participants were fully informed about what their participation in the research would entail. We obtained informed consent prior to each interview, assuring participants of anonymity and confidentiality in our presentation of the data, and encouraged voluntarism by offering opportunities to withdraw from the research at any time without negative repercussions. The participants were also offered the opportunity for interview debriefing within a support group or counseling setting. None of the women requested this, however, and all of the women seemed to be positively affected by the opportunity to discuss their experiences.</p>
<p>Following receipt of ethical approval, qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with 24 women in Alberta, Canada. Engaging women in qualitative interviews and taking their experiences to be important and authoritative is rooted in feminist critiques of a male-centered tradition in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421774">Hartsock, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421774">Reinharz, 1992</xref>). According to Reinharz (p. 19), interviewing women is a way to begin to hear and value women’s historically silenced voices:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Interviewing offers researchers access to people’s ideas, thoughts and memories in their own words, rather than the words of the researcher. This asset is particularly important for the study of women because this way of learning from women is an antidote to centuries of ignoring women’s ideas altogether or having men speak for women.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We used qualitative interviews as a way to provide the women with the opportunity to talk about their largely ignored experiences, and we sought to understand the women’s embodied experiences from their own perspectives. Given this, the research did not involve interviews with cosmetic surgeons. Although interviewing cosmetic surgeons might have provided a more nuanced understanding of the issue of informed consent, it is the women’s decision-making processes that are of paramount interest. In addition, interviewing only women who have undergone cosmetic surgery conveys to the women themselves, and to others, the importance of the women’s narratives as sources of knowledge.</p>
<p>The interviews were designed to be in depth and semistructured. One of the main advantages of this method is that it allows for flexibility and for the interview to flow like a conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421774">Harris, Nilan, &amp; Kirby, 2011</xref>). At the same time, a semistructured design focuses the interview on specific areas to be explored. The interview guide was designed with specific themes in mind, including choice and agency; the women’s perceptions of their bodies before and after surgery; support or censure for undergoing CBS; interactions with medical professionals before, during, and after the surgery; knowledge of cosmetic-surgery-related risks; decision making in relation to risks and rewards; and experiences of pain and complications following surgery.</p>
<p>For all of the reasons above, we chose to interview women about their experiences of undergoing CBS. The main limitation of this method is that it required the women to recall information. We accept that it is potentially problematic to ask participants to recall detailed experiences and information; however, during the interviews none of the women seemed to have difficulty remembering and answering any of the questions. Indeed, it was clear from the interviews that undergoing CBS was an extremely important event in the women’s lives, and as such, the experiences tied to this event were easily recalled.</p>
<p>To reach potential participants we placed advertisements on public notice boards in grocery stores, coffee shops, medical clinics, hair and beauty salons/spas, fitness centers, tanning studios, bars, restaurants, shopping malls, universities, and colleges. A local newspaper also aided in the recruitment of participants by publishing an article based on the research project. Finally, we employed snowball sampling as a method to reach potential interviewees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311421774">Seidman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311421774">Warren, 2002</xref>). Through snowball sampling we were able to reach women who agreed to participate because they heard about the project through a trusted person within their social network.</p>
<p>To allow for a comparative analysis we recruited women who had undergone different types of CBS. The sample included 10 women who had breast augmentations, 13 who had breast reductions, and 1 woman who had reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy. The women ranged in age from 21 to 71 years, and the sample included 12 women with children and 12 women without children at the time of the interview. Interviewing women with and without children permitted an understanding of how the women’s CBS decisions interacted with their mothering and breastfeeding decisions. The sample also included women who had undergone CBS within different time periods; the majority (14) of the respondents underwent CBS from 2000 to 2006, 7 women underwent surgery within the years of 1993 to 1999, and 3 women had CBS more than 20 years prior to interview; this final group included 1 woman who had her surgery in 1977 and 1 woman who underwent surgery in 1974. Including women who underwent CBS at different historical moments allowed for an additional comparative analysis because the women received different risk information and had varying degrees of informed consent prior to undergoing surgery. As we discuss below, the two women whose CBS took place in the 1970s were not given any information regarding the potential complications involved with the procedure, because the procedure was relatively new at that time and there had been no long-terms outcomes studies. This means that their decision making process in terms of risks and rewards was qualitatively different than the women who had their surgeries in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>In our analysis we used “tools” from grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421774">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>), but we did not use grounded theory as a methodology for theory building; rather, we drew on risk theory and feminist epistemologies to frame our analysis. We coded all of the interviews with the aid of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421774">ATLAS.ti (1997)</xref>, a qualitative data analysis computer software program. This software allowed for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311421774">Strauss and Corbin (1998</xref>, p. 119) termed a “line-by-line analysis” of the transcripts whereby the researcher codes for important concepts and themes in the data. The first few interviews that were coded were especially crucial for developing initial conceptual categories, and these interviews provided a basic code list to use when analyzing subsequent interviews. Following the tenets of theoretical sampling in grounded theory, however, we went back and analyzed the first set of interviews to incorporate and analyze emerging themes. Data collection, transcription, and analysis occurred concurrently, and new questions and important themes for analysis were informed by the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421774">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>, pp. 75-76). In the final stage of analysis all of the interviews were grouped together to determine which themes were common among the participants, reflecting shared experiences.</p>
<p>The grounded theory tools we used were applied to the data within a critical feminist framework. Thus, the process of data analysis was informed by feminist theory and was not completely inductive or simply based in a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421774">Maynard, 1994</xref>). In practice, this means that we took the women’s accounts as meaningful and important, while also considering the women’s descriptions within the context of gendered issues such as the imperative for beauty, the force of media on women’s self-image, and the relative imbalance of power between women as consumers and a medical system that has traditionally been masculinist and alienating to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421774">Lane, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Barriers to Managing Medical Risks</title>
<p>The concept of the ideal consumer subject is congruent with that of the ideal patient. Both concepts are rooted in cultural values of individual autonomy and freedom of choice, as well as an understanding that health is largely an individual responsibility, with rational, objective, and calculating subjects represented as the ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421774">Lupton, 1997</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421774">Fraser (2003)</xref>, medical discourse frequently asserts that in choosing cosmetic surgery, it is incumbent on the “individual to become informed about the risks and benefits of surgery and to weigh them up independently and dispassionately” (p. 36). Most of the women adopted the ideal consumer/patient role, suggesting that they had internalized this responsibility for making “wise” consumer/patient choices.</p>
<p>Although most of the women we spoke with did receive some information on medical risks from their physicians, those whose surgeries occurred 20 years or more prior to interview described receiving no such information prior to surgery. Even those women who did receive medical risk information, however, confronted significant barriers that hindered their ability to objectively and dispassionately weigh those risks. The following example serves to reveal the limits of modern medical risk information and the problems this poses for making well-informed health decisions. Recent studies have shown that after CBS, women experience difficulty breastfeeding or are unable to breastfeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421774">Hill, Wilhem, Aldage, &amp; Chatterton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421774">Nommsen-Rivers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311421774">Souto, Giugliani, Giugliani, &amp; Schneider 2003</xref>). Whereas some of the women interviewed were informed about these risks prior to undergoing CBS, not all were; in fact, some were told explicitly that CBS would not adversely affect their ability to breastfeed. Kelsey,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732311421774">1</xref></sup> who had breast-reduction surgery in 1999, when she was 16 years old, and who had some insider knowledge about this particular medical risk because of her mother’s problems breastfeeding after surgery, stated, “The cosmetic surgeon told me I could breastfeed, which was nice. Because technology is different now than it was in the [19]70s when my mom had the surgery.” Similarly, Tanya, who had breast-augmentation surgery in 2004, explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well the one thing that I was concerned about is that you couldn’t breastfeed once you got them [implants], but that’s false. Like I mean, maybe back in the day when women were getting them. I don’t know the details. But if I couldn’t breastfeed with them, then there was no way I was going to get them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to other women we spoke with, Kelsey and Tanya were under the impression that improved technology had made CBS a less “risky” procedure than previously understood. These examples reveal that the risk information provided to some of the women by their cosmetic surgeons was at best overly optimistic, and at worst untrue and misleading, barring these women from making well-informed consumer/patient decisions. Even those women who were well informed of the medical risks faced the problem of making a decision based on risks that were largely imperceptible at the time of surgery. The women were challenged to make objective decisions about medical risks that would not have an immediate effect on their lives. For example, Jamie, who underwent breast-reduction surgery when she was 21, stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She [the cosmetic surgeon] said that there is a chance that you might not be able to breastfeed. And I think I was too young and children were too far away at that time to think about that as a big deal. Maybe I would have thought a little bit differently now about it. But at that time that wasn’t the most important thing to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was difficult for Jamie, as for several other interviewees, to assess and manage medical risks when it was unclear how those risks might affect her later in life. Three years after her breast-reduction surgery, Jamie had realized that having the option to breastfeed might become important to her; however, at the time of her surgery such concerns were far removed from the factors she considered important in assessing her risks.</p>
<p>The women whose CBS occurred between 1970 and 1990 were informed about relatively few medical risks prior to surgery. Important information, such as the possibility of the implants rupturing, was not provided to these women simply because there were no major long-term studies on the effects of silicone or saline implants until the early- to mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311421774">Rowsella, Norrisa, Ryanb, &amp; Weenik, 2000</xref>). For example, Robin, whose breast-augmentation surgery was in 1974, explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I hounded the doctor. You know, up one side and down the other. I asked him every kind of question I could think of. At the end of the day he told me, “You know, Robin, when they dig you up 1,000 years from now, they will find nothing but implants and bones. That’s how good they are.” And I said, “Wow. Really? Okay.” So anyway, I thought, “Well, maybe this is okay. I mean maybe it will work. Maybe it is true.” So I went in and decided, yes, I would have the surgery.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marilyn, who underwent breast-augmentation surgery in 1977, recounted a similar experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In hindsight I don’t think that there was a lot of research that had been available as to the long-term effects of this type of surgery. So I guess we all put our trust in the physicians that we go to and we leave our bodies in their care. And I was just going in on face value. He said, “These things will last you a lifetime. No problem. I’ve done lots of them,” that kind of thing. And so I was just going on the positive side of it, and assuming that this was all going to be well and good and everybody will live happily ever after.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the two excerpts immediately above reflect, the women decided to undergo cosmetic breast surgery only after they were convinced that the procedure and the implants were safe, thus making their decisions based on the risk information that was available to them. The wholly positive way in which the surgery was presented to them by their physicians allowed these women to focus on the immediate social rewards, which often overrode medical concerns. For example, Robin described how one of the main social rewards of having her breasts enlarged was the sexual satisfaction of her husband, because he had requested that she undergo the procedure. Social risks and rewards attached to the women’s decision making are discussed more fully below.</p>

<title>Managing Medical Risks: Becoming an Expert</title>
<p>The women who had CBS more than 20 years prior to interview did not have the option to engage in any additional research or seek other advice largely because there was very little information on the procedure and the long-term effects at that time; thus, in the following section we focus on the women who underwent CBS from 1993 to 2006, and their strategies for seeking out medical risk information beyond what was offered to them in the medical encounter. Given the limits of the medical risk information they received during their consultations, it is hardly surprising that very few women who underwent CBS from 1993 to 2006 relied solely on their physicians to assess and manage risks. Instead, the majority of these women became experts themselves by actively seeking and evaluating risk information.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421774">Alaszewski (2005)</xref>, although it is the role of experts to provide some knowledge on risks, in Western cultures it is ultimately the responsibility of individuals to take this knowledge and make rational choices. Many of the women’s actions reflected that they understood it was their responsibility to research relevant risk information beyond traditional medical sources. These women’s actions suggest that they were engaging in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421774">Giddens (1991</xref>, p. 7) termed “reskilling,” by accessing information from friends and family, other women who had undergone CBS, medical and scientific journals, Internet Web sites, and television programs. Through reskilling, the women indicated that they were able to gain a sense of control in the face of significant risk possibilities, and to make well-informed consumer/patient choices. For some of the women this individual research was extensive and done over several years. Teresa, a 29-year-old mother and child care worker, spent more than 7 years researching the procedure prior to her breast augmentation. Similarly, Tara, a 25-year-old student, described her efforts prior to breast-augmentation surgery as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had done so much research before I even went to the surgeon, and so I kinda had an idea in my mind. So I asked questions knowing the answers, waiting for his answer. I ended up knowing quite a bit about it before. Like I had researched Canadian Web sites, American Web sites, health associations, all that kinda stuff. So I had a pretty good idea to start.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, 34-year-old mother, Diane, said, “You’ve gotta do your research, you gotta do your end, and if you’re not willing to put in the leg work and ask the questions . . . then don’t do it.” The language used by the women clearly reflects the understanding that they were individually responsible for making well-informed consumer/patient choices, including assessing the knowledge of their physicians prior to agreeing to surgery.</p>
<p>As part of their research into CBS, many of the women connected with other women who had undergone cosmetic surgery, because this provided them with embodied and experiential information beyond that provided by medical sources. By talking to other women who had undergone CBS, some of the respondents were able to gain first-hand information that was much more tangible than that offered by the cosmetic surgeons. In addition, this strategy allowed the women to learn about the risks and complications from trusted individuals. This is important, because the extent to which individuals trust the source of risk information strongly impacts how individuals will respond to the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421774">Alaszewski, 2005</xref>). The risk information provided by individuals in the women’s social networks was trusted not only because the individuals were often friends and family members, but because many of them had previously undergone CBS.</p>
<p>Karen, a 30-year-old sales representative, sought out useful risk information from women in her social network who had undergone CBS. In her words, “I talked to so many people who had it done. I looked at their scarring. I asked them their stories. But I didn’t look on the Internet or anything like that. It was just all word of mouth.” Similarly, Barbara explained that the information she received on CBS and the possible risks and complications was “mostly through word of mouth . . . from women that had already done it and were largely satisfied with it.” The stories of women who went outside of medical sources to assess their risks highlight a need for physicians and medical personnel to provide particularly strong and comprehensive information about medical risks. For example, Barbara’s sources were women who were “satisfied” with CBS, and thus the information she obtained, although fitting in with “good consumer” discourses relating to risk assessments, was perhaps neither adequate nor realistic with regard to the risks attached to CBS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311421774">
<title>Managing Medical Risks: Comparison Shopping</title>
<p>In addition to obtaining information to gauge medical risks, women managed risk and uncertainty by “shopping around” for a competent and qualified cosmetic surgeon, or by choosing to disregard or minimize risk possibilities. Both of these approaches, although slightly different, demonstrate that the women held themselves individually responsible for finding ways to control or prevent risk possibilities.</p>
<p>Some of the women chose their surgeon based on research or personal recommendations, and others interviewed several surgeons before deciding on one. The main goal of this strategy was to find a cosmetic surgeon who was perceived as trustworthy and possessing exceptional expert knowledge and skills, because these women believed this to be one of the best guarantees against experiencing risks and complications. The women’s strategies reflect the understanding that this particular decision was an important component of making a responsible and well-informed consumer/patient choice. Although some participants who underwent breast-reduction surgery discussed using these strategies, it was mainly those who underwent breast-augmentation surgery who were able to engage in the consumerist activity of shopping for cosmetic surgeons. This is partly because, as we discuss above, within the Canadian medical system, breast-reduction surgery is defined and treated as medically necessary, and thus some of these women were not offered a choice, because they were referred by their doctors to specific cosmetic surgeons.</p>
<p>The women who were not referred to a specific surgeon generally did “comparison shop” by visiting two or more cosmetic surgeons before deciding on one. Tanya, who underwent breast-augmentation surgery, met with two cosmetic surgeons during her decision-making process. She explained, “I knew right away which doctor I was going to go to, just because I felt more comfortable with him.” Tara also met with two different cosmetic surgeons, and when asked how she decided one was better than the other, she explained, “My gut feeling said, ‘Yeah this guy is going to do you a world of good.’ . . . To be honest, if you don’t feel right about a person, chances are there is something wrong.” A unique approach to finding a qualified and respected cosmetic surgeon was described by Diane, who underwent breast-augmentation surgery:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Working at the strip club] I could ask all the questions like: “Where did you get yours done?” and “Who was your surgeon?” and all of that information. And I could see like, “Oh, I like his work,” and “I don’t really like his work” [laughs]. You got a good taste of what was good work and what was bad work, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In one sense, Diane was more fortunate than many of the other women in that she was able to decide which cosmetic surgeon’s work she preferred by viewing the bodies of her colleagues. This strategy was a way to avoid a cosmetic surgeon who produced “bad work,” and it allowed her to have a degree of confidence and a sense of control over the uncertain outcomes of her surgery. Diane’s experience is perhaps the most reflective of the understanding that deciding on a cosmetic surgeon is an important consumer/patient decision that requires time and effort, including comparison shopping, to find the cosmetic surgeon with the medical skills and credentials necessary to create good results. In addition, Diane’s story exposes how social benefits, in the form of aesthetically “good work,” are as salient to women as is information about medical risks; in short, the aesthetics of the process formed as important an aspect of her risk assessments as did the potential medical risks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311421774">
<title>Managing Medical Risks: Disregarding or Downplaying Risks</title>
<p>Finally, it is not surprising that another risk-management strategy that women engaged in was to disregard or downplay medical risks and complications. For example, some of the women compared undergoing CBS to other medical treatments or interventions they felt were risky as a way to minimize their perception of risks specific to CBS. Janette, who underwent breast-reduction surgery, explained, “Going under general anesthetic is always a risky procedure . . . but [breast-reduction surgery] isn’t that risky of a procedure. It wasn’t like having open-heart surgery, or something like that.” Similarly, Leanne, who underwent breast-augmentation surgery, stated, “I mean he [the cosmetic surgeon] explained the usual risks. You can die from it. But you can die getting your tonsils out. You know, any time you go under [general anesthetic] you could die. So, whatever.” Both of these comments suggest that the women were able to manage feelings of uncertainty and anxiety by acknowledging and then downplaying the risks involved with many medical interventions, again highlighting a need for strongly presented medical risk information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732311421774">
<title>Managing Medical Risks Passively</title>
<p>So far we have presented insights on women whose approach to understanding and assessing medical risks could be characterized as active. In contrast to the active consumer/patient is the passive or dependent patient, who is constructed as compliant, uncritical, and dependent on authoritative and expert knowledge. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421774">Lupton (1997)</xref>, compliance and dependence are seen as undesirable, because this “deviates from current dominant and privileged notions in Western societies about the importance of the autonomous self, the self who governs personal behavior via reason rather than emotion” (p. 374). Although the passive patient is viewed negatively within personal responsibility discourse, a few of the women chose to adopt the passive consumer/patient position precisely as a way to deal with the responsibility and possible blame of making a “bad” consumer/patient decision. In other words, when the outcome is left to a higher power (in this case, the surgeon), one is absolved of some of the weight of making the “right” consumer/patient decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421774">Parker &amp; Stanworth, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas the majority (20) of the women’s narratives reflect the belief that individuals have a responsibility to seek out additional information to make a well-informed risk assessment, a few (4) of the women chose instead to adopt the passive or dependent consumer/patient position, relying entirely on the expert knowledge of medical professionals to assess the risks and benefits associated with CBS. This strategy freed them from feeling responsible and from possible attributions of blame resulting from making a poor consumer/patient decision. An example of this strategy was described by Danielle, a 45-year-old mother of two who underwent breast-reduction surgery in 2000. She stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just went in to the plastic surgeon and spoke with him, and went over whatever he had to show me, and what he knew for knowledge, ’cause I thought that was my very best bet. . . . My very best bet, I thought, was just go straight to the source, and talk with him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A similar example was provided by Marcy, who was 67 when she underwent breast-reduction surgery in 2002. Marcy explained that her decision to undergo breast-reduction surgery was based on her trust in the medical expertise of her primary care physician. She explained, “I went to my doctor one day for a checkup and I was just sitting there with the sheet, and she come in and she looked at me, and told me that I needed a breast reduction.” Although Marcy had never considered undergoing breast-reduction surgery prior to this doctor visit, she went along with her doctor’s orders, because she had “faith” in her and trusted that this was a medically necessary procedure. Following this she went to the cosmetic surgeon, and again she stated that she did not want any additional information on the possible medical complications following breast-reduction surgery, because, as she explained, “ignorance is bliss.” Marcy, Danielle, and the two other women who adopted the passive-patient position did not question traditional medical knowledge in the ways that the other women described above did. In turn, by depending solely on expert knowledge, these women stressed that their doctors were responsible for the outcomes of their surgeries, because they took the physician’s assessment of risks to be the only relevant criterion in their decisions.</p>
<p>All of the women who adopted the passive position underwent CBS between 2000 and 2006, and therefore their decision making occurred within a context of “commercial medicine” that placed individuals in the role of patients and consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311421774">Sullivan, 2004</xref>). In contrast to the majority of the women interviewed, however, these women chose to disengage with the active patient/consumer role. It is possible that they chose to adopt the passive consumer/patient role because they underwent procedures that were medically justified and financially covered by the Canadian health care system. Thus, the lifestyle risks (which we discuss below) attached to these procedures were lessened, and these women were not required to defend their choices to the same degree as women who chose to undergo CBS procedures that were viewed as elective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311421774">
<title>Social Risks: Focusing on the Benefits</title>
<p>When we recall the positive gains available to women who achieve ideal feminine beauty, it is not surprising that another strategy used by almost all of the women was to focus on the benefits of undergoing CBS. For many of the respondents, perceiving CBS as beneficial and rewarding helped to control their feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. This strategy is in line with the argument made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421774">Parker and Stanworth (2005)</xref> that risk taking involves possible losses and gains, and thus, “Voluntary exposure to danger may be done reluctantly but be regarded as ‘worth it’ and necessary if some positive gain is to be made” (p. 319). Lisa, who underwent breast-reduction surgery, explained, “I did look at all the pros and cons, and there didn’t seem to be a lot of cons, really. It was all going to be a positive thing if I did it.” For Lisa, the pros included having breasts that were less heavy and “saggy,” and being able to fit into sexually attractive bras and lingerie, reflecting an understanding that sexual attractiveness is seen as a strong enough benefit to override potential health risks. Similarly, when discussing the possibility of losing nipple sensation following breast-reduction surgery, Natalie stated, “I did think about it and it did kinda bother me. But I thought that the greater outcome was worth that for me. For me it was weighing that against what it would be like after.” In a similar vein, Chantelle, who was only 21 at the time of her breast reduction, felt that the benefit of having breasts that no longer appeared “old” and “saggy” outweighed the risks.</p>
<p>The benefits women cited in managing their risk perceptions were not only attached to achieving conventional sexual attractiveness, but were also specifically tied to heteronormativity. For example, as we discussed above, Robin’s decision to undergo CBS was directly linked to her desire to satisfy her husband. Although not all of the women’s choices were directly tied to the desires of their male partners, many of the women did reflect their cultural awareness of the relationship between beauty ideals and the likelihood of finding and keeping a partner. For example, Karen stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean, if my breasts were not very attractive then I can’t wear attractive clothing. So I can’t wear bustiers or things like that, you know? And then obviously I am the girl that’s going to get passed over by guys all the time. And so I had the surgery.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Lisa explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Even the caliber of men I was dating changed. I used to date the “average Joe”—quiet, sort of reserved kind of guys. And then [after the surgery] I was picking the one in the room that I wanted, and that made a huge difference to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not all of the women were quite as candid as Karen and Lisa; however, most of the narratives reflected the assumption that CBS was a practical and worthwhile means to heteronormative ends. Indeed, it can be argued that such strategies are in fact risk-reduction strategies, wherein the social risks are decreased “success” in the heterosexual arena.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits for heterosexual success, a number of women described why having ideal breasts could be beneficial in the workplace, particularly in waitressing and service work. Tara explained that she was motivated in part by the prospect of her new and improved breasts as vehicles to gain better tips at work by “being feminine and using your assets and doing what you have to do.” Tara went on to say, “I knew it was going to help, because I do bikini contests, and it really helps to fill out a bathing suit.” Diane, who also had breast-enlargement surgery, drew a direct connection between her increased cleavage and her ability to generate additional income, noting, “I had more or less been a career waitress. . . . If I had been in an office job maybe I wouldn’t have wanted it so badly.” For these women, CBS was considered to be an investment in their bodies, and a risk-reduction strategy, because their increased physical capital could be used to gain economic capital and avoid economic failure.</p>
<p>From the comments presented above, it is clear that the women framed their desire to undergo CBS in a positive light by highlighting the benefits associated with the decision, such as increased self-confidence and a youthful, feminine appearance, or increased marketability in the workplace or the marriage market. Furthermore, many claimed that these benefits outweighed the possibility of medical risks. In the end, these strategies of framing the positive outcomes as more weighty than the medical risks allowed the women to argue that undergoing CBS was “worth it” because it offset the social risks attached to “failed” femininity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311421774">
<title>Lifestyle Risks: Responsibility and Blame</title>
<p>In addition to balancing the medical and social risks, the women described managing lifestyle risks associated with CBS. CBS is commonly perceived as frivolous, selfish, or vain, and as such it falls into the category of lifestyle risks, and people who take these kinds of risks have a heightened likelihood of being perceived as irresponsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421774">Lupton, 1999</xref>). The interviews revealed that the women who underwent breast-augmentation surgery were particularly at risk of being seen by others to be acting selfishly and irresponsibly. Although both breast reduction and breast augmentation are rarely accomplished strictly as a result of medical need, only augmentation surgeries are generally understood to be done for aesthetic rather than medical reasons. Within this cultural context it is possible that women who underwent breast-augmentation surgery were facing weightier lifestyle risks than women who underwent medically justified surgeries. Furthermore, for the women who were wives and/or mothers, managing risk and uncertainty was balanced against how consequences of their decisions would affect others. Thus the women’s choices were embedded within discourses of blame and responsibility.</p>
<p>One common approach to managing risk and uncertainty was to wait a few years to undergo CBS so that the possibility of experiencing specific age-related risks might be lessened or prevented. Risk takers, especially those undertaking lifestyle risks, are often “represented as irrational, self-deluding and irresponsible if they challenge health risk assessments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311421774">Lupton, 1995</xref>, p. 90). The women’s decisions to wait several years to undergo CBS to prevent or lessen the possibility of experiencing certain risks can be seen as an attempt to distance themselves from this negative construction of lifestyle risk takers. For example, given that some women experience difficulty breastfeeding or are unable to breastfeed following CBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421774">Nommsen-Rivers, 2003</xref>), the decisions of a few of the women to defer CBS until after they had finished having children or until there was an improved likelihood of being able to breastfeed following surgery can be seen as a form of resistance to the idea of CBS as an irresponsible lifestyle risk.</p>
<p>Nancy, a 46-year-old mother of two, explained, “I guess what instigated my decision [to undergo breast-augmentation surgery] was that I knew I wasn’t going to have any more children, and so I wasn’t worried about the breastfeeding aspect.” Similarly, Teresa, who also had two children, stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, I had thought about it before children, and I had checked into it and gone to consultations, and I researched it and everything. And because of the side effects or complications with surgery you might not be able to breastfeed, so I wanted to wait. I wanted to make sure I could have my kids and breastfeed the way that I wanted to. So I waited till after I had kids.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both of the above excerpts suggest that the women accepted the cultural understanding that, as wives and mothers, women are “guardians of health,” and thus should be “more risk averse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311421774">Thirlaway &amp; Heggs, 2005</xref>, p. 109).</p>
<p>The women’s experiences reflect the gendered nature of risk and tensions between two dominant but contradictory cultural meanings associated with idealized femininity and women’s breasts. The women had to balance the cultural imperative of embodying idealized femininity with the expectation that mothers should unselfishly put their needs aside to care for their families. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421774">Blum (1999)</xref>, medical discourse that promotes the “breast is best” philosophy is used to educate and persuade mothers to breastfeed. In this cultural context, a woman’s choice to breastfeed is viewed as a moral choice, and women who choose not to breastfeed, or are unable to breastfeed, are culturally constructed as “bad” mothers. Women who have undergone CBS and are unable to breastfeed, or have difficulty breastfeeding, are seen as particularly “bad” mothers because they chose to undergo CBS despite the possible negative outcomes. These women are then blamed both for the medical complications they experience and for being “unfit” mothers. The decision to wait until after having children was clearly a way to engage in risk management and also to minimize any blame or guilt that would be associated with “failing” to protect their families from negative risk outcomes. In this way, the women were presenting a “version of reality that is viewed least damning to their image of self in order that their moral character is preserved” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421774">Coxhead &amp; Rhodes, 2006</xref>, p. 111).</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the women to exercise control, rationality, and responsibility in their risk management, it is clear that because the lifestyle risks attached to CBS were seen to be self-imposed, the women who did experience ill effects from their surgeries were punished for their choices. Leanne’s story provides an illuminating example. Eight years after her initial breast-augmentation surgery, Leanne woke up to find that one of her implants had ruptured and was causing her a great deal of pain. Her physical suffering was compounded by mental distress when she discovered that the medical staff in the emergency room did not deem her ruptured implant to be an “emergency.” Leanne explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So my husband took me to the emergency room, and they were such jerks. They just treated me like I am a piece of crap. The hospital people, like the nurses and the doctors, treated it like it wasn’t a big deal—like it was nothing. And they said, “Well, you know you need a referral to go to the plastic surgeon.” And I’m like, “This is an emergency!” and they’re like, “No, actually, it isn’t an emergency.” And then I’m like, “But I’m in pain!” And it was so horrible. You know, they treated me like I wasn’t even human.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inhumane treatment Leanne received is indicative of the sanctions that can be imposed on women when they are perceived to have made “irresponsible” or “frivolous” consumer/patient decisions, and clearly such sanctions do not take into account the social imperatives that women must juggle when making such choices.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421774">Fraser (2003)</xref>, in medical discourse women are constructed as responsible decision makers, and simultaneously treated as being unable to fully comprehend and cope with the medical information given to them. Ultimately, this contradiction results in cosmetic surgeons being excused for providing insufficient advice and inadequate results. Thus, when women have complications following cosmetic surgery they are often understood to be responsible for their own suffering, because it is assumed that they knew the risks involved and chose to have the surgery despite these possibilities. This conclusion is supported by our research, and in particular by Leanne’s experience outlined above.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>An increasingly market-based medical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421774">Conrad &amp; Leiter, 2004</xref>) places individuals in a position whereby they are expected to act as rational and competent consumers/patients. This allowed some of the women to exercise agency by shopping around for cosmetic surgeons, gaining knowledge about the procedure beforehand, and evaluating the results of friends and acquaintances. The strategies the women employed to manage risk and uncertainty provided them with some sense of control over their bodies. This sense of control, however, often proved to be false for many of the women who experienced medical problems following surgery. Several of the women who underwent breast-augmentation surgery also explained that they were more vulnerable to lifestyle risks after surgery, because their decisions were largely framed as individual and frivolous consumer choices. Within this difficult context, it is perhaps predictable that a few women adopted the passive patient position to free themselves of the responsibility of making a well-informed decision. However, because CBS blurs the line between medical and consumer choices, and individuals are likely to become increasingly responsible for their health-related decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421774">Bendelow, 2009</xref>), adopting a passive consumer/patient position seems to be a less-than-viable option. The current situation, wherein social benefits appear to outweigh medical risks—because medical risks are understated by medical professionals, or are simply attenuated and hence difficult to assess—can have dangerous consequences for women who are making fateful health-related decisions. Indeed, because the personal choice and responsibility discourse in relation to risk management masks the underlying social causes of risk taking, women are placed in a precarious position wherein they are understood to be personally responsible for making wise consumer/patient decisions, yet held accountable for any of the negative outcomes attached to these decisions.</p>
<p>Although it is imperative that cosmetic surgeons continue to provide women considering CBS with information on medical risks, the women’s experiences suggest that the notion of informed consent should be broadened to take into account the social and lifestyle risks associated with CBS, so that women can understand that, if and when things do go wrong, they might face censure and marginalization within the medical system for their “bad” choices. In addition, it is incumbent on medical practitioners to engage in discussions with clients that are honest about the culture of beauty and the limits of medicine to address the pressures women face in complying with its dictates.</p>
<p>The interviews provided a few examples of the kind of information that could be provided by surgeons. Following CBS, several women discussed how they were unprepared for the negative reactions and unwanted attention they received, and they explained that it would have been helpful to have been prepared for this. In addition, some of the women were disappointed when their postsurgical appearances failed to meet their expectations, and other women described increased feelings of inadequacy regarding other parts of their bodies following CBS. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421774">Adams (2010)</xref>, social representations of cosmetic surgery as routine and easy construct the understanding that cosmetic surgery can create perfect results. This is problematic, because “with all body projects there are limitations relative to outcomes and sometimes these limitations are inconsistent with individual expectations” (p. 765). Prior to undergoing CBS it is imperative that women be made aware of the limitations of CBS and be prepared for the possibility that they might encounter negative social reactions and/or feel disappointed with their bodies following surgery. By doing this, surgeons would be taking into account other forms of risk and providing the women with valuable information prior to undergoing surgery.</p>
<p>It is important to realize, however, that even in situations in which surgeons and patients are engaged in an open dialogue regarding the multiple forms of risk and the potential outcomes of surgery, given the pressures of lifestyle and social risks, there are clearly limits to the influence medicine can exact in the current cultural context. In addition, we must acknowledge that the historical period in which the women received risk information would have had an impact on the type of information they received and their decision making. As we discussed above, the women who underwent surgeries in the 1970s made their decisions based on the risk information that was available at that time; the surgeons were not acting deceptively and they gave the women all of the information that they could offer to provide informed consent. Even the women who had their surgeries within the last 10 years, however, explained that there were issues regarding the medical risk information they received and the way in which it was presented to them.</p>
<p>We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311421774">Mirivel (2010)</xref>, that “Plastic surgeons’ primary communicative responsibility should be to help prospective clients make informed choices about surgery,” and “institutional commitments, whether they are to acquire a clientele or to make money, cannot supersede medical and humanistic goals” (p. 800). Based on our research, there is still a great deal of work that needs to be done to ensure that women are offered full and informed consent prior to undergoing CBS, and we believe that more research needs to be done on the medical encounter within the cosmetic surgery context to achieve this goal.</p>
