<abstract>
<p>This article addresses the emerging patterns of contemporary media-based engagements between China and Africa and argues, after an examination of current media systems in both China and Africa, that, despite expressed worries to the contrary, because of reasons spanning from history to geo-politics, the Chinese model of media system as it currently stands does not stand a chance, at least in the foreseeable future, to be exported to Africa – a continent whose current media landscape is, and will arguably remain, significantly Western-oriented. The article concludes with a call for scholars to exercise analytical restraint in their examination of the potential impacts of recent China–Africa media relations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Generally speaking, even though it is widely acknowledged that African cultural systems have ‘withstood colonialism, the spread of Islam and Christianity and centuries of contact with external powers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611417679">Jennings, 2005</xref>: 466), it is indubitable that several dimensions of the dominant features of the political and socio-economic domains of contemporary sub-Saharan Africa are manifest indications of the impact of the region’s historical and contemporary contact with ‘external powers’. Arguably, European countries and their nationals have occupied the most prominent position as key ‘external power’ players in sub-Saharan Africa, whose historical engagement with the region changed the region in several ways.</p>
<p>European missionaries, for instance, implanted Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa and the religion has blossomed in the region tremendously. Current estimates, for instance, indicate that there are about 470 million Christians in Africa – meaning that one in five of all Christians in the world is an African (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611417679">Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, 2010</xref>: i). According to Katoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611417679">1984</xref>: 7) the introduction of Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa changed several aspects of African life, such as mode of dressing, marriage ‘concepts and customs’, as well as burial and funeral rites.</p>
<p>European missionaries, as Katoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611417679">1984</xref>: 8) further points out, also helped to ‘fight illiteracy, ignorance and disease’, notably by being at the forefront of the introduction of Western-oriented educational institutions and ‘modern medicine’ practices in sub-Saharan Africa. As Kinoti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611417679">1994</xref>: 24) has argued, European missionaries ‘must also take the credit for introducing modern medicine into Africa’.</p>
<p>Economically, Gana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611417679">1985</xref>: 115) has, for instance, pointed out that, Africa’s ‘incorporation’ into the global economy was ‘initiated by the Portuguese traders in the 15th century; consolidated by the slave trade between 1450 and 1750 and nurtured to maturity through trade in commodities between 1750 and 1900’. Thus, in several respects, like in the social domains, the current economic dispensation of sub-Saharan Africa is strongly rooted in the region’s historical economic engagement with ‘external powers’, especially Europeans.</p>
<p>Politically, one of the lasting vestiges of Europe’s colonization of sub-Saharan Africa is the plethora of states in the region which were mostly ‘constructed by colonialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611417679">Small, 2006</xref>: 13; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611417679">Gana, 1985</xref>: 115). As Mawhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611417679">1989</xref>: 248) has explained, these ‘constructed states’ generally arrived at ‘juridical statehood through the historically unique experience of a short period of colonial rule, followed by a sudden transition to political independence’, mostly in the 1960s.</p>
<p>What all this points to is the fact that there are enough historical examples to demonstrate that sub-Saharan Africa’s engagement with ‘external powers’ has had tremendous impacts in diverse domains in the region. Against such a record, any contemporary indication of an ‘external power’s’ engagement with sub-Saharan Africa has often occasioned intense academic and policy scrutiny with the aim being to understand the scope, motives and potential/actual consequences of such engagements in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, such academic and policy focus has centred on China’s renewed engagement with sub-Saharan Africa. In December 2010, the Chinese government issued its maiden White Paper on ‘China–Africa Economic and Trade Cooperation’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611417679">1</xref></sup> which revealed that China, now the world’s second largest economy after the United States of America, is Africa’s largest trade partner.</p>
<p>In a bid to diversify the scope of its cooperation with Africa China has, among others, sought to expand its media-based relations with the continent and to many interested media scholars, at least three central questions are worth looking into as far as these media-based Sino–African relations are concerned:</p>
<list id="list1-0021909611417679" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What forms/patterns are emerging as concerns media-based engagements between China and Africa?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In a region where engagement with ‘external powers’ has often had wide-ranging effects and where the media systems are currently in flux, are we on the cusp of witnessing an exportation of the ‘Chinese model’ of media system and its development to Africa as part of China’s renewed engagement with the African continent?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the above were to happen, what could be the implications of such a development for Africa’s socio-economic and political development?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In this article, an attempt is made to sketch a response to the first two aforementioned central questions. To do this, the article proceeds in four phases. In the first phase, to situate the context of contemporary Sino–African media-based relations, I describe the current situation of media systems across sub-Saharan Africa as well as their developmental orientations. In the second phase, I highlight the overall picture of the current scale of Sino–African relations, pointing out some of the major dimensions of current media-based relations between the two regions. In the third phase, I attempt to provide different ways in which these current Sino–African media-based relations could be understood and, in the last phase, I attempt to examine whether these current Sino–African media-based relations can lead to the development of the Chinese model of media system in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<title>Contemporary Media Systems in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
<p>Following the reintroduction of multiparty politics and the liberalization of the media sector across most of sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s, the African <italic>mediascape</italic> has changed significantly since then in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The changes in the media systems, which started in the early 1990s with the proliferation of private newspapers, have continued ever since with varying scales in different countries across the years to also include the liberalization of the audio-visual and telecommunications sector. Two decades after the commencement of these epochal changes, the political, technological, socio-economic, cultural and geo-political situation of Africa has changed and it has, therefore, become appropriate for scholars to assess the current situation of the African <italic>mediascape</italic> and predict its evolution.</p>
<p>Given that appropriate knowledge of the background and current situation of a media system is vital in any analysis that seeks to predict the ‘next steps’ of a media system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021909611417679">Ziegler and Asante, 1992</xref>: vi), in this article, the key features of current media systems across sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611417679">2</xref></sup> are first discussed before outlining the possible future orientations of these media systems, underscoring and analyzing in the process the prospects that recent China–Africa media relations have in shaping the contours of media systems development across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Before delving in detail to address the above, two issues are worth pointing out. First, as Bourgault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611417679">1995</xref>: xiii) argued, sub-Saharan Africa is both enormous and complex in such a way that ‘detailed accounts’ of the media systems of every country is impossible within the space limitations of this article. This notwithstanding, despite the significantly-different historical and current experiences of the different countries in the region, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611417679">Allen (1995)</xref> noted in relation to African politics, there are nonetheless common features across the media terrain in Africa which can permit a general description of the media systems in the continent.</p>
<p>Second, ‘systematic, reliable and consistent quantitative and qualitative data’ on media systems within sub-Saharan Africa is ‘severely limited and scant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611417679">Nisbet and Moehler, 2005</xref>: 25). As a result of this, the discussion that follows is less a methodologically-rigorous primary or secondary analysis of ‘raw’/available data but more of a summary of relevant conclusions from different research endeavours on the media in Africa done by communication scholars both in and out of Africa. Having said this, in the following paragraph I present a broad panoramic view of the current situation of media systems across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Across the board, communication scholars are in agreement that the media sector in contemporary Africa is undergoing tremendous transformations with the following characteristic key features:</p>
<list id="list2-0021909611417679" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Quantitatively, there has been a ‘tremendous growth’ of the media in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021909611417679">Ziegler and Asante, 1992</xref>: v; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 47) even though these media are still characterized by problems of sustainability and uneven national spread (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 11, 59).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Qualitatively, significant changes in the levels of professionalism of media personnel notwithstanding, the media across Africa are still caught up in battles to reflect and defend ethno-regional cleavages in their locales with a despicable tendency for some journalists to sacrifice professional standards for the service of ‘ethnic, religious and regional interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 57–8).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As regards the ever contentious state–media relations, while changes in legislation have fostered private ownership of the media across Africa, some African governments have, beyond the provision of financial assistance to the private media, continued to intervene in the media system by way of attempting to ‘maintain and enhance attempts’ at press controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 42).</p>
<p>What broad picture can thus be said to emerge after such a brief descriptive overview of the media systems across sub-Saharan Africa? Basically two angles of response emerge from this question: the first is attempting to describe in a ‘model-like manner’ the current media systems across the region, and the second is attempting to postulate on the bases of the former how these media systems could evolve as years go by.</p>
<p>With regards to the first angle of this response, a sort of <italic>état de lieu</italic> of current media systems in sub-Saharan Africa, it is appropriate to begin by agreeing with Nisbet and Moehler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611417679">2005</xref>: 6) that the broad picture which emerges after such a descriptive overview of the media systems across the region is that all of sub-Saharan Africa is stuffed with ‘transitional media systems’, systems which have remained ‘in flux with varying degrees of structural, social, economic and political challenges and obstacles that retard their further development and evolution into fully democratized, open and free mass media systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611417679">Nisbet and Moehler, 2005</xref>: 6). If we agree that these media systems are indeed transitional, then where are they at the moment (under what ‘box’ could they be bundled) and where are they likely to be tomorrow; or, more appropriately, where are they indicating that they could be tomorrow? These questions harbour on the second angle of the response and are inescapably tied, for purposes of theoretical arguments, to the issue of media systems modelling and classification.</p>
<p>To borrow from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611417679">Hallin and Mancini’s (2004)</xref> classification of media systems, it could be argued that, generally speaking (with few exceptions of course), these current African media systems could be bundled under the Polarized Pluralist Model of media systems whose key features include: a strong role of the state in the media sector; the media serving as an instrument of political struggle; the limited development of mass circulation press; and also the ‘relative weakness of common professional norms’ among journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611417679">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>: 306). Writing in the case of South Africa, Hadland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611417679">2010</xref>: 93) has, for instance, argued that instead of ‘groping its way toward utopian media liberalism, South Africa is slipping toward Polarized Pluralism’, arguing that in South Africa, there is a noticeable increase in political parallelism, state intervention in the media and a decline in journalistic professionalism.</p>
<p>So, if it is argued (albeit debatably), that the current media systems in Africa could be bundled at the moment under the Polarized Pluralist Model, how could these media systems evolve in the future? ‘Modelling-speaking’, where are they heading to and where could they be many years to come? Attempting to provide responses to such questions is not easy as this easily leads one into sometimes un-mastered waters of futurology. But because media systems all over the world change as key variables within the society change, it is possible to look at the way such variables could develop and then map out ‘prospective analyses’ of how the media system could evolve. Among these key variables that could determine the pattern in which media systems could evolve are: developments/changes in the political domain/regime; changes in legislation related to the media; broader socio-economic changes; technological changes and also, importantly, for countries in places like sub-Saharan Africa, changes in the geo-political cartography of the country/region and the role of ‘external powers’ in the region.</p>
<p>As far as the current situation and future prospects of media systems development in Africa is concerned, the potential impacts on trajectories of media systems development caused by these last key variables – changes in the geo-political cartography of the country/region and the related role of ‘external powers’ in the region – is currently gaining relatively much attention in the wake of China’s renewed engagement with sub-Saharan Africa. To ‘reduce’ (without minimizing) the debate as to the future direction of media systems development in sub-Saharan Africa, as China is scaling-up its engagement with the continent and widening the scope of its relations with Africa by adding a ‘media-dimension’ to its ‘ties-renewal’ with the continent, media scholars, as indicated earlier, have been asking whether we are on the cusp of witnessing an exportation of the ‘Chinese Model’ of media system to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>In the next section of this article, and within the framework of attempts to discuss the direction in which the ‘transitional’ media systems across sub-Saharan Africa could evolve, I will examine these emerging contemporary China–Africa media relations, discussing possible ways to frame these relations and addressing in the course of writing, the seemingly-emerging hypotheses (fear/worry?) that we could be in the cusp of witnessing an exportation of the ‘Chinese Model’ of media systems to contemporary sub-Saharan Africa. I begin this section with a brief depiction of the broader picture of current Sino–African relations and a descriptive summary of the Chinese media system.</p>

<title>The Dragon is Back: Contemporary Dimensions and Scale of Sino–African Relations</title>
<p>China’s engagement with Africa spans a period of several centuries. According to Jesman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611417679">1964</xref>: 26), the ‘earliest contacts’ between China and Africa ‘date from the days of the Han Dynasty (1st and 2nd century AD) and so, even though the Chinese ‘abandoned’ their attempts to ‘penetrate further’ into Africa by the middle of the 15th century, they had nonetheless ‘gained a fair knowledge of the continent’.</p>
<p>Following this 15th century ‘disengagement’, according to Jesman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611417679">1964</xref>: 27), Africa ‘faded from the national consciousness of China’ for five centuries, but all this started changing significantly after the Bandung Conference of April 1955. This Conference represented China’s ‘effective entry into the Afro–Asian community to cultivate trading links and extend technical and economic assistance in the African continent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909611417679">Wilson, 1964</xref>: 61; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611417679">Ismael, 1971</xref>: 507). From this Bandung Conference until now, the relationship between China and Africa has undergone interesting phases in an almost cyclical manner.</p>
<p>Between 1960 and 1965, the era of wide decolonization in Africa, there was ‘greater interaction’ between China and Africa, but this declined during the immediate post-independence years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0021909611417679">Yu, 1977</xref>). This low-scaled interaction persisted until the late 1980s and began thawing away in the 1990s as a result of the support China received from some African states in the wake of the Tiananmen Square crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611417679">Taylor, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, following the ‘termination of super power competition and emergence of economics as key determinant of foreign policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611417679">Payne and Veney, 1998</xref>: 867), China has, over the years, changed its foreign policy from ‘confrontation to cooperation, from revolution to economic development and from isolation to international engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611417679">Muekalia, 2004</xref>: 5). In practical terms, what this has meant in relation to Africa is that China, which is like an awakened dragon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611417679">Mahbubani, 2005</xref>), has effectively ‘returned’ to Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021909611417679">Zafar, 2007</xref>: 103), embarking on a ‘charm offensive’ towards Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611417679">Chan, 2007</xref>: i) and expanding its interests there both in a ‘mercantilist’ way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611417679">Holslag, 2006</xref>: 133) and at a ‘breathtaking pace’, prompting some people to call what is happening a ‘new invasion of the continent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611417679">French, 2006</xref>: 127).</p>
<p>Having emerged as an ‘economic juggernaut’ thanks to its historic economic ascendance which is ‘impressive by any measure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611417679">Moore, 2008</xref>: 499), China has sought to take its relationship with Africa to unprecedented levels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611417679">Ngomba, 2007</xref>, for a summary of the contemporary scale of Chinese engagement in different sectors in sub-Saharan Africa). As mentioned earlier, the maiden ‘China–Africa Economic and Trade Cooperation’ White Paper published by China in December 2010 indicated that China has become Africa’s largest trade partner. According to the White Paper, while the volume of bilateral trade between China and Africa stood at US$12.14 million in 1950, by November 2010 this had risen to US$114.81 billion.</p>
<p>Of interest in this article is the currently-emerging media dimension to China’s rise and media-based engagement with Africa in particular. With regards to its broader media expansion, as Schiller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611417679">2005</xref>: 80) points out, China’s media content, advertising and hardware industries are ‘establishing transnational affiliations and using them to broaden and reorganize the domestic market-and vice-versa at a furious pace’. In Africa, the media dimension of China’s ‘partnership’ with Africa has taken several forms, amongst which are the following: partnership between Chinese media and local media organs in Kenya; provision of radio-jamming devices to Zimbabwe; support for the state media in Kenya and Zambia; donation of communication gadgets to the ruling party in Cameroon; acquisition of contracts or provision of loans to transform the telecommunications sector in countries like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, Equatorial Guinea and Uganda and the hosting of several journalism-training seminars for African journalists in China (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611417679">Banda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">Franks and Ribet, 2009</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611417679">Ngomba, forthcoming</xref>, on discussions of some of these media-based Sino–African partnerships).</p>
<p>The extent of Chinese involvement in Africa in a wide range of areas at the moment raises two key challenges in both policy and academic circles: understanding China’s motives, and the consequences for such cooperation. With regards to the first key challenge, especially as it relates to contemporary Sino–African economic relations, even though ‘intangible interests are often the primary shapers of a country’s foreign policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611417679">Payne and Veney, 1998</xref>: 870), most commentators are in agreement that oil is the main driving force for China’s renewed interest in Africa (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611417679">Taylor, 2006</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0021909611417679">Zweig and Bi, 2005</xref>). Kaplinsky et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611417679">2006</xref>: i) have, however, cautioned that it is important not to see the contemporary Sino–African relationship as ‘purely an economic phenomenon’ but, rather, it is important to look at it also as one with broader geo-strategic concerns for both China and Africa, with the latter in particular seeking ‘alternatives to shun pressures exerted by Western governments and NGOs [non-governmental organizations] to promote more transparent and better governance’.</p>
<p>This, then, leads to the second challenge which, in line with Africa’s experience with the consequences of engaging with ‘external powers’, is basically focused on attempting to comprehend the consequences of such a diverse and intensive interaction between China and Africa. The question, as the editors of <italic>e-Africa</italic> asked in February 2005, is whether China is a ‘dire threat to Africa or a dynamic partner’, or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611417679">Lafargue (2005)</xref> put it more forcefully: is China just an investor or a predator in Africa? For some people, especially those who subscribe to the ‘China-as-threat’ thesis, China may be providing cheap goods to Africans as well as much needed fast and ‘untied aid’ to African governments, but China’s silence on issues of good governance in Africa has mixed with what some consider Chinese-caused visible negative effects in the textile industry in Africa; for example, to give China the confusing picture of a smiling dragon with arms stretched to Africa, at once welcoming, friendly but at the same time dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611417679">Ngomba, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving from a broader picture, to put these two key challenges preoccupying concerned policy makers and scholars within the specific realm of contemporary Sino–African media relations, the questions asked have revolved around the following: what could be the driving motive of China’s recent media relations with Africa? How can we frame these emerging forms of partnership and, lastly, what does this portend as far as media systems development in Africa is concerned? I will proceed to attempt an answer to these key questions beginning with the first: what could be the driving motive of China’s recent media relations with Africa and how can we frame these emerging forms of partnership?</p>
<p>At the moment, it is appropriate to contend that, because these contemporary Sino–African media relations are still emerging and have not yet been put under serious, systematic academic scrutiny, much is open for ‘guess work’ than for wide-ranging empirically-grounded analyses. So the ‘real’ motives for China’s recent media relations with Africa are left, at the moment, at the level of highly-personalized interpretations and debatable framings. As reflected once more in the December China–Africa White Paper, China itself has often framed all its engagement with Africa as one grounded on the ‘principles of equality, effectiveness . . . and reciprocity’ with the desired aim for China and Africa to work towards serving the ‘common interests of the two sides’ in a way that will lead to ‘mutual benefit and progress’.</p>
<p>If this desire for mutual development is the foundational basis of China’s renewed engagement with Africa, how can its recent media-based relations with the continent be framed? The emerging analyses of this phenomenon have suggested that there is an ‘ideological commitment’ underlying China’s media-based engagements with Africa (see, notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611417679">Banda, 2008</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">Frank and Ribet, 2009</xref>: 131, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611417679">Banda, 2009</xref>). Banda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611417679">2008</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">Frank and Ribet, 2009</xref>: 130–1) cites China’s support for Zambia’s state-owned media during election periods from 1996 to 2006 which ‘diffused the electoral power’ that the opposition parties ‘might have had’ as demonstrating this ‘underlying ideological commitment’ on the part of Beijing with regards to its media-based relations with Africa, despite the latter’s ‘insistence to the contrary’. While Banda might be correct to assume this ‘ideological’ orientation of Chinese media support to the state broadcaster in Zambia, such initiatives, like the media-based support of the ruling party in Cameroon by the Chinese, ought to be examined also, beyond such ‘ideological lenses’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611417679">3</xref></sup> and rather more within the broader context of Chinese engagement in respective countries.</p>
<p>I will take turns below to ‘alternatively interpret’ and frame four different Chinese media-based engagements in Africa, three of which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">Franks and Ribet (2009)</xref> cite. These four engagements include: China’s media-based support of the ruling party in Cameroon; its support of the state broadcaster in Zambia; its provision of radio-jamming devices to Zimbabwe; and, lastly, its liaising with local media in Kenya.</p>
<p>While I will not directly underscore an ‘ideological commitment’ in China’s communication-based support to the ruling party in Cameroon, for instance, it is possible and indeed plausible that such initiatives, like that in Zambia, could be analyzed as nothing but a media-focused public diplomacy strategy by the Chinese to further entrench their wooing of ruling parties/cliques in Africa (who control state broadcasters anyway). To further its interest in the continent, China definitely needs the support of these ruling parties/cliques. It could be argued further that it is still part of this media-based public diplomacy strategy that has led the tightly-controlled Chinese media to ‘rightly or wrongly’ emphasize ‘only the best of Africa, never referring to its perceived failures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">Franks and Ribet, 2009</xref>: 135). In this regard, such media-based support is not ‘intrinsically different’ at least in its desired aim, from the Chinese building hospitals, schools, roads, or stadia across Africa as part of their much acclaimed ‘win–win’ partnership with contemporary sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>If we argue that Chinese media-based initiatives like the ones just discussed in Cameroon and Zambia are not to be interpreted solely as demonstrating an ‘ideological’ commitment or alignment between China and respective African countries, what about the provision by China of radio-jamming devices to Zimbabwe? Could one also argue that there is no underlying ‘ideological commitment’ in such engagements? Plausibly. In this regard, I will agree with Sautman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611417679">2006</xref>: 8) that now, unlike in the pre-1990 years when China stood beside Africa ostensibly to combat colonialism, China’s renewed interest in Africa has taken an amazing ‘profit-centred’ outlook. Looking at China’s economic capacity at the moment, it is evident that communications and information technologies have, as Schiller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611417679">2005</xref>: 96) noted, come to comprise a ‘vital economic sector’ for China.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the December 2010 China–Africa White Paper cited earlier, the expansion in the scale of trade between China and Africa has been ‘gradually optimized and advantageous products have successively entered each other’s market’. According to the White Paper, since 2000, China’s export of machinery, automobiles and electronic items to Africa ‘has been dramatically increasing with product quality and technology markedly improved’. Currently, as revealed in the White Paper, ‘machinery and electronic products account for more than half of China’s exports to Africa’. In this regard, one could posit that, in its quest for Africa’s natural resources and markets for relatively cheap Chinese commodities, China has merely met ‘willing customers’ (autocratic rulers in sub-Saharan Africa) who are prepared to buy one of China’s technologies – radio-jamming equipments – to extend their grip on critical voices in their countries. So, for China, beyond any ideological undertones, providing radio-jamming devices to a country like Zimbabwe could merely mean market diversification. The democratic ramifications of these for citizens in the African countries concerned are of course an entirely different issue.</p>
<p>Lastly, what about Chinese media liaising with local media in places like Kenya? Earlier, it was argued that contemporary media-based engagements between China and Africa ought to be examined also, beyond ‘ideological lenses’ and rather more within the broader context of Chinese engagement in respective countries. It follows from this that, to adequately comprehend China’s media engagement strategies, we need to also look at what is happening in its relations with specific countries in other sectors and what are the domestic public reactions to these in Africa.</p>
<p>China might be entering Africa in ways unfathomable a couple of years back, but it is undeniable that, while African governments have stretched warm arms and decent red carpets to welcome China, there is an emerging public anger against the Chinese within some African countries where China and Chinese in these countries are seen as a threat to local economies, among other things.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909611417679">4</xref></sup> It is, therefore, in China’s interest to design approaches to ‘win the hearts and minds’ of not only African governments but also of its people. This in practical terms has meant that China has been ‘forced’, literally, to review and re-strategize its public diplomacy sector. This was given clear and official articulation in March 2004 when China launched ‘a new Chinese public diplomacy strategy’ with suggestions that China now needs to, among other things, move beyond ‘government-to-government diplomacy’ and initiate a public diplomacy to ‘engage foreign civil society’ all in a bid to ‘change the international view of China, redress the so-called China threat and make the world accept the rise of Chinese power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611417679">Wang, 2008</xref>: 263).</p>
<p>As Wang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611417679">2008</xref>: 265) further notes, in line with this new orientation to Chinese public diplomacy, there emerged within China a need for China to ‘carry out media diplomacy’ both within and out of China, using ‘all kinds of ways to introduce Chinese development and policies to the world and help foreign audiences understand China.’ In a practical realization of this new orientation, on 1 July 2010, according to the BBC,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909611417679">5</xref></sup> after ‘pouring millions of dollars into the broadcaster in an attempt to promote its own messages about China to the wider world’, China announced that its state news agency, Xinhua, has launched a ‘24-hour global news channel in English’ with Chinese officials saying the channel is meant to present ‘a better view of China to its international audiences’. So, it is within such parameters of China’s new public diplomacy strategy that we can and should interpret recent moves by China to link up its media with local media outlets in places like Kenya, for instance, as well as its strategy to invite several African journalists to China for training seminars.</p>
<p>Above, I have tried to sketch preliminary responses on how we could frame and interpret different patterns of recent China–Africa media relations. Having cleared this, the next key issue is: what do these contemporary China–Africa media relations portend as far as media systems development in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa is concerned?</p>
<p>More than five decades after the Bandung Conference, which established China’s renewed engagement with Africa, there has been intense engagement between the two regions in different spheres – economic, political, social, cultural and technological. According to Wilson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909611417679">1964</xref>: 62), when China decided to re-engage with Africa, the Chinese people were told by their leaders that ‘active support would be given to African national independence movements’ and that the Chinese experience in ‘transforming agriculture, launching industries and building Socialism would be of great significance and interest for Africa’. While the engagements in these spheres, especially in the socio-economic and technological spheres, might have led to impacts – both positive and negative – on the lives of Africans, it is plausible to argue that there is yet to be any significant wide-ranging adoption across sub-Saharan Africa, of specific ‘Chinese models’ be it in agriculture, economic/industrial development or medicine.</p>
<p>This notwithstanding, because Africa’s historical engagements with ‘external powers’, as discussed in the introduction to this article, has been a source of wide-ranging changes in the region, media scholars are still posing the question as to the potential impact of the recent China–Africa media relations on the continent’s media development. As Franks and Ribet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">2009</xref>: 130) phrase it, recent Sino–African media relations ‘beg the question of what the media implications of this relationship are’. Banda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611417679">2009</xref>: 343) has also urged scholars to pay close examination and ‘study China in Africa’s mediascape, in terms of how its influence will, if at all, reconfigure African media production, representation, identity, consumption and regulation’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909611417679">Xin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In response to all these questions about the potential impact of recent Sino–African media-based relations, it is fair to say it is a bit too early, if not indeed premature, to provide strong and systematic empirically-grounded answers to this question. But because academic interest has been triggered on the likely impact of these Sino–African media relations, it is in place to examine at least one of the main lines of ‘possibilities’ that have been expressed by commentators – the question (worry/fear?) that, because of current Chinese media-based engagements in Africa, the media systems in Africa could eventually develop along the Chinese model in future. Put more bluntly, the question asked has been: are we in the cusp of witnessing a ‘transplantation’ of the Chinese media system and its model of media development into sub-Saharan Africa?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is: NO! We are not going to witness a ‘transplantation’ of the Chinese media system or its model of evolution into contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, and these African media systems will not develop along the Chinese model. To substantiate this contention, it is pertinent to do three things: first, briefly provide a descriptive overview of the contemporary Chinese media system. Second, outline reasons why it is argued that media systems in sub-Saharan Africa will not develop along a Chinese route; and, lastly, provide an alternative perspective on the route towards which these media systems are likely to develop. These constitute the last part of this article and are addressed chronologically below.</p>

<title>Contemporary Chinese Media System: A Brief Portrait</title>
<p>Since China began its now famous ‘reforms’ in the late 1970s and finally entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the Chinese media landscape has ‘dramatically changed’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909611417679">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021909611417679">Zhengrong, 2007</xref>: 336; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611417679">Winfield and Peng, 2005</xref>: 263). Briefly, according to Zhengrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021909611417679">2007</xref>: 336–7), the key features of the ‘distinctive nature’ of this changing Chinese media system include the fact that, though some areas such as ‘content production and advertising’ are now ‘open to private capital’, the media are still state-owned and are ‘part of the government’; the media are currently both ‘pre-eminently political propaganda machines’ and ‘competitors in the media marketplace’ which provide ‘a public service’.</p>
<p>The contemporary Chinese media system is, therefore, a system oscillating between seemingly two conflicting dimensions but which the Communist Party in China has thus far managed to handle. This oscillation is between the state and the market. China’s media has overall remained party- and state-owned and are thus ‘mouthpieces’ of the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611417679">Dan, 2011</xref>: 110), although the government’s view of the media as ‘an ideological apparatus for political and state control’ is being challenged in the wake of the increasing commercialization of the media. This increasing commercialization is leading the media ‘away from an exclusive dedication to Party ideology’ with the result being a struggle by the media to ‘grope for a fine balance between the bottom line and the party line’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611417679">Chan, 1993</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611417679">Winfield and Peng, 2005</xref>: 255).</p>
<p>According to Ma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611417679">2000</xref>: 21), under the ‘spell of this unresolved duality’, contemporary Chinese media could be said to be characterized basically by ‘erratic reform, periodic repression and a deep-seated contradiction between political control and market-driven changes’. In classificatory parlance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611417679">Blum (2005)</xref> has placed China’s media system under what he called the ‘Asian–Caribbean Command Model’. This model (which, according to Blum also ‘houses’ countries like Zimbabwe, North Korea and Vietnam) ‘represents countries where the government has absolute control of the media except that the market is used for funding them’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611417679">Jakubowicz, 2010</xref>: 5–6).</p>
<p>Blum has debatably placed Zimbabwe alongside China in his ‘Asian–Caribbean Command Model’, but is it possible that, as a result of contemporary Sino–African media relations, we could see other media systems across Africa developing towards or becoming like the Chinese model? I submit that this will not happen but that, instead, the media systems across Africa will arguably remain significantly Western-oriented and, while they may not get there – at least in the foreseeable future – they will develop towards the liberal media system. This submission is grounded on the following reasons:</p>
<list id="list3-0021909611417679" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>African media systems have deep-rooted historical links with the West. Modern media of communication were largely introduced to Africa by Westerners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 40). As a result of this, and following years of colonialism and neo-colonialism, the media systems in Africa have thus been ‘highly influenced by Western societies and models’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 43).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Furthermore, and still related to Western influence on the media system in Africa, as concerns the core media personnel in Africa, while a good number of journalists in Africa have received Western training in Europe or North America, those educated in Africa have been trained in journalism schools whose curricula are designed to be similar if not exactly as those of journalism schools in the West (for a discussion of these see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611417679">Murphy and Scotton, 1987</xref> and more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611417679">Banda et al., 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is therefore not a surprise that journalists in Africa ‘largely endorse the same values’ as Western journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611417679">Murphy and Scotton, 1987</xref>: 30; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611417679">Ngomba, 2010</xref>) with researchers concluding for the most part that broadcasting, for instance in post colonial Africa, ‘has followed the style, formats and practices of similar institutions in the West’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>: 45).</p>
<p>It could therefore be argued that, in addition to the far more substantial and wide-ranging Western media assistance to contemporary Africa, as long as African journalists get trained continuously in Western-style journalism and expose themselves more to Western media, the Western-bound orientation of African media systems will most likely continue for a very long time. These are influences which the current patterns and scale of Chinese media-based engagements on the continent do not stand a chance to erode.</p>
<p>Politically speaking, taken together, sub-Saharan Africa is currently a bit too open (at least compared to China) for it to harbour the type of media system that exists currently in China. Beyond the lack of financial and material wherewithal to both develop and control the media as the Communist Party does in China, African governments are caught up with unceasing domestic demands for more freedom and international (mostly, if not entirely, Western pressure) for the entrenchment of liberal democracy to the extent that ‘going the China way’ will obviously be perceived within and out of Africa as moving several steps behind. At the moment it seems that very few African governments will dare to take the risk to bluntly change media legislation and ferociously and widely clamp down and control the media in a manner akin to China. The international and domestic pressures/risks will be too much for such regimes to bear. On the contrary, overall, these regimes are instead moving (both voluntarily and involuntarily, and at different paces), towards a more thickening of liberal democracy and, with it, the features of a liberal media system. So, politically speaking, it is not feasible for African media systems to evolve along the Chinese route. We might experience a couple of tentative strides along that route – like in Zimbabwe, but that will merely be an exception.</p>
<p>In his book <italic>The End of History and the Last Man</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611417679">Fukuyama (1992)</xref> contentiously argued that, what the world was witnessing was not just the end of the Cold War but rather ‘the end of history as such’ and the ‘universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government’. In media systems analyses, there has also been a similar acknowledgement that, in the context of globalization, what is being currently witnessed is nothing short of a universalization of the liberal media model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611417679">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>: 251). The pace of this universal implantation might vary nationally as well as the pattern, but the overall ‘syndrome’ is true of China as it is true of African countries.</p>
<p>In the context of this current global situation, it is more plausible for African media systems to evolve along the liberal media model than the ‘Chinese model’ because, in the context of globalization, as countries get substantially integrated into the ‘global economic system’, they begin adopting in media and related spheres dimensions of liberal democracy. China, like African countries are each integrated in their own way to the global economy and it is therefore plausible that the media systems in both regions could evolve towards one direction – the liberal model.</p>
<p>Far from significantly influencing African media systems to develop ‘its way’, though tightly and ideologically controlled, the Chinese media is itself arguably showing signs that it is drifting, albeit tepidly, into the logics of a liberal media model. Three points buttress this argument:</p>
<list id="list4-0021909611417679" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>China has, over the years, promoted a core liberal tenet-market freedom alongside the commercialization of its media system. Winfield and Peng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611417679">2005</xref>: 260) have even argued that the commercialization of the Chinese media system is making the party and government organs become ‘business entities, similar to a Western capitalist system with advertising, subscription dependence and capital investment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909611417679">7</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Journalism training and practice in China is also changing, hinting at orientations towards the liberal model. Chinese journalists are now willing to take advantage of the little freedoms they have, thanks to commercialization of the media, to practice a bit of challenging journalism in a way that reflects a ‘fundamental change’ from what used to exist prior to the commercialization of the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611417679">de Burgh, 2003</xref>: 802; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611417679">Dan, 2011</xref>: 114).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lastly, curricula in journalism schools in China have now ‘incorporated to a great degree audience appeal and pseudo-Western news values ranging from the five Ws in the lead to prioritizing conflict, relevance and consequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021909611417679">Xu et al., 2002</xref>: 75). All these go to indicate that even though some scholars looking at the current political situation in China have concluded that ‘there is no chance’ that the liberal media model could ‘emerge in China’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611417679">Winfield and Peng, 2005</xref>: 265), there are nonetheless indications that the severely-controlled, Communist-guided media system in China is gradually tilting towards the liberal media model. China, like Africa, might not have a fully liberal media system (as normatively defined) for several decades to come, but recent developments do indicate that things could change and are changing, however slowly.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The principal focus of this article has been to analyze the current media systems in sub-Saharan Africa and to examine, in the wake of recent and developing China–Africa media relations, the differing directions which these media systems could evolve in the future, with a special focus on whether African media systems can develop along the directions of the Chinese media system.</p>
<p>Many features of contemporary sub-Saharan Africa might be outcomes of the region’s historic engagement with ‘external powers’, as discussed in the introduction, but it has been argued above that, although media systems in sub-Saharan Africa are in transition, we are not in the cusp of witnessing a ‘transplantation’ of the Chinese model of media development to sub-Saharan Africa. It was also argued that media systems in sub-Saharan Africa will not develop along the Chinese model and that it is, however, possible that both the Chinese and African media systems, each in its unique pace and pattern, are all heading towards the liberal media model.</p>
<p>I join Franks and Ribet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">2009</xref>: 135) to conclude that contemporary China–Africa media relations represent ‘fertile ground worthy of further exploration’. But in doing this, communication scholars need to resist the temptation that has befallen scholars in other fields like international relations and political science who, in their recent scholarship about China’s global ascendancy, have ‘sensationalized’ China’s rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611417679">Moore, 2008</xref>: 497). Scholars need to exercise a justifiable restraint in their analyses, especially of the potential impact of such media-based relations between China and Africa.</p>
<p>Lastly, though far apart geographically and different in many respects, it is important to note that China and sub-Saharan Africa share a lot in common, especially with regards to their media histories than it is often acknowledged. For instance, like in most of sub-Saharan Africa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417679">Nyamnjoh, 2005</xref>), the first modern Chinese-language newspapers were published by Western missionaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611417679">Volz and Lee, 2009</xref>: 713). Like in sub-Saharan Africa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611417679">Banda et al., 2007</xref>), Western-style journalism education and training has a long history in China (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611417679">Volz and Lee, 2009</xref>). Like African journalists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611417679">Ngomba, 2010</xref>), Chinese journalists also yearn for Western-style investigative, watch-dog journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611417679">de Burgh, 2003</xref>: 803) and, more broadly, like the media systems across sub-Saharan Africa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611417679">Nisbet and Moehler, 2005</xref>), the Chinese media system, as Winfield and Peng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611417679">2005</xref>: 255) note, is a media system in transition.</p>
<p>Given all this, it is therefore indeed ‘worthy’ for scholars to pay particular attention to the patterns, scope and effects of contemporary China–Africa media relations in a way that is not only less hyperbolic and more level-headed but also prioritizes and appreciates ‘African agency’ in these relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417679">Franks and Ribet, 2009</xref>: 135). This would mean, for instance, that beyond asking what impact recent China–Africa media relations could have on Africa, the question could be directed at both partners, interrogating empirically also what impact this might have on China and what China can possibly learn from sub-Saharan Africa in the way it has, for instance, proceeded to open up its communication space, despite being in the context of political transition.</p>
