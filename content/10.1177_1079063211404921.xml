<abstract>
<p>We addressed the construct validity of Stable-2000 and Stable-2007 scores by examining correlations between selected items and validated independent measures of relevant constructs in samples of convicted sex offenders. In Study 1, the Child Molester Attitudes item of the Stable-2000 shared 23% of the variance with a self-report measure of beliefs supportive of child molestation, <italic>r</italic>(19) = .48. The Deviant Sexual Interests items of the Stable-2000 and Stable-2007 shared 7% to 66% of the variance, respectively, with an offense-history-based measure of pedophilic interests, <italic>r</italic>(18) = .27 for the Stable-2000 and <italic>r</italic>(11) = .81 for the Stable-2007. In Study 2, the Lovers/Intimate Partners, General Social Rejection/Loneliness, Rapist Attitudes, and Child Molester Attitudes items of the Stable-2000 shared 4% to 19% of the variance with self-report measures of, respectively, intimacy, <italic>r</italic>(90) = −.44; loneliness, <italic>r</italic>(88) = .34; beliefs supportive of rape, <italic>r</italic>(72) = .21; and beliefs supportive of child molestation, <italic>r</italic>(78) = .36. The results generally suggest that the Stable items examined are associated with measures of similar constructs; however, the degree of convergence was lower than expected. More systematic and comprehensive research is needed to examine convergence of the Stable items with other relevant measures and additional aspects of construct validity. Such efforts will provide a clearer understanding of dynamic risk factors, appropriate areas of focus for treatment efforts, and, more generally, <italic>why</italic> some sex offenders recidivate.</p>

<p>The Stable-2000 and, more recently, the Stable-2007, are interview- and file-based tools designed to assess dynamic risk factors for sex offender recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson, Harris, Scott, &amp; Helmus, 2007</xref>). Both measures have demonstrated moderate predictive validity for sexual, violent, and general recidivism (AUCs ranging from .64 to .69) in a large prospective study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>). Although the primary validity criterion for measures like the Stable-2007 is the accuracy with which they can predict sexual recidivism, it is just one aspect of construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211404921">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>).</p>
<p>The extent to which the items actually capture the constructs of interest is also an important issue for at least two reasons. First, if these items are viewed as treatment targets, treatment efforts will be appropriately guided when the items reflect the intended constructs but may be misguided if the items do not represent the intended constructs. It should not be taken for granted that the measure, as designed or as applied by assessors, adequately measures the intended constructs. Second, the construct validity of the Stable items also becomes important when interpreting failures to find the expected relationship between items and recidivism. Assessing the degree to which the construct of interest is measured by the items addresses one possible interpretation of such findings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al. (2007)</xref> found that the attitude items of the Stable-2000 were unrelated to sexual recidivism; consequently, these items were not included in the Stable-2007. Perhaps attitudes supportive of sexual offending are truly weak predictors of sexual recidivism. Alternatively, perhaps attitudes supportive of sexual offending are important but were not well measured in the Stable-2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>). If the Stable-2000 attitude items are highly correlated with validated measures of attitudes tolerant of rape and child molestation, this would suggest that the poor predictive validity may not be attributable to problems with measurement. Instead, the more plausible conclusion would be that these attitudes, at least as typically conceptualized in the literature, may not be particularly good predictors of sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Research examining the construct validity of sex offender risk assessment scales is sorely lacking. Construct validity has generally been defined as an overall index of a test’s validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211404921">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>). Namely, the construct validity of a scale is established by integrating all evidence evaluating the extent to which the inferences derived from the test are valid. The degree of relationship between the test and other relevant measures is but one step required to establish construct validity. Construct validity can (and should) also be addressed by examining known-groups validity, predictive validity, content validity, factor structure, temporal stability, and change in response to intervention (Chronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063211404921">Embretson, 2007</xref>, for an extensive review of evidence supporting construct validity). Determining the construct validity of a test requires identification of the latent construct of interest and the integration of multifaceted evidence regarding the extent to which the test reflects that latent construct.</p>
<p>Although no published studies have examined the construct validity of the items of the Stable-2000 and Stable-2007, the construct validity of another dynamic risk assessment instrument for sex offenders has recently been evaluated. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211404921">Canales, Olver, and Wong (2009)</xref> examined the sexual deviance items of the Violence Risk Scale—Sexual Offender Version (VRS-SO) in a sample of 124 incarcerated adult male sex offenders. The VRS-SO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211404921">Wong, Olver, Nicholaichuk, &amp; Gordon, 2003</xref>) is an actuarial instrument, which consists of static and dynamic risk items, designed to estimate risk of sexual recidivism, identify treatment targets, and assess change. The VRS-SO Sexual Deviance factor (sum of ratings on five dynamic items) was correlated with sexual interest in children as measured by percent full erection to pictures of prepubescent girls (<italic>r</italic> = .35) and prepubescent boys (<italic>r</italic> = .26) and a screening scale scored from offense and victim characteristics (Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests; SSPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211404921">Seto &amp; Lalumière, 2001</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = .43). These results suggest that the VRS-SO Sexual Deviance factor shares up to 18.5% of the variance with these measures of sexual interest in children (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> × 100 = .43<sup>2</sup> × 100 = 18.5%).</p>
<p>In two studies, we address the issue of construct validity of the Stable-2000/2007 by examining the extent to which the Lovers/Intimate Partners, General Rejection/Loneliness, Rape Attitudes, Child Molester Attitudes, and Deviant Sexual Interests items are associated with validated and independent measures of putatively similar constructs. These studies are conducted using datasets originally developed for other projects. Consequently, only Stable items for which there were one or more putatively similar independent measures in one of the datasets were examined.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, we examined the degree to which the Child Molester Attitudes item of the Stable-2000 and the Deviant Sexual Interests item of the Stable-2000 and 2007 were correlated with independent measures of such attitudes (Sex With Children scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211404921">Mann, Webster, Wakeling, &amp; Marshall, 2007</xref>) and sexual interests (Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211404921">Seto &amp; Lalumière, 2001</xref>; Sexual Interest Profiling System; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211404921">Laws, 1986</xref>). The focus was limited to these Stable items because data on measures of other relevant constructs were not available in our dataset.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 33 adult male child molesters incarcerated in minimum- (<italic>n</italic> = 7), medium- (<italic>n</italic> = 16), or maximum-security (<italic>n</italic> = 10) federal penitentiaries in the Canadian province of Ontario. These participants were drawn from a dataset (convenience sample) developed for a larger project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063211404921">Babchishin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211404921">Kessous, 2009</xref>). At the time of testing, the average age of participants was 47.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.5, ranging from 21.5 to 74.2). The majority of participants were White (90.9%); the remainder were Black (6.1%) or North American Indian (3.0%). For participants with determinate sentences (<italic>n</italic> = 26), average aggregate sentence length was 4.92 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.61, ranging from 2.0 to 14.0); the remaining 7 participants had indeterminate sentences (e.g., life). For 90.9% of participants, the youngest victim in current or prior sex offenses was under 12 years old. For the remaining 9.1% of participants, the youngest victim was between 12 and 13 years old. Approximately half of the sample (48.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 16) had participated in sex offender treatment.</p>

<title>Stable-2000</title>
<p>The Stable-2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>) assesses six areas: (a) significant social influences, (b) intimacy deficits, (c) sexual self-regulation, (d) attitudes supportive of sexual assault, (e) cooperation with supervision, and (f) general self-regulation. Intimacy deficits, sexual self-regulation, attitudes supportive of sexual assault, and general self-regulation are assessed by considering various indicators. Each area or indicator is scored on a 3-point rating scale: 0 (<italic>no problem</italic>), 1 (<italic>some concern/slight problem</italic>), or 2 (<italic>present/definite concern</italic>). Intimacy deficits, for example, are assessed by scoring offenders on the following five indicators: (a) lovers/intimate partners, (b) emotional identification with children, (c) hostility towards women, (d) general rejection/loneliness, and (e) lack of concern for others. The highest value on any of these five indicators determines the score on the Intimacy deficits factor. Similarly, attitudes supportive of sexual assault are assessed by taking the highest score on the following three indicators: (a) sexual entitlement, (b) rape attitudes, and (c) child molester attitudes. Total Stable-2000 scores can range from 0 to 12 (0-4 = <italic>Low</italic>; 5-8 = Moderate; 9-12 = <italic>High</italic>). The Stable-2000 has shown good internal consistency (α = .83), high interrater reliability (intraclass correlation [ICC] = .89), and moderate predictive validity for sexual recidivism (AUC = .66, 95% CI = [.59, .72]), violent recidivism (AUC = .65, 95% CI = [.59, .70]), and general recidivism (AUC = .67, 95% CI = [.63, .71]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>). An independent validation of the Stable-2000 yielded similar results for sexual recidivism (AUC = .68, 95% CI = [.64, .71]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211404921">Saum, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In Study 1, only the following items of the Stable-2000 were examined: Child Molester Attitudes and Deviant Sexual Interests. The Child Molester Attitudes item assesses beliefs that minimize or justify child molestation. The Deviant Sexual Interests item reflects sexual interest in, or sexual arousal to, illegal, inappropriate, or highly unusual sexual activities (e.g., sexual interest in children, nonconsenting adults, fetishism, etc.). The scoring of this item can be based on past behaviors or sexual interest assessments (e.g., self-report or phallometric testing).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1079063211404921">
<title>Stable-2007</title>
<p>The Stable-2007 is a refinement of the Stable-2000. It consists of the following 13 items: (a) significant social influences, (b) capacity for relationship stability, (c) emotional identification with children, (d) hostility toward women, (e) general social rejection, (f) lack of concern for others, (g) impulsivity, (h) poor problem solving skills, (i) negative emotionality, (j) sex drive/preoccupation, (k) sex as coping, (l) deviant sexual preference, and (m) cooperation with supervision. Scores can range from 0 to 26, with higher scores indicating greater risk of sexual recidivism. High interrater reliability has been found for the Stable-2007 total score (ICC = .92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211404921">Fernandez, 2008</xref>). The Stable-2007 has also shown good internal consistency (α = .80) and is a strong predictor of sexual recidivism (AUC = .76; 95% CI = [.59, .74]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In Study 1, only the Deviant Sexual Preference item of the Stable-2007 was examined. As in the Stable-2000, Deviant Sexual Interests are defined as sexual interest or sexual arousal to illegal, inappropriate, or highly unusual sexual activities (e.g., sexual interest in children, nonconsenting adults, fetishism). However, the Stable-2007 scoring of this item now requires the assessment of multiple indicators of sexual deviancy, including number of sex offense victims, number of deviant preference victims (e.g., male children), self-reported deviant interests, and specialized testing (e.g., phallometric assessment). The highest score of these four indicators of sexual deviancy becomes the score for this item. In comparison to the Stable-2000, the coding of this item is now more structured and requires the consideration of past sex offenses. High interrater reliability has been found for the Deviant Sexual Preference item of the Stable-2007 (ICC = .87; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211404921">Fernandez, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Static-99</title>
<p>The Static-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211404921">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063211404921">2000</xref>) is an actuarial risk assessment scale developed to predict sexual recidivism. It consists of 10 items: (a) prior sex offense charges/convictions, (b) index nonsexual violence, (c) prior nonsexual violence, (d) number of sentencing dates, (e) any stranger victim, (f) any unrelated victim, (g) any noncontact sex offense, (h) any male victim, (i) age of the offender, and (j) whether the offender has ever been in a common-law relationship lasting longer than 2 years. Total scores can range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater risk of recidivism. The Static-99 is one of the most accurate sex offender risk assessment instruments for predicting sexual recidivism (average <italic>d</italic> = 0.67; 95% CI = [0.62, 0.72]; <italic>k</italic> = 63; <italic>N</italic> = 20,010) and adequately predicts violent recidivism (average <italic>d</italic> = 0.57; 95% CI = [0.52, 0.62]; <italic>k</italic> = 35; <italic>N</italic> = 14,197; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211404921">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The Sex With Children (SWCH) scale</title>
<p>The SWCH scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211404921">Mann et al., 2007</xref>) is a self-report measure designed to assess beliefs supportive of child sexual abuse. The SWCH scale contains 18 items that are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Scores can range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting stronger and/or more frequent endorsement of beliefs supportive of child sexual abuse. The scale has two factors. Factor 1, Harmless Sex with Children, reflects minimization of the harmfulness of adult–child sexual contact. Factor 2, Provocative Sexual Children, reflects a view of children as interested in and actively seeking out sexual contact with adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211404921">Mann et al. (2007)</xref> examined the psychometric properties of the SWCH in exploratory and replication samples. The scale demonstrated strong internal consistency (ranging from α =.87 to .94) in both the exploratory and replication sample. It also showed excellent test-retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .93) over an average 72-day interval for 30 sex offenders drawn from the total sample. There is evidence for the construct validity of the SWCH. Specifically, it was correlated (.38 to .63) with other measures of beliefs supportive of child sexual abuse in the replication sample and it differentiated child molesters from nonmolesters in the exploratory sample.</p>

<title>Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI)</title>
<p>The SSPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211404921">Seto &amp; Lalumière, 2001</xref>) is designed to measure sexual interest in children. Four items are scored from information commonly found in official files: (a) any male victims, (b) more than one child victim, (c) any prepubescent victim, and (d) any extrafamilial victim. Scores can range from 0 to 5, with higher scores reflecting greater sexual interest in children. There is evidence for the construct validity of the SSPI. For example, is it correlated with phallometrically assessed sexual attraction to children (<italic>r</italic> = .23 and <italic>r</italic> = .27, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211404921">Canales et al., 2009</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = .46, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211404921">Seto, Murphy, Page, &amp; Ennis, 2003</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = .34, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211404921">Seto &amp; Lalumière, 2001</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = .28, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211404921">Seto, Harris, Rice, &amp; Barbaree, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Sexual Interest Profiling System (SIPS)</title>
<p>The SIPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211404921">Laws, 1986</xref>) assesses sexual interest via 130 situational vignettes, which are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from <italic>very unattractive</italic> to <italic>very attractive</italic>. There are 19 scales in total, two of which reflect nondeviant sexual interests: heterosexual sex between consenting adults and homosexual (male) sex between consenting adults. The remaining 17 scales assess Deviant Sexual Interests: female pedophilia, male pedophilia, female incest, male incest, female rape, male rape, female masochism, male masochism, female sadism, male sadism, female voyeurism, male voyeurism, female exhibitionism, male exhibitionism, female frottage, male frottage, and transvestism. Scores for each scale can range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater sexual interest in that particular sexual activity. The SIPS has been found to differentiate between child molesters with boy versus girl victims and to contribute independently to the classification of child molesters above phallometric assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211404921">Laws, Hanson, Osborn, &amp; Greenbaum, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study, three scores were computed from the SIPS scales: Deviant is the highest score on any of the 17 deviant interest scales (scores can range from 10 to 70). Nondeviant is the highest score on the two nondeviant interest scales (scores can range from 10 to 70). Deviant—Nondeviant is the difference between these and the preceding scores (scores can range from −60 to 60). A positive Deviant—Nondeviant score would reflect <italic>greater</italic> attraction to deviant than nondeviant sexual behaviors, a negative score would reflect <italic>less</italic> attraction to deviant than nondeviant sexual behaviors, and a score of zero would reflect <italic>equal</italic> attraction to deviant and nondeviant sexual behaviors.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited and tested by two graduate students in psychology as part of a larger project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063211404921">Babchishin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211404921">Kessous, 2009</xref>). Participants completed the SWCH and SIPS (along with several other measures not examined in the current study). Their files were then reviewed to score the SSPI, gather demographic and offense information, and transcribe item scores from the Static-99, Stable-2000, and Stable-2007, which had been completed by trained psychologists and program officers for risk assessments at one or more points during offenders’ current sentences. When more than one Stable assessment was available for an offender, the most recent was used. For 5 participants, the most recent Stable was completed prior to participation in a sex offender treatment program. The average time between completion of the self-report measures and the most recent Stable-2000 assessment was 2.35 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.37, <italic>n</italic> = 21).

<p>As noted above, Stable assessments on file varied in their recency to the date the self-report measures were administered and some offenders (<italic>n</italic> = 5) had participated in sex offender treatment between completion of the most recent Stable assessment and completion of the self-report measures. Although it seems reasonable to suspect treatment or the interval between assessment on the Stable and completion of the self-report measures may have reduced the observed correlations, taking these variables into account had minimal impact on the association between the Stable items and the self-report measures. More specifically, partial correlations controlling for treatment participation or time between Stable assessment and completion of the self-report measures yielded values very similar to the correlations reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1079063211404921">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The purpose of Study 2 was to replicate and extend some of the findings from Study 1 with a larger sample. The Stable-2000 items examined were Lovers/Intimate Partners, General Rejection/Loneliness, Rape Attitudes, and Child Molester Attitudes. The self-report measures considered were the Miller Social Intimacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211404921">Miller &amp; Lefcourt, 1982</xref>), Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211404921">Russell, Peplau, &amp; Cutrona, 1980</xref>), Bumby RAPE scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063211404921">Bumby, 1996</xref>), and the Bumby MOLEST scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063211404921">Bumby, 1996</xref>). As in Study 1, the focus was limited to these particular Stable items because data on measures of other relevant constructs were not available in our dataset. Because this dataset contained different measures than the dataset used in Study 1, we were able to examine some Stable items in Study 2 that we could not examine in the Study 1 dataset (Lovers/Intimate Partners and General Rejection/Loneliness) but we were unable to examine Deviant Sexual Interests as we had in Study 1. This sample does not overlap at all with the sample in Study 1.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 95 adult male sex offenders participating in low- (66.3%) or moderate-intensity (33.7%) sex offender treatment programs with complete data on at least one of the Stable-2000 items and at least one of the corresponding self-report measures. Participants took the program while incarcerated in federal penitentiaries (<italic>n</italic> = 85) or while in the community on conditional release (<italic>n</italic> = 10). These participants were drawn from a dataset developed for a larger project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211404921">Nunes &amp; Cortoni, 2007</xref>). The Stable-2000 and self-report measures were completed before participants started sex offender treatment. At the time they had begun the sex offender treatment program, the average age of participants was 45.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.7, ranging from 19.9 to 68.4). The majority of participants were White (89.5%); the remainder were Black (3.2%), Arab/West Asian (2.1%), Latin American (1.1%), North American Indian (2.1%), Inuit (1.1%), and Japanese (1.1%). For participants with determinate sentences (<italic>n</italic> = 91), average aggregate sentence length was 3.34 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.09, ranging from 0.83 to 16.25); the remaining 4 participants had indeterminate sentences (e.g., life, dangerous offender). In terms of victim age in the index sex offense, 59.2% had at least one victim under 12 years old, 61.8% had at least one victim between 12 and 17 years old, and 22.4% had at least one victim 18 years or older (note that the percentages sum to more than 100% because some offenders had victims in multiple age groups).</p>

<p>The Stable-2000 was described in the Measures section of Study 1. In Study 2, the Lovers/Intimate Partners, General Rejection/Loneliness, Rape Attitudes, and Child Molester Attitudes items of the Stable-2000 were examined. The Lovers/Intimate Partners item assesses the existence and stability of current intimate relationships. General Social Rejection/Loneliness assesses the ability to make friends and have close relationships. Rapist Attitudes assesses beliefs that minimize or justify sexual assaults against adults. Child Molester Attitudes assesses beliefs that minimize or justify child molestation. Adequate interrater reliability has been found for the General Social Rejection/Loneliness item, which is the same in Stable-2000 and Stable-2007 (ICC = .75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211404921">Fernandez, 2008</xref>).

Although the risk assessment and self-report measures were conducted as part of the same pretreatment evaluation, the data from the self-report measures were not used to score the Stable-2000; this was confirmed by the then manager of sex offender programs at Correctional Service Canada (P.

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of these studies was to examine the extent to which selected Stable-2000 and Stable-2007 items are associated with validated independent measures of putatively similar constructs. In Study 1, the Child Molester Attitudes item from the Stable-2000 was considered, as were the Deviant Sexual Interests/Preferences items from the Stable-2000 and Stable-2007. In Study 2, four items of the Stable-2000 were considered: Lovers/Intimate Partners, General Social Rejection/Loneliness, Rape Attitudes, and Child Molester Attitudes. The convergence between the Stable items and relevant measures was generally low. The shared variance was very low for the Social Rejection/Loneliness (12%), Rape Attitudes (4%), and Deviant Sexual Interests (0.02% to 7%) items of the Stable-2000. Results were more encouraging but still mixed for the Child Molester Attitudes (13% to 24%) and Lovers/Intimate Partners (19%) items of the Stable-2000 as well as the Deviant Sexual Preferences item (0.4% to 66%) of the Stable-2007.</p>
<p>What do our results mean for the construct validity of these Stable items? At least two interpretations of our findings are possible. First, if the corresponding measures are accepted as valid reflections of the constructs of interest in the Stable-2000/2007, then most of the Stable items we examined do not seem to be measuring the intended constructs very well. This is not necessarily problematic from a recidivism prediction perspective; it is possible for an item to be a good predictor of recidivism even if that item does not actually reflect the intended construct. For example, even if the General Rejection/Loneliness item of the Stable does not actually reflect loneliness, whatever it does reflect is a good predictor of recidivism. From a recidivism prediction perspective, the underlying construct is not particularly important. However, with a measure like the Stable, where one intended use is to identify treatment targets and monitor change on those targets, the fit between the presumed and actual construct is obviously important for successful outcomes. If a high score on the General Rejection/Loneliness Stable item is interpreted as it would typically be in the psychological literature (e.g., in carefully constructed and validated measures like the UCLA Loneliness scale), interventions targeting loneliness may fail to address the real issue underlying this Stable item and, thereby, fail to reduce the risk associated with this real issue. This interpretation of our findings suggests that using these Stable items to inform treatment planning and monitor treatment success may be premature given the current state of knowledge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our almost exclusive reliance on self-report measures leaves our findings open to another interpretation. It is possible that biased responding (e.g., social desirability) or lack of insight may make these self-report measures poor reflections of the constructs of interest with the current samples. If this is the case, then the generally low correlations between the Stable items and the self-report measures may be due to methodological weaknesses with the self-report measures rather than problems with the Stable items. However, there is emerging evidence that biased responding on self-report measures may not be as much of a threat as typically assumed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211404921">Mills &amp; Kroner, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211404921">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063211404921">Mills, Loza, &amp; Kroner, 2003</xref>). Measurement error (unreliability) would also underestimate the observed correlations between the Stable items and the other measures. However, adjusting for unreliability of the measures had little impact on the correlations observed in the current studies. Thus we can have some confidence in the measures we used. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that any brief self-report measure (or any single measure for that matter) would be a perfectly accurate and complete reflection of the construct of interest. As a result, our findings do not permit strong conclusions about the construct validity of the Stable items. This familiar conundrum in construct validation has been summed up nicely by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211404921">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref>: The failure to find expected relationships between a test and criterion</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . shows the bridge between the two to be undependable, but this is all we can say. The bridge cannot be used unless one end is placed on solider ground. The investigator must decide which end it is best to relocate. (p. 295)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given that the Stable is a good predictor of sexual recidivism and the amount of time and effort put into its development and evaluation, continued evaluation of the construct validity of the Stable is the obvious choice.</p>
<p>In addition to possible issues with the selected criteria, convergence with other measures is but one aspect of construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211404921">Chronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063211404921">Embretson, 2007</xref>). Accurately predicting sexual recidivism is paramount and the Stable has performed well in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211404921">Saum, 2007</xref>). Future construct validation research should examine whether treatment aimed at a construct putatively assessed by a particular Stable item results in change on the score of that Stable item. Another important question is whether change in Stable scores corresponds to change in risk for sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>). Future research should also continue to examine convergence between the Stable items and more comprehensive and varied measures of the constructs of interest, such as validated performance-based measures.</p>
<p>In addition to the challenges noted above, one noteworthy limitation of the current studies is the small sample size, particularly in Study 1, which resulted in relatively imprecise effect size estimates (wide confidence intervals). Replication of these findings with larger and more varied samples is necessary. It is also important to note that the observed correlations between these Stable items and relevant measures would be affected not only by the design of these items but also by the accuracy with which they are scored by assessors (e.g., following the guidelines in the manual and training) and the quality of the information on which scoring is based (e.g., assessments, records, collateral sources). We were not able to investigate the relative effect of conceptualization versus implementation on the agreement of the Stable items and relevant measures because we could not determine the quality of the Stable assessments. However, other studies have found good interrater reliability on the Stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211404921">Fernandez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211404921">Hanson et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that the Stable can be scored with relative agreement between trained raters.</p>
<p>The current studies are an important, albeit incomplete, first step toward examining the construct validity of the Stable. The results generally suggest the Stable items considered are associated with measures of similar constructs, but the degree of convergence is modest. Our studies yielded correlations of similar magnitude to those found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211404921">Canales et al. (2009)</xref> for the convergence between the VRS-SO Deviance Factor and measures of sexual interest in children. In light of the ever increasing focus on the assessment of dynamic risk factors, future research should further examine the construct validity of measures like the Stable-2000/2007 and VRS-SO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063211404921">Hanson, 2009</xref>). Such efforts will provide a clearer understanding of dynamic risk factors, appropriate areas of focus for treatment efforts, and, more generally, <italic>why</italic> some sex offenders recidivate.</p>
