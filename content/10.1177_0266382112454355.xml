<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept of suffering from ‘information obesity’ – analogous to physical obesity in its causes, development and ill effects – is one worth considering, especially in our work as information professionals. Whilst we might think that we are less susceptible to information obesity due to our abilities to find, evaluate, manage, synthesize and distribute information, this is open to debate. In this article, I discuss my take on information obesity and its causes, illustrate some additional factors that might make us prone to information obesity, and put forth some thoughts and practices on preventing and coping with it in our professional lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0266382112454355">
<title>What is Information Obesity?</title>
<p>The subject of ‘information obesity’ has come up in a variety of contexts within the last few years. In 2009, Andrew Whitworth published a book, ‘Information Obesity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266382112454355">Whitworth, 2009</xref>), which took a broad look at the issue of information obesity from ICT (or IT), educational and societal perspectives. To quote from Whitworth’s definition:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<bold>Information obesity</bold> is a failure to turn information into knowledge, and thus use it to sustain our minds, bodies, lives and communities. But just as physical obesity is not simply the result of too much food, so information obesity is caused by more than just ‘information overload’. Also responsible are:</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>reductions in the quality of information</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>problems with mental ‘fitness’, that is, a lack of skills, training, etc. in the consumer of information</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>external pressures, whether from ‘information industries’, peers, or organizations within which we work, to consume information before we have properly judged its worth.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266382112454355">Whitworth, 2009</xref>)</p>
<p>In early 2012, Clay A. Johnson published the book ‘The Information Diet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266382112454355">Johnson, 2012</xref>) which also looked at the issue as well as offering some practical approaches to dealing with information obesity at both individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>In March 2012, the journal <italic>Scientific American</italic> published an article entitled ‘What Science Wants to Know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266382112454355">Firestein, 2012</xref>) which, in my view, touched on the idea of information obesity from the perspective of scientific research:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>One crucial outcome of scientific knowledge is to generate new and better ways of being ignorant: not the kind of ignorance that is associated with a lack of curiosity or education but rather a cultivated, high-quality ignorance. This gets to the essence of what scientists do: they make distinctions between qualities of ignorance. They do it in grant proposals and over beers at meetings. As James Clerk Maxwell, probably the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein, said, ‘Thoroughly conscious ignorance … is a prelude to every real advance in knowledge.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266382112454355">Firestein, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both Whitworth and Johnson emphasize that information obesity is not to be confused with or equated to information overload. Information overload is a part of the phenomenon of information obesity. What seem to be the characterizing factors of information obesity encompass similar characterizing factors of physical obesity: the wide availability of nutrition-poor sources; indiscriminant consumption; and lack of adequate fitness or exercise. In the case of information obesity, the result is, essentially, the inability to make sense of or act effectively on information – as Whitworth states, the inability to turn information into knowledge. We become increasingly powerless and unable to make sense of things.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0266382112454355">
<title>What causes Information Obesity?</title>
<p>In his book, Johnson draws several parallels between the physical obesity and information obesity epidemics. At the risk of duplication, I would like to further illustrate some of my observations on the causes of information obesity by providing some parallels.</p>
<p>First, information is everywhere – just as fast food is increasingly available everywhere. As an example, a common observance, at least in the United States, is that there are Starbucks coffee shops everywhere. I recently had the very odd experience of physically standing in one spot, with limited lines of visibility, and being able to see two different Starbucks coffee shops. I briefly had a vision of getting a coffee from one of the shops, which I would drink on the way to the next shop to order another coffee.</p>
<p>This scenario seems absurd. Yet just as there is a great number of Starbucks selling coffee – and I confess, the number of Starbucks makes it hard for me to not drink a lot of coffee! – there is a great deal of information available out there for the taking. Information has become like running water in our homes and in our lives. We can access information via print, computer, and mobile device. We can access it via televisions and information screens in public places. We are increasingly connected to and bombarded with information, from the time we wake up to the news, to the time we go to sleep with our Kindle or print book in our hands.</p>
<p>This scenario also illustrates the relatively recent dramatic shift in the accessibility of information. Just as higher-end coffee is now ubiquitously available, one can think of Google as the fast-food drive-through for information. Need an article on any topic? Google it. Need a quick cat video? Google it. Need to kill a few hours? Google something – you will find information on anything you can think of, and a lot of things you had no idea existed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266382112454355">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Factiva recently made available a white paper from Basex that discusses the concept of information overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266382112454355">Burke and Spira, 2012</xref>). As already mentioned, information overload is analogous to simply eating too much, taking too much in. Information overload has been described as the availability of too much information, and the increasing distraction of taking in information on a daily basis. Besides our mobile devices, the Internet, television, podcasts, video, books, magazines, and a variety of other sources, many of us can barely manage even our email inboxes.</p>
<p>In addition to the increased availability of information online, the dual trends of the explosion of the use of social tools and users creating their own content has made even <italic>more</italic> information available to us. You might think of it as a multitude of individuals cooking and serving up their own food and selling it. This is analogous to the ‘food cart’ phenomenon – small independent eateries in trailers that aggregate in ‘pods’ and that seem to be everywhere in Portland, Oregon, Austin, Texas, and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266382112454355">Olmstead, 2012</xref>). Like food carts, a lot of this information is tasty – however, often times this content is not the most ‘nutritious’ information.</p>
<p>Part of the social dynamic is also the duplication and cycling re-distribution of content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266382112454355">Figure 2</xref>). One of the defining characteristics of Twitter is the ability to ‘retweet,’ or send the same information to your set of followers. Content can be re-blogged via Tumblr and other blog platforms. You can ‘re-pin’ content in Pinterest. This dynamic can be fun, useful, and in some cases, important in spreading critical information. Yet at what point does the dynamic become like an email that has been forwarded innumerable times? How many times do we consume the same information over and over?</p>

<title>What additional issues are specific to Information Professionals?</title>
<p>I believe there are certain additional issues that are specific to librarians and information professionals:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Stress and uncertainty in the profession</bold>. Library staff and budgets continue to be cut. The boundaries of ‘information work’ have blurred so much as to be almost non-existent. ‘Traditional’ library jobs are increasingly scarce, and many practitioners are filling roles and performing tasks they never thought they would. While this shift can be exciting, it also causes stress in the profession, and an unhealthy reaction is often to protect ourselves with activity – ‘do more’ – gather more information, manage more information, do more with less. For example, we may feel like we need (or are required) to take on more information activities. While this might preserve our current position, it often dilutes our effectiveness and focus across the board.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A related issue is <bold>a lack of focus due to changes in the profession and practice of information work</bold>. The nature of library and information work is very different than it was even ten years ago. The very definition of ‘information work’ can encompass records management, technology, market research, mobile app development, and creating summer reading programmes, among other things. Professionals who have been in the field for 20 or 30 years find themselves in a completely different profession from when they began their careers. Lacking a clear understanding of the boundaries of our work can lead to trying to do too much – to be ‘all things to all people.’</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>The rapid evolution of technology</bold>. Technology is now integral to our work, and it continues to evolve and change at an astonishing pace. Simply keeping track of developments is stressful enough. Implementing and managing technology is even more so. Driven by the necessity to simply stay on top of the technology trends, we often attempt to take in all that we can about technology and its effect on information work.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Some</bold> <bold>librarians and information professionals have a tendency to want to put ALL relevant information in</bold> to any project. As a colleague of mine has suggested, this may be an example of ‘information anxiety’ and perfectionism – the fear that we have not done a good enough job. This may result, for example, in the researcher aggregating information iteratively, going over the same resources until he or she has ‘everything, just in case.’ To me, this can be a contributor to information obesity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>The need to keep up on all of the shifting factors influencing our work</bold>. I have already touched on the challenge of keeping up with technology. There are additionally the challenges of keeping up to date with the relevant sources available to us (for example, governments making data sets available), and of understanding how our organizations are shifting and changing so that we can stay relevant in the context of the organization. Both of these factors seem to be changing rapidly, just like technology.</p>

<title>Two complementary approaches to dealing with Information Obesity</title>
<p>Reviewing all of these factors can be overwhelming, and it paints a dire picture. It is easy to get overwhelmed and feel hopeless. I believe there is hope.</p>
<p>As information professionals, I feel we are very well positioned to help our customers and patrons deal with information obesity. In doing this, we have the opportunity to concurrently re-shape and re-invent some of the value that we provide as information professionals. However, we have to deal with information obesity in ourselves first.</p>
<p>I propose two approaches to dealing with information obesity: what I refer to as a practical approach, which provides actionable tips; and what I refer to as a philosophical approach, which has more to do with our approach to what we do.</p>
<p>The following suggestions are by no means comprehensive, but they may help us to begin to deal with this phenomenon.</p>
<sec id="section6-0266382112454355">
<title>A practical approach to Information Obesity</title>
<p>The practical approach is based upon the idea of simply managing your information intake. In offering these, I have borrowed from the ideas of Whitworth, Johnson, Ashkanas and other sources cited at the end of this article. I have also included my own ideas. Some of the tips here are also derived from the concept of content curation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266382112454355">Beth Kanter (2012a)</xref> provides an understandable explanation of curation, which incorporates the idea of sense-making into the process.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Actively manage your attention</bold>. Let me illustrate this very concretely. How many times have I checked my email while writing this article? The answer is – I have lost count. Did checking email contribute to the article? The answer is – no, it did not. The always-on nature of our lives has mostly become destructive. Some very basic ways to manage your attention might be shutting down your email for discrete amounts of time; putting your phone in another room; and scheduling blocks of time for NO meetings.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Turn off some stuff for good</bold>. For example, it is easy to subscribe to many different newsletters, feeds, and other sources in tracking a new topic, and then spend a very long time afterward simply deleting emails or feeling overwhelmed because you still have not caught up on your feeds. Give yourself a break. Set a goal, for example, of unsubscribing from five email newsletters over the next week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0266382112454355">Figure 3</xref>). It is like taking Taco Bell out of your meal rotation because you realize you do not really like the taste of it. Good for you!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Utilize personal information management tools</bold>. A <italic>Business Information Review</italic> article, ‘Surviving and Thriving as a 21st Century Knowledge and Information Professional’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266382112454355">Dale, 2011</xref>), discusses the concept of personal information management, and choosing the right tools to help manage information ‘inflow.’ Business trade journals are increasingly covering this topic as well. In addition to some of the tips already mentioned, other tools include personal bookmarking and creating a personal dashboard to manage information inflow. Tools such as Hootsuite, which can help with managing Twitter feeds, can also be very useful.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Capture less, scan more</bold>. Focus on key sources and topics. After you have oriented yourself to your topic, it does not take long to understand the key things that you need to track. Within the information landscape of your specialty, it is key to differentiate what is critical from what is simply noise. Pay attention to the thought leaders and content curators for a quick snapshot of information. If you feel you need to look at vast amounts of information, scan more, and focus on those things that stand out to you. Trust yourself. You can more thoughtfully choose what you incorporate into your consciousness and work.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Curate content yourself by adding value</bold> as opposed to simply cutting and pasting. This practice breaks the cycle of indiscriminate consumption of information, and helps you build your own sense-making skills. If you make yourself describe <italic>why</italic> a piece of information is important, you start to better understand your own thought process and to take control of it. The key is to be careful not to invest so much time in curating content that you lose sight of turning it into meaningful knowledge. This is the cultivation of ‘high-quality ignorance’ – the ability to let the unimportant or less important information go, and to embrace the quality information in more depth.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Let yourself make sense of things</bold>. I know researchers who have been researching topics and industries for years. For example, a researcher might have an amazing knowledge and grasp of the computer hardware industry, yet he does not feel like he is an ‘expert’ or can offer insights because he does not have an engineering degree. As information professionals and researchers, we have a wealth of valuable information available to us. Trust yourself to understand the information and make some sense of it.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Share your insights and be willing to have a conversation</bold>. Talk with others, either your customers or your colleagues, and share your thoughts and insights. This is similar to the process scientists go through, asking questions and discussing information. At our best, we do not simply seek information. We seek information to convert it into knowledge, and to apply that knowledge.</p>

<title>A philosophical approach to Information Obesity</title>
<p>The practical tips allow us ways to deal with information obesity in a concrete and immediate way. However, I do not believe a solely practical approach can sustain us in staying ‘informationally fit.’ What is going to help us to fight information obesity in the long term?</p>
<p>Ben Hughes, in discussing the concept of the information diet, puts forth what he calls ‘The Rules.’ I like the following guidelines:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>no news (Twitter, newspapers/sites, news-y podcasts)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>consume full thoughts (e.g. books, music, interviews, non-news blog posts, pre-planned TV)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>create stuff</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>take one day off a week and go nuts.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266382112454355">Hughes, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>These ideas combine a practical approach (actually weaning yourself from sources like Twitter, at least for some discrete amount of time) with a mindset that allows for some mental freedom and creativity. ‘Creating stuff,’ to me, forces us to exercise some discernment, thought, and application of the information we consume. If we need to create something, it requires a different type of activity than just consuming information. ‘Going nuts,’ for Hughes, means indulging in the exact behaviours one is trying to avoid or contain. This allows the freedom to see the effect of those behaviours, and to recognize that destructive part of ourselves. Hughes’ ideas are built on the idea of ‘slow information,’ a concept we will come back to at the end of the article.</p>
<p>My own additions:</p>
<sec id="section8-0266382112454355">
<title>Practice ‘Good Enough’</title>
<p>When I began my career as a researcher, I often struggled with the issues of ‘enough’ and ‘good enough’ research. Did I find enough information to satisfy my customer, and was it the right information?</p>
<p>I have heard researchers express this in a variety of ways. At what point do I stop my research? How do I know I have found the information that I need to find? How much is too much information? In short – where and when do I stop? This is the same question at the root of over-consumption.</p>
<p>Depending on the project, it often feels like the research and tracking of information could potentially go on and on indefinitely, consuming all of our time and effort. What usually stops me are deadlines. Deadlines work because they are very concrete boundaries, typically imposed by someone else.</p>
<p>In addition to deadlines, how can we support ourselves in ‘good enough,’ especially in the face of limited time? I think anyone who has conducted research for a few projects begins to gain an innate sense of when the critical information has been located – the point when your efforts are exceeding your gains (sometimes referred to as the ‘80/20’ rule).</p>
<p>This sense changes depending on the context of your work, the project, and the client. For example, when dealing with intellectual property and patent searching, research intrinsically needs to be more thorough and exhaustive. However, I believe we tend to apply an exhaustive search approach in situations that do not necessarily warrant it. I encourage you to pay attention to your sense of when you have gathered the critical information for a project, and to learn to trust that sense. Let yourself start to be comfortable and confident in it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0266382112454355">
<title>Realize You Cannot Possibly Know It All</title>
<p>Let us face it – no matter how good a researcher, information specialist, or librarian you think you are, you will NEVER be able to find, keep, understand, and integrate ALL of the information that is available in the world, or even on your topic. The sooner you accept this, the happier you will be.</p>
<p>Scientists understand this. The <italic>Scientific American</italic> article referenced earlier expresses this well:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Scientists and laypeople alike would agree that for all we have come to know, there is far more we don’t know. More important, every day there is far more we <italic>know</italic> we don’t know. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266382112454355">Firestein, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This concept reminds me of the discussions over the last person to ‘know everything’ – to have an understanding of all the knowledge in the world. Suggestions range from Aristotle to Johann Goethe to Emanuel Kant to John Milton. (Note that all of these people lived well before the advent of the Internet and electricity.)</p>
<p>I know I am not Milton – I am nowhere even close. So in a way, it is pretty presumptuous for me to even think that I can track all the information out there, even on a relatively narrow topic.</p>
<p>If I accept this, it gives me some perspective on myself and my capabilities. It deflates my ego a little bit. I realize that I can do an excellent job – I cannot do a perfect job. I only frustrate myself and others to try to do so.</p>
<p>Instead, embrace the idea that you have access to so much information and to so much expertise in this truly incredible time in the history of information. If you want an analogy, consider the unprecedented access we have to an astounding variety of foods these days. To use Portland, Oregon as an example – in addition to traditional supermarkets and natural food stores, I have access to Asian grocery markets, locally-grown food, farmers’ markets, gourmet coffee, and microbrewery beer, among other things. I can create any variety of diet, based upon my needs. The same can be said of our access to information.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0266382112454355">
<title>Final Thoughts</title>
<p>The idea of a ‘slow information’ movement, following in the steps of the ‘slow food’ movement, has been embraced from different perspectives. If we refer back to the slow food movement, the philosophy statement says, in part:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We believe that everyone has a fundamental right to the pleasure of good food and consequently the responsibility to protect the heritage of food, tradition and culture that make this pleasure possible… We envision a world in which all people can access and enjoy food that is good for them…. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266382112454355">Slow Food, accessed 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Simply substituting the word ‘information’ for ‘food’ gives you an idea of what a sound information diet approach might be.</p>
<p>Not to encourage poor information consumption, but search for ‘slow information’ on Google and you will come up with some further ideas on the concept. One of my favourites is Vanessa Kam, though this is only one post on the idea of the Slow Information Movement. Part of the manifesto she posted in April 2012 reads:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The symbol of the Slow Information Movement is a simmering pot … followers of the Slow Information Movement are called simmers. The act of conducting slow information research is called simmering.</p>
<p>Simmers limit multitasking in favor of focus and reflection.</p>
<p>We discourage the notion that doing research is about instant gratification and quickly and effortlessly finding the ‘answer.’</p>
<p>Simmers foster patience in research and celebrate it for how it evolves, is iterative, and hopefully transformative for the researcher/author. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266382112454355">Kam, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These concepts resonate with me, as they point to allowing the time and space for processing and sense-making – in my view, an excellent practice in combating information obesity.</p>
