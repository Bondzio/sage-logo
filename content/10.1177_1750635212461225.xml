<p>The dramatic title of this book is based on a Biblical reference. When, after killing his brother Abel, Cain is asked by God where his brother is, and responds with the challenge ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’, God replies ‘What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the earth.’ Although those of us sitting in Western Europe today are likely to see the threat of religious terrorism mainly in terms of Islamism, this careful and illuminating review of the subject – by an American psychologist and psychotherapist who is also a professor of religion – makes it clear that all religions can be and have been associated with terror, and – as in the title’s reference – with repudiations of it. The book’s main argument is that, while religion has of course got no monopoly on terrorism, there is something in the content of religious belief systems in general that puts them at particular risk of giving succour to a terrorist mindset.</p>
<p>The mindset of the religious terrorist, according to Jones, has a number of key components, which – to simplify and codify his analysis somewhat – can be described as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1750635212461225" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It is linked to a deep inner sense of humiliation and shame (whether or not the individual has personally been subjected to strong humiliation experiences at the hands of others).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It has a view of the world, which has a number of closely related components.
<list id="list2-1750635212461225" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>It requires a commitment to being at war with the larger society, however defined, which is seen as irredeemably corrupt.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It has a simple cosmology of good and evil. All of humanity, whether as individuals or social groups, is either part of the corrupt present reality and is therefore ‘satanised’, or is part of the future ideal world.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It has an apocalyptic vision in which the terrorists’ actions are part of a necessary process by which the corrupt world will be purified, through violence and destruction.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The inner sense of humiliation generates the programmatic features of item 2 in this list, which are attempts to obliterate the humiliation by triumphing over the satanised ‘other’. Jones demonstrates how secular psychological theory, especially that of the post-Freudian ‘relational’ psychoanalytic tradition (he makes particular use of the work of Ronald Fairbairn and Melanie Klein), can illuminate the means by which defences against inner vulnerabilities and wounds can produce programmes of terror. Central to his purpose is the argument that religion can play a crucial role in creating and validating this turn to violence, and that it does so when it has a god who is humiliating and punitive to his subjects. So the humiliation need not be objective, but can stem from the individual’s inner relationship to an image of god. An unforgiving and violent god will create fearful and shameful subjects, who may seek to escape from their condition by identifying with the angry god and finding others who can be seen as evil and who must therefore be destroyed for their wrongdoings. In some cases there may be an intermediate relationship with a charismatic leader figure who embodies the god’s punitiveness and omniscience, and who must similarly be obeyed. (In this and other respects corresponding to items 1 and 2 above, there are close parallels between religious and non-religious terrorism.)</p>
<p>Jones tests this model against three case studies: a broad one of jihadism treated generally, and two more specific ones of the Japanese Buddhist sect Aum Shinrikyo and the US apocalyptic Christianity movement, especially in its pro-Life dimension. In each case, the main discursive features of the terrorist mindset, which Jones had identified can be found. This could be seen as supporting the argument that religion of any sort must always tend to nurture this kind of violent tendency because, by definition, all religions call for submission to a higher authority, and thus favour the development of ‘authoritarian’ personalities who live in fear of punishment. However, Jones rejects this position, and argues instead that religions that are based on images of god as loving and forgiving will support a different kind of relationship between individuals and their ‘internal’ god, one which is not organised around fear and humiliation. There is therefore a fundamental ‘ambiguity of religion’, which means it can be both a source of terroristic violence and a powerful force of opposition to it. In other words there can be ‘religious counter-terrorism’, as Jones calls it, and in a more profound sense than that of religious leaders condemning terror. That in itself is necessary, but will not get to the heart of the matter if those leaders, however personally genuine their repudiations of violence may be, are the rest of the time representing a religion of fearful submission.</p>
<p>Without explicitly comparing religions, Jones discusses how the Christian narrative of Christ as a victim, and of God as generous and just, creates a possibility for followers to identify with the victim and thus to imagine a more compassionate and inclusive social body, instead of being bound to visions of society based on the unbending law of an authoritarian god. This part of the book draws on Girard’s analysis of the need for religions to move away from the practices of scapegoating and sacrifice which, while serving to unite a social group within a religious community, do so around the destruction of a representative of the ‘other’ and so legitimate repeated cycles of violence.</p>
<p>A question not addressed directly in this book is whether different faiths stand overall in different positions in relation to the ambiguity of religion, with different balances of power between these two forces, and therefore different potential for generating terrorism. If that were so, we would then have to ask whether it was because of a basic psychological configuration inscribed in the core beliefs, myths and icons of that faith, or whether it is a result of extraneous, circumstantial factors, such as the place of that religion in relation to regional conflicts and to geo-political forces at a particular time. Jones’s approach would probably favour the second answer since he is very careful to avoid any stance of psychological reductionism, acknowledging the need to take socio-cultural and political conditions into account throughout any analysis of the dynamics of terrorism – alongside the irreducibly psychological dimensions based on the nature of human emotion and some universal aspects of mental life.</p>
<p>In all, this book is to be recommended as a readable and measured inquiry into the psychological drivers of religious terrorism. Its rich case studies anchor an exploration of some of the most profound levels of human experience, an exploration that inevitably goes beyond the question of terror to reflect on the nature of religion itself. At the same time, there are insights here of value to the practical study of terrorism and the tasks of responding to it, in a number of areas. Not least of these is in relation to the media; for example, Jones points to the increased possibility for pragmatic alliances between anti-democratic religious groups whose cosmologies may converge in that both identify a certain group (e.g. homosexuals) as part of the evil they are committed to fighting. In the pre-web era, such groups would not have had opportunities to communicate with each other. This technical game-changer does not change the underlying forces but vastly increases their potential for harm. The media, however, have an ‘ambiguity’ parallel to that of religion in that they can also create new opportunities for the realisation of constructive potential. Jones’s description of the features of religious terrorism identifies some of the key elements that must be engaged across the media battlefields of meaning if their development into terrorist activity is to be minimised.</p>
