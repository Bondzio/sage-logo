<p>François Cooren quickly states the key mission of his book: to demonstrate how passion and incarnation lead to <italic>ventriloquism</italic>, ‘the phenomenon by which an actor makes another actor speak through the production of a given utterance’ (p. 1). As Cooren himself acknowledges, ventriloquism may initially seem far-fetched. His careful analysis of a variety of discourses (ranging from literary texts to study-oriented data collections) soon makes it clear, however, that the way people incite agency has been taken for granted in discourse studies and that exploring ventriloquism allows groundwork for moving beyond microanalysis and into macro-discursive connections.</p>
<p>Cooren dedicates the first chapter of the book to agency, quickly relocating action and agents from being solely human-oriented concepts. To do so, he thoroughly analyzes discourses that could be associated with flipping a light switch. While this exploration may initially indicate an intellectual exercise in the splitting of hairs, the foundation the exercise provides is essential for the rest of the text as it firmly establishes how utterances allow the appearance of human agency where there is none – or by ‘focusing on nonhuman contributions and calling these contributions action’ (p. 25). The chapter also establishes that new conceptions of agency may be in order, and that these new conceptions allow for what Cooren calls the <italic>analytical payoff</italic> of ventriloquism that is to come in future chapters.</p>
<p>The second chapter is a better indicator of the exciting nature of the rest of the book, as it explores the implications of analytically re-conceptualizing agency. It both realigns speech act theory and questions common assumptions held about both discourse and conversation analysis, working to illustrate that interactive talk is never fully under control by the participants involved. Those following Marina Sbisà or Edda Weigand’s work on speech acts and negotiation will find this chapter especially useful, as will anyone who questions how agency can be relocated through language practices. The chapter also provides a cogent and clear overview of Searle’s speech act theory as Cooren combines it with Derrida’s <italic>exappropriation</italic> to drive home the idea that what is said is not always what is meant; and that this expropriation of words is always ‘haunted’ by a form of appropriation (p. 56).</p>
<p>At this point the book shifts the focus of discourse analysis from examining the signs interlocutors produce (and the effects of such signs) to what it is that instigates behaviors and actions in conversation (both discursive and non-discursive), particularly what is <italic>made present</italic> in interactions. As Cooren explains, ‘any action (activity) involves in one way or another a form of passion (passivity) to the extent that any interlocutor can position herself or be positioned as animated, moved, motivated, led, inspired, enthused, stirred, forced, constrained, affected by specific <italic>beings</italic>’ (p. 58, italics in original) and further, asserts interlocutors make ‘another agent speak through the production of a given utterance or text’ (p. 58).</p>
<p>Using the work of a variety of language and discourse scholars, particularly Bruno Latour (who also wrote the foreword for the book) and Jacques Derrida, Cooren continues Chapter 3 by offering three specific ways that ventriloquism can aid understandings of dialogue and interaction: deeper considerations of how performative notions of dialogue are co-constituted in interaction by a variety of incarnating forces including emotions, facts, laws and traditions; establishing that performative natures of language can open an interactional scene to consider how interlocutors may be acting for or speaking on behalf of others and what those representations produce; and practical aspects of these understandings, particularly ethical implications. Combined, these contentions allow for a much needed framework where constructivist and material worldviews can be examined together, in a genuine way, as they are both invoked in interaction.</p>
<p>After the theoretical framework and justifications are founded, the second part of the book reads much more quickly as Cooren demonstrates how ventriloquism can be used as an analytical tool and the various ways it extracts understandings of multiple agents that are invoked in interaction. While the entire book moves in the direction of understanding how individuals are both active and passive when invoking others in discourse (whether ‘others’ is another person, object or other thing), Chapter 4 provides perhaps the clearest understanding of how, when a speaker cites someone or something else, he or she is both speaking for the other force and letting that force speak through them. This idea of reflexivity expands in many different complex directions, and Cooren’s excitement in exploring these directions is palpable. In the fifth and final chapter, he considers some initial implications of ventriloquism, such as how it allows communication to be a conduit for combining the material and immaterial. He also makes a compelling argument about why the term <italic>reification</italic> should stop being looked at in a negative light.</p>
<p>Despite the complex and sometimes dense nature of the material, the book is a pleasant and enlightening read that clearly articulates a new way of viewing discourse and considering connections between distal interaction and proximal connections. While Cooren pulls in a rich variety of sources to make his argument, one notable omission is the work of Leslie Baxter whose relational-dialectical theory, especially its latest iteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611432756">2011</xref>), examines how micro discourses play into macro ones. Such a similar concept, even if only mentioned as a parallel, could illuminate Cooren’s assertions and aid those who do discourse analysis as a form of relationship studies to make stronger connections. Still, as such a researcher I find myself excited about expanding using ventriloquism in my own work and believe others who read the text will want to apply it to their own work as well. This book is recommended to anyone who seeks to extend their work beyond the micro level and who wishes to explore the deeper implications of interaction’s reflexive nature.</p>
