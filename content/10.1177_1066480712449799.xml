<p>If one works with clients using a brief therapy model, one needs to be familiar with solution-focused theory. This model allows clients to focus on their strengths, find solutions to their problems, and focus on the future. This book, <italic>1001 Solution-Focused Questions</italic>, was very well written and clearly explains how to integrate the solution-focused model. Drawing her expertise as a seasoned therapist of 30 years, Frederike Bannink presents solution-focused questions and protocols to help the reader understand how to implement a solution-focused model.</p>
<p>
<italic>1001 Solution-Focused Questions </italic>presents an in-depth overview of how solution-focused therapy works. Throughout the book, Bannink presents numerous examples that help the reader understand how to integrate solution-focused skills with clients. The thought-provoking ideas presented in this book will certainly engage therapists into self-reflection about what helps clients to enact change and how to move from a problem-focused model into a solution-focused model. By focusing on solutions rather than problems, clinicians will learn how to help clients set specific goals that describe their future and find exceptions to their problems. This gives clients the understanding that there are times that things are already working in their lives and that they already have tools to grow and change.</p>
<p>The book is divided into 13 chapters. In the introductory chapter, the author describes what solution-focused interviewing is. This chapter is followed by how to establish a collaborative relationship, as well as how to conduct the first therapeutic session, the subsequent sessions, and the concluding session. The author also discusses how to provide feedback to clients at the end of a session and how to give homework suggestions to clients. Giving homework can be helpful for therapists who want to extend the work of therapy outside the session. The intent of giving homework is to help the client find solutions to his or her problems and help with goal achievement. However, if the client does not want to do the homework, that in itself, is valuable information for the therapist. One of the author’s suggestions may be to tell the client at the end of the session, “Pay attention to what happens in your life that gives you the feeling that this problem can be solved” (Bannink, 2006). There are various examples in each chapter that bring to life the topic discussed. Other topics discussed include other solution-focused skills, how to work with other professionals, 1001 solution-focused questions, how to reflect on the session, solution-focused interviewing from start to finish, and solution-focused brief therapy as a form of cognitive behavioral therapy. At the end of the book, the author provides a compilation of appendixes that provide protocols for specific issues in therapy. Among them, the reader can find how to handle the first session, how to set a goal, how to find exceptions to the problem, how to formulate feedback, and how to externalize the problem.</p>
<p>At times, therapists label clients as noncompliant when they do not progress in therapy the way we think they should. It is not uncommon for therapists to blame the client when the treatment plan is not followed. This attitude comes from a medical model that sees the professional as the expert and the person who knows what is best in terms of treatment. This book brings a new perspective for therapists to consider, the idea that clients are doing the best they can to change, even at times when they are labeled “resistant.” If we listen to all that clients are telling us (with words and actions) and convey the idea that they are the experts of their own life and how it may unfold, there is more likelihood to align with the client rather than become adversarial. Thus, the author dispels the idea of resistance in therapy and presents a new perspective of how to conduct therapy.</p>
<p>This book will be a wonderful and useful resource for new therapists who want to understand how solution-focused therapy works and for seasoned clinicians who want to brush up their skills while using a solution-focused model. Students would highly benefit from this book since it is a how-to-use solution-focused therapy and is clearly illustrated with case examples. Furthermore, the protocols and questions provided will be extremely helpful for those who are trying to learn how to implement a solution-focused approach with individuals, groups, and couples.</p>
