<body>
<p>There are two key points being made in this book. First, it has been too easy to dismiss ascetic writings as expressing a dualistic approach to human nature, but Hunt argues for a more nuanced understanding which shows that the body co-operates with the soul and is indeed essential in achieving the desired salvation/<italic>theosis.</italic> Secondly, that debates over Christology and the nature of Christ’s human body in relation to his divinity inform much ascetic teaching. Theologically, it was unacceptable to doubt the full humanity of Christ and this had implications for the human body in the scheme of salvation.</p>
<p>The structure of the book suggests a comprehensive and logical treatment of the topic, beginning with Greek philosophy and concluding with the ‘triumph of orthodoxy,’ but the author is so much more at home with the Syrian material that the introductory and concluding sections appear to have been afterthoughts. Chapters two to four would appear to be introductory and deal with a range of preliminary background material from philosophy, scripture, and the Desert Fathers. Much attention is paid in chapter two to surveying relevant ideas from Greek philosophy to show a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between body and soul than the ‘lazy’ attribution of ‘dualism’ by later, predominantly Christian, writers would suggest. Plato’s views show moderation and harmony, not a complete separation, but more influential on Christian ideas were Plotinus who equates the self with the soul, rather than body-soul together, and the Stoics whose importance is asserted but not discussed in any detail. However, later Christian tradition is based upon scripture and so chapter three presents mainly Paul’s anthropology in relation to Jewish ideas which lie behind his <italic>soma sarx</italic> distinction.</p>
<p>Continuing the survey of Christian origins, chapter four presents how martyrdom and its transformation into desert asceticism propose a rejection of the body, even to the extent that violence toward it is normalized. Contemporary with this is the doctrinal assertion of Christ’s humanity which requires that the body be taken seriously; this Hunt sees manifest in the cult of relics where the spiritual is conveyed through the material. The ascetic programme seeks to restore a humanity tarnished by sin and so the contested area of women’s bodies becomes important as a sign that this is possible—the menopause indicates that the female condition can be transcended. Women’s bodies are discussed again in chapter five in relation to transcending gender to become manly or even transcending humanity altogether to become angelic. The emerging Marian theology is discussed, as well as Macrina’s eradication of ‘Eve,’ although she becomes manly in her emotional and intellectual life while retaining her femininity as a bride of Christ. A more integrated approach is suggested by John Climacus, the focus of chapter six, who proposes that it is possible to see a ‘vision of God’s splendour in the body’ when, like Christ, the two natures are in harmony. The mind acts with the body in sin; where that is not the case, then the flesh does indeed kill the soul.</p>
<p>There is quite an abrupt transition to the chapters dealing with the Syrian material (seven to ten). Chapter seven offers such disconnected ideas relating to ‘The Syrian Perspectives on Asceticism’ and chapter 8 provides a list with brief bibliographical information of some key sources, but neither of these propose any concentrated discussion in relation to the theme of the book. The sustained focus on Macarius and Ephrem are, then, most welcome. The former’s concentration on prayer of the heart as a way of cleansing the body indicates that the body does have a role in salvation and Hunt connects the unity of the person here to Christological ideas. Ephrem’s dominant and multifaceted metaphor of ‘clothing’ again connects the outward to the inner, material to spiritual, and especially in working out the implications of the role of Mary in clothing Christ in the flesh. God is known through bodily experiences and thus in prayer outward gestures ‘speak for’ the soul.</p>
<p>In the concluding section, Hunt contrasts heterodox and orthodox theologies and anthropologies. The discursive opening to chapter 11 reflects on how a latent dualism applied to humanity becomes unacceptable when applied to Christ and outlines a number of heresies where this is evident. Attention turns then to a presentation of the major Gnostic schools, whose emphasis on cosmology prevents a serious consideration of the body, finally presenting Eunomius in brief and Apollinarius at great length. In chapter 11, it is stressed how close the ‘heresiarchs’ are to the orthodox, but chapter 12 reverts to traditional designations of orthodox and heretic. The Cappadocians’ formulations of the full humanity of Christ are connected to the status of the human body in the divine plan of salvation; Cyril of Alexandria links the integrity of humanity to the integrity of Christ. Somewhat confusingly, the chapter concludes with Clement of Alexandria, and Gnosticism, Eunomius, and Apollinarius again, leaving the reader perplexed at the direction of the argument. Only in the, extremely brief, conclusion does the author attempt to draw together the threads left dangling in the preceding chapters; here the paradox is restated but not resolved.</p>
<p>The principal aims of the book, to reassert the place of the body in asceticism and to do so in relation to Christological debates, are interesting and worthy of closer examination and Hunt achieves them to some extent in the central chapters on the Syrian material. But the remainder of the book is much too disjointed to assist in the task. Not only is there no narrative thread between chapters, even within them the sequence of short sections becomes rather fatiguing and chapter conclusions do not always bring together the various threads. The author does, however, provide fruitful material for further reflections.</p>
