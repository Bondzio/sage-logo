<p>A team of 28 experts provided content on topics associated with complex pediatric cases ranging from premature infants as young as 24 weeks through older adolescents. Each chapter starts with key points and key words that highlight chapter content.</p>
<p>There are 4 parts to this book. Parts 1 and 2 discuss disorders that occur with disturbances in serum water, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Then, authors present common and obscure disorders in pediatrics. Clinicians can use this book for guidance across the continuum of care, from neonatal care through older pediatric care and in settings that include hospital and emergency department care. Home care clinicians may also gain new or updated knowledge about pediatric conditions. Part 3 focuses on disorders of acid base homeostasis, with 5 chapters devoted to disorders that occur when normal acid base balance is disturbed, and includes both metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. Authors share their “ABCDE toolkit” to facilitate assessment and assist the reader in diagnosing metabolic acidosis. In the final section, Part 4, titled “Special Situations of Fluid and Electrolyte Disorders,” the focus is on renal function and its importance as a vital part of regulatory homeostasis in maintaining acid base balance and general health. In addition, Part 4 includes the liver, parenteral and enteral nutrition, and special situations in the neonatal intensive care unit. Thus, Part 4 is really a combination of electrolytes and the renal system, as well as another system (liver) and a collection of topics related to highly specialized care. It might have been more beneficial to have non–renal system topics in a separate section so that content could be easily found.</p>
<p>Each chapter is written by different authors and includes case scenarios. Presentations of case scenarios have different formats; for example, after reading a case scenario and the corresponding chapter content, the reader will create a diagnosis and plan of care. Alternately, authors set up the case scenario and then walk the reader through a step-by-step plan of care that may have included common complications or a misleading diagnosis.</p>
<p><italic>Fluid and Electrolytes in Pediatrics</italic> is a great resource since it includes useful tools, equations, tables, and charts to help guide the reader toward understanding laboratory results and pediatric assessments. Almost every page has a diagram with valuable information on the section topic. Each chapter includes references, but some of the evidence is noncontemporary.</p>
<p>This is a highly specialized book that concentrates on fluid and electrolytes for the pediatric population. The topic themes are complex and may appeal to readers who need to better understand and apply complex material. The book was written by physicians. Thus, perspectives on topics are not well balanced beyond physician-delivered care. In pediatrics, social workers, nurses, and other healthcare professionals could have brought added dimensions to book content.</p>
