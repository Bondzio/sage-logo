<p>Alasdair MacIntyre’s scepticism about the prospect of a universal morality is well known, and he has written often on moral disagreement. In the opening chapter of this volume, entitled ‘Intractable Moral Disagreements,’ he offers a systematic account of views found hitherto in various of his writings from the past 30 years or so. This and the final chapter, ‘From Answers to Questions: a Response to the Responses,’ frame contributions from philosophers, theologians, academic lawyers, and a political scientist, who critique and comment upon his argument.</p>
<p>Lawrence Cunningham, the editor, explains that the book is the University of Notre Dame’s response to a letter of 2004 from the then Prefect of the CDF, Josef Ratzinger, in which that and other Catholic universities were enjoined to study the problem of finding a common denominator for moral principles held by all people today. Soon afterwards, as Benedict XVI, Ratzinger was to challenge secular thinkers on the possibility of articulating fundamental moral principles <italic>etsi Deus non daretur</italic>. Cunningham formulates the question put to the universities: ‘Can a persuasive case be made for a foundational morality <italic>etsi Deus non daretur</italic>? … It is that challenge which is taken up in this book’ (p. x).</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s starting-point is an affirmation by the <italic>Catechism of the Catholic Church</italic> that there is a natural moral law, established by reason, universal in its precepts, binding on everyone, and providing a basis for the fundamental rights and duties of each person. How can this be, he asks, if many intelligent and insightful people reject what Catholics take to be particular natural law precepts, or even the very idea of a natural moral law? ‘It seems that either the Catechism’s account of the natural law must be mistaken or else it is possible for some theses to be rationally vindicated without thereby being able to secure the assent of all rational agents’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>Observing that the philosophical question here is one that faces any philosopher who holds that moral principles must be rationally justifiable if they are to have authority, MacIntyre’s approach is to compare the view of St Thomas—a classic account that claims both the universality of natural law and its accessibility to reason—and utilitarian views, representative not only of a rival philosophical position but presupposed also in much everyday discourse. He contends that these views are incompatible though not incommensurable, and he argues that thomistic ethics and politics can be shown to be ‘rationally superior’ to the ethics and politics of utilitarians. His aim is to show that ‘it is possible to establish that one moral standpoint may be rationally superior to others without securing the assent of highly intelligent, perceptive, and thoughtful adherents of those other points of view’ (p. 4). He concludes by asking how Catholics and other proponents of a natural law ethic might find common ground with people with whom they disagree ‘irremediably.’</p>
<p>Most of the other contributors are essentially sympathetic toward MacIntyre’s case, and their comments open up aspects of the problem that are not dealt with, or not explicitly so, in his account. David Clairmont writes about the place of moral disagreement in interreligious dialogue; Cathleen Kaveny examines the impact of prophetic rhetoric with reference especially to pro-life and pro-choice advocacy in the United States; and in ‘After Intractable Moral Disagreement,’ Daniel Philpott sketches an ethic of political reconciliation for which he finds Catholic roots. Gerald McKenny reflects on the respective positions of MacIntyre and Josef Ratzinger on the limits of reason and their bearing on moral disagreement; Kevin Flannery SJ looks to Aquinas’s philosophical mentor in ‘Ultimate Ends and Incommensurable Lives in Aristotle’; John J. Coughlin OFM writes about the foundation of human rights and canon law; and Thomas Hibbs examines Aquinas’s thought on conflict, self-knowledge, and the virtues of practical reasoning.</p>
<p>It would no doubt be wrong to say that Jean Porter is unsympathetic to MacIntyre’s position but, as he himself acknowledges both explicitly and in the detail with which he replies, hers is the contribution that most radically challenges his thesis. Her essay is entitled ‘Does the Natural Law Provide a Universally Valid Morality?’ and her answer is that it doesn’t. As she puts it: ‘… I am not persuaded that the natural law as Aquinas understands it is tantamount to, or can be made to yield, normative precepts that are both specific enough to be put into practice and valid and binding in all times and places. At the very least, textual evidence on this point is inconclusive’ (p. 55).</p>
<p>Porter’s reading of the textual evidence is critical for her case, for it involves an unfamiliar interpretation of the familiar q. 91 of the <italic>Prima Secundae</italic>, especially of article 2, which asks whether the natural law contains many laws or only one. This article is usually taken to advance Aquinas’s view of the content of the natural law, but Porter, influenced by work of Daniel Nelson and Pamela Hall, argues that Aquinas is not here concerned with the question of content at all. Rather, she maintains, his interest is one shared by some predecessors and contemporaries, namely, to reconcile a number of competing definitions of natural law found in sources as disparate as Cicero, Ulpian, the canons of the <italic>Decretum Gratianum</italic>, and the writings of medieval theologians. What Aquinas is looking for is a formulation that maintains a rational unity and coherence in natural law, but the rational unity that he defends does not imply that its precepts can be derived systematically from some first principle. Her conclusion at this point is that the status of concrete precepts as specifications of first principles, and their unity and coherence, must be defended in terms of ‘a contentious metaphysical theory, developed within an overarching theological context’ (p. 73). An implication of Porter’s view which she develops is that there is room in Aquinas’s conception for a certain moral pluralism.</p>
<p>Each author’s contribution is valuable, as Alasdair MacIntyre is at pains to say; all are insightful, and each provides food for thought, even if the interest and appeal of each will vary from reader to reader. To this reviewer the most persuasive has been Porter’s (the foregoing account is of course nothing like an adequate summary). As mentioned, MacIntyre takes more time with this piece than he does with any of the others, acknowledging the value of various points which Porter makes, anticipating possible counter-objections she might tender, and graciously conceding that she may of course have more to say to his reponses. One is struck somewhat by the fact that he does not engage her reading of the textual evidence, considering especially its importance in her exposition.</p>
<p>A second essay that in a different way resonated with this reviewer is that of Cathleen Kaveny. This is an appreciative and informative account of the prophetic mode of moral discourse, a mode whose inspiration is biblical, and one that has been employed to great effect by such distinguished leaders as Martin Luther King. Kaveny is right, though, to question whether it is a mode appropriate to advocacy on one side or the other in a matter as complex as the law concerning abortion. She is thinking of current law in the United States, and of the stalemate between pro-choice and pro-life positions as regards its reform, but her observations are relevant beyond the US and might indeed be usefully noted by everyone with a concern for an effective church presence in the public square.</p>
<p>Alasdair McIntyre’s own contributions, needless to say, are also valuable, and not least for the grace and modesty with which he presents his case and responds to his critics. Characteristic themes are explicit and implicit—the inescapably social nature of the human person, the need to look to common good, the importance of social practices, and of tradition, the significance of the family, and so on—but his thesis here and the manner of his argument ensure that the essays do not simply reproduce familiar MacIntyre fare.</p>
