<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Although the overall average 10-year cardiovascular risk for patients with manifest atherosclerosis is considered to be more than 20%, actual risk for individual patients ranges from much lower to much higher. We investigated whether information on metabolic syndrome (MetS) or its individual components improves cardiovascular risk stratification in these patients.</p>
<p><bold>Design and methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective cohort study in 3679 patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis from the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study. Primary outcome was defined as any cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction). Three pre-specified prediction models were derived, all including information on established MetS components. The association between outcome and predictors was quantified using a Cox proportional hazard analysis. Model performance was assessed using global goodness-of-fit fit (χ<sup>2</sup>), discrimination (C-index) and ability to improve risk stratification.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 417 cardiovascular events occurred among 3679 patients with 15,102 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 3.7 years, range 1.6–6.4 years). Compared to a model with age and gender only, all MetS-based models performed slightly better in terms of global model fit (χ<sup>2</sup>) but not C-index. The Net Reclassification Index associated with the addition of MetS (yes/no), the dichotomous MetS-components or the continuous MetS-components on top of age and gender was 2.1% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.29), 2.3% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31) and 7.5% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prediction models incorporating age, gender and MetS can discriminate between patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis at the highest vascular risk and those at lower risk. The addition of MetS components to a model with age and gender correctly reclassifies only a small proportion of patients into higher- and lower-risk categories. The clinical utility of a prediction model with MetS is therefore limited.</p>

<p>Patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis, defined as patients who are/have been clinically symptomatic for artherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, are at increased risk for major and catastrophic cardiovascular events such as cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. According to American and European guidelines, such patients are considered to be burdened by an absolute risk of developing a new vascular event in the following 10 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711426636">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426636">2</xref></sup> of 20% or more.</p>
<p>On a population level, this ‘high risk’ characterization suffices to guide patient management and inform population-wide health initiatives but the actual risk of individual patients ranges from lower to much higher than this pooled average risk. Clinical practice would benefit from accurate individual estimates of cardiovascular risk in this important patient group. Such absolute risk estimations could serve to guide and motivate both physicians and patients in their clinical risk-management decisions. For example, it could be considered to achieve lower treatment goals for LDL-cholesterol in patients at very high risk.</p>
<p>Currently, no prediction rules exist to estimate cardiovascular risk in patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis. The prevalence of MetS in patients with manifest vascular diseases is around 45%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711426636">3</xref></sup> its diagnosis is based on five easily measured clinical variables,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711426636">4</xref></sup> and patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis who also suffer from MetS have a 50% higher risk of developing a new cardiovascular event compared to those without MetS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711426636">5</xref></sup> Moreover, patients with MetS and coronary artery disease benefit the most from intensive lipid-lowering therapy compared to patients without MetS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711426636">6</xref></sup> Despite criticism regarding its clinical relevance, the concept of MetS has helped to improve our understanding of obesity-induced insulin resistance and its associated metabolic and vascular consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711426636">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711426636">8</xref></sup> and may be useful in predicting the risk of a recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with manifest arthrosclerosis.</p>
<p>The advantage of a prediction tool based on a pathophysiologic concept may be that it aids in directing risk-reduction treatment. If patients at the highest cardiovascular risk can be identified by the presence of MetS then the appropriate treatment strategy could focus on targeting abdominal obesity and insulin resistance by changing inappropriate lifestyles. In addition, it may direct the choice of blood pressure-lowering therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711426636">9</xref></sup> and may influence the treatment goal for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, as patients with manifest atherosclerosis and MetS may benefit more from intensive lipid-lowering therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711426636">6</xref></sup> and from lower treatment targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426636">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of MetS in patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis from the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study. We evaluated whether MetS improved risk stratification in these patients, compared with a prediction model based on age and gender only.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711426636"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Patients were recruited from the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study, an ongoing prospective cohort study in patients with either a recent diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors, carried out at the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU), The Netherlands. The SMART study was designed to establish the prevalence of concomitant arterial diseases and risk factors for cardiovascular events in a high-risk population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711426636">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the present study, we used data from 3679 patients enrolled in the SMART study between September 1996 and March 2007. The patients had a recent diagnosis of coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm and were free of diabetes. Patients gave their written informed consent and underwent a standardized vascular screening protocol, including a health questionnaire, laboratory assessment and anthropometric measurements, at enrolment. The study was approved by the relevant local Medical Ethics Committee at the UMCU. Follow-up was collected up to March 2007, during which time patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire on hospitalizations and outpatient clinic visits biannually.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was defined as any cardiovascular event, comprising cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. All reported events were independently evaluated by three members of the endpoint committee, which was composed of physicians from different departments. If a patient had multiple events, the first recorded event was used for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711426636"><title>Definitions</title>
<p>MetS was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711426636">4</xref></sup> NCEP defined MetS includes ≥3 of the following metabolic abnormalities: abdominal obesity (waist circumference &gt;102 cm in men and &gt;88 cm in women), elevated blood pressure (≥130 mmHg systolic and/or ≥85 mmHg diastolic and/or use of blood pressure-lowering agents), hypertriglyceridemia (≥1.70 mmol/l), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (&lt;1.04 mmol/l in men and &lt;1.29 mmol/l in women), high fasting glucose (≥6.1 mmol/l and/or use of glucose-lowering agents).</p>
<p>Patients with diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2) at baseline were not included in the present analyses. Diabetes was defined as either a referral diagnosis of diabetes, self-reported diabetes (use of glucose-lowering agents) or a known history of diabetes. Among the subjects with a fasting plasma glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/l at baseline, only those receiving treatment with glucose-lowering agents within 1 year after enrolment were considered as having diabetes at baseline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711426636"><title>Data analysis</title>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711426636"><title>Model development</title>
<p>All analyses were conducted with SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R statistical software version 2.8.1. We pre-specified four models for investigation. First, we derived a model incorporating age in years and gender (model A). Second, to assess the added predictive value of knowing MetS status, we built a model (model B) that included age, gender and presence of MetS (yes/no). Third, in order to investigate whether measuring the individual MetS components rather than MetS (yes/no) improved risk-prediction, we constructed a model (model C) containing age, gender and five dichotomized MetS-components – hyperglycemia (yes/no), hypertension (yes/no), low plasma HDL-c (yes/no), hypertriglyceridemia (yes/no) and abdominal adiposity (yes/no). Finally, we defined a model (model D) based on age, gender and the continuous MetS components – plasma glucose (mmol/l), blood pressure (mmHg), plasma HDL-cholesterol (mmol/l), plasma triglycerides (mmol/l) and waist circumference (cm).</p>
<p>The association between the presence or absence of a recurrent vascular event and the predictors in the models was quantified using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Our aim was not to develop a best-fitting prediction model. Instead, we pre-specified the prediction models we intended to investigate; all pre-specified predictors were retained in the prediction models and were not excluded based on a certain level of significance. The effect of outliers on the regression coefficients was reduced by truncating them to the 1st and the 99th percentiles.</p>
<p>If the association between the continuous predictors and the outcome was not linear, the predictor was transformed to improve the fit. Diastolic blood pressure was transformed into a two-segment piecewise linear separated at 80 mmHg. In our study population, age ranged from 19 to 81 years (interquartile range 52–68 years). Since the association between lower values of age (&lt;55 years) was constant, age values below 55 were set to 55 years. Likewise, there was a constant effect of plasma triglycerides above 2 mmol/l, so triglycerides values higher than 2 mmol/l were duly truncated to 2 mmol/l. Plasma glucose levels &lt;5.5 mmol were similarly truncated to 5.5 mmol/l, as there was no relation between low plasma glucose levels and the outcome.</p>
<p>We encountered missing values among the pre-specified predictors in our study sample of 3679 patients: 35 for plasma glucose, 31 for plasma triglycerides, 32 for HDL-cholesterol, five for blood pressure and 731 for waist circumference. To reduce bias and increase statistical efficiency, missing values in the data were imputed using single regression imputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711426636">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711426636"><title>Model performance</title>
<p>Firstly, the model performance was assessed by calculating global model fit (model χ<sup>2</sup>). Next, the discriminatory ability of the models (the extent to which the model can correctly discriminate between those with and without a recurrent cardiovascular event) was assessed using the C-index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711426636">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Next, we assessed whether adding information on MetS or its components improved risk stratification by comparing the four models. We divided the predicted risks of the four models into tertiles and plotted these three groups in Kaplan-Meier-curves and assessed them visually for each model. We then assessed the ability of MetS-based models to correctly reclassify patients into either a higher- or lower-risk category, compared to reference model A (age and gender only). To this end, reclassification tables were created in which patients were categorized in predicted 3-year risk groups of &lt;3%, 3 to &lt;6%, 6 to &lt;9% and ≥9% (intrapolated from10-year risk cut-offs of 10%, 20% and 30%). The proportion of patients that were correctly reclassified into either higher- or lower-risk categories by each of the MetS-based models (compared to model A) was then computed. Reclassification was considered to be correct if the 3-year risk category predicted by the MetS-based model under scrutiny was closer to the observed 3-year risk (based on Kaplan-Meier estimates) than the risk category predicted by model A. The observed and predicted proportions were also compared directly with tests of reclassification calibration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711426636">13</xref></sup> Finally, the overall improvement in reclassification was quantified as the Net Reclassification Index (NRI) – incorrectly reclassified patients subtracted from correctly reclassified patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711426636">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Calibration and reclassification analyses were computed with 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates and predicted risks (as opposed to 10-year) because a majority of individuals had at least 3 years of follow-up available (median follow-up 3.7 years) and because shorter-term risk prediction is arguably more clinically relevant in such high-risk patients.</p>

Only model D had a better discriminatory power (C-index), compared to the reference model A. Compared to model B, model C did not show improved model Chi-square and C-index, while the model Chi-square of model D increased by 22.8 at the expense of 6 additional degrees of freedom, which indicates only a slightly better model fit. Thus, based on these performance parameters, model D, incorporating age, gender and the continuous MetS components was considered the best-fitting model. When we developed the models using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition of metabolic syndrome, similar performance measures were assessed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711426636">Table 3</xref>).

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711426636">Table 3</xref>, model D performed only slightly better in terms of global model fit (taking the degrees of freedom into account) and discrimination than model B (age, gender and MetS (yes/no)). To capture this difference in clinically relevant terms, model D was directly compared to model B using reclassification tables. Model D reclassified 21.1% (775 of 3679) of patients with 96.1 % correct reclassification. Reclassification calibration for this model was superior compared to model B (calibration χ<sup>2</sup> 17.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04 versus calibration χ 20.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.014). The NRI associated with the use of the continuous MetS components instead of MetS (yes/no) was 4.7% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.12).</p>

<p>In this study in patients with manifest atherosclerosis, it was shown that prediction models including information on the presence of age, gender and MetS or its individual components are able to discriminate between patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis at the highest risk and those at lower risk for future vascular events. However, the proportion of patients that were reclassified into higher- or lower-risk categories by adding MetS or its individual components to age- and gender-based models was modest. The clinical use of incorporating a MetS-based prediction model in clinical decision making is thus likely to be limited at best.</p>
<p>Previously, several etiological studies have investigated the relationship between presence of MetS and the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711426636">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711426636">15</xref></sup> These have indicated that people with MetS have a 50% higher risk of developing a new cardiovascular event compared to those without.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711426636">5</xref></sup><italic/> However, in the present study, it was shown that the concept of MetS has limited additional prognostic value. Currently, there is no prediction model for cardiovascular risk stratification among patients with manifest atherosclerosis. In this study it was found that, compared to a reference model including age and gender only, a model including age, gender and the continuous MetS components not only showed better performance in terms of model Chi-square and C-index, but was also able to correctly reclassify a small but statistically significant proportion of patients into higher- and lower-risk categories.</p>
<p>Whether this modest improvement in reclassification breaches the threshold of clinical relevance is debatable. In any respect, the MetS model remains relevant to understanding and further exploring the pathophysiology of vascular diseases and seems to offer some degree of added prognostic value.</p>
<p>From an etiological point of view, the concept of MetS has improved our understanding of insulin resistance and its associated metabolic derangements, closely associated with abdominal obesity. Accordingly, we assume that cardiovascular risk in patients with manifest atherosclerosis is related to insulin resistance. Understanding how MetS pathophysiologically increases cardiovascular risk in patients with manifest atherosclerosis helps to explain how MetS may improve cardiovascular risk stratification in these patients. This is clinically relevant, because it brings into focus how addressing insulin resistance (through weight control or exercise therapy) may help prevent future cardiovascular events in high-risk patient populations such as the one currently under study. In addition, a better understanding of the role of insulin resistance can improve the efficacy of the (medical) treatment of these patients. For example, insulin resistance-related hypertension is mostly due to increased renal sodium reabsorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711426636">16</xref></sup> and in a recent study it was shown that a reduced dietary salt intake reduces blood pressure in individuals with the MetS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711426636">9</xref></sup> Thus, to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with manifest atherosclerosis and MetS, hypertension should be targeted by salt reduction.</p>
<p>According to current guidelines, all patients with manifest atherosclerosis are considered to have an absolute risk of a new vascular event in excess of 20% over 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426636">2</xref></sup> This is comparable to a 3-year risk of more than 6%. Strikingly, in the present study a large proportion of patients were found to have a 3-year predicted risk below 6% in all four models. The addition of the continuous MetS components on top of a prediction model including age and gender led to the correct reclassifiication of a small but statistically significant proportion of patients. Indeed, some patients with manifest atherosclerosis and MetS may be at very high risk (&gt;9% 3-year risk), although this risk seems to be largely determined by age and gender. In patients with cardiovascular diseases, it has been previously shown that those with MetS benefited the most from intensive lipid-lowering therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711426636">6</xref></sup> The NCEP-ATPIII guidelines already provide an optional further lowering of LDL-c below 1.8 mmol/l in very high-risk patients, including those with MetS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711426636">17</xref></sup> As was shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1741826711426636">Table 6</xref>, 144 (3.9%) of 3679 patients were reclassified ‘upward’ to the very high-risk category (≥9% 3-year risk) and 229 (6.2%) of 3679 patients were moved up to the high-risk category (6-9% 3-year risk), indicating that 10% of patients are reclassified to the highest risk categories by adding the continuous MetS components to a model with only age and gender. Thus, in patients with manifest atherosclerosis, a prediction model based on age, gender and the continuous MetS components may help guide clinical decisions regarding more aggressive treatment targets for LDL-cholesterol in the subset of patients at the highest risk.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, however, a simpler prediction model may be preferable. We found that including only the clinically convenient MetS (yes/no) criterion to the age and gender model did not lead to a significant improvement in reclassification of risk.</p>
<p>Some methodological issues deserve consideration in the evaluation of these findings. Due to the relatively short follow-up time (median follow-up 3.7 years) we could not directly calculate 10-year vascular risks, which would have made our data more comparable to current clinical guidelines. However, we feel that a 3-year time horizon is clinically relevant for these high-risk patients. Another limitation is the large proportion of missing values for waist circumference (731 of the 3679), which was largely due to the fact that waist circumference was not measured in the study population prior to 1999. Regression imputation was used to minimize the risk of bias arising from this deficiency. Finally, results are based on baseline measurements of the variables included in the models. It is not known whether the observed values had been at this level long before enrolment in the study or if they had just been reached, nor whether this level substantially changed during follow-up, for example as a result of starting treatment. This may have influenced the estimation of risk and thus the performance of the models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, prediction models that include knowledge of age, gender and MetS are able to discriminate patients with clinical manifest atherosclerosis at the highest risk from those at lower risk for future vascular events. The addition of continuous MetS-components to a prediction model containing only age and gender reclassifies a small but statistically significant proportion of patients into higher- and lower-risk categories. Information on MetS and its individual components thus has some prognostic value in patients with established cardiovascular disease, although the added clinical usefulness is limited.</p>
