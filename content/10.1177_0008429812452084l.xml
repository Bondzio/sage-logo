<p>For both scholars and activists concerned with issues at the junction of religion and ecology, conceiving of the natural world as a gift can seem very problematic, leading too often to the misuse and abuse of nature. Indeed, the Judeo-Christian tradition of viewing creation as a gift to humanity has been characterized as foundational for what has been called the Western war against nature. As such, Mark Manolopoulos’ book, <italic>If Creation is a Gift</italic>, is particularly intriguing because he invokes Jewish, Christian and European philosophical sources addressing the phenomenon of the gift, to fashion an ecologically supportive ethic, which he hopes can help transform humanity’s relationship with the natural world.</p>
<p>Specifically, Manolopoulos proposes an oscillational eco-ethos. Central to this ethos is his discussion of gifts and gifting. Drawing on the work of continental thinkers like Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Marion and even Friedrich Nietzsche, along with biblical and theological resources, Manolopoulos critically expands upon the nature of the gift. Synthesizing this material with other aspects of Judeo-Christian thought and ecological ethical reflection, his basic premise is that the creation gift is a “both/and.” It is linear, for instance, coming from God with un-returnable gratuity; however, at the same time the creation gift is also circular, due to its location within webs of relationship. This paradox is representative of the aporetic or potentially un-navigable nature of the gift. Understanding the natural world as a creation gift, in multiple senses, compounds these entanglements because it immediately puts humans in a relationship with the divine and with our fellow creatures, while leaving us with the problem of the impossibility of reciprocating to a creator.</p>
<p>To solve this paradox, Manolopoulos suggests that an appropriate response to the heterogeneous creation gift will also be “both/and” in character, hence the oscillational nature of his proposed eco-ethos. This oscillation is multi-faceted, moving between responses, which are as diverse as letting-be, awe, celebration, silence, and gratitude. At the same time, it includes aspects of responses that may be surprising to theo-ecological ethicists, including utility, excess, and the secular forgetting of creation as a gift, which can help to overcome the paralyzing debt owed to a creator. In the process of its recounting in this volume, Manolopoulos’ eco-ethos challenges several formulations that have been central to “green” Christian responses to the ecological crisis, including the notion of humanity’s duty to be stewards of creation and the idea that God retains ownership of the natural world, both of which fail to fully integrate a heterogeneous understanding of creation as a gift.</p>
<p>As Monolopoulus unfolds this thesis, a few passages in his book are surprising because of their unreserved totality, most especially given the subtlety with which he approaches the issue of the gift. For instance, contrary to what Manolopoulos asserts, it is blatantly untrue that all ecological thinkers would accept the premise that defensive nuclear weaponry is necessary. Additionally, there are a couple of points where the transition from doctoral dissertation to published monograph has been less than smooth. On the most basic level, this transitional difficulty is evidenced by the present text referring to itself as a dissertation. Perhaps most crucially, given his stated purpose of helping to foster an ecologically supportive and relationally transformative ethos, Manolopoulos’ discussion of how to ensure that his proposed oscillation fosters the necessary sustainable results during our time of Earth crisis is rather underdeveloped.</p>
<p>These tensions noted, it must be conceded that <italic>If Creation is a Gift</italic> provides a new range of considerations for thinking about creation as a gift, which, in turn, ought to be taken into account by religious studies scholars and theologians seeking to fashion a more robust green ethos in a time of ecological crisis. Also, his discussion of the gift and obligation will be of interest to those studying related religious concepts like atonement, grace, penance, and sacrifice. Taken as a whole, Manolopoulos’ text stimulates reflective thought concerning many aspects of the relational implications of giving in both inter-human and ecological ethical terms. As such, its consideration of creation as a gift is well poised to foster creativity in a reader, making careful reflection on Manolopoulos’ insights, as presented in this book, a valuable activity.</p>
