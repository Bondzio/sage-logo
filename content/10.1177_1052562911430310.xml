<abstract>
<p>Evidence from extant literature indicates that faculty support is a critical driver for implementing the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), particularly for schools pursuing an advanced, cross-disciplinary level of sustainability integration. However, there is limited existing research offering insight into how to build faculty support for sustainability programs. Addressing this gap, the authors present an exploratory methodology using a survey and structural model to measure differential faculty support for sustainability. The methodology also increases awareness of the underlying drivers of and barriers to expanding the reach of sustainability across business faculty, ultimately allowing PRME institutions to address their distinct needs. The authors describe application of the methodology at a recent PRME signatory institution, including actions taken as a result of intriguing findings that identified difficulties in gaining broad faculty acceptance of PRME.</p>

<p>Sustainability may be defined as the practice of addressing current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1052562911430310">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>). Although this original definition has roots in environmental concerns, it can be extended to a triple-bottom-line focus to include social and economic dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562911430310">Elkington, 1999</xref>). Industry attention to sustainability is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs &amp; Cocklin, 2008</xref>), particularly as practitioners pursue links to success factors such as corporate performance, competitive advantage, customer loyalty, corporate image, and employee retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911430310">Haugh &amp; Talwar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562911430310">Margolis, Elfenbein, &amp; Walsh, 2007</xref>). In turn, business educators are also responding with sustainability courses and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911430310">Christensen, Peirce, Hartman, Hoffman, &amp; Carrier, 2007</xref>). Still, this academic response has generally been slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562911430310">Rands &amp; Starik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). Some argue that sustainability does not retain a strong presence in business schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562911430310">Starik, Rands, Marcus, &amp; Clark, 2010</xref>), and AACSB International, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, has not yet integrated sustainability into its expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562911430310">Walck, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this lagging response, the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562911430310">United Nations, 2010b</xref>) serve as a catalyst for advancing sustainability in business schools, ultimately seeking to “embed” sustainability in business education. Many consider this “embedded” level of sustainability to be a just and moral obligation of academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911430310">Rasche &amp; Escudero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). In addition, sustainability represents a niche opportunity for business schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911430310">Page, 2008</xref>), allowing PRME participants to distinguish themselves from competing institutions that have yet to offer clear commitments to sustainability education.</p>
<p>PRME, like the UN Global Compact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562911430310">United Nations, 2010a</xref>) on which the principles are based, remains open to allow each school to uniquely apply sustainability based on their institutional mission and capabilities. However, this openness creates a challenge for implementation as PRME “does not address the internal mechanics of a change process in a university, such as the adoption of a policy and communication of this across the university, allocating resources, setting benchmarks, creating staff incentives, and reporting on performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562911430310">Bendell, 2007</xref>, p. 8). As another challenge, typical implementation approaches such as stand-alone courses, degree concentrations, and thought leadership centers rely on the efforts of a few faculty sustainability champions. This can leave sustainability a disconnected topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs &amp; Cocklin, 2008</xref>), failing to fully assimilate across business disciplines as promoted by some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911430310">Haugh &amp; Talwar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562911430310">Hind, Wilson, &amp; Lenssen, 2009</xref>) and implied by PRME.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the level and breadth of faculty support for sustainability will define how schools should best incorporate PRME principles. For example, which faculty will accept responsibility for developing student sustainability capabilities (PRME Principle 1) as well as pursuing sustainability research (PRME Principle 4) and outreach to the business community (PRME Principle 5)? To what extent will faculty pedagogically integrate sustainability themes into curricula and academic activities (e.g., courses, concentrations, frameworks, materials; PRME Principle 3)? And overall, how can an integrated sustainability focus within a business school be best supported? Self-awareness of faculty motivations and interests is critical in formulating an achievable PRME implementation plan. However, limited research exists to either assess faculty attitudes of the legitimacy and importance of sustainability or offer guidance on how to advance faculty interests.</p>
<p>The primary contribution of this article is thus an initial evidence-based methodology to address this gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562911430310">Forray &amp; Goodnight, 2010</xref>). Our process uses a survey and structural model to measure faculty support for sustainability as well as identify underlying drivers of and barriers to expanding the reach of PRME across faculty. We demonstrate application at our own institution, including subsequent actions taken to enhance faculty support. Our results were particularly intriguing and challenged the scope of our PRME implementation. However, the methodology provided strong insights for addressing these challenges. As secondary contributions, this article both creates greater awareness of the importance of faculty support for sustainability programs and highlights potential complexities of sustainability acceptance by faculty. These issues are possibly underestimated by PRME signatories, so our work will hopefully focus more attention and research in the area. As a final contribution, the premise and findings of the article may motivate readers to apply the methodology at their own institutions to help align their approach to PRME with the unique characteristics of their faculty.</p>
<p>In the next section, we organize existing literature that addresses different approaches for implementing sustainability in business curricula as well as the success factors for doing so. This discussion ultimately highlights the need for strong faculty support to achieve an embedded level of PRME principles. We then present the methodology for business schools to assess and build faculty sustainability awareness, demonstrating the application of this methodology and subsequent actions taken at our own institution. We close with ideas for future research.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911430310">Christensen et al. (2007)</xref> reveal a high level of sustainability integration within top business schools, they note significant variability in ways of doing so. One fundamental approach involves developing a stand-alone course or module, which is relatively common but still not ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911430310">Bates, Silverblatt, &amp; Kleban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562911430310">Rundle-Thiele &amp; Wymer, 2010</xref>). Faculty observe that establishing the effectiveness of such courses is often arduous, obliging advanced pedagogical methods such as cases, role-plays, experiential learning, and cross-disciplinary team teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911430310">Bates et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911430310">Kurland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911430310">Roome, 2005</xref>). Still, the stand-alone course approach requires a relatively low level of resources and faculty acceptance, but the intensity of integration across the school and curriculum is also minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562911430310">Rusinko, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs &amp; Cocklin, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs and Cocklin (2008</xref>, p. 207) counsel “One potential danger of teaching stand-alone sustainability units is the educational disconnect that may arise between the free-market focus of MBA curricula and the social and environmental externalities associated with the operations of free-markets as they are currently constructed.”</p>
<p>A more enhanced level of integration is occurring at a few schools that have developed sustainability concentrations or dual majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562911430310">Amran, Khalid, Razak, &amp; Haron, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911430310">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911430310">R. S. Marshall &amp; Harry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1052562911430310">Steketee, 2009</xref>). This approach requires significantly greater resources than a single course yet still may not achieve reach across the institution. In a similar vein, many top business schools have at least one research center focused on sustainability, ethics, and/or corporate responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911430310">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>), but again these centers can remain isolated from the broader curriculum and faculty.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562911430310">Rusinko (2010)</xref> highlights challenges with true cross-disciplinary integration of sustainability in a business program. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911430310">Page (2008)</xref> indicates that extensive sustainability integration tends to be rare, typically accomplished by small, nontraditional private institutions. They suggest that, at least for now, the best approach for larger, prominent business schools is a concentration or a major. This would no doubt support the advancement of PRME but arguably would not achieve the “embedded” level suggested by the principles. Based on the above concerns, schools must carefully examine institutional resources to derive a sustainability integration approach that meets their intentions for PRME participation.</p>

<title>Success Factors and Challenges</title>
<p>Sustainability integration in business academia requires a significant transformation and as such remains a fairly risky endeavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). Accordingly, numerous academics have chronicled success factors and challenges based on their own personal implementations. For example, institutional (university, college, and departmental) considerations include leadership support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911430310">Bates et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911430310">Pesonen, 2003</xref>), alignment with institutional goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562911430310">Walck, 2009</xref>), funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911430310">Kurland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911430310">Pesonen, 2003</xref>), political and bureaucratic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562911430310">Amran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>), curriculum flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911430310">Holt, 2003</xref>), and program ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911430310">Kurland et al., 2010</xref>) and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911430310">Holt, 2003</xref>). Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1052562911430310">Thompson and Green (2005)</xref> caution that sustainability is unlikely to gain priority with administration.</p>
<p>From a student learning perspective, researchers observe the need for development of entrepreneurial skills, communication proficiency, and comfort in working with technical resources, for example, engineers and scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562911430310">Bradfield, 2009</xref>). Moreover, sustainability career paths and specific job market skills may be unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). At a higher level, researchers also suggest that the modernity and complexity of sustainability require sophisticated student transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562911430310">S. Marshall et al. (2010)</xref> propose the need for questioning attitudes and acceptance of change, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911430310">Thomas (2005)</xref> indicates that sustainability challenges student views of the role and behavior of businesses. However, student perceptions of sustainability will vary with background and personalities, so faculty must approach sustainability in curricula from multiple thought bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs &amp; Cocklin, 2008</xref>). As another concern for educators, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562911430310">Kagawa (2007)</xref> notes that students tend to project sustainability applicability more so to future generations.</p>
<p>The above institutional and student complexities lead to a vast number of faculty challenges that make sustainability integration a demanding effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562911430310">Springett, 2005</xref>) requiring careful assessment of pedagogical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911430310">Kearins &amp; Springett, 2003</xref>): “Effective integration of sustainability into business curricula will depend, in part, on the ability of instructors to demonstrate multi-level interactions and illustrate themes, topics and company examples to continual [<italic>sic</italic>] reinforce this aspect of sustainable development and sustainability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911430310">R. S. Marshall &amp; Harry, 2005</xref>, p. 192). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562911430310">Starik et al. (2010)</xref> declare that educators must “increase their innovative, interdisciplinary, practice-oriented, and external communication efforts” (p. 382).</p>
<p>Limited available time, a lack of sustainability awareness, and limited textbook coverage pose additional faculty challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911430310">R. S. Marshall &amp; Harry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). Also, the newness of the topic can create faculty disagreement over pedagogical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911430310">Roome, 2005</xref>). Higher level concerns emerge from publishing and thought-development disincentives. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett and Kearins (2001)</xref> contend that management theory centers on refining established practices, so new paradigms such as sustainability do not easily fit. Accordingly, such new paradigms are generally not integrated into standard pedagogical material such as textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911430310">Stambaugh &amp; Trank, 2010</xref>). Additionally, top journals tend to not value the cross-disciplinary nature of sustainability scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562911430310">Bendell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911430310">Kurland et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the above challenges combined with limited reward prospects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562911430310">Beringer, Wright, &amp; Malone, 2008</xref>), professor passion for sustainability is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911430310">Bates et al., 2009</xref>). However, existing literature implies that this energy seems to rest with a relatively small number of faculty at most business schools. Although a combined top-down and bottom-up approach is recommended for sustainability integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911430310">Rasche &amp; Escudero, 2009</xref>), disinterest from the general faculty base will limit the reach of sustainability within the institution and, therefore, challenge the scope of PRME implementation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911430310">Benn and Dunphy (2009)</xref> report success in expanding faculty acceptance of sustainability, but their efforts required significant time (up to 2 years) and funding ($30,000). Importantly, they describe the effort of integrating PRME as a “political process” that must consider the “enthusiasms and motivations of individual faculty coordinating and/or teaching the subject area” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911430310">Benn &amp; Dunphy, 2009</xref>, p. 287). Thus, an antecedent to a PRME implementation strategy must include measurement of faculty awareness of and interest in sustainability as well as an understanding of how to better motivate faculty to accept its importance. Beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911430310">Benn and Dunphy (2009)</xref>, insight from existing literature on how to do so is informal and disconnected.</p>

<title>Faculty Support Methodology</title>
<p>To address this gap, we present below an initial methodology to evaluate faculty support for sustainability then later demonstrate application at our own institution. The methodology begins with a survey to measure faculty sustainability attitudes, interests, and efforts. A structural model then identifies relationships among these constructs to ultimately identify how to better expand faculty support for sustainability programs. The underlying research constructs include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1052562911430310" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What is the underlying level of <italic>faculty personal concerns</italic> (<italic>FC</italic>) for sustainability issues?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the perceived <italic>legitimacy</italic> among faculty of sustainability to <italic>business practice</italic> (<italic>LP</italic>)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the perceived <italic>applicability</italic> by faculty to their specific <italic>academic disciplines</italic> (<italic>DA</italic>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the extent of <italic>academic</italic> (teaching and research) <italic>interest</italic> (<italic>AI</italic>) in sustainability among faculty?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With limited extant research on these concepts, we hypothesized relationships among the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562911430310">Figure 1</xref>) based on interpretations from the literature as well as input from colleagues both from our own school and other institutions. We conjecture that faculty with greater personal concerns for sustainability (<italic>FC</italic>) will tend to perceive higher levels of legitimacy of sustainability to business practice (<italic>LP</italic>), applicability to their specific academic discipline (<italic>DA</italic>), and interest in pursuing sustainability teaching and research opportunities (<italic>AI</italic>):</p>
<list id="list2-1052562911430310" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypotheses</italic>: A stronger level of <italic>FC</italic> for sustainability will positively influencel:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H1</italic>: LP—Faculty perceptions of the legitimacy of sustainability to business practice</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H2</italic>: DA—Faculty perceptions of the applicability of sustainability to their specific discipline</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H3</italic>: AI—Faculty academic interest in pursuing sustainability teaching and research</p></list-item>
</list>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1052562911430310-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Furthermore, faculty, regardless of personal concerns, may still recognize sustainability as a legitimate business concern and in turn develop academic interest and/or perceptions of applicability to their discipline. We thus add direct paths from legitimacy (<italic>LP</italic>) to both discipline applicability (<italic>DA</italic>) and academic interest (<italic>AI</italic>):</p>
<list id="list3-1052562911430310" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p><italic>H5</italic>: AI—Faculty academic interest in pursuing sustainability teaching and research</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These hypotheses are tested via a structural model that ultimately helps identify specific drivers of and barriers to faculty support. Accordingly, the results assist an institution with building a realistic plan for integrating sustainability that meets the school’s unique needs.</p>

<title>Case Study Application</title>
<p>The authors’ business school is part of a large, public university in the southeast United States with business programs supporting approximately 5,000 students annually. Driven by both ethical and market differentiation motives, we recently became a PRME signatory. To understand the potential positioning and reach of sustainability within our school, we applied the above methodology. Without established scales, we developed survey items (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562911430310">appendix</xref>) to measure the research constructs. For our application, we considered environmental and social dimensions, opting to omit economic aspects given potential confusion among our faculty over its definition of societal economic benefits rather than traditional firm profits. As a note, institutions repeating this methodology should carefully consider the dimensions of sustainability, including specific topics, to best fit with their missions.</p>
<p>We pilot-tested the survey with several faculty members, including those not known to actively support sustainability, then applied the refined instrument across the entire faculty. We included a definition of sustainability and several examples to align respondent interpretations of the surveyed concepts. To minimize nonresponse bias, a critical concern given the sensitivity of sustainability topics, we administered the survey at a collegewide faculty meeting followed by a web-based survey for absentees. The final data set consisted of responses from 115 of 152 faculty, thus representing a reasonably complete view of the faculty. Analysis of respondents by department and status (full- vs. part-time) did not indicate any nonresponse bias.</p>
<p>Before testing the research model, we first analyzed individual survey items to build a composite view of faculty sustainability perceptions. We tested each survey question for statistical significance from a value of 4, the median for each scale. The results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562911430310">Table 1</xref>) reveal a sense of the importance of sustainability as a business concern yet a general lack of interest in sustainability teaching and research among our faculty. Specifically, all items for faculty sustainability concerns (FC_1-FC_3) and legitimacy to practice (LP_1-LP_6) retain significance, indicating faculty agreement with a prosustainability position and validity of sustainability as a business issue. An additional paired test between current sustainability challenges (LP_2) and increasing challenges (LP_3) reveals that faculty sense that pressures to address sustainability in practice will grow in the future (LP_3 greater than LP_2 at α &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Although our faculty indicate strong applicability of sustainability to their academic disciplines (DA_2), they ironically do not project applicability to their own courses (DA_1). A follow-up paired test verifies this difference (DA_2 greater than DA_1) with significance less than .001. Faculty also show disagreement with sustainability research by colleagues (DA_3). Examining academic interest, faculty by and large disagree to both currently including sustainability material in courses (AI_1) and pursuing sustainability research (AI_3). Furthermore, faculty do not show interest in increasing sustainability material in their own classes (AI_2).</p>
<p>For further analysis, we used ANOVA to test for variations across faculty demographics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562911430310">Table 1</xref>). The results reveal no significant differences across mean responses relative to either respondent stage of academic career (measured as years in academia) or status as full-time (FT) or part-time (PT) faculty. However, the ANOVA results by academic discipline do expose many differing opinions across departments. To frame these results, our business school currently has four departments: accounting and information systems (Acctg); economics, finance, and quantitative analysis (Econ/Fin); management and entrepreneurship (Mgt); and marketing and professional sales (Mktg). Although faculty sustainability concerns (FC_1-FC_3) were the same across all departments, faculty from accounting and economics/finance generally displayed lower levels of perceived importance to practice (LP_1-LP_5), discipline applicability (DA_1-DA_3), and academic interest (AI_1-AI_3) when compared with management and marketing.</p>

<p>We next used the two-step approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562911430310">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</xref> to test the research model and hypotheses in order to develop a more in-depth awareness of how to best structure our PRME initiatives.

Convergent validity was supported by factor loadings greater than .50 with all but one near or greater than .70. In further support of convergent validity, average variance extracteds for each construct were greater than .50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911430310">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>), and composite reliabilities exceeded .70 for all constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562911430310">Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988</xref>). Interconstruct covariances were all positive and significant, thus supporting nomological validity.</p>

<p>However, tests for discriminant validity, the idea that the underlying constructs are distinct, identified issues with some constructs. The average variance extracted for one set of constructs (discipline applicability and academic interest) failed to exceed the squared interconstruct correlation between the pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562911430310">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). In other words, the survey items for these two constructs (DA_1-DA_3 and AI_1-AI_3) appeared to be measuring the same underlying concept in our application. Failure to pass discriminant validity initially indicates a problem with survey question design, an expected concern in this case given new, self-developed scales. Revisiting individual survey items post hoc, we observed rational links between some items across the applicability and interest constructs. For instance, “including material in courses now” (AI_1) could be interpreted as a matter of applicability rather than interest. In retrospect, this item could be reworded to better serve the interest construct. Still, face validity suggests that these sets of survey items should still represent two different ideas. Moreover, faculty should realize that personal interest in a topic does not prompt pertinence to the course (and thus the necessity to teach it) nor need faculty be fully interested in a topic to understand the necessity for students to learn it. Yet a follow-up exploratory factor analysis validated a strong single factor and did not reveal other partitions not considered by the authors.</p>
<p>Hence, we posited a second explanation for the discriminant validity results as survey respondents not cognitively differentiating between the two constructs. In other words, our faculty may fail to psychologically distinguish between “applicability of” and “interest in” sustainability. Examining extreme views for instance, faculty who discount sustainability concepts may also immediately disregard academic interest or any discipline applicability. On the other extreme, sustainability advocates, who personally sense great urgency in the topic, may biasedly overemphasize discipline applicability. Faculty between these extremes may not have fully processed this relatively new concept of sustainability. So, they may have neither deeply reasoned how sustainability applies to their discipline nor extensively processed how sustainability aligns with their personal academic interests. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett and Kearins (2001)</xref> declare that sustainability “requires deep thought to realize understanding. It requires a fundamental shift” (p. 218). This level of focus may not have reached the broad collection of our faculty.</p>
<p>To further assess this interpretation, we conducted follow-up, qualitative interviews with 12 survey respondents who retained varying levels of interest in sustainability. Although “deep thought” is difficult to verify, feedback indicated that all but one had yet to methodically rationalize application of sustainability to their academic work. The single exception had recently become involved in a team-taught, cross-disciplinary freshmen-level seminar focused on sustainability. Through these follow-up interviews, we generally did not see evidence to contradict the above judgment of a shared applicability/interest construct and therefore collapsed the discipline applicability and academic interest variables into one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911430310">Farrell, 2010</xref>) with a revised model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1052562911430310">Figure 2</xref>). Convergent and discriminant validity tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1052562911430310">Table 3</xref>) were now all satisfied.

<p>With a valid measurement model, we then assessed the structural model as the second step of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562911430310">Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988)</xref> two-step approach, allowing evaluation of the research hypotheses. Fit indices, which match the measurement model, indicated a strong fit: χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.667, CFI = .947, TLI = .937, RMSEA = .076. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1052562911430310">Figure 2</xref> shows the path from faculty concerns to practice legitimacy (.77) to be significant at α &lt; .001, providing strong support for H1. The path from faculty concerns to the combined applicability/interest construct (.18), however, is not significant. Thus, we reject H2 and H3, discrediting a possible slant that only sustainability-oriented faculty will support sustainability. The path from practice legitimacy to applicability/interest (.48) is significant at α &lt; .01 (<italic>p</italic> = .003), indicating relatively strong support for H4 and H5. So sustainability legitimacy to practice is an important driver of applicability and interest. It is worthwhile to note that despite the lack of significance of H2 and H3, the results from H1 combined with H4 and H5 reveal that faculty sustainability concerns have an indirect impact on applicability and interest that is mediated by practice legitimacy.</p>

<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>We next interpret the above results and discuss our steps to expand faculty support for PRME. In general, the results show concurrent support for and resistance to integration of PRME across our business programs. On one hand, the survey responses portray a faculty environment conducive to supporting PRME. For instance, faculty generally indicate prosustainability attitudes (FC_1-FC_3) and perceive sustainability as a legitimate business issue (LP_1-LP_3). Furthermore, the paired test of LP_2 and LP_3 reveals that they expect the importance of sustainability to practice to increase in the future. Subsequently, they place value on sustainability knowledge and skills for students (LP_4-LP_6). Moreover faculty, by and large, deem sustainability important to courses within their individual departments (DA_1).</p>
<p>On the other hand, personal interest and responsibility for sustainability are generally lacking. The paired comparison of DA_1 (applicability to their own courses) with DA_2 (applicability to other departmental courses) reveals that faculty members perceive sustainability to more so belong elsewhere in their department. If faculty project responsibility for sustainability coverage to others, few will develop new material and instead wait for cues from colleagues. This is validated by the significance of a negative direction of AI_1, which indicates that faculty do not include sustainability material in their courses now. In the same vein, faculty do not show significant interest in sustainability teaching (AI_2) and research (AI_3) opportunities.</p>
<p>The ANOVA results by department offer insight into these views. Faculty in accounting, economics, and finance perceive lower levels of sustainability legitimacy to practice, discipline applicability, and academic interest. This may be partially explained by omission of economic sustainability topics in the survey. However, a preliminary literature review by discipline suggests a greater level of attention to all sustainability dimensions by management and marketing versus other disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562911430310">Starik et al., 2010</xref>), at least from a U.S. perspective. Yet PRME promotes that sustainability be “embedded” across all business disciplines, and practitioners likewise emphasize the need for cross-functional integration of sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911430310">Haugh &amp; Talwar, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Developing a Plan of Action to Further a PRME Agenda</title>
<p>So despite our eagerness to establish PRME throughout our business programs, the ANOVA results indicate that we do not retain broad faculty support to realistically do so in the near future. In response, our short-term plans have centered on building general faculty awareness by highlighting individual initiatives while finding opportunities to affect perceptions of applicability (H4), especially among accounting, economics, and finance faculty. To this end, specific faculty have focused on developing smaller, unique offerings, most prominently in social entrepreneurship. Other faculty, primarily from the management and marketing departments, have also integrated sustainability into their existing core and elective courses. In addition, one department has promoted experiential volunteering activities involving local social causes. By recognizing and rewarding these successes, we have enhanced PRME visibility to the overall faculty base.</p>
<p>The above efforts have been led by a combination of junior and senior faculty, contradicting a suggestion that junior faculty better fit with developing sustainability offerings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>). The prominent role of senior faculty has been important to align sustainability values across the ranks for not only pedagogical coordination but also hiring, promotion, and tenure. Additionally, it is important to have senior faculty assistance given potential difficulties in publishing related scholarship in prominent journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562911430310">Bendell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911430310">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>) as well as increased pedagogical complexities for incorporating sustainability into curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911430310">Roome, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562911430310">Springett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562911430310">Starik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911430310">Thomas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our long-term challenge remains to greatly expand sustainability interest among all departments and faculty. Although knowledge exchange resources such as PRME and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562911430310">The Aspen Institute (2011)</xref> offer strong support, including existing examples, for doing so, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911430310">Benn and Dunphy (2009)</xref> portray a long, resource-intensive path requiring customized value propositions for individual faculty. As such, we are undertaking multiple initiatives based on feedback from the structural model findings. For instance, H4 and H5 highlight the importance of faculty perceptions of the legitimacy of sustainability as a business issue to drive discipline awareness and academic interest. Existing research portrays legitimacy as an elaborate construct shaped both by personal views and external validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911430310">Thomas, 2005</xref>). Given this, we have offered basic faculty training in sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911430310">Haugh &amp; Talwar, 2010</xref>) related to business impacts and teaching techniques. However, drawing extensive faculty interest in such training has required financial incentives, and most attendees seemed to already retain higher levels of sustainability concerns. Longer term, we seek to expand the impact and reach of this training. The primary challenge is that the training program must broadly address different cognitive mindsets about sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs &amp; Cocklin, 2008</xref>) as well as customize material to specific business academic fields, namely accounting, economics, and finance in our case, to help those particular faculty appreciate sustainability applications. This significantly increases required personnel and financial resources, which have proven significant barriers to PRME integration in the near term.</p>
<p>Following the results from H4 and H5, an initial step to build external validation for sustainability has been to share the above results with key decision makers in the program. This has resulted in increased prominence of sustainability and ethics in Assurance of Learning goals as well as a recent core curriculum revision within the management department. Another external validation approach has been to publicize and emphasize the university’s dedication to sustainability, mainly being our membership in the American College &amp; University Presidents’ Climate Commitment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/">www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/</ext-link>). Additionally, there has been greater promotion of student-oriented sustainability programs, including a study abroad course focusing on social entrepreneurship in developing countries, active participation in Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) competitions, and a Peace Corps Volunteer Fellowship program.</p>
<p>More ambitious ideas, though currently budget-restricted, have included endorsing sustainability research through funding, paper series, and chaired and/or visiting professorships. We also seek to better promote validation from industry through direct linkages with the business community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562911430310">Starik et al., 2010</xref>) via a speaker series, executives in residence, and applied research and consulting projects. As a further attempt to generate collegewide integration, our dean has supported the college’s Teaching and Learning Center to develop a “Year of” initiative that would incent classes to focus on the same firm throughout the year, including support by guest lecturers and case material from the firm across multiple classes. The Teaching and Learning Center is supportive of integrating sustainability into the “Year of” initiative, which would raise the visibility and legitimacy of our PRME agenda.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Future Research</title>
<p>The UN PRME is motivated by concerns that “corporate responsibility and sustainability have entered but not yet become ‘embedded’ in the mainstream of business-related education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562911430310">United Nations, 2010b</xref>). The expectations of PRME are open to allow autonomy, creativity, and customization for participating institutions, so a lack of widespread faculty acceptance does not necessarily preclude a successful PRME implementation. Indeed, many schools identified as leaders in sustainability business education rely on courses, concentrations, and centers that do not assure sustainability reach across all students and faculty. Nevertheless, practitioners highlight the need for cross-functional assimilation of sustainability initiatives. Likewise, the “embedded” term implies that PRME schools should strive to expand sustainability throughout the faculty.</p>
<p>Current academic sustainability champions are already committed to this effort, yet their appeals to colleagues may be disregarded. Moreover, pedagogical complexities and publishing challenges may further limit broad faculty acceptance of sustainability. The role of faculty support in the implementation of sustainability initiatives has been underresearched and is therefore likely underestimated by UN PRME signatories. In this article, we have presented an evidence-based methodology by which schools can better understand the drivers of and barriers to enhancing such faculty support. This methodology allows schools to develop tactics to expand sustainability integration within academic programs while addressing their unique objectives and institutional environments. We demonstrated application at our own school. In all, expansion of sustainability reach at our institution has been slow given a large, diverse faculty base and the financial resource challenges of a public school. Still, our process has increased our self-awareness of our faculty’s perceptions of sustainability initiatives and has helped us better focus resources for our PRME implementation efforts. Overall, the results have driven relatively significant progress in our PRME agenda.</p>
<p>Examining the importance of this research from a macro perspective, the findings from our case study are intriguing enough to actuate greater scholarly awareness of the importance of faculty support for sustainability initiatives. Similarly, the results urge all schools at various stages of PRME implementation to conduct a faculty assessment using the process described. Specifically, attempting to implement PRME across unwilling faculty will likely lead to wasted resources, poor quality, and slow progress.</p>
<p>At an extreme, a lack of faculty acceptance may cause business schools to severely lag actual industry sustainability practices. An analogy may be made to the quality movement in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. industry response to high-quality competition from Japan was generally slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911430310">American Society for Quality, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562911430310">Dory &amp; Schier, 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911430310">Cole (1998</xref>, p. 69) relates, “Many institutional factors operated to delay recognition of quality as a competitive factor and worked against learning effective responses to this challenge.” Similarly, business schools were slow to incorporate quality management in curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562911430310">Kaplan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562911430310">Stern &amp; Tseng, 1993</xref>). Sustainability concerns do not yet seem near an acceptance threshold among business faculty, so the risk of lagging practice is realistic.</p>
<sec id="section9-1052562911430310">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Additional research is needed to improve the reach of PRME within business programs, including but not limited to better understanding the tools needed to overcome faculty resistance and disinterest. The existing literature largely consists of conceptual essays promoting greater application of sustainability in academia and case studies of efforts to create new courses and concentrations. Although this research continues to be valuable, we advocate more empirically based work that better exposes sustainability perceptions among broad faculty bases to identify underlying barriers that limit sustainability penetration in business academia.</p>
<p>Academics, like the general population, seem bounded by the psychological and organizational conflicts of sustainability. Accordingly, future sustainability research could capitalize on established theories linked to organizational dynamics such as systems theory, social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1052562911430310">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>), loose coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1052562911430310">Weick, 1976</xref>), and the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562911430310">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Given the unique dynamics of academia, empirical work could extend these approaches specifically for sustainability integration in higher business education. This would lead to stronger awareness of methods for effectively overcoming individual and group barriers.</p>
<p>As a related avenue, researchers might focus on one or several of the specific success factors identified in existing literature (e.g., awareness or cross-disciplinary coordination). For instance, sustainability awareness research has more so focused on students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911430310">Stubbs &amp; Cocklin, 2008</xref>) and administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1052562911430310">Thompson &amp; Green, 2005</xref>) rather than faculty. Similarly, the benefits and barriers of cross-disciplinary coordination (e.g., for courses) are thoroughly reviewed in business pedagogical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562911430310">Athavale, Davis, &amp; Myrin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562911430310">Ducoffe, Tromley, &amp; Tucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911430310">Hamilton, McFarland, &amp; Mirchandani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562911430310">Olson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562911430310">Pharr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1052562911430310">Watkins, 1996</xref>) though not so much applied to teaching sustainability. These literature streams could be adapted to understand mediating effects of different success factors on dependent variables such as discipline applicability and academic interest as well as outcomes not considered in this article.</p>
<p>As a closing research opportunity, we urge repetition of the methodology and scales proposed herein. Beyond helping schools better understand their own faculty support needs, further application will help refine the survey scales to enhance reliability and validity, substantiate the underlying research constructs, and identify potential new constructs. To yield greater insights, schools could include economic sustainability elements or separately examine environmental, social, and economic aspects. Additionally, combining data across schools could help identify key control variables in PRME integration, such as institution size, location, and public versus private orientation. Extensions of the methodology could collect input from practitioners and recruiters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562911430310">Forray &amp; Goodnight, 2010</xref>) or assess job market needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562911430310">Gupta, Saunders, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562911430310">Sodhi, Son, &amp; Tang, 2008</xref>). Without such further work, faculty acceptance of sustainability may remain limited, and PRME could linger as a disconnected movement in business education.</p>
