<title>Background:</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) onset during adolescence has the potential to disrupt a key period of psychosocial maturation. Objective: We aimed to examine the prevalence and risk factors associated with emotional and behavioral outcomes in adolescents with MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511433918">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2nd Edition (BASC-2) was completed by 31 adolescents with MS (mean age = 16.1 years), 31 age-matched controls, and parents of all participants. BASC-2 outcomes were compared between groups. Base rates were examined for scores falling at least one or two standard deviations below norm. Associations between BASC-2 outcomes and features of disease severity and IQ were examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458511433918">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Youth with MS were reported by their parents to have more symptoms of depression and somatization and lower adaptive skills compared with reports by parents of controls. On the self-report, patients endorsed more problems of inattention/hyperactivity and lower self-reliance relative to controls. Behavioral concerns and reduced adaptive functioning in the MS group were associated with fatigue, poor relations with parents, and perceived social stress. Psychosocial outcomes did not associate with number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, disease duration, brain lesion volume or IQ.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Youth with MS are at risk of difficulties in behavioral and emotional health. Relations with parents emerged as a key factor influencing the emotional well-being of youth with MS, suggesting an important role for family-centered care in this population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is characterized by acute relapses of neurological deficit and remissions, and by a progressive accumulation of neurological and cognitive disability over time. Approximately 5% of individuals with MS are diagnosed prior to age 18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433918">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433918">2</xref></sup> The onset of MS during the key formative years of development may contribute to unique and potentially more severe deficits in emotional and behavioral functioning in the pediatric age group.</p>
<p>Studies in pediatric-onset MS have shown that cognitive impairment and fatigue are particularly disabling symptoms of the disease that can negatively impact everyday and school activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511433918">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511433918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433918">7</xref></sup> Cognitive impairment not only has a dramatic impact on quality of life, it may also affect an individual’s resources for enacting adaptive strategies for problem-focused coping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511433918">8</xref></sup> In children, higher IQ is considered a protective factor for mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511433918">9</xref></sup> Given that up to 50% of youth with MS have cognitive dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511433918">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511433918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433918">7</xref></sup> emotional health and adaptability of a child must be evaluated concurrent with determination of cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Emotional disorders are also common in patients with pediatric-onset MS, with a formal diagnosis of a mood, anxiety, or adjustment disorder made in approximately 30–60% of individuals in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433918">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511433918">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511433918">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511433918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511433918">13</xref></sup> These earlier investigations of psychosocial functioning are based on structured interviews designed for diagnostic purposes and questionnaires focused on the assessment of depressive symptoms. While depression is a common disturbance in pediatric-onset MS, with a prevalence of 20–50% in youth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511433918">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511433918"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511433918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433918">7</xref></sup> other behavioral disturbances, such as aggression, hyperactivity and low adaptive functioning, are also important outcome variables in the context of adjusting to a chronic illness in adolescence. The complex relationships between behavioral disturbances, adaptive functioning, and clinical–demographic risk factors in youth with MS are currently not well understood.</p>
<p>Underlying mechanisms associated with emotional disturbances and maladjustment in adults with MS include both psychological factors related to having a chronic illness and the impact of the disease on brain networks essential for emotional and behavioral regulation. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated an association between depression and lesion volume,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511433918">14</xref></sup> brain atrophy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511433918">15</xref></sup> and abnormalities in left anterior-temporal normal-appearing white matter regions on diffusion tensor imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511433918">16</xref></sup> While the neuroimaging data account for some of the variance in predicting depression, an extensive psychosocial literature in adult MS highlights other important etiological factors, including feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, health locus of control, and patient-perceived dissatisfaction with social support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511433918">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511433918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511433918">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, we evaluate emotional, behavioral, and adaptive functioning in adolescents with MS, and explore demographic, adjustment-related, and clinical factors that may contribute to difficulties in these areas as reported by parents and youth. We hypothesized that MS onset in childhood can impact emotional well-being, behavior, and adaptive functioning in youth with MS. Moreover, based on the existing literature, variables associated with greater adversity or lower resiliency in youth with chronic illness, such as lower intellectual function, higher levels of perceived social stress and lower perceived parental support, were hypothesized to contribute to a greater likelihood of emotional and behavioral problems. Finally, we hypothesized that surrogates of clinical activity, including higher disability score and higher brain lesion volume, would correspond with more difficulties in emotional and behavioral function.</p>

<title>Study design and overview of procedures</title>
<p>All MS patients were recruited consecutively from the Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto to participate in a longitudinal study examining neurocognitive and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433918">7</xref></sup> Data for the current study were gathered at the baseline assessment that occurred on average 4.4 years (SD = 3.3) from first attack.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458511433918">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The MS cohort consisted of 31 patients (23 female, eight male) who were diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511433918">20</xref></sup> prior to age 18, with an average age at disease onset of 11.6 years. As the goal was to evaluate adolescents, all participants were over age 12 years (mean age of 16.1 years), and ranged from 12–19 years at time of assessment. Patients were not preselected for psychological evaluation on the basis of cognitive or behavioral complaints. None reported prior head trauma, drug or alcohol abuse. Two MS patients had a learning disability, and another five had a history of clinical depression and/or anxiety. One MS patient was taking anti-depressant medication (Sertaline) at the time of assessment. All patients were evaluated at least 4 weeks from most recent relapse or corticosteroid exposure, and all were fluent in English. Fourteen patients (43.8%) reported chronic fatigue versus none in the healthy control (HC) group; only two of these patients were receiving treatment (Modafinil) for fatigue. From an original sample of 36 patients with pediatric-onset MS who had met inclusion criteria and had completed cognitive testing, questionnaires from five parent–child pairs were excluded due to failure to complete the forms.</p>
<p>A comparison group of 31 HCs (25 female, six male) who were similar with respect to sex, age, and parental education level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511433918">Table 1</xref>) were recruited from the community. Advertisements for study participation were posted at community centers, on hospital and university websites, and a local Craig’s List website. Parents of HCs were first interviewed by phone by a study coordinator using a screening form developed for our study to determine eligibility. Controls were excluded if they reported any history of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses, learning disability, alcohol or drug abuse, or major medical illness. Mean age at evaluation for the HC group was 15.5 years (SD = 2.4), ranging from 12–18 years.</p>

<p>Participants were mailed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2<sup>nd</sup> Edition (BASC-2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433918">21</xref></sup> Adolescents and one of their parents were asked to complete the BASC-2 independently at home, and to return the questionnaire on the day of their scheduled cognitive assessment. If reading ability was identified as a problem during initial telephone screening, the BASC-2 was completed orally at time of assessment.</p>
<p>The <italic>BASC-2 Parent Rating</italic> form (Adolescent version for ages 12–21) is a 160-item questionnaire completed by a parent to reflect their view of their child’s emotional functioning, adaptive and problem behaviors in community and home settings. Reponses are rated on a four-point scale, ranging from ‘never’ to ‘almost always’. The BASC-2 Parent Rating form contains 14 clinical scales, seven content scales, and four composite scales (described in Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511433918">Table 1</xref>). Composite scales are helpful for drawing broad conclusions regarding different types of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors and personality- related constructs. Specific constructs include: <italic>Externalizing Problems</italic> (Hyperactivity, Aggression, and Conduct Problems); <italic>Internalizing Problems</italic> (Somatization, Depression, and Anxiety); <italic>Behavioral Symptoms Index</italic> (Attention Problems, Withdrawal, and Atypicality); and <italic>Adaptive Skills</italic> (Functional Communication, Activities of Daily Living, Leadership, Social Skills, Adaptability). Reliability indices obtained in validation studies conducted by the test developers are very high for the composite scores (<italic>r</italic> values all greater than 0.90) as well as the clinical scales (median <italic>r</italic> value of 0.85).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433918">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adolescents completed the <italic>BASC-2 Self-Report of Personality</italic> (Adolescent version, 12–21 years),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433918">21</xref></sup> which comprises 51 true/false items and 88 items requiring a rating on the same four-point scale as used on the Parent Rating form. The Self-Report form yields 18 clinical scales, four content scales, and five composite scales. The domains for each composite scale and the affiliated scales that comprise each composite score include the following: <italic>School Problems</italic> (Sensation Seeking, Attitude to Teachers, and Attitude to School); <italic>Internalizing Problems</italic> (Somatization, Sense of Inadequacy, Depression, Anxiety, Social Stress, Locus of Control, and Atypicality); <italic>Inattention/ Hyperactivity; Emotional Symptoms Index</italic> (Attention Problems and Hyperactivity); <italic>Personal Adjustment</italic> (Self-Reliance, Self-Esteem, Interpersonal Relations, and Relations with Parents) (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511433918">Table 2</xref> for scale definitions). Reliability indices are high on the BASC-2 Self-Report, ranging from 0.84–0.96, for the composite scales and having a median value of 0.82 for the clinical scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433918">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>BASC-2 forms completed by adolescents and parents were scored relative to age and sex-matched normative data provided in the BASC-2 manual. A high score implies more emotional and behavioral problems, except for the Adaptive Skills and Personal Adjustment scales for which a high score implies more attributes that contribute to healthy functioning. For each scale, the At-Risk and Clinically Significant range are represented by <italic>T</italic>-scores (i.e. standardized score with a mean of 50 and SD of 10) from 60–69, and 70 and above, respectively. Analogous cutoffs are established for the Adaptive and Personal Adjustment scales whereby <italic>T</italic>-scores from 31–40 are considered to be At-Risk, and scores 30 or less are considered to be Clinically Significant.</p>
<p>Validity of the respondents’ endorsements was established using Validity Indices on the BASC-2, including the F Index (identifies ‘faking bad’), Response Pattern Index (identifies patterns in answers that are a result of inattention to content), and Consistency Index (monitors consistency in responses to similar items). Scores on the Validity Indices were examined to ensure that they did not exceed recommended cut-off values, as reported in the manual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511433918">21</xref></sup> Finally, extreme scores on the BASC-2 scales (defined as &gt; ± 3 SDs from the normative mean) were reduced to a maximum <italic>T</italic>-score of 80 to diminish the impact of an outlier, after confirming the elevation with the parents in a follow-up interview. This adjustment was required on two Parent Rating forms in the MS group.</p>

<p>For all participants, age at evaluation, sex, current academic placement and performance, and parental education and marital status were obtained by parent interview.

<title>Clinical characteristics of the MS group</title>
<p>Data regarding age at first MS attack, disease duration (defined from first attack), total number of relapses, current and prior medication use, and other medical diagnoses were obtained from a clinic database that is updated at every clinic visit. All patients with MS were examined by a neurologist at time of study assessment to exclude concurrent relapse and to determine the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511433918">23</xref></sup> score as a measure of overall clinical disability. Patients were interviewed about the presence of fatigue. Fatigue was defined as a sustained feeling of physical tiredness and lack of energy persisting more than 2 months. For the purpose of this study, patient-reported fatigue was coded qualitatively as yes versus no. Finally, intellectual function was evaluated in all MS and control participants using the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) score from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511433918">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics were compared between groups using Chi-square for categorical data and <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous data. Departures from normality on the BASC-2 scales were examined using Levene’s statistic and normal probability plots. BASC-2 outcomes in youth with MS were examined in two ways. First, between-group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA, two-tailed), unless the variances were non-homogeneous for which the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> statistic was used instead. Second, base rates of elevated scores on the BASC-2 (i.e. <italic>T-</italic>score ≥ 60) were examined for each group. To ensure internal consistency reliability of the items included in each scale of the BASC-2, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were computed. To compute the Cronbach alpha coefficient, the positively worded item scores were reversed so that higher scores indicated more difficulty in each domain. A reliability coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient) of 0.70 or higher for each scale was considered acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511433918">27</xref></sup> Inter-item correlation coefficients were examined to determine degree of consistency between the Parent Rating and Self-Report forms using only the scales that are common to both forms.</p>
<p>Relationships between BASC-2 outcomes and individual and disease-specific variables were examined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, except for analyses involving non-normal variables, such as EDSS score, where Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> was used instead. The composite scores from the BASC-2 Parent-Report and Self-Report forms were used for correlational analyses instead of individual scales because of their high construct validity for describing dimensions of problem behaviors; the only exception was the Internalizing composite score. In order to reduce the confounding effects of vegetative symptoms on the Internalizing composite (due to the inclusion of the Somatization scale), we examined correlations with the individual Depression and Anxiety scales instead. The following covariates were analyzed: (a) <italic>individual variables</italic>: age at assessment, sex, level of perceived social stress and relations with parents (as reported on the BASC-2 Self-Report); and (b) <italic>clinical variables</italic>: self-reported fatigue, EDSS score, Full Scale IQ, and whole brain LV.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the risk of false negatives (i.e. type II error), we elected to use an alpha cut-off of 0.05 for the between-group analyses, and an alpha cut-off of 0.01 to determine significance for the more exploratory within-group correlational analyses, while being cognizant of the increased risk of a false positive finding (i.e. type I error). Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<p>Participant characteristics and clinical data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511433918">Table 1</xref>. The MS and HC groups were comparable with respect to sex, age at testing, parental marital status, and parental education level. As expected, Full Scale IQ was significantly lower in the MS group compared with HCs (mean = 112.2, SD = 8.3), Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> = 206.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Eight patients (25.8%) had an EDSS score of 0. Twenty-two patients (71.0%) had scores between 1 and 3, indicative of minimal disability, and only one patient (3.2%) had a score of 4, indicative of moderate physical disability.</p>
<p>Of the 31 BASC-2 Parent Rating forms that were completed by parents of patients with MS, 29 met criteria for validity; of these, 28 had a corresponding and valid BASC-2 Self-Report completed by the adolescent. One additional BASC-2 Self-Report completed by a patient with MS was included in the study that did not have a corresponding Parent Rating form. Thus, BASC-2 forms were valid and available for 29 parents of youth with MS, and 29 youth with MS. Of the 31 BASC-2 questionnaires that were completed by parents of HCs, 29 were valid. All 29 had a corresponding and valid adolescent BASC-2 Self-Report. One additional BASC-2 Self-Report was completed by a HC participant, such that we had 29 Parent-Reports and 30 Self-Reports completed by participants in the control group.</p>

<p>Considering base rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511433918">Table 2</xref>), nine of 31 (29.0%) patients with MS were reported by their parents as having elevated symptoms of depression placing in the At-Risk range or greater (i.e. <italic>T</italic>-scores ≥ 1 SD above mean), with five of these patients (16.1%) placing in the Clinically Significant range (i.e. <italic>T</italic>-scores ≥ 2 SD above mean). Parents in the MS group also reported behavioral problems in their child related to aggressiveness (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 22.6%), attention problems (<italic>n</italic> = 8, 25.8%), anxiety (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 22.6%), somatization (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 32.2%), and with regard to activities of daily living (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 22.6%). Only a small proportion of patients (less than three) were reported by their parents as having conduct problems, or difficulties with social or leadership skills.

<p>Base rates of self-reported problems are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458511433918">Table 3</xref>. Ten of 29 patients (34.5%) had elevated scores (defined as <italic>T</italic>-scores ≥ 60) on the Attention Problems and Hyperactivity scales. Elevated scores on the Anxiety scale were revealed in nine of 29 patients (31%), whereas seven of 29 patients (24.1%) showed elevated scores on the Depression and Somatization scales. Six of 29 (20.7%) patients rated themselves as having elevated scores on the Attitude to School, Attitude to Teachers, Sensation Seeking, Social Stress, Sense of Inadequacy, and Self-Reliance scales. All of the other scales had base rates that were less than 20% (five of 29).</p>
<p>To rule out the possibility that MS participants were describing ‘cognitive problems’ on the BASC-2 Self-Report form given their overall lower IQ relative to controls, we examined the correlation between the patients’ IQ and composite scale scores using only the scales that were elevated relative to controls. No significant correlations were revealed between IQ and these particular scales. Furthermore, although the IQ scores of the MS group were lower than the HC group, the actual IQ values were still within the range of normal intellectual functioning.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511433918">Table 2</xref>, internal consistency reliability estimates were generally satisfactory for each group on the BASC-2 questionnaires. On the Parent-Report form, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.66–0.96 in the MS group, and 0.31–0.91 in the HC group. Coefficients were all at or above the acceptable threshold (0.70) on all scales of the Parent-Report, except for the Activities of Daily Living scale in the MS group and the Hyperactivity scale in the HC group. On the Self-Report form, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.55–0.90 in the MS group, and 0.58–0.94 in the HC group. Coefficients fell below the acceptable threshold on four scales of the Self-Report in the MS group (Locus of Control, Attitude to Teachers, Attention Problems, and Self-Reliance) and on two scales in the HC group (Sensation Seeking and Hyperactivity).

<p>Two variables from the BASC-2 Self-Report, Relations with Parents and Social Stress, both of which were shown to have satisfactory internal consistency reliability, were also used to predict emotional and behavioral functioning. Youth with MS who had lower scores on the Relations with Parents scale (indicating poorer relations) were more likely to be rated by their parents as having more emotional and behavioral difficulties, as reflected by higher scores on the <italic>Externalizing Problems</italic> composite (<italic>r</italic> = −0.63), <italic>Behavior Symptoms</italic> index (<italic>r</italic> = −0.67), and the Depression (<italic>r</italic> = −0.72) and Anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = −0.65) scales. Finally, patients with a higher score on the Social Stress scale (indicating an increased perceived level of social stress) were more likely to be rated by their parents as having an elevated score on the Depression scale (<italic>r</italic> = 0.52).</p>
<p>Analyses of these same inter-relationships in the control group are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1352458511433918">Table 6</xref>. In contrast to the MS group, Relations with Parents and Social Stress scores were not robust correlates of parent-rated behavioral outcome, with one exception. Youth who reported a higher level of social stress were more likely to be rated by their parents as having symptoms of depression (<italic>r</italic> = 0.51).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adolescence is a period of intense peer-focused social behavior. As such, having a chronic disease and the management of MS-related symptoms serve to emphasize distinction of adolescent patients with MS from healthy peers, and may contribute to a heightened sense of social isolation. Our results show that parents of youth with MS reported more difficulties related to their child’s mood, adaptive functioning, and attention compared with parents of healthy controls, as well as the adolescent patients themselves. Almost 30% of MS patients were rated by their parents as experiencing moderate or severe symptoms of depression. This estimate of depressive symptomatology in adolescents with MS is consistent with a previous study where 12 of 39 (31%) patients with pediatric-onset MS received a formal diagnosis of an affective disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511433918">12</xref></sup> None of the parents of our HC group reported elevated depressive symptoms in their children; however, this finding must be interpreted with caution given our non-random sampling of controls. Also challenging the interpretation of the parental reports in the MS group is the potential confounder of externalization of parental sadness for the ‘loss’ of a healthy child, or parental perception of current or future implications of MS for their child. While parental externalization of emotion must be considered, the moderate concordance between parent- and self-report indicates that the adolescents themselves also endorsed depressive symptoms. Even if parental emotional health influenced our findings, this in itself is an important contribution to the overall health of the familial environment of the MS patient.</p>
<p>From the patient perspective, youth with MS endorsed more problems related to attention, and lower levels of self-reliance compared with same-aged peers. Self-reliance reflects the adolescents’ confidence in their ability to make decisions, solve problems, and/or be dependable. Importantly, mood-related symptoms reported by youth with MS did not differ from controls, even though clinically elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety were endorsed by 25% (seven of 29) and 31% (nine of 29) of patients, respectively. Qualitative studies have suggested that youth with MS may underreport feelings of anxiety or depressed mood, and rarely describe themselves as being different from their peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511433918">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511433918">28</xref></sup> These findings implicate the need for gathering data from cross-informants, such as teachers, to avoid potential confounds related to self-awareness issues or mood disturbances in patients or parents. Another important finding from the patient perspective was that self-esteem did not differ between groups, consistent with results of a large meta-analysis showing a tendency toward ‘normal’ self-concept or self-esteem in children with chronic physical disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511433918">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>One factor that may be of relevance to the emotional health of youth with MS is the ability of the adolescent and parent to openly engage in dialogue about MS. Specifically, the youth’s perception of the availability of parental support and satisfaction with it (as assessed by the Relations with Parents scale of the BASC-2 Self-Report) emerged as the top determinant of how parents rated their child’s behavior and emotional well-being. This finding is consistent with the well-supported link between an individual’s perception of social support and higher levels of depression and psychological maladjustment in adults with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511433918">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511433918">30</xref></sup> In youth, positive parent–child relationships have been shown to favor resilient outcomes among children who have experienced major life stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511433918">31</xref></sup> and to improve adherence with treatment regimens and psychological adjustment in chronic childhood illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511433918">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511433918">33</xref></sup> Thus, when evaluating depressive symptoms one must consider the inter-play between patient and parent, and family-focused therapeutic intervention is likely to form a key component of care.</p>
<p>We considered that MS-related symptoms and immunomodulatory treatment side effects may lead to the same vegetative symptoms that are reflected in the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder (i.e. sleep disturbances, weight loss, lack of energy). Similarly, symptoms of anxiety may reflect a bona fide reaction to living with the uncertainty of MS or to the requirement for frequent medication injections. The use of the BASC-2 as a measure of depression and anxiety, however, reduces the confounding diagnostic effects of vegetative symptoms by including very few physical symptoms as items comprising the Depression and Anxiety scales. The Depression scale, for example, contains items such as ‘says “nobody understands me”’, and ‘complains about being teased’, while the Anxiety scale contains items such as ‘tries too hard to please others’ and ‘worries about what teachers think’. These differences in how the mood-related scales are constructed on the BASC-2 contrast with conventional measures of depression and anxiety (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) that include measures of fatigue or psychomotor retardation, which in turn may lead to an over-estimation of depressive symptoms. Qualitative interviews are required to further explore patient and parent perceptions of MS as a disease, and tolerability of therapy to more fully appreciate the direct impact of MS and therapy on emotional health.</p>
<p>We also examined how emotional and behavioral functioning relate with clinical factors. Prior studies in adult MS indicate a moderate association between depressive symptoms and functional status, but not illness duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511433918">19</xref></sup> In the current study, functional status as assessed by the EDSS emerged as a determinant of parent-reported internalizing, but not externalizing problems in their child. While functional impairment may contribute to lower confidence in a child’s abilities and increased worry about loss of autonomy in the future, the large majority of our cohort had EDSS scores of 2 or less, which do not correlate with any functional impairment. Thus, although EDSS correlated with mood-related symptoms, physical disability itself was mild.</p>
<p>The results of this study should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, because of the cross-sectional design, we can not adequately assess whether parent- and self-reports vary over time. This is especially important given that fluctuations in MS-related symptoms may have a considerable impact on a person’s behavior, emotional health, and self-perception. We attempted to limit the influence of concurrent disease activity by requiring that participants be free of recent relapse at the time of inclusion and by evaluating correlations with total relapses. Secondly, our study is questionnaire based. While the BASC-2 measures broad domains of behavioral functioning, it lacks the additional depth that more structured in-person interviews might provide for diagnostic identification of internalizing and externalizing disorders. Respondents were instructed to complete the forms independently. However, given that the questionnaires were completed at home, it is possible that parents may have interfered with their child’s responding, or vice versa. Finally, while the inclusion of a healthy control population is an important asset to the evaluation of participant and parent reports, the healthy population can not address the combined impact of having a chronic illness with CNS involvement. Comparison of our findings in pediatric MS to studies of youth with other CNS chronic illness and to chronic illness that does not involve the CNS would assist in defining any unique contribution of MS on brain networks involved in emotional and behavioral regulation.</p>
<p>In summary, we provide a view into the impact of MS on the behavioral and emotional health in adolescents with MS, and show that youth with MS tend to have more internalizing and attention problems than externalizing problems. Among predictors of psychosocial well-being, an adolescent’s perceived level of parental support emerged as the strongest predictor of parent-rated child emotional and behavioral health. Strategies to enhance the development of self-reliance and self-empowerment of youth with MS may improve their psychological adjustment to the disease. Future research is needed to examine the emotional and psychosocial impact of MS onset during childhood not only on the child, but on the entire family.</p>
