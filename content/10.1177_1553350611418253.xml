<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Against a societal backdrop that sees advances in information technology as commonplace, the rapid expansion of Internet information now means that we have access to material that in the past would have needed a significant investment of time to both assemble and access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611418253">1</xref></sup> E-learning involves the use of Internet technology to enhance knowledge, offering students control over learning content and allowing them to tailor their learning sequence individually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611418253">2</xref></sup> The past 5 years has seen e-learning become a high-profile approach to educating medical students and facilitating continuing professional development of health care professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611418253">3</xref></sup> This has resulted in large investments in e-learning by universities for all student categories including medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611418253">3</xref></sup> Medical educators today face different challenges to their predecessors as changes in health care delivery and medical advances have increased the demands on academic faculties, leaving less time for the development of new teaching methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611418253">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>“Peer-to-peer” teaching and learning is a well-established education modality in health sciences with many studies reporting that peer teaching and learning increases development in learning outcomes with positive implications for clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418253">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611418253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611418253">6</xref></sup> Peer learning approaches have been promoted as fostering certain learning skills that are not as readily pursued by other means, such as the development of learning outcomes related to collaboration and teamwork, as well as students becoming members of a learning community. Furthermore, it improves critical enquiry and communication skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611418253">7</xref></sup> There is also a potential for economic benefit as a previous review of nurse education recommended peer teaching as cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611418253">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our project aim therefore was the development of a new teaching strategy for medical students while creating a national online repository system (Surgent University) capable of delivering this teaching strategy. We aimed to evaluate the potential of this e-learning modality to facilitate the learning of clinical surgery.</p>

<sec id="section2-1553350611418253" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An online repository and Internet-based interface was designed and hosted on the medical education Web site, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surgent.ie">www.surgent.ie</ext-link>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611418253">9</xref></sup> Participation was across 3 Irish universities: the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University College Galway, and University College Cork. Final-year medical students from these universities were given individual password-protected access and were invited to upload 10 new facts per day, which they had been taught by a member of the surgical team that they were on rotation with. Furthermore, using a “buddy system,” the students were then invited to peer-review facts previously uploaded to the online repository by other students, validating the facts in evidence-based medicine and providing literature references. None of the medical students were offered any incentive to participate. It was not a requirement for them to complete but rather an additional teaching tool designed to assist their exam preparation. The commercial company “Hitslink” was used to monitor student’s usage of the developing online repository over an 8-week period.</p>
<p>At the end of this study period, we used the Beaumont Hospital intake of students using the online repository as a focus group to direct our platform design and assess operational function as well as seeking feedback on academic merit. Along with simple “Yes/No” questions, a detailed Likert-type scale was also used, with students answering questions with answers ranging from <italic>extremely, very, moderately, minimally</italic>, to <italic>not at all</italic>. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 considered significant.</p>

<title>Usage of the Program</title>
<p>Over the 8-week period, the online repository received 6105 uploaded facts by 182 final-year medical students from the 3 different universities. Overall, the repository Web pages were accessed 54 061 times by the group of 182 students. There were 4609 individual searches of the repository during this time period. The first group of 60 participating students was invited to provide survey-based feedback. All 40 respondents participated, giving a 67% response rate. All students (100%, N = 40) reported having used the online repository. An assessment of timing of access by medical students to our online repository reveals that the majority of visits to our e-learning program occurred between 6 <sc>pm</sc> and 10 <sc>pm</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611418253">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Effectiveness of Program</title>
<p>Medical students from the Royal College of Ireland who were attached to Beaumont Hospital (N = 60) were invited to be part of a focus group to aid in the evaluation of the online resource. Of these, there were 40 respondents, giving a 66.7% response rate. Of those surveyed, 70% (n = 28) found the repository “extremely” or “very” beneficial. A total of 17.5% (n = 7) found it moderately beneficial, with only 12.5% (n = 5) finding it of minimal or no benefit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611418253">Table 1</xref>). Overall, 75% (n = 30) found the program to be “extremely” or “very” relevant, with 17.5% (n = 7) finding it moderately relevant and only 5% (n = 2) finding it minimally relevant and 2.5% (n = 1) finding it not relevant to their continuing medical education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611418253">Table 1</xref>). When questioned as to whether or not the online repository program should be continued beyond the study period, 87.5% (n = 35) felt that it should be continued, and 70% (n = 28) felt that it should be expanded beyond surgery to include other hospital specialties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611418253">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Ease of Use</title>
<p>Of those surveyed, 72.5% (n = 29) rated the online program “extremely” user-friendly. Of the remaining students, 20% (n = 8) found the interface “very” user-friendly, with 7.5% (n = 3) finding the interface moderately easy to use.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Online repositories, also known as digital libraries, are one strategy for managing access to e-learning materials. They facilitate shared access to high-quality peer-reviewed e-learning materials. However, they are only 4 peer-reviewed repositories at present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611418253">2</xref></sup>: the Association of American Medical Colleges Med EdPortal, the End of Life/Palliative Education Resource Center, the Health Education Assets Library, and the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching. Development of such repositories represents a significant investment of time, faculty, money, and space, which can prove challenging to medical educational organizations that support e-learning. In addition, they require a significant investment in time and money to ensure they remain relevant and updated.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the changes in students’ knowledge or attitudes allows those developing e-learning initiatives to gauge the effectiveness of their program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611418253">2</xref></sup> The advent of Web-based question-delivery systems for self-assessment have not only allowed students to further participate in self-directed learning but also have enabled e-learning developers to gauge the effectiveness of different e-learning modules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611418253">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418253">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such studies have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness of the e-learning approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611418253">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611418253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611418253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611418253"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611418253"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611418253">16</xref></sup> and a recent meta-analysis concluded that Internet formats were equivalent to non-Internet formats in terms of learner satisfaction as well as changes in knowledge, skills, and behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611418253">17</xref></sup> These studies have comprehensively assessed student usage of Internet resources through questionnaires and interviews. In this study, as part of our anonymous survey, students were also asked to report their usage of the online repository, with 100% answering that they used it. Retrospective methods of evaluation such as these are prone to recall bias. As such, our study included a quantitative assessment of medical student use of our online teaching program.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated an extremely high usage of Internet resources in current medical education. Of our 182 medical students, each student accessed the repository Web pages 297 times in the 8-week study period. Given the high levels of usage of the online repository occurring outside of the regular “9 <sc>am</sc> to 5 <sc>pm</sc>” hours, our study demonstrates the ease of access of Internet-based learning tools for medical students. This is particularly the case when the online repository is hosted on the “World Wide Web” rather than on a local intranet-based hospital or university server, as students can then access the information as mobile content at any time of the day or night.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative aspects of our online repository is the student-centered model that it is based on. In our 8-week study period, there were more than 6000 medical facts uploaded by the medical students. These facts are those that have been taught to the medical students during ward rounds and bedside teaching throughout clinical attachments. These facts are then available to be accessed by other medical students in our group. Furthermore, the facts are also then peer reviewed by the medical students themselves with reference to publications from peer-reviewed journals. This promotes collaboration and teamwork, critical enquiry, and communication skills as predicted by advocates of peer-to-peer learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611418253">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611418253">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, the advantage of uploading, accessing, and verifying facts on our online repository in this manner is that the repository is self-perpetuating, its growth fuelled by the medical students who are themselves using it. However, the final content uploaded is not validated by a teaching faculty member, which is a potential weakness in our clinical repository.</p>
<p>As well as demonstrating high levels of usage of our online repository, students surveyed also found it beneficial and relevant, with 75% of those surveyed rating the information available as “extremely” or “very” relevant. This is a further benefit of the student-centered model in that only facts that the medical students themselves found beneficial and relevant were uploaded. As such, it is inevitable that those same facts when accessed by other medical students in the same study cohort are likely to be found relevant.</p>
<p>A recent systematic review reported a number of factors that influence student usage of e-learning programs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611418253">14</xref></sup> claiming that students were more likely to engage in the program if it was easy to use technically. Our survey indicated that the majority (72.5%) of students found our online repository easy to use, and this is reflected in our quantitative data, which demonstrates high levels of repository access by our medical students over the study period. Apart from the quality and quantity of information available through an online learning program, the importance of a user-friendly interface is again demonstrated in the survey section of our study. Given the ever-increasing number of facts uploaded to the medical repository, there exists the risk of the data becoming difficult to access or being duplicated in the future. As such, to avoid the online repository from becoming unwieldy to use, we may potentially plan further improvements to the organizational structure of Surgent University, such as categorizing data entries to specific organ systems, with separate search tools for each system decreasing the number of potentially less relevant facts being returned for given search terms. The importance of easy navigation is evident in our survey results, as students who rated the online repository as easy to use were more likely to find it beneficial and relevant as well as believe that it should be continued as part of the medical curriculum.</p>

<sec id="section8-1553350611418253" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The “Surgent University” online repository of medical facts is beneficial and relevant to medical students’ education. In addition, the continued uploading, peer reviewing, and accessing of the online repository by medical students leads to exponential self-perpetuating growth of the repository as its overall usage increases.</p>
