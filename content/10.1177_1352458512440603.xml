<p>Both debaters raise convincing arguments in support of their case and reflect a dichotomy in modern practice. It is clear from talking to colleagues that, in North America and most of continental Europe, patients are treated with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) onset, whereas in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand a more conservative approach is taken.</p>
<p>Because the industry sponsored CIS trials have shown a statistically significant effect of first-line DMTs on conversion to McDonald’s multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically definite MS, is it incumbent on neurologists to actively treat all CIS presentations? There is one group of CIS patients (and it is a small group) who should be treated from onset. Patients who have a heavy T2 lesion load with gadolinium-enhanced lesions should be treated, initially with a first-line drug, and if it fails, as is most probable, then with natalizumab or fingolimod. All other patients should be treated expectantly with regular 6-monthly clinic visits and yearly MRI scans.</p>
<p>Why do I say that, given the evidence from the CIS trials? The ability to forecast active MS disease only applies to the presentation described above. In the CIS trials the patients recruited were not typical of the general CIS population that I see in the clinic, but overall had very active disease. In the REFLEX study the mean T2 lesion number at trial entry was 22 and ≥70% had more than nine T2 lesions;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440603">1</xref></sup> in the ETOMS study the median T2 lesion number was 26 (58% had enhancing lesions);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512440603">2</xref></sup> in the BENEFIT study at recruitment median T2 lesion number was 18 and 70% had more than nine T2 lesions;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512440603">3</xref></sup> in PreCISe the mean number of baseline T2 lesions was 30–33 in various arms and 84% had more than nine T2 lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512440603">4</xref></sup> Only the CHAMPS study recruited patients more representative of daily practice; the median T2 lesion number was four or five and only 29% had eight or more T2 lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512440603">5</xref></sup> Overall the patients recruited to these phase III CIS trials were not typical of the everyday CIS presentation seen in neurology clinics throughout the world. They were recruited to these trials precisely because they had evidence of high disease activity. They were entered by neurologists hoping to provide them with effective therapies, only available at that time to patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS); knowing they had a high likelihood of transferring to the open-label phase of the study, and had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>So why apply such therapies to CIS patients, for example presenting with an optic neuritis with only two asymptomatic T2 lesions on MRI brain? Because industry tells you to, has constructed trials to show that DMTs benefit CIS, and make you feel guilty, neglectful, by not prescribing their wondrous therapies? These patients will not suffer from masterful inactivity, a watch and wait policy. A significant proportion of these patients will not change over the years either clinically or by yearly MRI scanning. Real-life CIS patients are more represented by the unique 20-year cohort reported by David Miller and his colleagues from the Institute of Neurology, London.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512440603">6</xref></sup> Only 61% of those patients developed clinically definite MS (CDMS) by 20 years of follow-up. Of more relevance to the clinical neurologist, the most important predictor of patients who developed disability was the accrual of T2 lesions over the first 5 years of their illness. This risk can be managed by careful clinical follow-up and by yearly MRI; patients showing evidence of accumulating lesions by MRI can be started on appropriate therapy. This has the advantage of avoiding over-treating that group of patients who will not develop CDMS, saving much useless energy, reducing side-effects of inappropriate therapy and expense. Neurologists must act responsibly in the logical management of demyelinating disease presentations. Patients presenting with CIS are psychologically vulnerable. Because there is a therapy for a sub-group of patients with evidence of highly active disease at CIS presentation does not mean we must apply it to all of, or even the majority of, patients with CIS. Patients with CIS deserve management by masterful watchful consideration over the first few years following presentation.</p>
