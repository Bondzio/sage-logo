<abstract>
<p>This paper aims to investigate the possibility of safely and lawfully employing a sustainable reduce, reuse, recycle philosophy in the management of waste within healthcare settings. Climate change presents significant threats to our wellbeing on a global scale and provides a new challenge for healthcare organisations. As the United Kingdom’s biggest public sector employer, the National Health Service has enormous power to mitigate the impact of climate change by implementing sustainable practices. One area in which sustainable practices could be employed is within healthcare waste management. The investigation used a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with 20 participants responsible for the safe management of healthcare waste in an English county.</p>
<p>Interviews indicated that topics such as knowledge, the environment, finance and legislation influence attitudes and behaviour in healthcare waste management. Participants were clear that from financial and environmental perspectives an aim to reduce, reuse and recycle waste in health care was desirable. Attempts to implement sustainable healthcare waste management practices, informed by a sustainable waste management philosophy are desirable both financially and environmentally. Research is needed to explore behaviour, attitudes, learning, knowledge and the role of the environment in healthcare waste management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Climate change presents one of the most significant threats to our wellbeing on a global scale and provides a new challenge for healthcare organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412471411">King, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412471411">NHS Sustainable Development Unit, 2009</xref>). Strategies are needed to address the challenges and consequences of unsustainable consumption and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412471411">Harrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412471411">Lambert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412471411">Nichols et al, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412471411">2010</xref>). The United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) contribution to the problem of climate change is significant, with estimates suggesting that the NHS is responsible for 5% of the road transport emissions in the UK, and that in 2010 the NHS in England alone had a carbon footprint of 20 million tonnes of CO2e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177412471411">O’Dowd, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412471411">Mayor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412471411">NHS Sustainable Development Unit, 2012</xref>). With its large estate, purchasing power and its position as the UK’s biggest public sector contributor to climate change, the NHS has enormous power to mitigate the impact of climate change by implementing sustainable practices and encouraging its employees to do likewise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412471411">Coote, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412471411">NHS Sustainable Development Unit, 2009</xref>). One area in which sustainable practices could be employed is within healthcare waste management. However, attempts to implement sustainable waste management practices would have to be mindful of potential associated hazards such as infection and environmental risk, while also ensuring that waste management practices remain lawful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412471411">Department of Health, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Disposal of waste is costly to the NHS; in 2005 its disposal cost £73m but arguably, much of the waste generated in the NHS is potentially recyclable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412471411">Hutchins and White, 2009</xref>). However the literature indicates that more could be done in practice to reduce the volumes of waste generated, and that the safe re-use and recycling of waste would contribute to achieving this aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412471411">Hutchins and White, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177412471411">Scally, 2009</xref>). By safely and lawfully reducing volumes of waste, the costs associated with its disposal could be significantly reduced, thus releasing funds that could be diverted towards direct patient care.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates the need for an understanding of the mindset of individuals, including knowledge of their values, attitudes, norms and behaviours in order to enable a positive response to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412471411">McCartney et al, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412471411">Tudor et al (2007a)</xref> found that NHS employees who reported recycling behaviour at home were also more likely to report recycling at work, and that such reports were influenced by underlying attitudes and beliefs about the environment. However, these self-reports of behaviour did not necessarily translate into actual behaviour when measured through observation and waste-bin analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412471411">Tudor et al, 2007b</xref>). Suggestions for means of changing behaviour at an organisational level included training managers, with an emphasis on cost-savings, increased communication about recycling, and environmental issues through staff training and development (Tudor, 2007b). Investigations of the literature indicated that achieving positive and desirable behaviour change at both individual and organisational level might provide a feasible means of achieving constructive changes in healthcare waste management. However, to achieve this some greater understanding of the attitudes, beliefs and knowledge that underpin individual and organisational behaviour was required.</p>
<p>This project builds on previous research and explores the possibility of safely and lawfully employing a sustainable reduce, reuse, recycle philosophy in the management of waste within healthcare settings. The aim of the project was to explore participants’ attitudes, beliefs, behaviour and knowledge with regard to healthcare waste and their views on the viability of applying a reduce, reuse, recycle philosophy to its management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757177412471411" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The project took the form of an exploratory investigation, where stakeholders with responsibility for the safe management of healthcare waste were invited to take part in qualitative interviews in order to gain an understanding of their attitudes, behaviour, knowledge and practice regarding healthcare waste. A mixture of purposive and snowball sampling was used to recruit participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412471411">Marshall, 1996</xref>). Those participants interviewed were selected for their ability to reflect both a horizontal cross section of senior managers involved in healthcare waste and staff who handle healthcare waste on a daily basis. The research team made a joint decision about organisations to be included in the project. These included the Health Protection and Environment Agencies; not for profit, private sector and acute NHS healthcare providers; local public health workers; and those responsible for reducing carbon emissions within healthcare settings within a county in the south west of England. Those responsible for waste and/or environmental issues in the identified organisations were contacted by letter, provided with written information on the proposed research and invited to participate. Written consent was obtained from participants. Following interviews, participants were invited to suggest other individuals or organisations that they felt might offer information or opinions useful to the project. These additional individuals were then approached to participate following the procedure outlined above.</p>
<p>The participants ranged from a matron working in an acute setting to a porter and a manager of operations and quality. The intention was to provide both operational and strategic data on the management of waste, raise issues pertinent to how guidance, regulation and legislation is manifested in practice and identify if and how individual and organisational attitudes affected efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>There was no involvement of patients in this research, but as it involved NHS staff within healthcare environments, the approval and guidance of the local NHS Research Ethics Committee was obtained. The research was informed, designed and executed in full accordance with established principles for research involving human participants. Guiding principles for designing and carrying out research were adhered to, which included respect for all individuals involved in the research, valid consent, openness, honesty, right to withdraw, and confidentiality (Nursing and Midwifery Council’s Code of Professional Conduct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177412471411">2008</xref>). As participants were recruited from a small geographical area, and a small potential sample population, a confidentiality agreement was made with participants before the interview; this allowed participants to give full and frank responses to questions. The agreement also precludes the inclusion of any data that might identify, for example, participants’ job roles and titles. Clearly, the behaviour, knowledge and understanding of individuals with regard to healthcare waste management is likely to be influenced by their employment and the context in which they work. The inability to fully discuss this influence due to the established confidentiality agreement is recognised as a limitation of the project. The semi-structured interviews, using a topic guide took place in venues and at times negotiated with and convenient for the participants. The research team considered the aims and objectives of the project in developing and piloting questions that would address these. Questions used within the research were open ended and enabled participants to offer their own ideas. Interviews were typically of 30–45 minutes duration, were digitally recorded and were conducted by an experienced qualitative researcher. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were then manually thematically analysed. This analysis was used to develop codes and identify themes emerging from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412471411">Mays et al, 2005</xref>). Data extraction, coding and analysis was cross checked, discussed and agreed by two independent researchers.</p>
<p>Project rigour was established through the use of a decision trail following the principles of credibility, transferability and dependability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412471411">Guba and Lincoln, 1989</xref>). To achieve project rigour the transcribed digital recordings were checked for accuracy. Secondly, a selection of scripts were coded by an experienced researcher external to the project to check that codes and themes identified were consistent and congruent with those identified in the initial coding. Lastly a selected group of clinicians and managers involved in the project were invited to comment on the validity of the concepts generated by the project. These clinicians confirmed that the themes and notions produced by the project were valid.</p>
<p>Twenty interviews were completed and analysed. The results of this analysis and the emergent themes identified are discussed below.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section4-1757177412471411">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p>Participants clearly identified the importance of individuals and their employing organisations having a knowledge and understanding of sustainability and waste management issues.</p>
<p>This understanding of issues and dissemination of knowledge was often found to be the task of ‘champions’ as discussed by Participant 3 (P3):<disp-quote>
<p><italic>P3 – ‘You try and make the collection points as easy as possible and you try and promote sort of something on the lines of recycling champions or reuse champions, recycling and reuse champions’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidence was found of the effectiveness of these ‘champions’ as related by P4:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘There are a couple of buildings within ------- ------ who have got green reps in and because they’re quite small, they’ve actually managed to take quite good control of their waste and their energy. And they publish their performance and so people really engage with that because they’re getting feedback’</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177412471411">
<title>Feedback</title>
<p>This concept of feedback on waste management performance is also arguably pertinent to the statement made by P4 that:</p>
<p>‘One of the key things that actually if you, say a green rep might actually be a very junior person and it’s a voluntary system, but actually giving them the status, if you like, to be able to say to somebody who’s resisting, you know, what’s this about’?</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that some form of feedback, either positive or negative, and which may even be challenging to those who are resistant, may be effective in influencing behaviour. The ability to provide such feedback may be seen as being based upon knowledge that is recognised and legitimated within employing organisations and which is held among those who provide feedback on waste management performance; this certainly seems to be suggested by P5:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘It’s giving the staff the knowledge and the containers and the training to say, well, right, we won’t put our Coke cans in the incineration clinical waste stream, we’ll put it either in the black bag or if we’re really lucky, in a recycling can container’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757177412471411">
<title>Legitimacy</title>
<p>Mandating and legitimising by employing organisations may empower and enable champions to undertake projects at the grassroots level. This argument is supported by the opinion of P12:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Environmental champions, so such as people like the renal unit who sort of made contact, started very small pieces of work, but that’s really grown. I think what we’re seeing there is a lot of innovation in terms of why do the dialysis tubes have to be so long? Why can’t they be shorter? Why do we have to do this with the artificial kidneys? Why can’t we do that? Why do we need all this water? So I think they’ve sort of reduced the packaging on a lot of things, and they’ve made some new products’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It could be suggested then, based upon the evidence above that ‘champions’ may provide some effective means of achieving positive behaviour change. However, a note of caution regarding this suggestion is raised by P14 who felt that:<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>We’ve got a waste champion, and I still have to go and say, that label’s on the wrong bin. I’m not convinced this is about education. I’m not convinced if we educate staff [1] they’ll be interested and [2] they’ll change their practice</italic>’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757177412471411">
<title>Environment</title>
<p>Despite the broader environmental appreciation discussed above being seen to some extent as a driver to adopt more environmentally friendly behaviour, the main concern of participants seemed to be focused upon their immediate working environments and the problems posed by it, as discussed by P13:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘I have issues about recycling and recycling as much as I can which is not always possible because we don’t have the facilities to do it, as in bins, separate bins. And we don’t have the space to do that’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The availability of space within working environments in order to achieve greater recycling of waste was clearly a problem recognised by project participants:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Having less space than we need probably …. So we’re driving this space harder than we used to’. (P12)</italic></p>
<p><italic>‘Our space here is extremely limited, so some of the things that happen here are not ideal’. (P14)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, participants felt that a lack of space within their working environments compromised their ability to recycle and adopt positive behaviours with regard to waste management.</p>
<p>Evidence within the data suggests that for the participants, the ‘working environment’ meant more than simply the space in which they found themselves operating within. The working environment, particularly within clinical settings is likely to be impacted by a range of factors such as workload, staffing levels, lighting, ventilation etc. Environmental factors other than the availability of space were also identified as influential in waste management practices, as discussed by P14:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Staff actually don’t have the time, space or emotional energy to be able to do something massively different’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite these concerns, participants agreed that positive and sustainable changes in waste management could not only achieve environmental benefits but might also have economic impacts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1757177412471411">
<title>Economics</title>
<p>With regard to economic issues and sustainable waste management the views of the following participants were typical:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Fundamentally I mean it’s good for the finances, it’s good for the planet, it’s good from the energy point of view. And it’s good for people to take personal responsibility for what they’re doing’. (P4)</italic></p>
<p><italic>‘I suppose I come at it very much from a cost point of view. I’m aware of the benefits to the environment obviously, and the company has got an ethos of a green policy. So I am aware of the obvious benefits if we reduce our waste that that contributes in the carbon emissions’. (P10)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The evidence above indicates that participants perceived the desirability of sustainable waste management practices from both an environmental and financial point of view. A number of participants were clear that, to a degree, the issue of waste management could be addressed prior to the point at which waste is generated in practice, for example, in procurement of equipment, materials and in their packaging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1757177412471411">
<title>Procurement</title>
<p>The significance of the procurement of equipment and materials was stressed by P2 who was:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Trying to include the procurement of materials and so on to have the whole organisation looking at the sustainability angle’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The issue was again raised by P5 who was clear in about aims:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘In essence you’re trying to reduce what waste you produce in the first place’.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants recognised that some waste reduction might be achieved through changes made to the packaging of equipment and materials. Participants agreed there was:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘An awful lot of packaging for something that you don’t need all this packaging for. There’s over packaging’. (P13)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants recognised that changes to procurement and packaging were themselves likely to be limited by the requirements of guidance, regulation and legislation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1757177412471411">
<title>Regulation</title>
<p>It was recognised that legislation and regulation also provide a driver and incentive to achieve positive and sustainable changes in waste management, as found by P6:<disp-quote>
<p>‘There’s other legislation now which encourages recycling, sort of producer responsibility legislation about packaging waste and other things. So now we’ve got the legislation actually backing up what has always been good practice’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, others questioned how easy it is to comply with legislation and regulation in practice, for example P15 found that:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘We got the regulations that were broken down into hazardous, infective, non-infective, clinical. … It would say things like, bodily fluids from a non-infective patient, but how do you know somebody is non-infective, because as infection control practitioners we would always advise that all bodily fluids be treated as potentially infectious by nature. So it was very, very difficult I think to come up with some sort of general advice … I don’t think it’s very clear to people what constitutes infective or clinical waste’</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above provides some clear indication of the type of practical problems that might face those wishing to implement sustainable waste practices within clinical environments. It can be seen that there is potential for suboptimal waste management practice based upon individuals’ possible lack of knowledge and ability to recognise potentially infectious material and/or clinical waste. This in turn might well have an impact on the approach of those individuals to waste management and their performance of it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1757177412471411">
<title>Attitudes, beliefs and behaviour</title>
<p>Participants acknowledged the potential impact of attitudes and behaviour in respect of waste management. Participant 14 presented some interesting views on this topic:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘I do think people’s attitudes have to change as well and we have to change the way we look at – maybe we should try taking the bins away and see what people do when they don’t know where to put something, you know. If you didn’t have so many bins would people think more about what they were throwing away’?</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants argued that changing behaviour was a potential route to more sustainable waste management in health care, for example P18 claimed that:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Behavioural change is, you know, the key part of any initiative to make more efficient use of resources really’</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants were clear in advocating behaviour change through a process of questioning and challenging accepted practice while attempting to change and guide new practice. For example:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Because of the way you were brought up and done things that you’ve always done it that way and that’s why you do it. And it’s the business about the questioning of that, that’s part of the thrust of behaviour change isn’t it’? (P18)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>P5 also highlights the need to challenge behaviour but also suggests that when in difficulty individuals should have access to knowledgeable persons who are able to provide sound advice:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘It’s staff having the confidence to challenge their own behaviours when they get stuck, knowing who to ask’. (P5)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When discussing attitudes and behaviour it became clear that participants saw this as an issue for individuals. None of the participants made any explicit mention of the desirability or even the possibility that attitudes and behaviour could be changed at a strategic, organisational level or how this might be achieved.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section12-1757177412471411" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evidence gained from the interviews clearly showed that distinct topics such as knowledge, the environment, finance and legislation will all have an influence on attitudes and behaviour with regard to healthcare waste management. Participants were clear that from financial and environmental perspectives an aim to reduce, reuse and recycle waste in health care was desirable. This aim was itself to some extent seen to be both driven and constrained by factors such as finance, legislation and working environments.</p>
<p>The evidence gained from the interviews suggests that further investigation of learning and facilitating behaviour change within working practice and within the working environment may be beneficial. Participants indicated that ‘Green Champions’ or opinion leaders may be effective in generating and disseminating knowledge in practice, and that this knowledge can then be readily used, thus achieving some element of behaviour change. It appears that this knowledge generation and sharing was not necessarily based upon formal, classroom based training. Instead evidence indicates that this knowledge may have been effectively mediated by ‘Green Champions’ who were able to inform and demonstrate good practice while also challenging poor practice when it was encountered. This ability to inform, demonstrate and challenge practice was itself validated and legitimated by employing organisations. This form of learning could be seen as similar to the tacit learning described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412471411">Nonaka et al (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177412471411">Wenger (2000)</xref> in as much as it is held by individuals who use it to inform their actions, values and behaviour and is shared through socialisation and collective experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177412471411">Nichols and Badger, 2008</xref>). Informal learning opportunities such as those described above may present an opportunity to change waste management behaviour and attitudes through the sharing, application and challenging of knowledge and practice within the working environment. Consequently, this may provide an area for further investigation.</p>
<p>Any further investigation or attempts at developing informal learning within practice must take account of the potential impact made by the working environment. Evidence gained in this project supports that found in the literature arguing that space and the physical arrangement of the environment are significant factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412471411">Allermann Beck et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412471411">Gooding et al, 2011</xref>). However, it can also be argued that the ability of the working environment to provide a supportive site for informal learning to occur may be influenced by a multitude of variables such as heating, lighting, ventilation, workload and interpersonal issues. As such, the working environment and its ability to support learning and facilitate behaviour change may too provide an area for further investigation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper presents findings from a project employing qualitative interviews with key stakeholders involved in the management of healthcare waste. The results of this project clearly indicate that some attempt to implement sustainable healthcare waste management practices, informed by a sustainable waste management philosophy is desirable both financially and environmentally. The research has also indicated that further investigation should be carried out exploring the role of informal learning within practice in achieving positive behaviour change with regard to sustainable waste management practice. The research has also discussed the significance of the working environment and its ability to facilitate learning and behaviour change, arguing that this too provides an area for future research. Further research is needed to explore behaviour, attitudes, knowledge and the role of the environment in healthcare waste management.</p>
