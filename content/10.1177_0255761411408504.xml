<abstract>
<p>This paper explores how leadership and peer relation relate to the propensity of college music departments to develop transformational organizational culture. Our theory of relational leadership and peer relation has initially allowed us to formulate expectations for the affirmative impacts of professional and personal leadership and peer relation on the expansion of transformational culture. The samples are taken from the full-time college professors in Taiwanese music departments. The results demonstrate the significant importance of professional leadership and peer relation to the growth of transformational culture; however, the intimate personal relations fail to make contributions to the prediction. The larger implication is that professionalism in leadership and peer relationships is a major determinant of music department disposition in bolstering transformational organizational culture.</p>

<p>This paper examines the association of professional leadership and peer relations to transformational organizational culture in higher education music departments. It is also concerned with how the growth of transformational culture relates to the amiable personal interactions between a department head and faculty members as well as those among the fellow faculty members. The present analysis addresses these questions referring to Taiwan four-year colleges and universities where classical music plays a dominant part in shaping faculty hiring, curriculum, and development as well as other aspects of pedagogy.</p>
<p>In a transformational organization leaders center on followers and institutional analysis in a dynamic environment and try to help the followers carry out more than might be anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>). These leaders are characterized by inspirational motivation, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. In such an organization, leaders and subordinates together take on a respectful process directed toward shared goal attainment, elevating one another to greater levels of ethics and morale rooted in common aims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411408504">Lindholm, Sivberg, &amp; Uden, 2000</xref>). These properties differ from the transactional organizational culture that is typical of day-to-day operations in a fixed and traditional management system and weighs more heavily in favor of the success of leaders and institutions than of mutual goal achievement between leaders and followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411408504">Bass, 1997</xref>). Leadership is here bound up with a matter of contingent reinforcement for compliance or punishment for failure to abide by the rules and agreed-on tasks to be done by the followers.</p>
<p>The theory of transformational organization culture has spawned much research over the past three decades because of its far-reaching organizational consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>). Researchers, for instance, have applied this theory to various organizations in the areas of business, government, hospital administration, education, and the military. These studies showed that transformational cultures serve to establish a good working environment as well as to enhance institutional performance and member participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411408504">Li &amp; Hung, 2009</xref>). Those working in transformational cultures develop great job satisfaction, innovation, and self-efficacy, which in turn contributes to achieving the ultimate goals of the organization and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411408504">Rank, Nelson, Allen, &amp; Xu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411408504">Yang, 2009</xref>). Besides, transformational organizational culture is noticed to ensure improvements in leadership outcomes, strategic planning, institutional image, and the selection and transfer of personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411408504">Ruggieri, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The theory of transformational culture has also attracted a great deal of cross-cultural attention since transformational organizations reportedly exist in varied cultures, including many Asian countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411408504">Bass, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411408504">Li &amp; Hung, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411408504">Singer &amp; Singer, 1990</xref>). To be fair, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411408504">Jung, Bass, and Sosik (1995)</xref> found that development of a transformational organization is exceptional rather than the rule in some cultures, and cross-cultural research of ideal organization models reflected a number of crucial differences across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Avolio, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411408504">Hofstede, 1991</xref>). Yet the majority of studies found that, although some cultures render ideal organizations differently from others, there is clear evidence that a transformational organization is commonly taken as a model for imitation and acquisition in most cultures, an organizational culture deemed more astute in concept and practice than a transactional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411408504">Lam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411408504">Ruggieri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411408504">Yang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For the following empirical analysis we took samples from Taiwan four-year colleges and universities (hereafter colleges). The logic of this sampling decision was based on our interest in studying classical music education in Asian colleges, an area that remains largely unexplored for scientific research despite a few narrative explorations of teaching popular folk music in Asian countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411408504">Brand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411408504">Ho, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Aside from this practical aspect our sampling decision has a conceptual connotation for the research of Asian music education and transformational culture. The literature on Asian groups and organizations is voluminous and rather consensual with respect to the prevalence of transformational leadership and organization culture in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411408504">Hofstede, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411408504">Jung et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411408504">Triandis, 1993</xref>). In view of these studies, Asian societies may as a whole be collectivistic and Confucian, and these cultural values exert positive impacts upon an institutionâs resolution to adopt and nurture transformational organizational culture. Asian people tend to see their group or organization as an essential part of their lives and are often willing to sacrifice their self-interests for the benefit of the group and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>). This attachment to the organization helps Asians embrace group goals and values, and group-oriented followers themselves readily identify with the organization and leader on a belief in a common and collectivistic purpose. In this context, transformational organizational elements â such as charismatic leadership, inspirational motivation, and realignment of individual values â are likely to be present and valued in various Asian organizations.</p>

<title>Research hypothesis</title>
<p>This paper conceptualizes a music department organizational culture as a relational phenomenon rather than a physical-structural occurrence. At the same time it is assumed that the characteristic of a department organizational culture involves the chairâs professional and personal relationships to the faculty members (leadership) as well as the faculty membersâ professional and personal relationships with other peers (peer relations) in the department.</p>
<p>Professional leaders and faculty members are those of high caliber in professional competency, a trait commonly understood as the routine and efficacious use of communication, skills, experiences, and values in work performance to the advantage of the individuals and organization being served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411408504">Epstein &amp; Hundert, 2002</xref>, p. 226). From a relational perspective, professionalism pertains to the ability to communicate and work with leaders, colleagues, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411408504">Mcapherson &amp; Kenny, 2008</xref>). Professional department chairs and faculty members would support individual efforts of their faculty members and colleagues by paying attention to their needs, providing assistance, making resources available, and training and helping them toward the success of operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411408504">Andolsen, 2008</xref>). As might be expected, this kind of professional support from leaders and colleagues can form a favorable working environment in that a chair and faculty members provide appropriate and timely help to one another, individuals are encouraged to take initiative, faculty members strive to improve organizational operations, and mistakes are treated as learning experiences for the better. In this view, our first research hypothesis to test is whether the increase of professional leadership and peer relation is positively linked with the increase of transformational culture.</p>
<p>Strength in this professional dimension â without balance from the second component, however â could be understood as a mechanistic-occupational organization. This second component is about support and action on the human plane. For a department head, it would pertain to fair treatment of his or her faculty members, making them feel valuable, showing respect to the faculty members, and interacting well with the members at the personal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411408504">Camplin, 2009</xref>). In a similar fashion, it is possible that faculty members form a transformational culture department when they get along well with their peer professors and reach out to one another with a cordial and friendly attitude (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411408504">Yukl, 2009</xref>). These attributes seem to align nicely with the properties of transformational culture, such as mutual trust and encouragement, frequent communication, and a sense of community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411408504">Hui, Wong, &amp; Tjosvold, 2007</xref>). Compatible with this position are the findings showing that peer openness and agreeableness are tied with increased team player disposition; such increased peer trust and interdependence then bolster team member performance and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411408504">Kline &amp; OâGrady, 2009</xref>). Hence our second hypothesis is that, for college music departments, the expansion of transformational culture is tied to the increase of amiable and receptive perceptions and interactions between the department head and faculty members as well as among the fellow faculty members.</p>
<p>In addition, most studies on organizational culture address transactional organizational culture as a competing form of organization culture, and it has thus often been the object of secondary analysis beyond transformational culture. Our strategy of inquiry into transactional culture is rather crude and supplementary because we do not attempt to set up one particular formal hypothesis. At this stage, two speculations seem to be conceivable. First, transactional culture is not so much relation-oriented that it would be independent of relational factors such as department leadership and peer relation. Transactional organizations carry out the goals and manage everyday operations chiefly by introducing a variety of structural elements and mechanisms such as norms, rewards, and punishments in lieu of improving personal relationship, individual capacity, and organizational morale. On the other hand, it may be equally logical to expect that the degree of transactional culture is inversely related to those of professionalism and personal relationships. The high levels of idealized influence, intellectual inspiration, individual consideration, and connectivity that mark the traits of professional and personal leadership and peer relations are contrasted with the devaluation of purpose, flexibility, individual attention, and community spirit, a property deeply embedded in transactional organizations. Our inductive stance, however, may not be deemed totally irresponsible from a practical point of view since most scholars appear to agree on the argument that transactional culture has trivial effects on elevating an institution to an effective organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>). This study may draw on some empirical data that it expects can help future research move in a more deliberate theoretical direction regarding transactional organizational culture.</p>

<sec id="section3-0255761411408504">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>The survey population consisted of full-time faculty in all Taiwanese music departments in both four-year private and public colleges and universities. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411408504">Taiwan Ministry of Education (2008)</xref> statistics database provided a list of the 22 music departments. The names and contact information of 362 faculty members were then generated based on each departmentâs internet homepage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0255761411408504">1</xref></sup> Since the population size was small, the survey questionnaires were sent to everyone on the list rather than just a representative sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0255761411408504">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the survey, each faculty member received the questionnaires and a pre-paid return envelope with a letter explaining the purpose of the study. The participants were asked to complete the questionnaires and return them to the researchers within a two-week period. Three follow-up letters were sent to the participants: the first was sent two weeks after the first mailing, the second was sent two weeks after the second mailing, and the third was sent two weeks after the third mailing.</p>
<p>The response rate was 43%; 157 faculty members returned the questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0255761411408504">3</xref></sup> Of the respondents, 50 (32%) were male and 83 (53%) had a doctoral degree as their highest educational degree. Fifty-two respondents (33%) had less than 10 years of teaching experience, while 76 (48%) and 29 (19%) had taught between 10 to 20 years and longer than 20 years, respectively. With respect to academic major, 60 (38%) taught an instrument for a majority of their teaching job, 65 (41%) taught in composition, music education, or other music theory areas, whereas the rest were involved in teaching both theory and performance subjects.</p>

<sec id="section4-0255761411408504">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>As a means of tapping transformational and transactional cultures we used the 28-item <italic>Organization Description Questionnaire</italic> that was made up of two distinct 14-item factors, one for transactional and the other for transformational culture with coefficients alphas of .60â.65 and .69â.77, respectively (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Avolio, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411408504">1992</xref> for detailed psychometric properties). We computed the means from 14 corresponding items for the measurement of the two cultures.</p>
<p>For the predictor variables, 20 items from Lesterâs <italic>Teacher Job Attitudes Questionnaire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411408504">1987</xref>) were adapted to college department leadership and peer relationship. The items were modified because the test was originally developed for K-12 teachers. According to Lester, eight and 12 of the 20 items assess variances in faculty perception of their peers and immediate supervisors in educational settings, respectively.</p>
<p>Our preliminary reading of the 12 leadership items led to the assumption that the scale was a two-factor structure made up of professional and personal leadership. Factor analysis was conducted to test this observation, and the results are given in the top tier of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411408504">Table 1</xref>. The model expectedly yielded two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1, accounting for 58.51% of the variance in leadership style. Also the model adequately fit the data, chi-square (53) = 83.62, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .96, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = .95, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = .07. The first three eigenvalues were 5.69, 1.33, and .95, explaining 47.39%, 11.12%, and 7.97%, in the order specified. The first factor, named professional leadership, included seven items pertaining to providing assistance, resources, suggestions, and praise for teaching excellence along with clear task expectations for the faculty members. The second factor, named personal leadership, comprised five items that portrayed a department head who treated the faculty members equally, made them comfortable, and listened to suggestions from the faculty. Cronbach alpha coefficients were .87 and .83 for professional and relational leadership, in the order specified. For the analysis, we averaged responses within the two subscales to measure professional and personal leadership.</p>

One and three factor solutions explained 44.68% and 69.40%, in the order given. The eigenvalues for the first three factors were 3.58, 1.18, and .79. The first factor was labeled professional peer relation; its four items were associated with peer relationship replete with adequate feedback and stimulation related to work. The second factor, personal peer relation, was also comprised of four items measuring the extent to which the respondents felt good about their peers as well as whether they got along well with them. Cronbach alphas for professional and personal peer relation were, in order, .70 and .80, confirming acceptable internal consistency. The mean score of the four corresponding items was then computed for the analysis of professional and personal peer relation.</p>
<p>Apart from leadership and peer relations, several control variables might warrant inclusions in the analysis: pay, working condition, gender, teaching experience, education, teaching subjects, and teaching status. These measures were possibly important demographic indicators of perceived transformational culture as suggested by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411408504">Burns, 1978</xref>). For pay and working conditions the questionnaire tapped the levels of respondent attitudes toward the earning from the current faculty occupation and the facilities and equipments in their department and school, adapting 10 items taken from the Lester scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411408504">1987</xref>). The overall model fit was adequate, chi-square (45) = 1003, 20, CFI = .97, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .07. The bottom tier of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411408504">Table 1</xref> displays the results of factor analysis on the 10 items measuring pay and working conditions, clearly once again pointing to a two factor solution with the 68.66% variance explained. The first three eigenvalues were 5.01, 1.86, and .65. Factor 1, working conditions, contained six items; factor 2, pay, consisted of four items pertaining to respondent satisfaction with income and financial security. Cronbach alphas for pay and working conditions were .86 and .87, respectively. We then separately averaged the responses on the four and five items to assess the respondent pay and working conditions. Besides, the questionnaire asked for the respondentâs gender (0 male, 1 female), teaching experience (1 less than 10 years, 2 11â20 years, 3 more than 20 years), education (0 no doctoral degree, 1 doctoral degree), teaching subjects (1 performance, 2 performance and theory, 3 theory), and faculty status (1 full professor, 2 associate professor, 3 assistant professor).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411408504">Table 2</xref> presents descriptive statistics for the department leadership, peer relation, and organizational culture variables being analyzed. Of the four leadership and peer relation variables, personal peer relation had the highest mean, 3.91, while personal and professional leadership recorded the two lowest means, 3.43 and 3.49, respectively. Yet the differences between these scores are considered more or less minimal given that the means could range from 1 to 5. Professional leadership recorded a mean of 3.57. On the other hand, the respondents gave a mean score of 8.85 for transformational culture to their music department, a value much greater than the mean of 2.94 for transactional culture. The total scores of both transformational and transactional cultures could range from â14 to +14; the higher the positive scores, the stronger the characteristics are within the organization.</p>

<p>Next we employed ordinary-least-squares regression, and the left column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411408504">Table 2</xref> provides the estimated importance of leadership and peer relations to transformational culture in the music departments. Two predictors stood out. There was a positive association between professional leadership and transformational culture, uniquely explaining 12% of the variance in the dependent variable. Also, professional peer relation was positively related to transformational culture, accounting for about 5% of the total variance. In contrast, personal leadership and peer relation did little to engender transformational culture. Transformational culture was also statistically independent of pay, working condition, and other demographic variables. For transactional culture, in the right column, the level of transactional culture was captured by working condition, and its inverse association shows that degraded working condition is related to increased transactional culture, accounting for 3% of the variance.</p>
<p>One potential caveat to the preceding transformational culture analysis is that it has not taken into account whether the effect of one type of leadership or peer relation may vary according to the influence of other types of leadership and peer relations. An interaction between predictor variables is common in the social science literature and should be examined routinely in relation to research hypothesis testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411408504">Hinkle, Wiersma, &amp; Jurs, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0255761411408504">Table 3</xref> reports the effects of professional and personal leadership and peer relation, broken down by below-average and above-average groups based on the mean leadership and peer relation scores, and then arrayed according to the four types of leadership and peer relation. A couple of findings are noteworthy. First, the results clearly demonstrated that professional leadership positively relates to transformational culture regardless of levels of personal leadership, professional peer relation, and personal peer relation, positing that, for the music departments, the influence of professional leadership is independent of changes in other types of leadership and peer relation. Second, professional peer relation is also conducive to transformational culture but, noticeably, this affirmative role takes place solely in the music departments with low levels of professional leadership, personal leadership, and personal peer relation. This fact shows that the effects of professional peer relation differ according to the levels of leadership and personal peer relation. Finally, personal peer relation can also play the same favorable role, but this impact is possible only in a music department under a highly professional chair.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present data indicate that the music departments under scrutiny are markedly transformational in their organizational culture. The mean scores of the departmentsâ perceived transformational and transactional cultures were 8.85 and 2.94, respectively. We are told that a mean score of 6 is necessary in general for an organization to be reckoned transformational in terms of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>, p. 106). When this is used as a comparison for our data, the mean perceived transformational score of the music departments is significantly greater than the suggested score of 6, <italic>t</italic>(156) = 7.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In contrast, the mean score of 2.94 for the transactional culture variable falls between â5 and 5, two scores corresponding to the lower and upper limits, respectively, of a moderately-transactional organization.</p>
<p>The results that the samples define their departments as highly transformational in organizational culture and moderately transactional are worthy of attention, since these represent some of the first empirical data we have from college music professors that their departments may fit the so-called âmoderately transformationalâ organizations, an organizational type that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass and Riggio (2006)</xref> defined as the one with highly transformational and average transactional traits. The findings may also reinforce a casual speculation that Taiwan music departments are coupled with transformational organizational traits due to their collectivistic, Confucian cultures as well as their involvement in teaching classical music and performance, academic subjects that require high levels of creativity, innovation, and individualized effort (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411408504">Creech et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For hypothesis testing, as anticipated, results revealed in this paper are indicative of the propitious impact of professional leadership on the departments. Professional leadership accounts for more than 12% of the variance, which is much greater than the 1%, 2%, and 5% for personal leadership, personal peer relation, and professional peer relation, in the order given. Further, this connection is probably independent of peer relation and personal leadership. These results imply that, for transformational culture, college music programs are mostly benefitted by a department chair who can provide professional assistance and resources to the faculty as well as keep track of the facultyâs performance and give them rightful rewards based on their performance.</p>
<p>In the data, professional peer relation is found to be the second most influential factor in explaining the variance in transformational culture. This importance is not as straightforward as the one for professional department leadership, however: the effects of professional peer relation vary according to the levels of the other leadership and peer relation variables. Specifically, the affirmative accent of professional peer relation appears to be assured only if a department suffers from low levels of professional and personal leadership and personal peer relation. In contrast, it may fail to make weighty contribution to the prediction of transformational culture when the department bears high levels of professional leadership and personal leadership and peer relation.</p>
<p>One possible interpretation of this professional-leadership interaction is that high levels of professional leadership, due to its likeness to professional peer relation, can offset, suppress, or prevent the role that professional peer relation plays in relation to the growth of transformational culture. Otherwise it possibly testifies to the compensatory role that professional peer relation bears in linkage with professional leadership. The faculty may see their professional peers as an alternative source of support and assistance to the weak department leadership plagued with poor professional knowledge and skills. Professional colleagues, as for professional leaders, are equipped with knowledge, experience, and skills that novice faculty members need for completing tasks and operating programs. It is possible that music faculty turn to their knowledgeable and experienced colleagues for professional help when it is not available from their department chair and other leaders.</p>
<p>What is more difficult to explain is the result that professional peer relation tends to promote transformational culture mainly under the circumstances of weak personal leadership and peer relation. Its influence becomes insignificant once it is associated with strong personal leadership and peer relation. Our hindsight guesswork concerning this finding is the potential emergence of âpersonalisticâ organizational culture. This is to say that leaders and peers with intimate ties with others in the department can prioritize their relationships, acting to enrich their personal reputations and networks, rather than other department goals, and doing so adversely curbs the likelihood of faculty with professional traits to affect the department and reshape it to a transformational institution. This might be a negative consequence unanticipated by those who maintain intimate personal relationships with others in the department. Personalistic interests and activities may embed themselves in the department, possibly concentrating power and resources in a few individuals and their relationships and adopting policies directed at intimate relationships or short-term actualization of rents for a selected group. In such an environment, there are likely to be few mechanisms for professional regular faculty to pressure their department head or senior members to focus on the promotion of transformational culture, new ideas and policies, and the overall welfare of the department instead of their personal interest and relationships with others.</p>
<p>Another finding suggests a significant interaction, albeit less discrete as compared to the case of professional peer relation, between personal peer relation and professional leadership. In the data, should a department head be highly professional, personal peer relation has the potential to enhance the music departmentâs likelihood to bring about transformational culture, but such a relationship does not emerge under the department leadership that is flaccid in professionalism. That is to imply that the intimate faculty peer relationship requires a professional department head to be constructive. Perhaps a range of professional leadership traits, especially goal-orientation and ability to supervise followers and notice changes in their job performance, can direct and discipline the potential counter-organizational drive of intimate personal peer relation such that the drive is transformed into more useful and constructive activities and behaviors.</p>
<p>Apart from transformational culture, we spent some effort examining a subsidiary issue of whether leadership and peer relations affect college music programs in procurement of transactional culture. In light of the data, the expansion of transactional culture is independent of professional and personal leadership and peer relation. This result bespeaks that the future study of transactional culture needs to incorporate factors other than professionalism and personal relations into its research agenda. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411408504">Bolman and Dealâs (1997)</xref> thesis of structural leadership orientation is a potentially useful concept for the study of transactional culture, which stresses formal rules and relationships in leadership practice and seeks ways to develop a chain of command that best fits organizational demands and purposes. As we have discussed, the traits of rule, corrective actions, and structure are so often cited in relation to a transactional organization that these have become the characteristics of transactional leadership and organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411408504">Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006</xref>). For further studies, this convergence may offer reasons to expect that the growth of transactional culture is a function of structural leadership and management, rather than the professional or personal components of leadership and peer relation. At this point, regardless of this viewâs plausibility, it suffices to suggest that we may need to shift the analysis more toward leadership and peer relation factors other than professional and personal traits in order to account for the growth of transactional culture in college music departments.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper began with a hypothesis that, in college music departments, the increase of transformational organizational culture is associated with the increase of professional and personal department leadership and faculty peer relation. The results are found to be more complicated and differ from the initial expectations in some ways. Besides, our findings could be challenged due to the fact that the faculty samples are Taiwanese. To be sure, caution is needed in drawing out general implications of this study because our respondents are not a representative international or AmericanâEuropean sample group, although it possibly offers more relevant clues for the music faculty in Asian countries.</p>
<p>A couple of findings are, nevertheless, worthy of attention in our conclusions. First, the results lend support to those advocating professionalism in leadership and peer relations for the expansion of transformational culture. Professional department leadership is a factor closely linked with the growth of transformational culture in college music departments. Although other factors shaping transformational culture are also identified, professional leadership seems to have a more powerful and consistent connection with transformational culture than do other variables. Further, its significance to transformational culture may be neither affected nor controlled by other leadership and peer relation factors, including the department chairâs personal relationships with the department faculty. Second, the results speak to the accent of professional peer relations; increased professional peer relationship is tied with higher levels of perceived transformational culture. This linkage becomes further distinctive when faculty members work in a department lacking strong professional leadership and personal relationships. That is to imply that, as professional leadership and personal peer relation diminish in a music department, regular faculty members with professional aptitude may tend to play increasingly more salient roles in promoting transformational culture in the department. Finally, overall, both personal leadership and peer relations fail to make noticeable contributions to the growth of transformational culture. This finding goes against the popular view that an intimate personal relationship is central to the success of an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411408504">Camplin, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Many department heads declined to participate in the survey due to their small numbers in the survey sample and the resulting likelihood of being identified and highlighted in the analysis. Moreover, department chairs reportedly differ in demographic attributes and work-life issues from regular faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411408504">Rosser, 2004</xref>). They are generally recognized as having high degrees of dedication, training, and support for high standards of performance and eminence in their areas of expertise. Hence they can make up an outlier group in a distribution of effects, distorting the overall results of our analysis given the relatively small sample size utilized for this study. We thus involved only regular faculty in sampling and focused on how regular faculty assess their departmentâs organizational culture.</p></fn>

<p>Prior to the survey we acquired the approval of our research proposal from the university internal review board to ensure the privacy and safety of the respondents. The research closely followed this approved research proposal. Participation was voluntary and the subjects were informed about our research purposes and gave us their written consent for participation along with the questionnaires.</p></fn>

<p>The 43 percentage rate would be considered typical of higher education research granted that, when surveying a professional educator population, a response rate is generally noted to record less than 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411408504">Porter &amp; Whitcomb, 2003</xref>). Also, while we explored the demographic attributes of non-respondents, no significant differences were detected in gender, education, teaching subject, status, and experience between those who responded and those who failed to do so, possibly implying that the present sample is representative of the survey population.</p></fn>

<title>LidÃ©rance, relation avec les pairs, et culture de transformation et dâorganisation: Une approche relationelle au sein dâune facultÃ© de musique taiwanaise</title>
<p>Ce manuscript explore comment la lidÃ©rance et la rÃ©lation avec les pairs influencent lâinclinaison au dÃ©veloppement de la culture de transformation et dâorganisation au sein des dÃ©partments de musique Ã  la facultÃ©. Notre theorie sur la lidÃ©rance relationelle et la relation avec les pairs nous a initialement permis de formuler les expectations pour les impacts affirmatives de la liderance professionelle et personelle et de la rÃ©lation avec les pairs sur lâexpansion de la culture de transformation. Les sujets dâÃ©tude ont Ã©tÃ© selectionnÃ©s parmi les professeurs Ã  plein temps dans les dÃ©partements de musique taiwanais. Les rÃ©sultats ont dÃ©montrÃ©s lâimportance de la lidÃ©rance professionelle et de la relation avec les pairs pour agrandir la culture de transformation. Cependant, les relations personelles intimes ont Ã©chouÃ© cette prÃ©diction. Lâimplication principale est que le professionalisme de lâÃ©quipe de direction et les relations avec les pairs sont les principaux facteurs encourageant les dÃ©partments de musique Ã  supporter la culture de transformation et dâorganisation.</p>

<title>FÃ¼hrungsverhalten, Peer-Beziehungen und transformationelle Organisationskultur: Eine relationale AnnÃ¤herung an das Beispiel einer taiwanesichen College Musik FakultÃ¤t</title>
<p>Dieser Artikel ergrÃ¼ndet, wie FÃ¼hrungsverhalten und Peer-Beziehungen, mit der Tendenz der Musikfachbereiche von Colleges eine transformationelle Organisationsstruktur zu entwickeln, zusammenhÃ¤ngen. Unsere Theorie der relationalen FÃ¼hrung und Peer-Beziehung hat uns zu Beginn erlaubt, Erwartungen fÃ¼r einen positiven Einfluss von professioneller und persÃ¶nlicher FÃ¼hrung und Peer-Beziehungen auf die Erweiterung einer transformationellen Kultur zu formulieren. Die Beispiele stammen von Fulltime College Professoren der Taiwanesischen Musik FakultÃ¤ten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen die signifikante Wichtigkeit professioneller FÃ¼hrung und Peer-Beziehungen in Bezug auf das Wachsen einer transformationellen Kultur; trotzdem verfehlen die engen persÃ¶nlichen Beziehungen, der Vorhersage Rechnung zu tragen. Die weitere Implikation ist, dass ProfessionalitÃ¤t in der FÃ¼hrung wie auch Peer-Beziehungen eine Hauptdeterminante fÃ¼r die UnterstÃ¼tzung einer transformationellen Organisationskultur duch die Musikfachbereiche darstellen.</p>

<title>Liderazgo, Relaciones entre Iguales y Cultura Organizativa Transformativa: Una AproximaciÃ³n Relacional a una Muestra de Profesorado de MÃºsica Universitario en TaiwÃ¡n</title>
<p>Este artÃ­culo analiza la relaciÃ³n entre el liderazgo y las relaciones entre iguales con la tendencia de los departamentos de mÃºsica universitarios a desarrollar una cultura organizativa transformativa. Nuestra teorÃ­a del liderazgo relacional y de relaciones entre iguales nos ha permitido formular hipÃ³tesis sobre el impacto positivo del liderazgo personal y profesional y las relaciones entre colegas en la expansiÃ³n de la cultura transformativa. La muestra se seleccionÃ³ entre el profesorado universitario a tiempo completo en departamentos de mÃºsica taiwaneses. Los resultados demuestran la significativa importancia del liderazgo profesional y la relaciÃ³n igualitaria para el crecimiento de la cultura transformativa; sin embargo, las relaciones personales fallan a la hora de contribuir a la predicciÃ³n. La consecuencia mÃ¡s importante es que la profesionalidad en el liderazgo y las relaciones igualitarias son factores clave en la disposiciÃ³n de los departamentos de mÃºsica para reforzar la cultura organizativa transformativa.</p>
