<abstract>
<p>In this article, the effect of hygrothermal aging on the painted surface finish of unidirectional and fabric carbon fibre composite laminates, with and without surfacing film was investigated. The results highlighted the importance of ensuring that the composite surface directly beneath the paint layer is made from a uniform material with a consistent thickness in order to minimise surface defects from occurring during aging. The surfacing film was found to minimise the print through development on the painted unidirectional and twill composite surfaces. However, the surfacing film layer was found to intermingle with the carbon fibre plies during cure, which resulted in an uneven film thickness that caused increased levels of orange peel. The twill laminate painted surface produced high levels of print through and surface waviness that was caused by the large resin rich regions located within the tow intersections at the surface which enlarged due to thermal expansion and swelling of the matrix with hygrothermal aging. It was also noted that the small resin rich regions between the individual carbon fibres on the unidirectional composite surface were sufficiently large to print through the painted surface.</p>

<p>An improvement in vehicle performance, efficiency and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through the replacement of steel with lightweight materials such as carbon fibre composites. The lightweight, high strength properties of carbon fibre composite materials can assist with the automotive industry’s need to meet stringent greenhouse gas emission targets by 2020 and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312442555">1</xref></sup> Although there are many advantages gained through the use of carbon fibre composite materials, there are also a number of issues associated with the surface finish of painted carbon fibre composite components when used for automotive body panels that compromise its Class A finish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312442555">2</xref></sup> Class A is a quality standard used within the automotive industry to define an acceptable surface finish of a painted automotive body panel. Many definitions exist for Class A due to the different quality standards within each of the major automotive companies, although in general, Class A is defined as a painted surface that is deemed acceptable by the customer that is free of defects. When using alternative materials such as composites, they are classified as Class A if the optical properties are identical to that of an equivalent steel panel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312442555">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Carbon fibre composite body panels can be manufactured to meet the Class A standards,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312442555">4</xref></sup> although there are difficulties maintaining the Class A surface finish when the panel is exposed to environmental factors such as high temperature and humidity. Surface defects common with painted composite components after environmental exposure can include print through,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312442555">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312442555"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312442555">7</xref></sup> blistering,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312442555">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312442555">8</xref></sup> cracking and flaking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312442555">7</xref></sup> Orange peel, another common defect, is the term used to describe the dimple pattern or waviness on a painted automotive surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312442555">9</xref></sup> and is influenced by the underlying substrate material and paint processing conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312442555">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Print through is a common surface defect that is caused by variation in the resin and fibre density beneath the painted surface. Carbon fibre is a dimensionally stable material with low thermal expansion, while thermosetting resins are susceptible to many forms of volumetric changes. Volumetric changes can occur through a combination of the following phenomenon:
<list id="list1-0021998312442555" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Resin shrinkage as a result of molecular cross-linking during cure which produces a ‘fibre’ print through effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312442555">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312442555">11</xref></sup> Resin shrinkage is irreversible and can gradually increase in intensity if the resin was insufficiently cured prior to the application of paint.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resin expansion and contraction as a result of thermal effects and moisture absorption which causes a ‘resin’ print through effect. Resin expansion is mostly reversible and diminishes once removed from the hot/humid environment.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The volumetric changes of the resin are generally observed in resin rich regions beneath the painted surface, commonly between fibre tows with woven fabrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312442555">4</xref></sup> Materials developed by the major composite suppliers in an attempt to eliminate print through and prepare the surface for painting include surfacing films (Henkel SynSkin® HC 9837.1<sup>12,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312442555">13</xref></sup>) and complete material systems such as Gurit SPRINT® Car Body Sheet, Advanced Composites Group ZPreg™ Body Panel System and Cytec Carboform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312442555">14</xref></sup> Gurit SPRINT Car Body Sheet is renowned as the best performing composite system, in terms of surface finish, within the automotive industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312442555">15</xref></sup> All of these systems provide a resin rich laminate surface which acts as a barrier between the carbon fibre plies and painted surface. However, a lack of scientific understanding of the influence of carbon fibre architecture and surface layers on the surface finish after aging is evident from the literature with no work published to date. The material systems mentioned above also use woven carbon fibre fabrics, although other reports have suggested that woven materials should be avoided in order to reduce print through.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312442555">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of hygrothermal aging on the painted surface finish of simple fibre architectures (unidirectional and 2 × 2 twill) combined with a surfacing film. Changes in mass and surface finish appearance were recorded throughout the aging test. The surface finish of the painted laminates were evaluated visually in terms of orange peel and print through, and with a BYK-Gardner wave-scan distinctness of image (DOI) instrument in terms of DOI, short and long-term waviness. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312442555">Figure 1</xref>, the appearance of any given surface can be evaluated by focussing on the physical surface (short and long-term waviness) and by focussing on the quality of the reflected image from the surface (DOI). The short and long-term waviness measurements are calculated using a mathematical filter that separates wavelength sizes into short and long-term wavelength categories, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312442555">Figure 2</xref>. Micrographs of the cross-sectional surface morphology for the different laminate combinations were assessed in order to understand and give reasoning as to what caused the observed surface changes with aging.

<p>The laminates in this study were manufactured using unidirectional (T600S 190 g/m<sup>2</sup>, laminate lay-up [0/90/0]<sub>S</sub>, referred to as UD) and 2 × 2 twill (12k T700S 380 g/m<sup>2</sup>, laminate lay-up [0/90/0]<sub>T</sub>, referred to as TW) carbon fibre pre-impregnated with G83C epoxy resin as supplied by TorayCA. G83C is an automotive epoxy resin that was used by General Motors for the Corvette Z06 2004 C5 bonnet and 2006 C6 front fenders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312442555">16</xref></sup> An epoxy-based surfacing film, Henkel SynSkin® HC 9837.1 (150 g/m<sup>2</sup>), was co-cured with the composite. SynSkin is used in the aerospace industry to minimise surface porosity and print through of core materials and to, therefore, reduce secondary surface preparation that would be otherwise required. SynSkin HC 9837.1 contains silica (quartz and crystabolite) embedded in an epoxy resin film. The laminates received one debulk 10 min prior to curing, regardless of the prepreg fibre architecture and surface film usage. The laminate stack was laid on Alanod Miro 4/4400 GP aluminium sheeting (<italic>Ra</italic> = 0.011 µm, <italic>Rt</italic> = 0.12 µm, <italic>Rsk</italic> = 0.09 and <italic>Rku</italic> = 3.45). The Miro sheet was coated with a semi-permanent release and placed on a rigid tool. A perforated release film was placed on the edge of the laminate stack with a solid release film on the centre. A peel ply and breather layer was placed over the lay-up and the vacuum bag was sealed with bagging film and sealant tape. The cure was conducted using an American Autoclave Mini-Bonder (#MB-2036-415-315-800). Laminates were heated to 150°C for 10 min using a heating rate of 2.8°C/min with 700 kPa of pressure and 80 kPa of vacuum applied within the bag. The complete duration of the cure was approximately 100 min.</p>
<p>The panels were painted by a Tier 1 supplier to the Australian automotive industry, who specialise in painting plastic and composite exterior body panels. The primer used for the composite panels was Akzo Nobel AP-106, a two component polyurethane primer developed for carbon fibre epoxy substrates. Two coats of PPG ESB Heron White were applied to the primed surface followed by two coats of DuPont OE-8000 clear and then baked at 80°C for 30 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998312442555"><title>Fibre volume fraction</title>
<p>The fibre volume fraction was calculated using the areal method. Three samples were taken from cross the centre of each laminate, placed in metallographic mounts and set in an epoxy casting resin. Once cured, the samples were demounted, rough ground and fine polished to 1 µm. A total of ten optical images were taken at 1000 × magnification before being analysed with ImageJ software. Images were converted to 8-bit grey scale followed by applying the threshold function to convert the image into black and white pixels only. The threshold level was kept consistent between images by selecting the minimum point between the two peaks of the grey scale histogram which represent the two major components of the image; the fibres and matrix. The ratio of the number of black pixels in the image (representing the individual carbon fibres) relative to the number of white pixels was used at the fibre volume fraction for the laminate.</p>

<p>The glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) was measured in accordance with ASTM D 7028 – 07 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312442555">17</xref></sup> to monitor any changes before and after aging. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tests were conducted on TA Instruments DMA Q800 controlled using TA Instruments Explorer software. The temperature range analysed was from 30°C to 250°C using a heating rate of 5°C/min. The specimen size tested were 55 mm long and 14 mm wide using double cantilever flexural loading mode (35 mm effective sample length) at a frequency of 1 Hz and 0.1% strain. The DMA <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> was determined to be at the intersection of the two tangent lines from before the transition and at the midpoint of the storage modulus drop.</p>

<p>Visual changes and defects formed on the painted surface during the aging tests were recorded and classified into two groups: orange peel and print through.

<p>A BYK-Gardner wave-scan DOI was used to measure the DOI, short-term and long-term waviness of the painted laminates. Three scans of 10 cm length were performed per painted panel. The wave-scan DOI records an optical profile while rolled across the surface of interest. The instrument illuminates the surface with a laser point at a 60° angle and a detector that measures the reflected light intensity at the opposing 60° direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312442555">10</xref></sup> The data was transferred from the portable device onto BYKWare auto-chart software for analysis.

The short and long-term waviness parameters describes the physical nature of the surface and encapsulates imperfections such as waviness, orange peel and print through at the two different structure categories as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312442555">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>The surface finish of a painted laminate can be affected by the thickness of the film layer, therefore a consistent paint film thickness should be maintained between samples. The paint layer thickness for the different sample sets remained consistent as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312442555">Table 1</xref> and, therefore, it can be assumed that the film thickness has a negligible effect. Applying a high-gloss layer to any surface will increase the visibility of surface defects which also applies to painting a composite surface. The unpainted composite surface is a mirror finish of the tool surface which generally has a low-sheen appearance. With the application of the paint layer to the composite surface, surface defects such as print through and orange peel will become increasingly apparent. The reader should also be made aware that the paint film also contributes to the appearance of a composite surface and can also have an effect on the degree of orange peel depending on how the film was applied and the chemistry of the film, although further discussions regarding this topic are out of the scope of this article. It has previously been shown that the use of thick paint films mask the effects of substrate roughness on the final painted appearance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312442555">21</xref></sup> and, conversely, thinner paint layers further emphasis the substrate defects. The paint thicknesses used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312442555">Table 1</xref>) represent those commonly used by the automotive industry. Total paint film thicknesses vary accordingly with the vehicle and automotive company. For example, the paint film thickness used on the General Motors Corvette is between 71 and 109 µm, whereas, thicknesses used in papers where the work was funded by Ford and Aston Martin Lagonda were 170 µm.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312442555">Figure 4</xref> shows the percentage change in mass for each of the laminates. The change in mass represents the amount of moisture absorbed by the matrix. It can be seen that the laminates absorb the most moisture within the first 200 h of exposure to the humid environment reaching almost 0.4% mass change. The mass change of the laminates continued to increase until it reached approximately 0.5% for all laminates by the end of the 552 h of exposure and where the mass change has begun to plateau. The slightly higher moisture absorption of the twill laminates could be attributed to the greater thickness of the laminates compared to the unidirectional laminates which allowed for much larger quantities of moisture to be absorbed.

<p>The visual changes in the appearance of the painted surfaces after 552 h of aging are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312442555">Table 2</xref> and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312442555">Figure 5</xref>. Print through was observed on both the twill and unidirectional laminate surfaces, although was more evident on the twill surface. The SynSkin surfacing film was found to significantly reduce the print through for the twill laminate and subsequently, completely eliminated the print through from forming on the unidirectional laminates. However, laminates with SynSkin as the surface layer resulted in an increase in orange peel. This increase in orange peel for the SynSkin laminates is represented in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312442555">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312442555">7</xref> by the large change in DOI and short-term waviness values for both the unidirectional and twill laminates. The minor visual change in orange peel and surface waviness of the aged unidirectional laminate surface was supported by the small change in both DOI (−4.2) and short-term waviness (7.9) in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312442555">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312442555">7</xref>, respectively. The print through, as represented by the long-term waviness results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312442555">Figure 8</xref> was shown to dramatically reduce when the SynSkin surfacing film was combined with the twill fibre architecture. The formation of print through on the twill laminates and surface waviness in the long-term waviness region (1.2–12 mm) was found for the unidirectional surface with and without the SynSkin surfacing film.

<p>The quantity of moisture absorbed by the matrix determines the degree of print through and orange peel which occurs. It is interesting to note that the most significant change in the surface finish was observed within the first 100 h of beginning the aging test as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312442555">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312442555">7</xref> and within the first 200 hours for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312442555">Figure 8</xref>. This change is associated with both the thermal and swelling properties of the matrix material. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312442555">Figure 4</xref>, most of the changes with the painted surface appearance were observed when the mass increased by 0.4%. Mass changes of approximately 0.4–0.5% appeared to not make a substantial difference to the surface finish.</p>
<p>The print through phenomenon can occur as a result of the uncured resin molecules continuing to cross-link and consequently create resin shrinkage. However, DSC analysis determined that the laminates were fully cured, which suggested that the print through occurred due to a combination of thermal expansion and swelling of the matrix. Within 24 h after the samples were removed from the aging environment, all traces of print through and orange peel disappeared, which supports the hypothesis that insufficient molecular cross-linking prior to aging was not the cause of the print through.</p>
<p>The volumetric changes of the matrix due to thermal expansion and swelling are emphasised by the resin rich surface regions. On woven fibre laminates, these resin rich regions are located where adjoining tows intersect, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312442555">Figure 9</xref>, directly beneath the painted surface. When the resin rich regions expand, the pattern of the woven fibre structure below the painted surface protrudes through the paint and results in the print through effect. The relatively small resin rich regions on the unidirectional laminate surface that were also found to contribute to print through are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312442555">Figure 10</xref>. As expected, the unidirectional fibre laminate had a more consistent fibre and resin distribution across the surface that neighboured the paint layers.

<p>A cross-section micrograph of the twill laminate surface with the SynSkin film is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312442555">Figure 11</xref>. The silica fibres from the SynSkin layer can be seen to intermingle between the intersecting twill fibre tows and filled what was previously a resin rich region. The SynSkin also formed a resin rich layer across the entire surface which also assisted with reducing the severity of the print through. The micrograph of the unidirectional laminate with a SynSkin surface layer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312442555">Figure 12</xref>. The cross-section showed that the SynSkin created a resin rich layer at the surface and, therefore, reduced the sensitivity to small changes in surface resin volumetric expansion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312442555">Figure 12</xref> also highlighted how the SynSkin layer has intermingled with the unidirectional surface ply and has created an uneven surface layer thickness. As the resin is heated at the commencement of cure, the resin viscosity of both the surfacing film and the prepreg layers reduced, which has allowed the resin and fibrous layers to intermingle.

<p>The non-uniform resin thickness at the surface has caused uneven matrix volumetric expansion which resulted in the increased orange peel that was observed on the painted surface.</p>
<p>Resin-rich surfacing films are an effective method to reduce print through. However, the importance of creating a uniform, resin-rich surface has also been highlighted and should be kept in mind when assessing other surfacing films to create stable surface layers.</p>

<p>This study has investigated the surface finish of painted carbon fibre composites, manufactured with two different fibre architectures and a surface layer, after exposure to a hygrothermal environment. It was found that the most obvious changes in the painted surface finish were observed up to 0.4% mass change which resulted in the most significant changes in DOI, short-term and long-term waviness.</p>
<p>It was also found that print through, as a result of moisture absorption, formed on laminates with both unidirectional and 2 × 2 twill carbon fibre layers. As expected, the resin rich regions in between the tow fibre intersections of the twill laminate readily absorbed moisture resulting in swelling. However, the small resin rich pockets located in between individual carbon fibres on the unidirectional laminate surface were large enough to contribute to visible print through. The application of a SynSkin surfacing film layer eliminated all signs of print through on the unidirectional fibre laminate, although could not completely eliminate the print through on the twill laminate surface. The SynSkin surfacing film was found to intermingle with the adjoining epoxy layer that created an uneven film thickness across the laminate surface, which resulted in high levels of surface waviness and orange peel.</p>
