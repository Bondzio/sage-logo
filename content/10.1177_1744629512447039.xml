<p>This is an interesting text that addresses the core issues of social exclusion for vulnerable groups in our society. People with mental health and intellectual disabilities are among the most socially excluded and stigmatized groups in society.</p>
<p>The text is divided into three parts. The first part comprises six chapters which set the scene by making the case for why social exclusion should be the concern of professionals, carers and service users in the field of mental health and intellectual disabilities. The term ‘social exclusion’ is explained, and the breadth and complexities of the concept are examined. This part explores key aspects of social inclusion for people with mental health and intellectual disabilities. It also provides an overview of UK and European policies that relate to social exclusion and their relevance to psychiatry and its subspecialties.</p>
<p>The second part also comprises six chapters, which examine the scope of the problems of social exclusion for people with mental health and intellectual disabilities. The authors critically discuss the relationship between poverty, social exclusion and mental illness and its effects on people’s lives in a number of areas such as health, education, employment, social support and crime. Social exclusion is seen as both the cause and the consequence of having a mental health and/or intellectual disability. The authors analyse the nature of social exclusion and its relationship to ill health and set out a strong argument as to why it should be a legitimate concern for mental health professionals, carers and service users.</p>
<p>Finally, part 3 comprises of a further six chapters that provide a broad overview of the research literature on social exclusion and mental illness. Some key aspects of inclusive mental health services for the twenty-first century are discussed in the context of future policy and practice.</p>
<p>The strengths of the text are its clarity, its use of relevant literature and its consideration of the biopsychosocial aspects of social exclusion. The text is written in a clear, uncomplicated style and the authors have made good use of boxes and figures to present information in different ways with a view to enhance understanding of the issues and concepts. The sequence of the content is coherent and logical, with each chapter ending in a conclusion and a helpful summary to ensure that the key points have been grasped or can be easily accessed for busy readers.</p>
<p>The focus of the book is essentially on people with mental health, and some useful references are made to people with intellectual disability without examining the depth and breadth of social exclusion issues for this client group. The journey to social inclusion is indeed a long one and it is certainly a national, European and global issue. It would have been beneficial to include a comparative analysis of European policies and evidence based practices. This would have gone some way towards sharing how barriers to social exclusion are addressed at the European level and should help to improve care and services for people with mental health.</p>
<p>The editors and contributors have made an excellent attempt at putting together a substantial and contemporary text on social inclusion and mental health. The text will make an invaluable contribution to reshaping national policy and practice with a view to supporting people with mental health to achieve meaningful and rewarding life experiences. The book is aimed primarily at psychiatrists, including trainees, who see people with mental health as part of their practice. However, there is much merit in this book and it will provide essential reading for a wide range of health and social care professionals working in the field of mental health and intellectual disability.</p>
