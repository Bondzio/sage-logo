<abstract>
<p>This study aims to examine the relationship between sleep duration and body mass index (BMI) in two South Korean samples: children and adolescents. Nationally representative secondary data (i.e., the Korean Survey on the Obesity of Youth and Children) collected in 2009 were analyzed (<italic>N</italic> = 2,499 for children and <italic>N</italic> = 7,431 for adolescents). Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were implemented to examine BMI levels depending on sleep duration. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore the existence of a strong association between sleep duration and BMI <italic>z</italic> score after controlling for other factors. In both samples, sleep length had a reverse linear relationship with BMI <italic>z</italic> score, and shorter sleep duration was significantly associated with an increase in BMI <italic>z</italic> score. School nurses should take note of the strong association between sleep duration and BMI for more effective weight control in children and adolescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The obesity prevalence among children and adolescence is substantial in South Korea, and this is a serious health concern. The most recent national data in South Korea show that 16–21% of the children and adolescents in 2007–2009 were overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512450582">Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512450582">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512450582">2010</xref>). Although obesity is a critical public health issue at each stage of life, greater attention should be paid in childhood and adolescence for the following four reasons. First, obese young people are more likely to experience physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, orthopedic problems, and liver abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840512450582">Sinha &amp; Kling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059840512450582">Viver &amp; Tompkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059840512450582">Wicks-Nelson &amp; Israel, 2009</xref>). Second, they are more likely to be afflicted with psychological problems such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and suicide behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512450582">Friedlander, Larkin, Rosen, Palermo, &amp; Redline, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512450582">Mash &amp; Wolfe, 2010</xref>). Third, their social relationships with peers could be affected by negative views of obesity (e.g., social withdrawal, isolation, and bullying) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059840512450582">Viver &amp; Tompkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059840512450582">Wicks-Nelson &amp; Israel, 2009</xref>). Lastly, obese youths’ quality of life is more likely to be impaired (i.e., lower physical and psychological functioning), as compared to their nonobese counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512450582">Friedlander et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059840512450582">Tsiros et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To address obesity-related problems among children and adolescents, diverse intervention programs modifying obesity-related factors have been developed and utilized (e.g., school- and community-based programs). However, these programs have produced limited success, and they suggest that there is not one easy universal solution to resolve obesity at these early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512450582">Boon &amp; Clydesdale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512450582">Chan &amp; Woo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512450582">Lee, 2007</xref>). This implies that more tailored intervention strategies are urgently needed to obtain better outcomes. To do so, the understanding of obesity in childhood and adolescence should be fundamentally enhanced.</p>
<p>In recent times, researchers have proposed that sleep duration plays a critical role in the emergence of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512450582">Cappuccio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512450582">Chen, Beydoun, &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512450582">Hart &amp; Jelalian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall, Glozier, &amp; Grunstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512450582">Nielsen, Danielsen, &amp; Sorensen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512450582">Patel &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>). In general, as compared to adult samples, considerable scientific evidence shows that short sleep duration is critically linked to obesity in pediatric samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>). However, there is sparse research on a possible difference in this association between children and adolescents in the present literature. The enhancement of understanding the association is needed to clarify the following issues. The degree of this association may weaken with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512450582">Patel &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>), thus signifying that the strength of the association between the two conditions varies by developmental stages (i.e., childhood and adolescence). Also, the shape of the association may vary by life stage. Currently, the literature suggests that the link between sleep duration and obesity is either U-shaped or negatively linear, although the latter contour is more pronounced among the pediatric population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>). Lastly, the direct comparison of findings across studies has been difficult because of different measures and study designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512450582">Patel &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>). In order to investigate the aforementioned issues, this study aims to explore the association between sleep duration and body mass index (BMI) between childhood and adolescence. More specifically, this study examines the shape of the relationships between sleep length and BMI, and the difference in the strength of association between the two samples.</p>

<title>Study Design and Data</title>
<p>This study analyzed nationally representative secondary data from the Korean Survey on the Obesity of Youth and Children (KSOYC). The current research has been certified as exempt from the Institutional Review Board review of the Kyung Hee University, given the use of de-identified secondary data. The KSOYC was conducted in 2009 by the National Youth Policy Institute. The purpose of the KSOYC was (a) to monitor health and lifestyles among South Korean children and adolescents for a better understanding of their health and lifestyles and (b) to gather information that can be used for developing policies to improve their future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059840512450582">The National Youth Policy Institute in South Korea [NYPI], 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A sample was selected from the South Korean population of 4th–6th grade elementary school students, and middle and high school students (i.e., 7th–12th graders in the United States) using stratified cluster sampling. In this study, schools and the territorial districts of South Korea were used as clusters and strata, respectively. The number of participants in each of the 12 administrative districts was proportional to the student population in the stratum. For approximately 3 months from June to September 2009, trained research staff members visited schools chosen for this study and two staff members interviewed each student in person in order to gather precise information. Information collected included demographics, weight and height, depressive feelings, body image, attempts to lose weight, perceived quality of life, and lifestyles (e.g., eating habits, physical activities, and sleep duration). The total number of subjects was 10,156 (<italic>N</italic> = 2,964 in elementary school; <italic>N</italic> = 3,658 in middle school; and <italic>N</italic> = 3,534 in high school; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059840512450582">NYPI, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Those older than 19 years were excluded from the samples based on the definition of adolescence. Although researchers have not yet reached a consensus on the definition of an adolescent, those aged 12–18 years are generally considered to be adolescents in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512450582">Ministry of Health and Welfare, n.d.</xref>). Participants younger than 19 years were divided into two samples, 2,499 children (those younger than 12 years) and 7,431 adolescents (those aged 12–18 years).</p>
<p>In the child sample, the mean age was 10.12 years and 50.18% of the respondents were male. The majority of the highest parental education level was either high school or college graduation (86.40%), and the majority of the respondents (91.47%) self-rated their economic status as average or higher. In the adolescent sample, the mean age was 14.68 years and 52.91% of the respondents were male. Like the sample of children, the majority of the highest parental education was either high school or college graduation (87.84%), and the majority of the respondents (77.03%) self-rated their economic status as average or higher (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512450582">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>BMI z score</title>
<p>BMI was calculated based on the self-reported height and weight. BMI was defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512450582">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512450582">Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). BMI has been a suitable proxy for adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512450582">Goodman, Hinden, &amp; Khandelwal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512450582">Hebebrand, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059840512450582">Zimmermann, Gubeli, Puntener, &amp; Molinari, 2004</xref>). However, BMI in childhood and adolescence is greatly affected by gender and age, and thus the consideration of the two conditions is essential in order to precisely measure adiposity levels at these developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512450582">Must &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>). In this study, BMI values were converted into <italic>z</italic> scores, which “is a function of standard deviation of the BMI distribution after it has been transformed into a normal distribution or approximately normal distribution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512450582">Flegal &amp; Ogden, 2011</xref>, p. 1605). BMI z-scores were calculated using South Korean age- and gender-specific pediatric values (i.e., LMS values). The LMS parameter refers to the power in the Box-Cox transformation (L), the median (M), and the generalized coefficient of variation (S). While BMI <italic>z</italic> scores and BMI percentile are equal in that mathematical conversion between the two is possible, this study determined to use BMI <italic>z</italic> scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512450582">Flegal &amp; Ogden, 2011</xref>). This is because BMI cutoff points for overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence have not been well defined in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512450582">Flegal &amp; Ogden, 2011</xref>), and BMI <italic>z</italic> score is more appropriate for statistical analysis when a continuous BMI measure is utilized (i.e., the feasibility of comparing findings across studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512450582">Must &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Eating habit</title>
<p>Five questions asking about the respondents’ eating habits (e.g., eating vegetables and fruits frequently, having regular meals, and having breakfasts) were used.

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>As the first step in the analytical process, the validity and reliability for measures with multiple questions (i.e., eating habit, depression, and self-esteem) were examined. For validity, an exploratory factor analysis was performed, and questions that were highly loaded on the extracted factor were utilized to create measures. Important factors were extracted after considering three criteria (i.e., a scree test, at least 10% of variance explained, and interpretability). For reliability, internal consistency was examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512450582">Hatcher, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>At the next step, mean BMIs across levels of sleep duration were calculated, and the shape of the association between the two conditions was compared in the two samples. Also, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine whether these mean BMIs differed significantly across sleep duration levels. The characteristics of unbalanced data were taken into consideration in implementing ANOVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512450582">Elliot, 1995</xref>).

<title>Relationship Between BMI and Sleep Duration</title>
<p>The mean BMI in childhood and adolescence was 18.23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 20.41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. According to World Health Organization, BMI <italic>z</italic> scores greater than 2 are considered to be overweight or obese among children and adolescents. In 176 (7.44%) children and in 429 (6.92%) adolescents, the BMI <italic>z</italic> score is greater than 2. The mean sleep duration in childhood and adolescence was 8.42 hours and 6.83 per night, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512450582">Table 1</xref>). Depending on the levels of sleep duration, the range of the mean BMIs was 17.91–18.61 among children and 19.67–21.09 among adolescents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840512450582">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059840512450582">2</xref>). In general, the associations between BMI and sleep duration in the two samples were negatively linear. In both samples, the findings of the ANOVA showed statistically significant differences in the mean BMI across sleep duration groups, <italic>F</italic>(3, 2315) = 6.73, <italic>p</italic> = .0002 among children and <italic>F</italic>(6, 6950) = 16.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001 among adolescents. This implies that both children and adolescents whose sleep duration at night is shorter are at greater risk for an increase in BMI.</p>

<title>The Negative Linear Association Between BMI and Sleep Duration</title>
<p>In this study, an inverse relationship between sleep duration and BMI was found in both childhood and adolescence. In general, this result is in line with the previous review studies predominantly suggesting that the association between the two conditions is negatively linear among young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512450582">Patel &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512450582">Taheri &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>). Moreover, a reverse dose–response association has been found in young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059840512450582">Taheri, 2006</xref>). This relationship appears not to be greatly affected by ethnicity or race because similar findings have been replicated in diverse countries (e.g., Australia, Japan, United States, and Canada; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512450582">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512450582">Knutson &amp; Van Cauter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512450582">Patel &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this study revealed the inverse linear relationship between the two conditions among children and adolescents, caution is advised in interpreting the findings. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall et al. (2008)</xref> suggest that young people may also be subject to the U-shape association but just cannot sleep long enough to obtain this U-shape pattern due to external factors (e.g., early school start times and late bedtime). Second, not all the studies currently propose a negative linear association among children. Also, the association between sleep and obesity among adolescents has not been thoroughly investigated and its nature is somewhat inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512450582">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512450582">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>). In summary, although empirical evidence generally supports the inverse relationship among young people, further research should be conducted to confirm that this relationship between the two conditions is valid.</p></sec>

<title>The Strong Association Between BMI <italic>z</italic> Score and Short Sleep Duration in Childhood and Adolescence</title>
<p>In this study, short sleep duration significantly increased BMI <italic>z</italic> score even after controlling for the other covariates in both samples. This result is congruent with the previous studies, which generally find a strong link between short sleep duration and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512450582">Biggs &amp; Dollman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512450582">Hart &amp; Jelalian, 2008</xref>). A causal association between the two conditions is not definitive in the literature because the majority of studies were cross sectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512450582">Bell &amp; Zimmerman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512450582">Hart, Cairns, &amp; Jelalian, 2011</xref>). However, some longitudinal research has found empirical evidence on the predictive effects of short sleep on obesity among children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512450582">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512450582">Hart &amp; Jelalian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512450582">Patel &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512450582">Snell, Adam, &amp; Duncan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The recent literature proposes three potential mechanisms explaining the link between short sleep duration and weight gain, which includes obesity (i.e., neuroendocrine regulation, energy expenditure, and behavior). First, regarding neuroendocrine regulation, the function of the orexigenic neuron is important because it is involved in the sustainment of arousal as well as the control of feeding. To maintain arousal, the cortical cortex and the ascending arousal system are activated, and in turn the sympathetic nerve activities are enhanced, which leads to decreased leptin release and augmented ghrelin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512450582">Darukhanavala &amp; Pannain, 2011</xref>). This hormonal change results in an increase in food cravings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512450582">Jones, Johnson, &amp; Harvey-Berino, 2008</xref>). Also, sleep loss is linked to an increase in serum C-reactive protein (CRP). It is known that CRP binds to leptin, and this means that free leptin, which elevates satiety, is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512450582">Darukhanavala &amp; Pannain, 2011</xref>). Second, physical activity levels diminish with sleep loss. Reduced physical activity can lessen activity-related energy expenditure, which plays a major role in maintaining the energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512450582">Darukhanavala &amp; Pannain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512450582">Hart et al., 2011</xref>). Third, short sleep duration may be associated with obesity through an alteration in young people’s eating behavior (e.g., food preferences, amounts, and mealtimes). They may eat more (a) in order to ease feelings of anxiety and depression, which are common in those whose sleep duration is insufficient, and (b) simply because there are more opportunities to eat due to the fact that there is more time awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512450582">Darukhanavala &amp; Pannain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512450582">Hart et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important finding to note in this study is that the degree of association between short sleep duration and BMI <italic>z</italic> score is stronger in childhood than in adolescence. This result is also in accordance with the literature showing that the influences of sleep duration on weight gain become weaker with age. This phenomenon (i.e., greater effects of sleep loss on weight gain among younger people) is consistently found in comparison to different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512450582">Biggs &amp; Dollman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512450582">Lytle, Pasch, &amp; Farbakhsh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512450582">Snell et al., 2007</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512450582">Biggs and Dollman (2007)</xref> directly compare the differences in the association between sleep duration and BMI between children and adolescents and conclude that this relationship is stronger in childhood. In a comparison of adolescent groups, the relationship between sleep duration and weight was strong among middle school students, while its effect among high school students was minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512450582">Lytle et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, this phenomenon is also replicated in comparison to child groups: Sleep duration has greater effects on weight in younger rather than older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512450582">Snell et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, there are some proposed mechanisms to explain the greater impact of short sleep duration on weight gain in childhood as compared to adolescence: (a) the larger effects of sleep duration on metabolic functions in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512450582">Biggs &amp; Dollman, 2007</xref>), (b) less adaptability to stressors (e.g., insufficient sleep) in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512450582">Lytle et al., 2011</xref>), and (c) the manifestation of puberty, which weakens the influences of sleep duration on weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512450582">Snell et al., 2007</xref>). However, the aforementioned reasons have not been thoroughly examined, and therefore future research should investigate the mechanisms triggering this phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1059840512450582">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>This study analyzed representative data, and thus the generalizability of the results could be assured. Another strength is the utilization of the identical research design and measures in the two samples, and thus the direct comparison of the findings between childhood and adolescence was feasible. The study limitations are mainly due to the use of secondary data. Because of the cross-sectional study design, it was not possible to explore causal inferences between sleep duration and BMI <italic>z</italic> score. Also, measurement errors for some of the variables might exist because they were measured with a single question (e.g., daily exercise and sedentary lifestyle) or a subjective question (i.e., perceived household economic status, self-reported BMI, and self-reported sleep duration). However, BMI-related measurement errors may not be a crucial problem, considering that the literature suggests that self-reported BMI measures are suitable for epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512450582">McAdams, Van Dam, &amp; Hu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840512450582">Spencer, Appleby, Davey, &amp; Key, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512450582">Stommel &amp; Schoenborn, 2009</xref>). In addition, best attempts (i.e., the use of exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency) were made for variables obtained from multiple questions in order to attain valid and reliable measures. Lastly, not all of the variables that may affect the association between sleep and BMI could be included in analysis due to a lack of information in the data. However, it was attempted to maximize the use of available information in the data. For example, a direct measure of a genetic influence was not available, and thus a perceived parental body shape was used as an alternative.</p>

<title>Implication for School Nursing Practice</title>
<p>School nurses should take note of the important function of sleep duration in young people’s weight control. As a preventive strategy targeting children and adolescents, school nurses should implement educational programs (e.g., the benefits of adequate sleep) so that they form and maintain healthy sleep habits (i.e., sufficient sleep duration). As an intervention strategy targeting obese children and youth, school nurses should consider educating young people on the importance of sleep (e.g., the significant relationship between sleep duration and BMI), identifying those whose sleep habits are unhealthy, and providing interventions to correct their undesirable habits. Considering the multifaceted nature of obesity, sleep-related interventions should be implemented after simultaneously taking into account other obesity-related factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840512450582">Moreno, Pigeot, &amp; Ahrens, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are three issues to note in order to achieve effective outcomes. First, the above approaches should be implemented as early as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512450582">Lytle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059840512450582">Van Cauter &amp; Knutson, 2008</xref>), considering the greater impact of sleep duration in early life and the difficulties in managing obesity after childhood. Second, parents of young people should be included as the targets of the aforementioned strategies, given the fact that parents have strong influences on children and adolescents in their children’s weight-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512450582">Haines, Neumark-Sztainer, Hannan, &amp; Robinson-O'Brien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512450582">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, while implementing interventions for obese children or adolescents, barriers to the programs (e.g., body consciousness) must be taken into consideration. For instance, body awareness and feelings of embarrassment may be reduced through physical activities, which focus on body parts (e.g., legs or arms), and body esteem can be improved through strategies reducing the value of appearance and weight (e.g., identifying and noticing the respectable characteristics of obese children and adolescents; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059840512450582">Zabinski, Saelens, Stein, Hayden-Wade, &amp; Wilfley, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The important findings in this study were (a) a negative linear relationship between sleep duration and BMI in childhood and adolescence, (b) a statistically significant association between short sleep duration and BMI <italic>z</italic> score in the two developmental stages, and (c) a greater influence of sleep on BMI <italic>z</italic> score in childhood than in adolescence. The above results may imply that short sleep duration among children and adolescents could serve as one of the critical risk factors for obesity. Future research should be directed toward resolving the following issues. First, the causal inference between short sleep duration and weight gain should be examined with a longitudinally designed research. Second, the negative linear relationship between sleep duration and weight gain among children and adolescents should be further examined. Also, reasons for the strong association between short sleep duration and weight gain should be investigated. Lastly, despite the accumulating empirical evidence showing that age affects the degree to which sleep duration influences weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512450582">Lytle et al., 2011</xref>), little is known about the reasons for this phenomenon. Thus, it is necessary to empirically investigate the replication of this phenomenon and to understand its mechanisms.</p>
