<p>The book’s concise and complete title highlights the fact that a society’s politeness can be understood partly by knowing what has gone before and partly by glimpses of its opposite. The historical period examined is mainly the 17th and 18th centuries, but also includes Chaucer. Data include more than the usual European sources, despite the apparently European origins of the nine contributors from Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>The editors’ introduction goes beyond a simple content summary, although it does have that. Culpeper and Kadar show the importance of the field (a sub-field of sociopragmatics), point to gaps waiting to be filled and describe existing research. As they suggest, understanding current politeness practices depends on knowing their wider, historical context, but the same is true in reverse. This chapter, like the others, has its own references. At about a third of the length of the actual chapter, the list signals the thoroughness of the research underpinning the book. The following eight chapters show variety in their summaries of existing literature, in the media they examine, in the detail of their research interests and in their investigative methods.</p>
<p>Literature reviews show the extent of existing research into beliefs, past and present, about the concept of politeness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612467254">Brown and Levinson (1987)</xref> continue to be the basis for many analyses, although not uncritically. Bax (Chapter 2), for example, refers to criticisms of their individualism and eurocentricity, while others mention the strengths and weaknesses of more recent major studies.</p>
<p>The media chosen for examination by the contributors also offer variety, sometimes within the same chapter. Some, like Bax with his 50 letters from a 17th-century writer, have put the magnifying glass on one type of discourse only, while others spread their nets wider. Fitzmaurice, for instance, looks at biographical material, newspapers, letters, history and a ‘treatise on polite conversation’ in 18th-century England. Kadar is interested in Chinese letters, and Nevala in 17th- and 18th-century English personal correspondence. King looks at 13 17th-century Spanish literary works: dramatic plays and comic interludes. Two of Jucker’s ‘snapshots’ are from the <italic>Canterbury Tales</italic> and one from 15th-century private correspondence. We must be thankful for the richness of handwritten, personal letters from those days. There are also suggestions for further investigations, such as Paternoster’s echo of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612467254">Richard Watts’s (1992)</xref> reference to politeness manuals.</p>
<p>Even more varied and detailed is the aspect of politeness which each contributor chooses to examine. Kadar, himself a Hungarian, looks at the denigration/elevation phenomenon in Chinese, which he illustrates with the Chinese script. Nevala tracks the use of the third person to refer to oneself in correspondence about helping someone’s son to get a scholarship to Oxford. Paternoster dedicates part of her study to ‘lower class’ people who behave to one another as ‘members of a close-knit in-group’ (p. 216). Of course, in good academic style, contributors mention the limitations of their own studies, some pointing out that they have examined only a fraction of the material available.</p>
<p>The research methods section of each chapter could suggest a basis for replication studies. The case study approach of Jucker is, as he says, a realistic alternative to ‘a comprehensive analysis of politeness issues in Middle English’ (p. 181). Bax consulted a number of letter-writing manuals, with titles such as <italic>Well-mannered Secretary</italic> (p. 50), then categorized the letters into four: letters to the ‘truly high and mighty’ (p. 52), to subordinates, to equals and to family members.</p>
<p>How have definitions of politeness changed over the years? In some ways the results of the studies seem less gripping than their research methods and content, although to scholars interested in one particular area of politeness it will, of course, be the results that count. Fitzmaurice builds on politeness theory to show ‘the transformation of politeness over the [18th] century from a model of social interaction to a rigid code of conduct that was rejected as insincere and hypocritical in the late eighteenth century’ (pp. 90–91). King’s study of Spanish in the Golden Age points out the complication brought about by ‘the introduction of a third address form into the binary system that had previously been in place’ (p. 257).</p>
<p>O’Driscoll starts his epilogue by mentioning his lack of knowledge of the times and places named in the studies. However, his publication on British culture and his other research interests suggest he is well placed to react to and summarize the book’s contents.</p>
<p>According to the editors, this book’s readers will be researchers, students and ‘a wider circle of scholars’ (p. 12). For these serious scholars of historical pragmatics/sociolinguistics, the relatively new <italic>Journal of Politeness Research</italic> adds to an ongoing understanding of this subject. Would it be facetious to suggest that since one of the editors (Culpeper) must by now have completed his three-year fellowship on impoliteness, that topic in turn could be the focus of a new journal? To the editors’ list of possible readers I would add tertiary lecturers in literature. Surely the analyses here of classical literature will provide fresh lecture material?</p>
<p>It is easy for a reviewer to point to gaps in a publication, but could it be that the readership would be even wider if future contributors to this fast-growing series, <italic>Linguistic Insights</italic>, were to include contributions from non-European scholars? As one example, many universities in South East Asia have a long tradition of studies in various sub-fields of linguistics. One final suggestion: this is a topic which could be of considerable interest to the general public. If one or more of the writers wanted to prepare a popular book on this fascinating subject, it would surely have a wide readership.</p>
