        <p>How people perceive the nature of a hazardous substance may determine how they respond
          when potentially exposed to it. We tested a new Perceptions AbouT Hazardous Substances
          (PATHS) questionnaire. In Study 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 21), we assessed the face validity
          of items concerning perceptions about eight properties of a hazardous substance. In Study
          2 (<italic>N</italic> = 2030), we tested the factor structure, reliability and validity of
          the PATHS questionnaire across four qualitatively different substances. In Study 3
            (<italic>N</italic> = 760), we tested the impact of information provision on Perceptions
          AbouT Hazardous Substances scores. Our results showed that our eight measures demonstrated
          good reliability and validity when used for non-contagious hazards.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Accidents or disasters involving the sudden exposure of large numbers of people to a
        hazardous substance are common. How members of the public react during such incidents plays
        a large role in determining their overall impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312459096">Wray et al., 2008</xref>). For example, low uptake of
        emergency prophylaxis during an anthrax incident (e.g. SteelFisher et al., 2011),
        unnecessary mass evacuation away from a nuclear reactor (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312459096">Ziegler et al., 1981</xref>), surges of unaffected people
        seeking treatment at hospital during an infectious disease outbreak (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312459096">Chang et al., 2004</xref>) and the long-term
        avoidance and stigmatisation of community members following a radiological incident (e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312459096">Petterson, 1988</xref>) have all
        previously been observed and are likely to hamper a population’s short- and long-term
        recovery from a disaster. However, these reactions can vary widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312459096">Rogers et al., 2007</xref>). Existing theories of risk
        perception provide some explanation for this, with two factors often singled out as
        important: a person’s perceptions about how likely they are to be affected and their
        perceptions about how severe any effects will be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312459096">Brewer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312459096">Leppin and Aro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312459096">Markon et al., 2011</xref>). While undoubtedly important, a
        narrow focus on perceptions of severity and likelihood is of limited usefulness to those who
        need to communicate with the public during a major incident. From their perspective,
        understanding why people believe that they are likely to encounter a hazard and why they
        believe that its effects are severe or are not severe is more important, as it may provide a
        better indication of what issues to address when talking to an affected community.</p>
      <p>Other models of risk perception propose a broader range of determinants for how people
        respond to risks. For example, 15 characteristics were proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312459096">Slovic (1987)</xref> as differentiating risks that people
        are likely to accept from those that cause controversy. Many of these characteristics were
        properties of the hazard itself; is it observable, for example, or are its effects delayed?
        Although providing a more fine-grained approach to understanding risk perception, these
        characteristics were not specifically designed with a sudden major public health incident in
        mind.</p>
      <p>Designing a questionnaire to assess the perceptions that people hold about a major incident
        would be useful in advancing our understanding of behavioural and emotional responses to
        these events. Although many categories of perceptions might be important, one set of
        perceptions that is particularly relevant is how an individual views the innate properties
        of a hazardous substance itself. In this article, we report three studies in which we tested
        a new questionnaire, which assesses Perceptions AbouT Hazardous Substances (‘PATHS’).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-1359105312459096">
      <title>Study 1: piloting</title>
      <p>In order to determine the types of perception that should be included in the PATHS, we
        reviewed previous qualitative studies that have explored how people perceive the risks
        associated with a hazardous substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312459096">Cava et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312459096">Etchegary et
          al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312459096">Glik et al.,
          2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312459096">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312459096">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312459096">Palinkas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312459096">Rubin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312459096">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312459096">Stein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312459096">Wray et al., 2008</xref>). Nine categories occurred
        repeatedly in this literature as reflecting the main relevant beliefs: perceptions about the
          <italic>severity of the health effects</italic> that a substance can trigger, the
        difficulty that people can experience in <italic>differentiating the symptoms</italic>
        caused by a hazard from those of other common illnesses, the possibility of a
          <italic>latency period</italic> between exposure to a substance and the appearance of the
        first symptoms, the potential for exposure to cause <italic>hidden harm</italic> that may
        not become apparent for many years, the <italic>ease or difficulty of detecting
          exposure</italic>, the perceived <italic>mechanisms</italic> through which a substance can
        exert its effects, the perception that a hazardous substance exerts severe effects on
        specific <italic>at-risk groups</italic>, the perceived <italic>environmental
          persistence</italic> of a substance and an overarching sense of <italic>uncertainty or
          mystery</italic> that people feel about hazardous substances.</p>
      <sec id="section3-1359105312459096">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>We generated 56 items to cover our nine domains, guided by our literature review and by
          adapting items from the Revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (IPQ-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312459096">Moss-Morris et al., 2002</xref>), which
          measures some related concepts. Items were formulated as statements with responses ranging
          from strongly disagree (scored as 1) to strongly agree (5). Most items were intended to be
          combined into scales. However, perceptions relating to the mechanisms of action of a
          substance were measured using single items.</p>
        <p>We piloted the items with a convenience sample of 21 participants recruited by sending an
          invitation e-mail to our institution’s database of research volunteers (age range: 18 to
          72 years; 14 female; 14 White British). Each was asked to consider one of four substances
          during a 30-minute telephone interview: polonium 210, anthrax, swine flu or carbon
          monoxide. These reflected qualitatively different substances that we expected participants
          to have some awareness of because they have been widely discussed in the British media
          following the Alexander Litvinenko affair, the US anthrax attacks, the 2009/2010 flu
          pandemic and public health campaigns about carbon monoxide. We asked participants to
          complete the PATHS for their selected hazard and to explain each answer or rephrase each
          question in their own words. Items that appeared difficult to understand were revised
          after every fourth interview. Ethical approval for this and all other studies was given by
          the King’s College London Research Ethics Committee.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section4-1359105312459096">
        <title>Results and discussion</title>
        <p>We made several minor clarifications to item wording during the piloting. Piloting also
          revealed two more problematic issues. First, creating items to assess environmental
          persistence proved challenging, as persistence is a property of both the substance and the
          prevailing environmental conditions. We, therefore, made these questions conditional on a
          substance remaining within a stable environment. Second, it became apparent that questions
          about the ease with which someone could detect a substance needed to be qualitatively
          different when asked about a contagious disease, where concern focuses on detecting people
          who pose a risk. Our revised items are given in supplementary file 1.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section5-1359105312459096">
      <title>Study 2: reliability and validity</title>
      <p>In Study 2, four groups of participants completed the PATHS with respect to polonium 210,
        carbon monoxide, anthrax or swine flu. Responses were given at two time-points and were used
        to test the factor structure, internal consistency and test–retest reliability of the
        scales. For the questionnaire’s validity, we hypothesised that scores would differ depending
        on what substance was being considered. We also hypothesised that scores would not simply
        reflect a stable personality trait and therefore tested their correlation with a measure of
        trait affect. To assess whether different hazardous substances trigger different levels of
        concern because of differences in the way people perceive them, we tested whether perception
        scores mediated any difference between the four substances in terms of how worried a
        participant felt someone should be if exposed to them. We predicted that any differences in
        worry between the four substances would be reduced once differences in the PATHS scores were
        controlled for.</p>

        <sec id="section7-1359105312459096">
          <title>Participants</title>
          <p>Participants were members of an online panel maintained by the market research company
            Ipsos MORI. All were aged 16 years or more.</p>

          <title>Questions</title>
          <p>Participants first completed our items in relation to polonium 210, carbon monoxide,
            anthrax or swine flu. Items were presented in a random order. Participants were then
            asked how worried someone should be if they were exposed to the substance in question
            for the first time and felt ill 3 days later and if they were exposed to the substance
            for the first time and felt fine for the next 3 days. Responses could range from 0 (not
            at all worried) to 7 (extremely worried). Finally, participants completed the 10-item
            short form of the trait positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312459096">Thompson, 2007</xref>)).</p>

          <title>Procedure</title>
          <p>Potential participants were sent an email invitation for a survey about ‘health risks’.
            Those who gave consent were allocated at random to one of the four versions of the
            survey, reminded of a previous incident involving their allocated substance and asked
            whether, before today, they had ever seen or heard anything about it. Those who had not
            previously heard of it were excluded. The remainder completed the first survey (time 1)
            immediately. After 1 week, participants were asked to complete a second identical survey
            (time 2). Recruitment for each version of the questionnaire was halted after 500
            participants had completed it at time 1, a sample size which would allow us an adequate
            participant to item ratio for an exploratory factor analysis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="section10-1359105312459096">
          <title>Analysis</title>
          <p>We used exploratory factor analysis to assess the clustering of items that were
            intended for use as scales. This was performed separately for each version of the
            questionnaire, using time 1 data. We used principal axis factoring, examined scree plots
            to determine how many factors to extract and performed oblique rotation using direct
            oblimin. Pattern matrices for the four versions of the questionnaire were compared in
            order to identify items that consistently loaded onto the extracted factors across the
            different versions. We interpreted items that tended to load 0.45 or higher across
            versions as representing a factor. Factor scores were calculated by taking the mean of
            those items that loaded onto them, with items reverse scored where required. Internal
            reliability was tested by checking for adequate Cronbach’s alphas (between 0.7 and
            0.90), item-total correlations and inter-item correlations (between 0.2 and 0.9 for
            both) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312459096">Streiner and Norman,
              2008</xref>). Test–retest reliability was calculated using intra-class coefficients
            for scales and linearly weighted kappa coefficients for individual items.</p>
          <p>Validity was assessed by testing whether the results for the scales and individual
            items differed between the questionnaire versions (using analyses of variance and
              <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> tests) and whether the scales or individual items
            correlated with trait affect. We also tested whether the scales and individual items
            mediated any difference between the four questionnaire versions with respect to worry by
            using binary logistic regressions to assess the impact of including perceptions as
            potential mediators.</p>

          <p>Preliminary factor analyses identified inconsistent loadings for those items that were
            intended to measure environmental persistence. These were removed from all the further
            analyses. Re-running the factor analyses suggested the presence of six (polonium 210,
            carbon monoxide, anthrax) or five (swine flu) factors, accounting for between 47.4 per
            cent and 50.5 per cent of the variance. The pattern matrix for each version is given in
            supplementary files 2 to 5.</p>
          <p>Loadings for the six factors in the polonium 210, carbon monoxide and anthrax versions
            were similar. They related to perceptions that the hazard would cause serious health
            effects (loaded on by six items), the potential for hidden harm (five items), the
            difficulty in differentiating health effects from those caused by other illnesses (three
            items), the ease of detecting exposure (three items), the mysterious nature of the
            hazard (four items) and the existence of at-risk groups (six items). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312459096">Table 1</xref> shows the Cronbach’s
            alphas, item-total correlations and inter-item correlations for these scales, all of
            which were acceptable. Because Cronbach’s alpha exceeded 0.90 for the ‘existence of
            at-risk groups’ scale in all three versions of the questionnaire, we reduced it to four
            items while retaining acceptable levels of internal consistency. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312459096">Table 2</xref> shows the results for the test–retest

            the various questionnaire versions for every scale and individual item, excluding those
            swine flu scales that could not be compared because of their different compositions. The
            differences were logical. The two more unusual hazards (polonium 210 and anthrax) were
            seen as being more mysterious and as more likely to cause serious or hidden health
            effects than carbon monoxide and swine flu. Polonium 210 was rated as more difficult to
            detect than carbon monoxide or anthrax. Carbon monoxide, which generally causes flu-like
            symptoms, was rated as having symptoms that are more difficult to distinguish from other
            common causes than polonium 210 or anthrax. Swine flu was rated as being most likely to
            have clearly identifiable ‘at-risk’ groups, in accordance with recent advertising
            campaigns in the United Kingdom, urging at-risk groups to be vaccinated. The different
            perceptions about mechanisms were also logical: carbon monoxide was rated as most likely
            to affect you by being breathed in; polonium 210, anthrax and swine flu, but not carbon
            monoxide, were seen as risks if present on food, though swine flu was seen as less risky
            if the food was cooked; polonium 210 and anthrax were seen as risky if touched and swine
            flu was seen as particularly likely to be passed on by coughs or sneezes. Finally, the
            latency between exposure and the first symptoms appearing was logical, with carbon
            monoxide being seen by most participants as having an immediate effect (&lt;24 hours:
            66.1%), polonium 210 and anthrax as taking between 24 hours and 2 days to have an effect
            (endorsed by 41.5% and 42.3% of respondents, respectively) and swine flu as taking
            either from 24 hours to 2 days (56.8%) or between 3 and 6 days (30.9%) to take
            effect.</p>

          <title>Association with worry</title>
          <p>The two worry scores were strongly correlated (r = .70, p &lt; .001). We combined them
            by taking the mean. Because the mean showed negative skew, we recoded it into scores of
            0–4 (low worry) and 4.5–7 (high worry). There was a significant difference in the level
            of worry that participants felt someone should feel after exposure to the hazards
              (χ<sup>2</sup> = 490.23, df = 3, p &lt; .001). More people felt that exposure to
            polonium 210 or anthrax should lead to a high level of worry (80.8% and 82.6%,
            respectively) than exposure to carbon monoxide or swine flu (36.1% and 30.5%). Post hoc
            tests showed no significant difference between polonium 210 and anthrax (χ<sup>2</sup> =
            0.54, df = 1, p = .52) or between carbon monoxide and swine flu (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.55,
            df = 1, p = .06)</p>
          <p>To assess whether PATHS scores mediated the differences, we compared polonium 210 with
            carbon monoxide and anthrax with carbon monoxide. A binary logistic regression confirmed
            that polonium 210 was associated with more worry than carbon monoxide (odds ratio (OR) =
            7.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.61–9.94). With all PATHS measures included in the
            regression, this association was reduced, but remained significant (adjusted OR (aOR) =
            2.56, CI = 1.61–4.08). Only three PATHS measures showed a significant association with
            worry in the regression: the perception that the health effects of exposure were severe
            (aOR = 2.47, CI = 1.89–3.24), the perception that exposure might cause hidden health
            effects (aOR = 1.68, CI = 1.26–2.26) and the perception that the hazard could affect
            health if touched (aOR = 1.26, CI = 1.03–1.54). We observed a similar pattern of results
            when comparing anthrax and carbon monoxide. An initial regression confirmed the
            difference in terms of worry (OR = 8.41, CI = 6.28–11.27), which was reduced when PATHS
            measures were entered (aOR = 2.48, CI = 1.59–3.87). The only perception variables that
            showed a significant association with worry were the perceptions that the health effects
            of exposure were severe (aOR = 2.24, CI = 1.69–2.97), that exposure might cause hidden
            health effects (aOR = 1.53, CI = 1.15–2.03) and that someone’s health could be affected
            by being coughed or sneezed on by a person who was ill (aOR = 1.44, CI = 1.15–1.78).</p>

      <title>Study 3: effect of information provision</title>
      <p>In Study 3, we tested whether PATHS scores were amendable to change by providing three
        groups of participants with three different types of information about carbon monoxide
        before asking them to complete the PATHS. We hypothesised that, in comparison to a control
        condition, information that emphasised the severity of the health effects caused by carbon
        monoxide would specifically elevate perceptions relating to severity, while information that
        emphasised the possibility of chronic health issues would raise perceptions that carbon
        monoxide causes hidden health effects and reduce perceptions that the first symptoms become
        apparent soon after exposure. As an additional test of the role of perceptions in
        determining levels of concern about a hazardous substance, we also assessed whether our
        information had any impact on levels of worry.</p>

            to evaluate the whole survey using five items, which asked for their opinion on overall
            satisfaction, survey topic, language/grammar, the time spent to complete the survey and
            question formulation and the instructions given. Response options used the colloquial

            receive one of the three information passages regarding carbon monoxide (see
            supplementary file 6). The first acted as our control condition and described how carbon
            monoxide is produced. The second focused on the severity of the health effects caused by
            carbon monoxide (severe information condition). The third focused on the possibility
            that poisoning could give rise to health effects months or years after exposure (chronic
            information condition).</p>

        <title>Results and discussion</title>
        <p>Each condition was completed by 253 or 254 participants. There were no differences
          between the groups in terms of the proportion of women (48.8%;
            <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .97), mean age (41.2

          or highest educational qualification (10% postgraduate degree, 36.5% bachelor’s degree,
          23.7% A-level, 8.3% vocational qualification, 21.5% General Certificate of Secondary

            <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 9.8, <italic>p</italic> = .28).</p>
        <p>The data for each condition showed an identical six-factor structure, replicating that in
          Study 2 (data not shown).</p>
        <p>There were significant differences between the three groups in terms of their perceptions
          about the severity of carbon monoxide poisoning (<italic>F</italic>(2, 757) = 25.67,
            <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the likelihood of it causing hidden health effects
            (<italic>F</italic>(2, 757) = 143.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the difficulty of
          discriminating the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning from other conditions
            (<italic>F</italic>(2, 757) = 19.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the latency of
          the first symptoms following exposure (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 25.05, df = 12,
            <italic>p</italic> = .02). Post hoc Tukey’s tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1359105312459096">Table 4</xref>) revealed that the severe information
          condition resulted in increased perceptions of the severity of carbon monoxide poisoning
          compared to both the chronic and control conditions, and that the chronic information
          condition (which also mentioned some health effects of exposure) increased perceptions of
          severity in comparison to the control information. The chronic information condition
          resulted in higher perceptions that carbon monoxide might cause hidden health effects than
          either of the other conditions and reduced the number of people who felt that the first
          effects of carbon monoxide poisoning would appear within 24 hours. Finally, while
          emphasising the severe nature of the effects of carbon monoxide made people feel that its
          effects are easy to distinguish from those resulting from other causes, our chronic
          information condition had the opposite effect.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The PATHS questionnaire provides reliable, valid measures of the perceptions people hold
        about the properties of non-contagious hazardous substances. Study 1 demonstrated that the
        questions are readily understood and can be applied to any hazardous substance with only
        minor rewording. Study 2 demonstrated that our attempt to produce a measure of the
        environmental persistence of a hazardous substance was unsuccessful. This was probably
        because of the range of factors (including prevailing environmental conditions) that
        determine persistence. However, our other items clustered as expected for the three
        non-contagious hazards, producing scales that were internally consistent and had good
        test–retest reliability. Test–retest reliability for our single-item measures was lower,
        though still comparable to that for similar items designed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312459096">Barr et al., 2008</xref>). Face validity for the measures
        relating to non-contagious hazards was established in Study 1, while their lack of
        association with measures of trait affect (Study 2), their ability to discriminate between
        different types of hazard (Study 2) and their amenability to change when people were
        presented with different types of information (Study 3) all add weight to their
        validity.</p>
      <p>Although the PATHS questionnaire performed well for non-contagious hazards, this was not
        true when we used it to assess perceptions of swine flu. This may reflect a deeper
        distinction in the way people perceive contagious and non-contagious hazards. While
        non-contagious agents are often seen as separable from a person and as present in the
        environment, people may find it difficult to appreciate the difference between a virus or
        bacteria and the contagious disease that it causes. Although we tried to make this explicit
        by asking participants to consider ‘the germs that cause swine flu’, it is possible that
        people were still thinking about the illness when responding. Additional research to explore
        and measure the perceptions that people hold about contagious illnesses would be justified,
        for example, how contagious the illness is and how it can be contracted.</p>
      <p>Despite this, our questionnaire fills a gap that exists in our ability to understand
        perceptions during a major public health incident involving a non-contagious hazardous
        substance. At present, research in this field focuses on assessing the perceived severity of
        being exposed to a given substance and the perceived likelihood of being exposed to it.
        Assessing perceptions about the nature of the substance causing the risk has been neglected
        by researchers. This is surprising. Although a person’s ‘mental model’ of an external threat
        can determine whether or not they take protective actions in relation to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312459096">Morgan et al., 2001</xref>), a questionnaire
        to assess the more common themes within these perceptions has, until now, been unavailable.
        The availability of the PATHS questionnaire should help communicators to understand whether
        members of the public hold perceptions about a given substance that are substantially out of
        step with scientific knowledge, and whether those perceptions are, in turn, associated with
        levels of worry or changes in behaviour. By targeting perceptions that are associated with
        the outcomes of interest, using messages that are designed following best practices in risk
        communication (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312459096">Wray et al.,
          2008</xref>), it may be possible to promote more adaptive responses to an incident
        involving hazardous materials.</p>
      <p>Evidence that PATHS do indeed partly determine responses to them can be found in our own
        Study 2, with the association between a hazard and ratings about how worried someone should
        feel once exposed to it being substantially reduced once perceptions about the hazard were
        controlled for. On the other hand, experimentally manipulating perceptions in Study 3 did
        not affect levels of worry. It is possible, then, that there is no causal association
        between the perceptions we assessed and worry, or that a person’s emotional response
        determines their initial perceptions about a hazard until detailed information about it has
        been received. Alternatively, it is possible that the failure of our information to affect
        levels of worry was due to the artificial nature of our survey, which may have encouraged
        participants to process information at a relatively shallow level. Had our information
        related to a risk that was of greater relevance to the participant, it might have resulted
        in more systematic processing, resulting in changes in worry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312459096">Trumbo, 1999</xref>).</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The ability to measure perceptions that members of the public hold about the properties of
        a hazardous substance should help communicators judge how best to target their messages
        during a public health incident. We hope that the PATHS questionnaire will facilitate
        this.</p>
