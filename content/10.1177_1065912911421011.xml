<abstract>
<p>The vetting of potential federal judges by the Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association (ABA) is politically controversial. Conservatives allege the Standing Committee is biased against Republican nominees. The ABA and its defenders argue the ABA rates nominees objectively based on their qualifications. The authors investigate whether accusations of liberal bias have merit. They analyze all individuals nominated to the U.S. Courts of Appeals from 1977 to 2008. Using genetic matching methods and ordered logit models, the authors find evidence of bias against Republican nominees in the ABA’s ratings. They conclude by discussing the implications of these results.</p>

<body>
<p>The American Bar Association (ABA) has evaluated the professional qualifications of federal judicial nominees for more than fifty years. Presidents routinely sent the names of potential nominees to the ABA prior to nomination until 2001, when President George W. Bush removed the ABA’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary from this function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911421011">1</xref></sup> On March 17, 2009, President Barack Obama invited the ABA to return to its long-standing role.</p>
<p>These decisions by Bush and Obama to alter the ABA’s participation in judicial selection prompted renewed debate about the proper role of the ABA and whether its Standing Committee favors prospective liberal jurists over their conservative counterparts. Bush’s decision followed frequent accusations by conservatives of liberal bias in the ABA’s ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421011">Howlett 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911421011">Murray 2001</xref>). Although those sympathetic to the ABA’s review process praised President Obama’s decision, it also prompted a revival of these criticisms by his detractors.</p>
<p>Concerns over ABA ratings reflect the growing politicization of lower court appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421011">Goldman 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911421011">Scherer 2005</xref>). Senators increasingly scrutinize lower court nominees, and presidents expend political capital to see controversial nominees confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421011">Scherer, Bartels, and Steigerwalt 2008</xref>). This rise in scrutiny is concurrent with efforts by presidents to appoint jurists with policy preferences similar to their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421011">Goldman 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911421011">Scherer 2005</xref>). Given the revival of concerns about potential bias in the ABA’s ratings, we investigate what factors explain the ratings of nominees to the U.S. Courts of Appeals from 1977 to 2008, including whether Republican and/or conservative nominees are disadvantaged.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911421011">
<title>The ABA and Its Evaluation of Judicial Candidates</title>
<p>Presidents have asked the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary to evaluate potential appointees prior to nomination since the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421011">Grossman 1965</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911421011">2</xref></sup> Depending on their goals and the perceived ideological inclinations of the Standing Committee, presidents have sought to enhance or minimize its role in the process. President Carter, in his quest to increase the representativeness of the federal bench, created the Circuit Judge Nominating Commission and pushed the ABA to relax its standards as to the minimum number of years of legal experience a nominee needed to be deemed Qualified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911421011">3</xref></sup> The ABA thus described their role under Carter as less of a screening commission and more of “a post-selection check” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911421011">Slotnick 1983a</xref>, 353). The Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations reduced the influence of the ABA by submitting the names of nominees, unlike previous presidents, after their selection but prior to their formal nomination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421011">Goldman 1997</xref>, 323-27). During this period, concerns were raised that the ABA unfairly judged conservative candidates, with Attorney General William Barr threatening to remove the ABA from the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421011">Rutkus 1995</xref>, 56).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911421011">4</xref></sup> President Clinton, on the other hand, alerted the ABA when potential nominees were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911421011">Wilson 2003</xref>, 32). In 2001, the Standing Committee was removed from the presidential vetting process altogether by President Bush. Finally, President Obama restored the ABA’s former role in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421011">Lewis 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Standing Committee evaluates nominees’ (1) professional competence, (2) integrity, and (3) judicial temperament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911421011">5</xref></sup> In evaluating professional competence, the committee assesses the potential jurist’s legal experience. Its guidelines state that “ordinarily a nominee to the federal bench should have at least twelve years experience in the practice of law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421011">ABA 2009</xref>, 3). Courtroom and trial experience as a lawyer or trial judge is considered, as is participation in administrative proceedings, arbitration, or law school instruction. Evaluations of integrity and judicial temperament are more subjective. The guidelines include “character and general reputation” among the criteria for integrity and “compassion, decisiveness, open-mindedness, courtesy, patience, freedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice under the law” as indicators of temperament. Critics argue that opinions about character may be colored by ideology, as might views about compassion, open-mindedness, and bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911421011">Ross 1990</xref>). We focus primarily on the influence of competence and ideology on nominees’ ratings, as both integrity and temperament are difficult to measure systematically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911421011">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each nominee receives a single rating reflecting the ABA’s evaluation of these three criteria, either Well Qualified, Qualified, or Not Qualified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911421011">7</xref></sup> Well Qualified individuals are expected to be exceptional, Qualified candidates are predicted to perform satisfactorily, and Not Qualified nominees fail to meet the committee’s minimum standards. If the vote is split, the chair reports “that the nominee received a certain rating from either a majority (8-9 members) or substantial majority (10-13 members) of the committee and notes that a minority gave the nominee another rating or ratings. The majority rating represents the committee’s official rating of the nominee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421011">ABA 2009</xref>, 6). Only the final rating is released publicly.</p>

<title>Evaluating the Ratings of the ABA’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary</title>
<p>Political debates about the role of the ABA in the evaluation of judicial nominees have inspired scholarly studies since the 1960s. In his seminal book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421011">Grossman (1965</xref>, 126) noted that the process was “clearly susceptible to misuse.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911421011">Slotnick (1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911421011">1983b</xref>) conducted the first empirical studies, which examined the effect of background characteristics on the ratings of Carter nominees during the 96th Congress. He found nominees’ race, gender, caliber of legal education, clerkships, publications, and legal experience influenced their ratings.</p>
<p>More recently, scholarly interest in ABA ratings was revived when the Bush administration removed the ABA from the vetting process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421011">Haire’s (2001)</xref> study of nominees confirmed to the Courts of Appeals between 1977 and 1994 substantiated many of Slotnick’s findings. She found that more judicial or legal experience increased the likelihood of receiving a Well Qualified rating and that female and minority nominees received lower ratings.</p>
<p>Empirical tests of partisan bias also emerged at this time, along with debates over how to test for such bias. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421011">Lindgren (2001)</xref> examined the ABA ratings of George H. W. Bush’s and Clinton’s confirmed Courts of Appeals nominees. He concluded the ABA was biased against Bush nominees who lacked judicial experience but that those with judicial experience received similar or higher ratings than comparable Clinton nominees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911421011">Saks and Vidmar (2001)</xref> criticized Lindgren for analyzing only confirmed nominees, offering broad claims about bias in the ABA’s ratings, and drawing conclusions from anecdotal evidence unsupported by model results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421011">Lott (2001)</xref> conducted an assessment using the same nominees as Lindgren and found that Lindgren’s results were not replicated when using more sophisticated control variables. Lott concluded that it is impossible to determine whether bias exists given the limited data. Interestingly, he found that racial characteristics have more influence than partisanship, with white Republicans rated highly but African American Republicans having a low probability of being rated Well Qualified. Lott noted that this combination could be capturing other factors related to nominee quality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911421011">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ABA’s return to its former role necessitates a new examination of these bias claims. We address and correct weaknesses in prior studies, the most problematic of which are omissions that bias the sample, such as examining only confirmed nominees. We overcome these flaws by examining all nominees to the U.S. Courts of Appeals rated by the ABA and by utilizing more appropriate econometric models. We also investigate a longer time frame, 1977 to 2008, during which policy-based appointments were becoming routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911421011">Scherer 2005</xref>) and controversy over judicial confirmations increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421011">Scherer, Bartels, and Steigerwalt 2008</xref>). Finally, we use genetic matching methods to preprocess the data before estimating our statistical models to address whether a causal relationship exists between party and ABA ratings, a link not established satisfactorily in prior research. Earlier studies identified a statistically significant relationship between party of the appointing president and ABA rating. However, these studies used unbalanced data, meaning that they did not necessarily compare similar nominees.</p>
<p>We focus on the U.S. Courts of Appeals for practical and theoretical reasons. Circuit court nominees are more diverse and plentiful than Supreme Court nominees, facilitating empirical analysis. They are also substantively different from district court nominees, with significant opportunities to influence law and policy that are seldom available to trial judges. Legislators and interest groups also view circuit and district nominees differently: the former are monitored more closely and challenged more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421011">Scherer, Bartels, and Steigerwalt 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1065912911421011">
<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>
<p>We present two competing views of the ABA’s vetting process, the <italic>professional theory</italic> and the <italic>political theory</italic>, which reflect different characterizations of how the ABA evaluates prospective judges. The professional theory asserts that the Standing Committee evaluates potential judges by considering only qualifications related to past employment and experience, without regard for partisan affiliation or ideology. Alternatively, the political theory suggests political factors influence ratings received by prospective judges. In other words, the political theory contends that a nominee whose ideological orientation is objectionable to the Standing Committee—presumably a conservative nominee in the modern era—will receive a lower rating than a nominee with similar qualifications whose ideological orientation is more liberal. Proponents of the ABA’s role in judicial selection argue the professional theory rings true; opponents assert that the political theory is more accurate.</p>
<p>Among the criteria defined in the Standing Committee’s guidelines is professional experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421011">Grossman (1965</xref>, 112) explains that judicial experience is most important to evaluators, followed by trial practice, success in legal academia, public service, and political credentials. Therefore, the <italic>more years an individual has served as a judge, the higher his or her ABA rating is predicted to be</italic>. However, the ABA may not view all previous judicial experience as equal. In particular, the ABA may weigh more heavily previous federal district court experience and the fact that these nominees have previously been vetted both by the ABA and the U.S. Senate. We count separately the number of years each nominee served as a state court judge and as a federal district court judge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911421011">9</xref></sup> in addition, <italic>the more years of legal experience in one’s background, the higher the ABA rating one is predicted to receive</italic>. The ABA likely does not view all legal experience equally. The ABA’s guidelines specify that the courtroom and litigation experience of former prosecutors are highly valued. We categorize each nominee’s legal experience by the number of years spent in private practice and as a prosecuting attorney.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911421011">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Standing Committee considers a background in legal academia to be a suitable substitute for courtroom experience. It is not, however, preferred over practical experience. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421011">Haire (2001)</xref> did not discover an association between ABA ratings and employment as a law professor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421011">Goldman (1997</xref>, 343) reports that law professors nominated by Reagan received lower ratings than other Reagan nominees. Legal academics may also receive lower ratings as a result of provocative writings or statements, as famously occurred in Robert Bork’s nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court. Thus, we anticipate that <italic>judicial candidates employed as law professors will receive lower ABA ratings than those with other legal backgrounds</italic>. Completion of a judicial clerkship further indicates professional competence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421011">Lott (2001)</xref> found that former clerks for federal appeals court judges are more likely to receive a Well Qualified rating. Accordingly, we expect that <italic>individuals who served as law clerks for a federal appellate court judge are likely to receive higher ABA ratings than those who did not</italic>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, political factors may influence nominees’ ABA ratings. Critics suggest the ABA has a bias against conservative nominees and cite as evidence the liberal positions taken by the ABA House of Delegates on issues such as abortion and capital punishment, as well as the Standing Committee’s practice during the 1980s of soliciting input from liberally oriented interest groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421011">Rutkus 1995</xref>, 44-56). Conservatives also contend that the emphasis on compassion, sensitivity, and equal justice in determining a nominee’s “judicial temperament” may indicate an inclination for liberal leanings. For example, the four members of the ABA who rated Judge Robert Bork as Not Qualified cited concerns about his “compassion, open-mindedness . . . [and] sensitivity to the rights of women and minority persons or groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421011">Wermiel 1987</xref>, A25), leading many conservatives to criticize the ABA’s ratings process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421011">Curriden 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912911421011">Torry 1996</xref>). Proponents of the political theory also assume that individuals nominated by Democrats are more liberal than those nominated by Republicans. Thus, if the political theory is correct, then <italic>potential judges whose names were submitted by Democratic presidents should, all else being equal, receive higher ABA ratings than nominees chosen by Republican presidents</italic>. Alternatively, the Standing Committee may respond to partisan activism. Potential nominees who held overtly political positions as elected officials or political staffers may receive lower ratings than nominees who served in more “neutral” positions. We anticipate that <italic>nominees with political experience will receive lower ratings than those who have not held such positions.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911421011">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>A related explanation is that the ABA evaluates nominees in relation to the contemporaneous political situation. This strategic theory, suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421011">Lott (2006)</xref>, maintains the ABA rates nominees in anticipation of the reception that they will receive in the Senate. If the ABA foresees a difficult confirmation, they may rate a preferred candidate higher to mitigate potential objections. Oppositely, if the ABA foresees an easier confirmation, they may evaluate a disliked candidate more negatively to mitigate support for her. Lott advances the specific argument that the ABA rates Republican nominees more negatively during periods of divided government when Senate-led opposition is most likely to be successful. This strategic theory predicts that <italic>Democratic nominees will receive higher scores when facing a Republican controlled Senate than during unified government, while Republican nominees will receive lower scores when facing a Democratic controlled Senate than during unified government</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, we control for the nominee’s race, gender, and age at nomination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911421011">Slotnick (1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911421011">1983b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421011">Haire (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421011">Lott (2001)</xref> all find nontraditional nominees are systematically rated lower by the ABA than are white males. Thus, we expect that <italic>minority or female nominees will receive lower ABA ratings than white or male nominees.</italic> We also posit that age may act as a proxy for a lack of professional experience not otherwise captured by the model. Given the Standing Committee’s preference for a minimum level of legal experience, <italic>we predict that older nominees will be rated more highly than younger nominees, ceteris paribus</italic>.</p>
<p>If professional considerations primarily determine ratings awarded by the Standing Committee, the most influential explanatory factors should be those related to nonpolitical experience. If political considerations predominate, then the partisanship, ideology, or partisan activism of judicial candidates should have a significant influence on nominees’ ratings. These effects may be further enhanced by the contemporaneous political environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1065912911421011" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses, we examine all nominees to the U.S. Courts of Appeals who received ABA ratings from 1977 to 2008; this time frame covers the start of the Carter administration through the second term of George W. Bush. We include all individuals nominated during this time period, regardless of whether they were eventually confirmed to the federal bench by the Senate. We do not include individuals rated informally by the ABA who failed to be nominated because of a lack of systematic data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421011">Rutkus (1995)</xref> notes this practice was common under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson but suggests it was much less frequent under Nixon and Carter and practically nonexistent by the Reagan administration. If a nominee was renominated during successive Congresses by the same president to the same seat, we count only his or her first nomination to prevent bias and autocorrelation in the model. We do, however, consider separately instances when the same person was nominated by different presidents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911421011">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>While 436 nominations were submitted to the Senate during this period, only 434 received evaluations by the Standing Committee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911421011">13</xref></sup> Of these, 51 were renominations by the same president of individuals not confirmed during the previous Congress. Because we exclude renominations from our analysis, our data include 383 nominees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911421011">14</xref></sup> Our dependent variable is each nominee’s <italic>ABA rating.</italic> We use a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from unanimously Not Qualified to unanimously Well Qualified that takes into account split ratings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911421011">15</xref></sup> Because our dependent variable is ordinal, we employ ordered logit to estimate our models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911421011">16</xref></sup> We also employ robust standard errors clustered on the year of the nomination to account for any potential variations in ratings because of yearly changes in the composition of the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>To assess the professional theory, we measure <italic>the number of years a nominee previously served as a state court judge</italic> or a <italic>federal district court judge</italic>. The variable for state court judge experience includes all years spent on local and/or state courts as well as the state’s high court. We also measured <italic>the number of years spent as a prosecutor</italic>, or as a <italic>private practice attorney</italic>, and whether the nominee worked as a <italic>full-time law professor</italic> or was a <italic>former federal appellate court clerk</italic> (i.e., clerked for a Court of Appeals judge or Supreme Court justice).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1065912911421011">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>To test the political theory, we use a dummy variable for whether the nominee was nominated by a <italic>Democratic president</italic>, as the party of the appointing president likely serves as a proxy for the ideological orientation of the potential judge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1065912911421011">18</xref></sup> We also include a variable capturing whether previous political service negatively affects nominees’ ABA ratings. Nominees are counted as having prior <italic>political experience</italic> if they worked as a state, House, or Senate staffer or served in elected office.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1065912911421011">19</xref></sup> Last, we control for the nominee’s <italic>age</italic>, <italic>race</italic>, and <italic>gender</italic>; white and male nominees are coded 1.</p>

<sec id="section5-1065912911421011">
<title>Testing the Political and Professional Theories of ABA Ratings</title>
<p>To test our competing theories of ABA ratings, we engage in two levels of analyses. We first use a matching technique to explore the causal link between ABA ratings and presumed nominee ideology. We then use ordered logit to evaluate alternative explanations for variations in ABA ratings. All models presented perform well, with likelihood ratio tests showing they all perform significantly better (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than the restricted models.</p>
<sec id="section6-1065912911421011">
<title>Are Similar Nominees Rated Similarly? An Analysis of Matched Data</title>
<p>Our research question is fundamentally one of causality, yet it is difficult to answer because we cannot observe the counterfactual. In other words, it is impossible to determine whether an individual nominated by a Republican president, and presumed to be ideologically conservative, would have received the same ABA rating if nominated by a Democratic president, and was instead presumed to be ideologically liberal. An experimental design in which the subjects are randomized would allow us to better isolate the effect of the appointing president’s party as a proxy for ideology on the rating received by the nominee. In an experiment, individuals would be randomly selected for nomination, thus breaking any relationship between the treatment and the characteristics of the nominees. In observational data, however, there are almost always dependencies between the nominee’s personal characteristics and a president’s choice to nominate that person. In other words, Democratic presidents may select nominees with different types of qualifications than Republican presidents.</p>
<p>To correct for this potential bias, we utilize a genetic matching procedure to preprocess, or “match,” the data to balance the distribution of the covariates’ values before testing the professional and political theories. Preprocessing will break any linkage or dependency between the explanatory variables (in this case, the qualifications of nominees) and the treatment variable (i.e., the party of the president, used here as a proxy for ideological orientation). By preprocessing the data prior to statistical analysis, we are able to create a balanced pool of treated and untreated observations, from which we may estimate whether there is a causal link between ABA scores and expected ideology, independent of other potential factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1065912911421011">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>We designate appointment by a Democratic president as the “treatment.” All Democratic nominees are assigned to the treatment group, and all Republican nominees are assigned to the “control” group. Given the possibility of differences in nominee characteristics across the party of the appointing president, as well as the likelihood that presidents use similar professional criteria as the ABA to evaluate candidates, we relied on the following covariates to balance the data: race, gender, age, years of district court experience, years of state court experience, years of prosecutorial experience, years as a private practice attorney, whether the nominee had worked as a law professor or a federal appellate clerk, and prior political experience.</p>
<p>The data were preprocessed using the genetic matching method with replacement and bias correction, as implemented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421011">Diamond and Sekhon (2008)</xref> through MatchIt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421011">Ho et al. 2009</xref>), which provides some benefits over the use of other forms of matching, such as exact matching, propensity score matching, and Mahalanobis distance matching. Exact matching is the simplest form of matching, in which observations in a control group are “matched” with observations in a treatment group with identical values on the covariates of interest. For example, white male Democratic appointees would be matched with white male Republican appointees with comparable levels of legal and political experience. Problems arise when many of the covariates of interest are continuous, and exact matches are rare or fail to occur. One alternative is propensity score matching, in which the units are matched based on their probability of being assigned to the treatment group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911421011">Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983</xref>). Another is Mahalanobis distance matching, which involves matching each treatment unit with the control units within some previously defined distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911421011">Cochran and Rubin 1973</xref>). Genetic matching, as implemented in GenMatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421011">Diamond and Sekhon 2008</xref>, as adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911421011">Ho et al. 2007</xref>), is a generalization of both Mahalanobis distance matching and propensity score matching. This method of preprocessing data employs an evolutionary algorithm that “maximizes the balance of observed baseline covariates across matched treated and control units” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421011">Diamond and Sekhon 2008</xref>, 2). In this case, a population size of 10,000 was specified to solve the optimization problem.</p>
<p>Genetic matching performs better than both propensity score and Mahalanobis matching when the distributions of the covariates of interest are not ellipsoidally symmetric (i.e., the covariates’ distributions are nonnormal), and, as a result, the assumption of equal percentage bias reduction (EPBR) is violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421011">Diamond and Sekhon 2008</xref>). As a number of the covariates in our model have skewed distributions with long tails, we suspect the EPBR assumption is violated and use genetic matching to ameliorate this problem. Genetic matching also solves covariate balance problems that may occur if the correct propensity score is not exactly identified.</p>
<p>Through these techniques, we are able to better balance the distribution of the covariates of interest across the control and treatment groups prior to conducting our ordered logit analysis. In other words, such techniques allow us to conduct an analysis on Democratic and Republican nominees with similar characteristics and levels of experience. By preprocessing the data, we can preemptively eliminate potential biases in presidential selection methods that may in turn influence the ABA’s ratings, such as if presidents of one party systematically select more (or less) qualified nominees than presidents of the other party.</p>
<p>Our matched data set includes 242 nominations—92 Republican nominees and 150 Democratic nominees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1065912911421011">21</xref></sup> An ordered logistic regression was then performed on the preprocessed data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1065912911421011">22</xref></sup> To illustrate the substantive effects of the statistically significant variables, we examine the predicted probability of a nominee receiving each ABA rating as the variable of interest changes, holding continuous independent variables at their means and binary variables at their modal values. This analysis highlights the impact of each variable on the probability that a particular rating will be awarded to a nominee while controlling for other influences. The impact of each variable is expected to vary across the dependent variable: a large number of years of judicial experience may increase the probability of a nominee receiving a Well Qualified rating while decreasing the probability of that same nominee receiving a Not Qualified rating. A variable may also strongly affect the likelihood of receiving a Well Qualified rating while only minimally influencing the nominee’s likelihood of being rated Qualified.</p>

<p>As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421011">Table 2</xref>, nomination by a Democrat increases the probability of receiving a Well Qualified rating by approximately 15 percent, although the confidence interval associated with this effect, while always positive, is quite wide. The party of the president has a smaller effect on the probability of receiving ratings other than Well Qualified. Nomination by a Democrat has a small, negative substantive effect on whether a nominee receives a Well Qualified/Qualified rating (3 percent) or Qualified/Well Qualified rating (1.3 percent). More notably, nomination by a Democrat decreases the probability of receiving a Qualified rating by about 8 percent and Qualified/Not Qualified rating by roughly 3 percent. Overall, we find support for the proposition that the ABA ratings reflect a bias in favor of Democratic nominees.</p>

<p>The dummy variable for political experience is in the expected negative direction, meaning that the likelihood of a nominee receiving a Well Qualified rating is lower if the nominee has such experience, all else equal. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421011">Table 2</xref> reveals that a nominee with political experience is 24 percent less likely to receive a Well Qualified rating than a nominee without such experience, but almost 5 percent more likely to receive a Qualified/Not Qualified rating.</p>
<p>This result suggests that political experience is not viewed by the ABA as a legitimate substitute for legal experience. There is also likely a presumption that these individuals were nominated because of patronage rather than their legal pedigrees. The ABA thus evaluates those with a political past more unfavorably than those following a more traditional path to a judgeship. Notably, the percentages of nominees from each party with political experience are similar (18.5 percent of Republican nominees compared to 20.0 percent of Democratic nominees).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1065912911421011">23</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-1065912911421011">
<title>Evaluating the Professional Theory of ABA Ratings</title>
<p>To test the professional theory, model 1 includes six variables that account for competence and experience. Two of these variables are significant in the expected direction. A greater number of years spent as a district court judge increases the prospect of receiving a higher ABA rating (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, two-tailed test), as does experience as a federal appellate court clerk (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, two-tailed test). The number of years spent as a state court judge, as a prosecutor, or in private practice does not significantly influence a nominee’s ABA rating, nor does experience as a law professor. The ABA relies on traditional measures of legal credentials when evaluating nominees for the circuit bench, with a strong emphasis on previous federal judicial experience.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912911421011">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the predicted probability of receiving a Well Qualified rating across the range of years of district court experience possessed by circuit court nominees. The probability of a nominee receiving a Well Qualified rating increases from 61.4 percent with no district court experience to 90.3 percent with twenty years of experience, increasing, on average, 1.4 percent for each additional year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1065912911421011">24</xref></sup> Given the ABA’s stated preference for nominees with trial experience, it is not surprising that nominees likely to have this type of experience are rated more highly. However, experience as a state judge does not significantly influence a nominee’s rating.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1065912911421011-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Prior experience as a federal appellate court clerk also increases the probability of receiving a Well Qualified rating and decreases the probability of receiving a rating lower than Well Qualified. Former clerks are about 13.6 percent more likely to receive a rating of Well Qualified than those without such experience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421011">Table 2</xref>). Completing a clerkship also lowers the probability of a nominee receiving a rating less than Well Qualified.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that experience as a law professor does not significantly influence a nominee’s ABA rating. One potential explanation is that the ABA values, but does not emphasize, experience as a law professor, similar to how it evaluates years in private practice.</p>
<p>Unlike earlier studies, we fail to find that the race of nominees influence ABA ratings. This is likely the result of the erosion of educational and workplace barriers for minorities over time, including in the legal field. Gender, however, is positive and statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10. Men were 12.3 percent more likely to receive a Well Qualified rating than women and 6.6 percent less likely to receive a Qualified rating. However, the significance of gender is neither robust to alternate specifications of the genetic matching procedure nor replicated in the alternative models presented below. Finally, we find that a nominee’s age does not have a significant influence on her ABA rating when controlling for other factors.</p>
<p>Overall, model 1 provides support for <italic>both</italic> the political and professional theories. First, all else being equal, Democratic nominees are more likely to receive Well Qualified ratings than Republican nominees. Furthermore, nominees with a politically oriented background are more likely to receive lower evaluations than those with more traditional paths to nomination.</p>
<p>Second, and equally as important, the ABA clearly considers a nominee’s professional qualifications. Nominees with more experience as a federal district court judge and former federal appellate court clerks are more likely to receive higher ratings. The ABA does evaluate nominees based on their qualifications, with particular importance placed on federal court experience, but, all else being equal, Democratic nominees also receive some partisan benefit.</p>
<p>The utilization of matching techniques allows us to directly answer the causal question posed above: All else being equal, do Democratic and presumed liberal nominees receive higher ABA ratings than Republican and presumed conservative nominees? The results of model 1 reveal that even when we compare similar nominees who differ only as to the party of their appointing presidents, Democratic nominees are more likely, all else being equal, to receive the highest rating and less likely to receive lower ratings than Republican nominees. This result suggests that the explanation is not simply that Carter and Clinton selected more “qualified” judicial nominees. Rather, some systematic bias exists, especially with relation to whether a federal circuit court nominee will receive the ABA’s highest possible rating.</p>

<sec id="section9-1065912911421011">
<title>Testing Alternative Explanations for ABA Ratings</title>
<p>The possibility still exists that our results can be explained by alternative explanations. To test these potential reasons for the partisan variances we find in ABA ratings, we perform additional analyses using standard ordered logistic regression techniques with the full, unmatched data set of 383 nominees. We utilize the unmatched data for these extended tests as they either utilize smaller subsets of nominees or include additional parameter estimates, which serve to decrease the efficiency of the models estimated with the matched data.</p>
<p>The first alternative explanation we investigate is the strategic theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421011">Lott (2006)</xref>. The strategic theory posits that the ABA evaluates nominees in relation to the contemporaneous political environment; in particular, this theory proposes that the ABA takes into account whether the nominee faces a friendly or opposition Senate. Thus, the ABA is more likely to rate preferred nominees favorably when they face a more difficult confirmation setting because of an opposition Senate, and more likely to rate disliked nominees unfavorably when they face a more amenable confirmation environment. Specifically, Lott proposes that the ABA will rate more poorly Republican nominees facing a Republican-controlled Senate, while rating more positively Democratic nominees facing a Republican-controlled Senate, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The second alternative explanation we investigate is whether our initial findings of bias reflect concerns that recent Republican presidents have nominated ideologically “extreme” nominees, resulting in systematically lower ratings for Republican nominees overall. While the ABA supposedly is not influenced by the ideological views of potential judges, it is possible that “extreme” ideological positions result in lower ratings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421011">Table 3</xref> reports the results of models 2, 3, and 4. In model 2, we reestimate the model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421011">Table 1</xref>, utilizing the unmatched data set of 383 nominees, to present a baseline for comparison. Model 3 mirrors model 2, while also including a variable for <italic>divided government</italic> and the interaction term <italic>Democratic president</italic> × <italic>divided government</italic> to test the strategic theory. Finally, model 4 is similar to model 2 but excludes Federalist Society members from the data set. As discussed in more detail below, this model estimation allows us to test whether our findings about bias are driven by a subset of nominees that the ABA might perceive as especially extreme in their conservatism. We now examine these model results and their implications.</p>

<title>The Strategic Theory</title>
<p>Model 3 tests the strategic theory, which holds that the ABA will strategically rate nominees in relation to the contemporaneous political environment in anticipation of the likely response the president’s nominees will receive in the Senate. To test the strategic theory, we include an interaction between the party of the appointing president and whether there was divided government at the time of the appointment. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421011">Table 3</xref>, only the coefficient for <italic>Democratic president</italic> is significant, while neither the coefficient for <italic>divided government</italic> nor the interaction <italic>Democratic president</italic> × <italic>divided government</italic> is significant.</p>
<p>Given the inclusion of the interaction, the coefficient for <italic>Democratic president</italic> reflects only when there is a Democratic president and unified government. To conclude whether the strategic theory is supported, we need to determine whether a change from unified to divided government significantly alters the probability of a nominee receiving a particular ABA rating. We therefore calculated the marginal effect of a change from unified to divided government for both Democratic and Republican nominees. We then examined the 95 percent confidence intervals to determine whether the ABA ratings given to nominees during unified government are significantly different from the ABA ratings received during divided government; if the confidence interval crosses 0, the difference is considered insignificant. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1065912911421011">Table 5</xref> reveal that none of the marginal effects are significant, regardless of the party of the appointing president.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1065912911421011">26</xref></sup> As a result, we fail to find support for the claim that the ABA strategically rates nominees of either party, nor, more specifically, that Republican nominees are more likely to be rated more negatively when facing a Democratic-controlled Senate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1065912911421011">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Federalist Society Membership</title>
<p>The results from models 2 and 3 support the political theory’s contention that the ABA’s ratings are systematically lower for Republican nominees than for Democratic nominees, regardless of the broader political environment. A possible response is that Republican presidents may nominate more ideologically “extreme” nominees than Democratic presidents. Such ideological extremism would then result in lower ABA ratings vis-à-vis concerns about whether the nominees will be open-minded and free from bias once on the bench. To investigate whether our findings are the result of a subset of “extreme” conservative nominees, we further explore the role of ideology by examining one potential indicator of ideological extremism: Federalist Society membership. The Federalist Society is a legal organization of conservatives and libertarians who promote the principles of separation of powers, individual freedom, and judicial restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1065912911421011">28</xref></sup> Numerous Democratic senators and liberal activists claim that the Federalist Society and its members hope to instill conservative legal principles into the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911421011">Benac 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911421011">Scherer and Miller (2009)</xref>, examining the decision making of circuit court judges in states’ rights and search and seizure cases, find that Federalist Society members vote more conservatively than other Republican appointees. A possible implication of their finding is that Federalist Society members may be perceived as more “extreme” than other nominees by the ABA and consequently rated less positively. To test this proposition, model 4 examines the 1989 to 2005 period, the time frame used in the Scherer and Miller study, but excludes all nominees whom they identify as Federalist Society members (29.6 percent of Republicans nominated between 1989 and 2005). We do not exclude a similar group of potentially extreme liberal nominees as this allows us to conduct the most stringent test possible of the proposed alternative explanation.</p>
<p>Model 4 utilizes the same independent variables as model 2. The results of model 4 reveal that, even after excluding Federalist Society members from the analysis, Democratic nominees are still significantly more likely to receive a higher rating than their Republican counterparts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421011">Table 3</xref>). Specifically, Democratic nominees are 17.8 percent more likely to be rated Well Qualified than Republican nominees, all else being equal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1065912911421011">Table 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1065912911421011">29</xref></sup> Alternatively, Republican nominees are 8.3 percent more likely than Democrats to receive a rating of Qualified. Thus, even controlling for the possibility that the findings in model 2 are a function of the ABA rating ideologically extreme Republican nominees negatively, Democratic nominees are still more likely to receive the highest possible rating than their Republican counterparts.</p>

<sec id="section12-1065912911421011" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis of the ABA’s evaluations of circuit court nominees presents a twofold narrative. First, we find support for the professional theory. The ABA considers nominees’ previous legal experiences and values experience as a federal judge or federal appellate clerk, both of which suggest familiarity with federal trial and appellate procedure. Other types of legal experience do not appear to significantly influence the ABA’s ratings.</p>
<p>Second, we also find evidence for the political theory and strong evidence of systematic bias in favor of Democratic nominees. All else being equal, a Democratic nominee is more likely to be rated Well Qualified than a similarly qualified Republican nominee. Furthermore, nominees with previous political experience, as opposed to merely legal or judicial experience, are more likely to receive a lower rating from the ABA. This suggests the ABA does not view political experience as a legitimate substitute for legal practice. Finally, we do not find any evidence that the ABA takes into account the political environment by strategically rating nominees in anticipation of easy or difficult Senate confirmations.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence here of systematically higher ratings for nominees selected by Democrats, we cannot establish conclusively the mechanism governing the relationship between perceived ideology and the probability of receiving a Well Qualified rating. One possibility is an ideological bias against conservatives by members of the Standing Committee. However, it important to emphasize that <italic>the differences among Democratic and Republican nominees primarily affect which top rating they receive rather than their probability of being rated as Not Qualified.</italic> Our findings suggest the need for studies of the membership of the Standing Committee and its effect on ABA ratings. If the committee is not dominated by Democrats, for example, that would cast doubt on claims that its output is the result of partisan bias.</p>
<p>Alternatively, our ideological proxy measure may indirectly capture different qualities in Democratic and Republican nominees. One possibility is that Democrats nominate less ideologically extreme nominees than Republicans. However, the results of model 4 reveal that our findings are robust even when we omit a subset of Republican nominees, Federalist Society members, who are likely to be viewed as ideologically extreme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911421011">Scherer and Miller 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possibility is that our measures of party and ideology capture the effect of a difference between Democratic and Republican nominees not contained in our model. We identified qualifications the ABA likely assesses when evaluating potential nominees, with all of our measures based on information the ABA possesses when investigating them. It is possible, however, that there is something unique about Democratic or Republican nominees that explains the systematic bias we find. One factor we cannot account for is information obtained during the confidential interviews conducted as part of the ABA’s evaluations process. These interviews with the potential judges and their associates may yield concerns about unethical behavior or judicial temperament. However, we lack any evidence to suggest that such discoveries of ethical problems or claims of poor temperament follow any consistent partisan or ideological patterns.</p>
<p>A final possibility is that the evaluation procedure, while designed to be neutral, contains an inherent liberal bias. While “merit” is often assumed to be a neutral quality, different groups value different experiences and qualifications. Notions of acceptable criteria for federal judges may intrinsically favor the types of nominees Democrats are more likely to select, and the ABA’s evaluation criteria may reflect these inherent biases.</p>
<p>The ABA focuses on three criteria: professional competence, integrity, and judicial temperament. Concerns have been raised about the “judicial temperament” criterion, which includes compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice under the law. These concepts are not captured well by our models. The concern with the ABA’s definition of judicial temperament is that broadly interpreting the above terms may disfavor nominees who, personally or professionally, oppose positions such as abortion rights rather than ensuring that potential judges are committed to treating all legal parties fairly. Whether these more subjective requirements are separable from a nominee’s ideology is unclear.</p>
<p>Notions of what constitutes a “good judge” have evolved. While the ABA once required a minimum of fifteen years of legal experience, it amended these standards when they were found to disfavor female and minority nominees. Similarly, the ABA has broadened its view of acceptable legal experience to encompass the contributions of law professors. The ABA also amended its criteria several times to address concerns over whether nominee ideology was an acceptable consideration. Finally, in the early 1980s the ABA abandoned its policy of rating nominees Not Qualified because of advanced age. The question still to be answered is whether our findings reveal another way in which the ABA’s standards need to evolve to ensure that the best candidates are selected for federal judgeships and that potential nominees are evaluated fairly.</p>

<p>We primarily utilized information available from the ABA as to the ratings given each nominee. For a handful of Carter nominees for which the ratings were not available, Sheldon Goldman graciously provided us with the necessary data. Given the span of over thirty years in our data, some changes in the ABA’s specific ratings have occurred. First, the ABA prior to the mid-1980s had a policy of rating some nominees Not Qualified because of advanced age, but it announced the abandonment of this policy in 1981 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911421011">Slotnick 1983b</xref>, 387). However, no individual nominated to the circuit courts during the time frame under study was rated Not Qualified because of age (see Martinek 2004). Second, the ABA’s highest rating was originally Exceptionally Well Qualified, but the use of this rating was discontinued in 1989. We follow the practice utilized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421011">Martinek, Kemper, and Van Winkle (2002</xref>, 341) of rating all nominees similarly who received a unanimous Well Qualified rating or higher to account for the discontinuation of the use of the Exceptionally Well Qualified rating.</p>

<p>We also considered whether the ABA evaluates trial court experience differently than appellate service, as well as federal trial versus state trial versus state appellate experience.

<p>For example, Terrence Boyle was nominated in 1991 by George H. W. Bush and then again in 2001 by George W. Bush to the Fourth Circuit.

Objections arose that Smith, who is from Idaho, was nominated to a California vacancy. The nomination was withdrawn, and Smith was nominated by Bush to an Idaho vacancy in the 110th Congress.

<p>With respect to split ratings, we do not distinguish between when the split rating reflected a “majority” as opposed to a “substantial majority.” The only exception with this policy occurred with the evaluation given to the Steven Colloton during the 108th Congress. Colloton received a rating of Qualified(sm)/Well Qualified(min)/Not Qualified(min). To try to accurately account for the fact that he received a minority rating of both Well Qualified <italic>and</italic> Not Qualified, we considered his rating as simply Qualified, a decision bolstered by the fact that he received a substantial majority vote for this rating. Results are robust across model iterations, however, using alternative coding schemes (including both Qualified/Well Qualified and Qualified/Not Qualified).</p>

<p>We also tested whether prior clerkship experience at the federal district court or state high court level influenced nominees’ ABA ratings, as well as models separating out the effects of circuit court and Supreme Court clerkships.

<p>We also ran each of the models shown herein using a more nuanced measure of nominee ideology developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911421011">Giles, Hettinger, and Peppers (2001)</xref> rather than the broad proxy of presidential party affiliation. The GHP scores account for the tradition of senatorial courtesy. If both home-state senators are from the president’s party, the average of their NOMINATE common space scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911421011">Poole and Rosenthal 1997</xref>) is used; when only one senator hails from the president’s party, that senator’s common space score is used. If both home-state senators are not from the president’s party, the president’s score is used. Given the method in which GHP scores are calculated, they are highly correlated with the party of the appointing president (the correlation is .921 in our data). As a result, models estimated using the GHP scores, rather than the simple presidential party dummy, produce almost identical results to those shown herein. We therefore report the results using the party affiliation dummy because of the increased ease of interpretation. These alternative models are available from the authors on request.</p>

<p>We exclude from this calculation years spent as an elected state attorney general. Only a few states elect their attorney generals, and their duties as the state’s chief law enforcement officer are qualitatively different from those undertaken by other elected officials.</p>

<p>A discussion of the application of matching methods in the judicial decision-making context can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421011">Boyd, Epstein, and Martin (2010)</xref>.</p>

<p>Increasing the range of acceptable matches may result in a larger <italic>N</italic>. However, this also increases the likelihood of matching dissimilar nominees (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421011">Boyd, Epstein, and Martin 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Supplementary analyses were used to assess the performance of genetic preprocessing compared with other matching methods. Model 1 was estimated following preprocessing using subclass, nearest neighbor, optimal, and full matching methods. In all analyses, the party of the president, years as a district court judge, and political experience were significant in the expected direction at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level. In one analysis (nearest neighbor), federal appellate clerkship was statistically significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 level. In no other model was gender statistically significant. Each of these alternate models resulted in a poorer Akaike information criterion goodness-of-fit scores than the model estimated with genetically matched data. These results are available from the authors.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-1065912911421011">

<p>In the matched data, the mix of nominees with political experience was slightly different, with 20.0 percent of Democratic nominees and 17.4 percent of Republican nominees possessing such experience.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn24-1065912911421011">
<label>24.</label>
<p>In calculating these figures, the data were set to the mean for continuous variables and the mode for dichotomous variables in the matched data. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421011">Table 1</xref>, the modal value for Democratic president is 1.</p>

<p>Model 2 does show two notable changes from the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421011">Table 1</xref>. First, gender is not significant in any of the models using the full, unmatched data, while it is in some models using the matched data. Second, age is significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 in models 2 and 3, but not in any estimation utilizing the matched data and not in all models using the unmatched data.</p>

<p>We also tested this theory using a 90 percent confidence interval (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and still did not find support for the proposition that the ABA rates nominees strategically.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn27-1065912911421011">
<label>27.</label>
<p>The strategic theory offers a unidirectional hypothesis. It is thus notable that the marginal effects are not only insignificant in all cases but also in the opposite direction as predicted, with Republican nominees predicted to receive higher ratings during divided government and Democratic nominees predicted to receive lower ratings during divided government.</p>
