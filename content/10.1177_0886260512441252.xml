<abstract>
<p>Few studies have examined sexual victimization among cadets and midshipmen at the three U.S. Military Academies. Self-report data from the 2005 Service Academy Sexual Assault Survey of Cadets and Midshipmen (<italic>n</italic> = 5,220) were used to examine the extent of unwanted sexual attention, sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, sexual coercion, and rape within the last academic year and their effects on cadets’ and midshipmen’s perceptions of their leadership’s morality and intolerance for sexual victimization. About 60% of cadets and midshipmen experienced at least one type of sexual victimization and 25% reported that they had experienced polyvictimization (e.g., two or more types). Eighty-six percent of female and 42% of male cadets and midshipmen were sexually victimized. Those who were sexually victimized had significantly more negative views of their leadership’s morality and intolerance for sexual victimization than nonvictims. Cadets and midshipmen who reported experiencing polyvictimization were more likely to perceive leadership as less moral and more tolerant of sexual victimization than those experiencing a single type. This pattern also was observed for gender-specific models; both male and female victims reported more negative perceptions of leadership. Implications concerning the effects of sexual victimization on military leadership are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Media stories of sexual victimization within the U.S. Military have created an image of sexual victimization, including rape and sexual harassment, as a common occurrence that military leadership tolerates and does not sanction. In 2006, for example, 34% of active duty women and 6% of men reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441252">Lipari, Cook, Rock, &amp; Matos, 2008</xref>). In 2009, there were 3,230 reports of sexual assault involving active military service members as either victims or accused, an 11% increase from the prior year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512441252">U.S. Department of Defense, 2010a</xref>). This increasing trend was also evident for both men and women attending the U.S. Military Academies. The Department of Defense reported that the number of sexual assaults at the three U.S. military academies rose 64% during the 2009-2010 academic year compared to the previous one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512441252">U.S. Department of Defense, 2010b</xref>). These statistics have left many observers with the impression that sexual victimization is a deeply rooted and significant problem in the U.S. Military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441252">Nelson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Further concern is aroused when the repercussions of sexual victimization in the military are considered. Leadership development is among the cornerstones of military academy education. Negative perceptions of leadership could be harmful throughout the military since a core principle to its effectiveness is respecting and following the “chain of command.” If sexual victimization alters perceptions of military leadership, then the long-term effects could undermine the successfulness of the military, especially since the military academies are the training grounds for their future leaders.</p>
<p>In examining the relationship between sexual victimization and perceptions of military leadership, the current study makes four contributions to what researchers currently know about the extent and effects of sexual victimization in the U.S. Military. First, no published studies have used a sample of male and females enrolled in the U.S. military academies to examine sexual victimization. The current study fills this void by examining the extent of single victimization and polyvictimization (e.g., sexual harassment and sexual coercion) for different types of sexual victimization among male and female cadets and midshipmen. Second, researchers know little about the effects, if any, of experiencing sexual victimization while enrolled at the U.S. military academies. It remains an open question, one deserving further scrutiny, whether cadets and midshipmen who have been sexually victimized have significantly different perceptions of their military academy leadership than those who have not been sexually victimized. A further contribution of this study is examining if both male and female cadets and midshipmen who are victimized have different perceptions of leadership tolerance and morality toward sexual victimization. Finally, because past research has shown that sexual victimization is not a single occurrence, the impact that polysexual victimization has on perceptions of military leadership is investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886260512441252">
<title>Past Military Academy Sexual Victimization Research</title>
<p>Two U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) reports are among the only sources of information about the extent of sexual victimization in the military academies. The 1994 report’s major finding was that over half of the women who responded to the survey reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment at least twice a month while enrolled at the academies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512441252">U.S. General Accounting Office, 1994</xref>). In the 1995 report, 70% of the women at the Naval Academy and 78% of women at the Air Force Academy experienced sexual harassment at least twice a month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512441252">General Accounting Office, 1995</xref>). Of the various forms of sexual harassment, the most common form that cadets and midshipmen reported experiencing was verbal harassment.</p>
<p>These two GAO reports provide only a limited view of the extent of sexual victimization among cadets and midshipmen, in part, because they only describe the extent of one type of sexual victimization—sexual harassment. Neither report examines the extent of other types of sexual victimization, for example, rape, sexual coercion, or polysexual victimization (e.g., experiencing more than one type of sexual victimization). Notably, other research shows that a substantial percentage of women have reported experiencing each of these omitted types of sexual victimization during their college years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512441252">Daigle, Fisher, &amp; Cullen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441252">Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, neither report examines the effects of sexual victimization on males’ and females’ perceptions of their military leadership.</p>

<title>Military Leadership and Sexual Victimization</title>
<p>Military academies are critical in building and maintaining the military’s hierarchy of authority while training future military leaders. The longstanding structure of the male-dominated military academies has created a sort of “brotherhood,” that values masculine characteristics such as toughness, aggressiveness, and competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441252">Rosen &amp; Martin, 1998</xref>). Militaristic culture may create an atmosphere that treats sexual victimization as a normal part of military life. As one female Army veteran put it, “If you’re a woman in the military, sexual harassment is part of the job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441252">Nelson, 2002</xref>, p. 105). The highly structured and cohesive culture makes the role of leadership very important in setting the overall tone for tolerance of sexual victimization.</p>
<p>Leaders in the military are seen by their subordinates as having the absolute authority on all concerns, including formal and informal policies regarding sexual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441252">Bergman, Langhout, Cortina, Palmieri, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>). Studies have shown that the tolerance level for sexual victimization is often set by the immediate supervisor of the unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441252">Nelson, 2002</xref>). Leaders who actively discourage harassment create an organizational climate in which sexual harassment is not seen as being tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512441252">Pryor, La Vite, &amp; Stoller, 1993</xref>) and is less likely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441252">Bergman et al., 2002</xref>). Using a sample of active duty military, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441252">Magley, Waldo, Drasgow, and Fitzgerald (1999)</xref> found that both men and women who experienced unwanted sexual behaviors were less satisfied with their supervisors, job, and coworkers. Importantly, these victimized men and women reported being less committed to the military.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512441252">Murdoch, Pryor, Anderson, Gackstetter, and Cowper Ripley (2009)</xref> found that the perceived norms of senior officers did not affect reporting of sexual victimization by active duty military men and women, but the perceptions of sexual victimization tolerance of immediate supervisors did affect reporting. These results suggest that some levels of leadership, specifically those closer in the chain of command to the victim, may have the greatest impact on victimization outcomes. While few studies have been conducted, the existing research suggests that leadership can make a difference in the occurrence of sexual victimization and how victims perceive their leaders’ response (or lack thereof) to their experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512441252">
<title>Focus of Current Study</title>
<p>Using a large sample from each of the three U.S. military academies, this study examines the extent of different types and forms of sexual victimization among male and female cadets and midshipmen and the effects on their perceptions of military academy leadership. The current study builds on the scant past military academy research and makes two contributions to this body of research. The first contribution is to estimate the prevalence of different types (e.g., unwanted sexual attention) and forms (e.g., specific behaviors within types such as continued requests for dates or attempts to establish a relationship) of sexual victimization among male and female cadets and midshipmen. The primary focus here is to determine if there are sex differences in the extent of sexual victimization among cadets and midshipmen. A gendered approach is warranted, in part, because sexual victimization among males generally has largely been ignored, perhaps due to the lack of data about male victims (e.g., a small number of males in the sample or a small number of victims). The data used in the current study had a large number of males, so it is possible to reliably estimate the percentage of male sexual victims and compare it to the percentage of females who were sexually victimized.</p>
<p>The second contribution is to determine what effects, if any, experiencing sexual victimization has on the cadets’ and midshipmen’s perceptions of their leadership at three levels of leadership: cadet/midshipmen, commissioned officers, and senior officers. We would expect cadets and midshipmen who had been sexually victimized to have significantly more negative perceptions of their leadership compared to those who have not been sexually victimized. In light of Murdoch et al’s., findings, we also would expect this difference at the lowest level of leadership (cadet/midshipmen leaders) but possibly not at the other two removed levels of leadership (commissioned officers and senior officers).</p>
<p>A gendered approach is adopted in these analyses because the effect of sexual victimization on perceptions of leadership may be different for males and females. That is, experiencing sexual victimization may negatively influence the way that females view their leaders, but not have the same effect for males. However, on the other hand, if a similar pattern emerges in the gender-specific models, it would provide evidence that the effect of victimization on perceptions of leadership operates similarly for males and females. These relationships have yet to be examined in the military research since males are often excluded from sexual victimization studies due to the reasons previously noted. Thus, males and females are analyzed as separate subsamples to further examine the sexual victimization-perception of leadership relationships.</p>
<p>Due to the possibility that individuals who experience more than one type of sexual victimization (polyvictimization) may have different perceptions at each level of leadership than those who experience only one type, this study also examines the impact that experiencing multiple types of sexual victimization has on cadets’ and midshipmen’s perceptions of leadership. Specifically, this study tests whether individuals who reported experiencing polysexual victimization have more negative perceptions of their leadership than those who experienced only one type. We hypothesize that individuals who have experienced more than one type of victimization may feel their leadership has failed them more than once in the prevention of victimization resulting in more negative perceptions. It could also be speculated that individuals who have experienced more than one type of victimization (polyvictimization) have been more “seriously” victimized, thus resulting in more negative perceptions than those who report experiencing only one type of victimization. Past research suggests that those who have experienced polyvictimization reported more trauma symptoms than those who experienced repeated victimizations of a single type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441252">Sabina &amp; Straus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441252">Turner, Finkelhor, &amp; Ormrod, 2010</xref>). Thus, looking at polyvictimization in the current study might yield understanding of its negative effects, if any, on cadet’s and midshipmen’s perceptions of military leadership.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that this relationship will be evident at the cadet and midshipmen level of leadership, but not at the levels of leadership further removed from the victim, namely, at the levels of the commissioned officers and senior officers. Furthermore, to investigate if males and females perceive polysexual victimization differently, they are analyzed as separate subsamples so this relationship can be examined for each group separately.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Data from The Service Academy 2005 Sexual Harassment and Assault Survey (SASA2005) were used in the current study. These data were collected by a team of Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) administrators. Participants were briefed by an officer from the same service branch who was not currently employed at the respective academy.</p>
<p>The SASA2005 is the second of five congressionally mandated surveys designed to track sexual harassment and assault at the Army, Naval, and Air Force academies. The SASA2005 survey contains questions about sexual victimization and perceptions of academy leadership. Participants were surveyed in April 2005.</p>
<p>All female cadets and midshipmen enrolled at each of the three academies were recruited to participate in the SASA2005. Males were stratified by the three academies and 4 class years (2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and then randomly selected from each of the 12 stratum. Participation in the survey was voluntary. Each participant was notified that she or he did not have to complete any question or the entire survey. The response rate for females was 86.7% and 84.7% for males across all three academies. Reponses were anonymous, with no identifying information collected other than some demographic information (e.g., sex, academy class).</p>

<sec id="section7-0886260512441252">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The total sample size was 5,220 male and female cadets and midshipmen. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512441252">Table 1</xref> presents characteristics of the sample broken down by sex of the cadets and midshipmen. Of the total sample, 61.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 3,214) were males and 38.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 2,006) were females. About a third of the total sample was enrolled at each academy, as was the percentage of males and females, respectively. The sample ranged from 25% in the 2005 academy class to 29% in the 2008 academy class. The percentage of males ranged from 23% in the 2005 class to 27% in the 2008 class. A similar pattern in the range of proportions was evident in academy class for females.</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Two measures of cadets’ and midshipmen’s perceptions of leadership were created: (a) morality and (b) intolerance for sexual victimization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0886260512441252">Appendix A</xref> for survey items, descriptive statistics, and Cronbach’s alphas). Each variable was measured in reference to three different levels of leadership: (a) Cadet/midshipmen leader, (b) Commissioned officer, and (c) Senior officer. Cadet/midshipmen leaders are the closest in the chain of command to cadets and midshipmen at the academies and have the most contact with them. Commissioned officers are a step up in the chain of command, and senior officers are at the top of the chain of command and have the least amount of day-to-day contact with the cadets and midshipmen.</p>
<p>Morality is a three-item scale designed to evaluate the perceived morality of leadership (moral character, conduct, and welfare). Item responses ranged from one (<italic>not at all</italic>) to five (<italic>to a large extent</italic>). To create the morality scale, a mean for each respondent was calculated across the three items, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of perceived morality demonstrated by military academy leadership. Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach’s alpha; values ranged from .77 to .94 for the three levels of leadership.</p>
<p>The intolerance scale was comprised of three items assessing the perceived intolerance (climate for not tolerating sexual harassment or sexual assault and encouraging reporting) of leadership for sexual victimization. For each question, respondents could indicate one (<italic>not at all</italic>) to five (<italic>to a large extent</italic>). A mean for each respondent was calculated across the three items with a higher score on the intolerance scale indicating higher levels of intolerance or nonacceptance of sexual victimization. The items used in the intolerance scale were internally consistent across levels of leadership, with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from .80 to .94.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512441252">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Respondents were asked about their sexual victimization within the last year (since June 2004). Individual survey items describing different forms of sexual behaviors were categorized into one of five different types of victimization: (a) unwanted sexual attention, (b) sexual harassment, (c) unwanted sexual contact, (d) sexual coercion, and (e) rape (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0886260512441252">Appendix B</xref> for original survey items and their categorization by type of victimization, and Cronbach’s alpha). Each of the five sexual victimization variables was dichotomous and coded as 0 = <italic>nonvictim</italic> and 1 = <italic>victim</italic>.</p>
<p>Respondents were categorized into three mutually exclusive groups based on their responses to the type(s) of victimization, if any, that they had experienced: nonvictims, single-type victims, and polyvictims. Nonvictims did not experience any type of sexual victimization. Single-type victims experienced only one type of sexual victimization (e.g., sexual harassment or sexual coercion), while polyvictims reported experiencing two or more types of sexual victimization (e.g., sexual harassment and sexual coercion).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260512441252">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Proportion tests were performed to determine if the proportion of males and females who experienced sexual victimization were significantly different from each other. These tests were performed by type and form of sexual victimization.</p>
<p>Given that there are two dependent variables, multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) models were estimated to test if there was a significant difference in cadets’ and midshipmen’s perceptions of their leadership between (a) nonvictims and victims and (b) single-type victims, and polyvictims. MANCOVA models were estimated for each level of leadership by the total sample. In addition, models were estimated separately for male-only and female-only subsamples to determine whether patterns of perceptions of leadership varied by sex. SPSS version 17.0 was used to analyze the data.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Nearly 42% of males and just above 85% of females reported experiencing at least one type or form of sexual victimization. The percentage of males who were victims ranged from 2% for rape to 38% for sexual harassment. Overall, males were more likely to experience sexual harassment than the other types of sexual victimization. Unwanted sexual contact and unwanted sexual attention were less likely to be reported by males, yet a notable proportion of males did report experiencing these forms of sexual victimization (nearly 9% and 11%, respectively). A relatively small percentage of male cadets and midshipmen experienced sexual coercion (4%) and rape (2%).</p>
<p>The percentage of female victims ranged from 5% for rape to 83% for sexual harassment. Like males, a greater percentage of females reported experiencing sexual harassment and its four different forms than the other types of sexual victimization. Unwanted sexual attention was commonly experienced. Approximately 41% of all women cadets and midshipmen reported that they have been continually asked for dates and/or experienced repeated attempts to establish a relationship. Unwanted sexual contact was also reported among a sizable percentage of females (27%). Sexual coercion (14%) and rape (5%) were the least common types of sexual victimization reported by females.</p>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512441252">Table 2</xref>, across the different types and forms of sexual victimization, a significantly larger percentage of females experienced victimization compared to males. For example, females reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact (26%) at three times the proportion of males (8%). The only nonsignificant differences were for one form of sexual coercion (implying better assignments) and completed rape. There were no significant differences between the percentages of males and females who had experienced each of these two forms of sexual victimization.</p>
<p>Of those reporting experiencing sexual victimization, 25% of the total sample reported that they had experienced polyvictimization (i.e., two or more types). A significantly larger percentage of females experienced polyvictimization compared to males (45% vs. 12%, respectively).</p>

<title>Nonvictims’ and Victims’ Perceptions of Leadership</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512441252">Table 3</xref> presents the adjusted means from the MANCOVA models for perceptions of leadership between nonvictims and victims for the total, male-only, and females-only subsamples. To assess whether there are significant differences in the means across the three groups and to measure the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, Wilks’s Lambda and effect sizes (partial eta square) were calculated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512441252">Table 3</xref>). Contrary to our expectation that differences between nonvictims’ and victims’ perceptions would be found only at the cadet and midshipman leader level, significant differences were found at each level of leadership. In each level of leadership, victims reported their leaders to be less moral and more tolerant of sexual victimization than nonvictims. For example, at the cadet and midshipmen level of leadership, victims had notably smaller adjusted means for the intolerance scale (3.69) and morality scale (3.47) than nonvictims (3.99 and 3.72, respectively). Victims perceived their cadet and midshipmen leaders to be less moral and more tolerant of sexual victimization than nonvictims.</p>

<p>A similar pattern was evident in the males-only and females-only subsamples. Overall, male and female cadet and midshipmen victims perceived their leadership as being less moral and more tolerant of sexual victimization than their nonvictim counterparts. For example, male (3.77) and female (3.58) victims perceived their cadet and midshipmen leaders as more tolerant of sexual victimization than male (4.05) and female (3.92) nonvictims. Both male and female victims had more negative perceptions of their leadership than nonvictims. Contrary to our expectations, this relationship was evident within each level of leadership. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512441252">Table 3</xref> indicates, for the total sample, and each of the gender-specific subsamples, the observed effect size was significant indicating that victimization status accounted for approximately 3% to 4% of the variance in the perception of leadership scores.</p>

<p>A similar pattern was revealed for males and females. Regardless of the sex of the victim, polyvictims reported more negative perceptions of leadership than single-type victims (for exception see male polyvictim perceptions of the morality of their cadet and midshipmen leaders). Once again, the observed effect sizes for the total sample and for each of the female and male subsamples were significant. Although these effects sizes are small, they demonstrate that victimization status does account for variation in perceptions of leadership scores.</p>

<title>The Extent of Sexual Victimization</title>
<p>Supportive of past college student victimization research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441252">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441252">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2003</xref>), our findings suggest that sexual victimization is a common occurrence in the Army, Naval, and Air Force academies. Nearly 60% of cadets and midshipmen had been sexually victimized within the last year. In line with the GAO’s report, sexual harassment was the most common type of sexual victimization reported. Supportive of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512441252">Daigle et al.’s (2008)</xref> findings that show that a large proportion of women are revictimized sexually during their college tenure, our findings reveal that cadet and midshipmen sexual victims are at risk of being revictimized during their tenure at the military academies.</p>
<p>Our results also indicate that sexual victimization is a problem that affects not only females, but also male cadets and midshipmen. The finding that males are also at risk for sexual victimization at the academies may be attributed to several factors. First, males comprise an overwhelming majority of persons who are enrolled at the military academies. Previous research shows that being in close proximity to motivated offenders, most typically males, increases sexual victimization risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512441252">Daigle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441252">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2003</xref>). Second, the culture of power and male-dominated chain of command might also contribute to the perpetration of sexual victimization among all cadets and midshipmen, not simply females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512441252">Street, Gradus, Stafford, &amp; Kelly, 2007</xref>). As such, programmatic efforts that seek to reduce sexual victimization need to be evidence-based, address both female and male victims, and should focus on altering the climate of the military academies that perpetuate sexual victimization (e.g., emphasis on toughness, masculinity, and control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441252">Lonsway et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of Experiencing Sexual Victimization on Perceptions of Military Leadership</title>
<p>A second important finding is that sexual victimization has a negative effect on victims’ perceptions of their military academy leadership’s morality and tolerance of sexual victimization. Significant differences in perceptions were observed for the leadership closest to the victim in the chain of command (i.e., cadet/midshipmen leaders), which both confirms our hypothesis and support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512441252">Murdoch et al.’s (2009)</xref> findings. However, contrary to Murdoch et al., our findings also indicate that sexual victimization’s effect on perceptions permeates throughout all levels of leadership suggesting that this effect is not restricted to only leaders lower in the chain of command. Finally, victims who experienced polyvictimization had significantly lower perceptions of morality and intolerance than those who only experienced one type of sexual victimization, a finding that when coupled with the extent of polyvictims underscores the significance of these results to the operations of not only the academies, but also the entire military. This effect was not contained only to cadet/midshipman leaders, but contrary to our hypothesis was also evident at the two higher levels of leadership.</p>
<p>Since the military academies are the training grounds for future officers of the U.S. Armed Forces, the impact that sexual victimization has on perceptions of leadership is notable for several reasons. First, cadets and midshipmen who were sexually victimized perceived that their leaders at all levels of command were more tolerant of sexual victimization and had lower levels of morality. These negative perceptions could compromise the structure, authority, and hierarchy that is so critical to the proper functioning of the military. Perceptions of tolerance could potentially influence a victim’s confidence in reporting victimization experiences to their leadership. From both a prevention and service provision perspective, it is important that individuals who have been sexually victimized feel confident in reporting so that their experience can be brought to the attention of those in a position to provide victim services or carry out an investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441252">Bergman et al., 2002</xref>). Encouraging reporting should be an important part of any program geared toward sexual victimization education or prevention. If more sexual victimizations were reported to the military authority, it could help to raise awareness of the issue and exert pressure on leadership to make greater efforts to protect cadets and midshipmen. Second, it is possible that individuals who feel as though their leaders are unconcerned about sexual victimization may become disenchanted with the military and less likely themselves to seek positions of leadership. Sexual victimization may also undermine the cadets’ and midshipmen’s confidence in their jobs by weakening their relationships with their employers and lowering their overall job satisfaction. Third, victims may become less trustful of leadership and as a result may be less likely to continue to pursue their education at the military academies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512441252">Antecol and Cobb-Clark (2006)</xref> reported that active-duty women who experienced sexual harassment reported higher dissatisfaction with their military employment and higher intentions to leave the military. These possibilities should be explored in future research to better grasp the full impact that sexual victimization has on cadets’ and midshipmen’s academy experiences, as well as their pursuit of, and satisfaction in, future military careers.</p>
<p>Our findings have other additional implications for the academies. First, victims need to be encouraged to come forward so that they can receive services that can potentially reduce the likelihood that they experience a subsequent sexual victimization. Experiencing polysexual victimization may also be reduced if the offender is identified and prevented from having further access to the original victim or another victim. Second, those who experienced polyvictimization had more negative perceptions of their leaders. This group of individuals may be at particular risk of being disillusioned with the military academies and may be further unwilling to seek assistance from those in positions of authority, possibly making any continued victimization unlikely to be reported.</p>
<p>Researchers have argued that leadership plays a significant role in setting the standards for appropriate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441252">Bergman et al., 2002</xref>). Leaders and officers at each level of command have the potential to alter the cultural and organizational characteristics of military academies that perpetuate sexual victimization. Education and prevention programs should include teaching those at all levels of leadership to recognize risk of sexual victimization, to respond seriously to all reports of sexual victimization, and to help change cultural norms that allow sexual victimization to occur. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441252">Antecol and Cobb-Clark (2003)</xref> reported positive outcomes for programs that educate individuals (especially men) on recognizing and appropriately addressing sexual victimization.</p>
<p>It might be beneficial to encourage the professional development of female cadets and midshipmen so that they can be more successful at attaining positions of leadership. Having more females in leadership positions could be valuable both for encouraging future female cadets and midshipmen to strive for officer positions and also for helping to foster an environment where sexual victimization is perceived as being not tolerated.</p>

<sec id="section18-0886260512441252">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has some limitations that should not be overlooked. First, the use of secondary data allowed us to create only two dependent variables related to our research questions. However, the data allowed us to create multi-item scales with Cronbach’s alpha’s ranging from .77-.94 indicating good internal consistency. Nonetheless, how perception of leadership is defined and operationalized should be reconsidered in future research to include outcomes beyond morality and intolerance. Using two measures, however, is a first step toward understanding the effects that sexual victimization has on the cadets’ and midshipmen’s perception of their military leadership. A second possible limitation is the level of comfort the cadets and midshipman felt while completing the survey. Cadets and midshipman were told that their responses would be confidential and that they could cease participation at any time. It is difficult to know how these two conditions influenced their survey responses. Finally, another limitation is the lack of information on who perpetrated the incident. Perpetrator-level information was collected in the SASA2005 but was excluded in these public use data. Having perpetrator information would allow for examining the relationship between type of perpetrator and measures of intolerance and morality. For instance, individuals who were victimized by authority figures might report lower perceptions of leaders’ morality and intolerance toward sexual victimization than individuals who were victimized by another student.</p>
<p>Finally, further research is needed to investigate the impact of single and polyvictimization on leadership perceptions. Specifically, there is a need for more examination as to why polyvictims reported more negative perceptions of their leadership than their single victim counterparts. This finding could be due to polyvictims perceiving that their leadership has failed them repeatedly in the prevention of victimization. For instance, an individual who has experienced various types of sexual victimization (e.g., unwanted sexual attention, sexual harassment, etc.) may be more likely to perceive a broader failure on the part of leadership and that victimization is more tolerated in the environment than an individual who only experienced one type of sexual victimization. Data on perpetrators could also help illuminate this relationship. For instance, polyvictims may be more likely to experience victimization from multiple offenders, which may further cause them to perceive victimization as more pervasive and uncontrolled. On the other hand, it could be that polyvictims have experienced more serious victimizations than single-type victims resulting in more negative perceptions of their leadership. That is, a building effect of victimization may be occurring in that rape victims are likely also to experience less severe types of victimization such as sexual harassment and sexual coercion, and it is the rape victimization, not the polyvictimization, that is resulting in the observed relationship. Future research that examines single-type victims, polyvictims, and repeat victims (i.e., victims that have experienced more than one of the same type of victimization) is needed to fully unpack this relationship.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, the findings underscore the importance of further examining the extent and effects of sexual victimization on cadets and midshipmen. These men and women represent the future of the U.S. Military. Our findings show that their victimization experiences while attending the U.S. military academies negatively shape their perceptions of academy leadership at all levels of commands. Given that the academies are the primary training ground for future military leaders, further research should consider the long-term impact that sexual victimizations have on future military experiences and career success. If sexual victimization experiences at the academies play a significant role in determining future career aspirations, then the U.S. Military needs to act to ensure that they are not losing talented young men and women due to sexual victimization experiences that could have been prevented.</p>
