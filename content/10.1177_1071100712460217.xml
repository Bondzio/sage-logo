<sec id="section1-1071100712460217">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Hallux valgus remains a common forefoot condition where different causes may contribute to the pathology. The extent of first ray mobility and, in particular, instability of the first tarsometatarsal joint represents a key argument in the debate on the selection of an appropriate operative treatment. Until now, assessment of first ray instability has relied on clinical examination or static assessment only. For dynamic evaluation in our study, pedobarographic, clinical, and standard weightbearing radiographic findings were correlated with the radiokinematically determined first ray instability in the sagittal plane in hallux valgus patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460217">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Eight patients with hallux valgus deformity and a clinically unstable first tarsometatarsal joint were enrolled. Seven patients were females; 1 was male. Mean age was 44 years (range, 15-65). Clinical symptoms, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society forefoot scores, and standard parameters of weightbearing radiographs in 2 planes of the forefoot were recorded. A mobile C-arm fluoroscope with a novel distortion-free flat-screen detector and a pedobarographic platform were synchronized during the rollover process. Fluoroscopic image analysis was performed employing a specific CAD model. Pedobarographic parameters were determined within 8 defined areas of the forefoot contact zone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460217">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean dorsiflexion distance and angle of the first ray was 13.9 ± 9.4 mm (range, 6.3 to 34.5) and 5.9 ± 4.0 degrees (range, 2.4 to 14.5). At the first tarsometatarsal joint, the mean maximum dorsiflexion angle was 2.6 ± 1.3 degrees (range, 0.1 to 4.0). The intermetatarsal angle correlated significantly (<italic>P</italic> = .013) with the radiokinematically determined maximum dorsiflexion. Furthermore, a significant correlation between maximum force transfer to the central (<italic>P</italic> = .021) and lateral forefoot (fourth metatarsal; <italic>P</italic> = .032) and first tarsometatarsal joint instability was detected with an unloading of the first metatarsal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460217">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Although our analysis was limited to the sagittal plane only, we can support the notion that an enlarged intermetatarsal angle was associated with increased maximum dorsiflexion of the first ray during gait in hallux valgus patients. Gross instability of the first tarsometatarsal joint during weightbearing was not detectable in our patients, while first tarsometatarsal joint instability increased maximum force transfer to the central forefoot with the potential risk of metatarsalgia.</p>

<body>
<p>Hallux valgus is a common pathologic forefoot condition where different parameters may contribute and its causes are not completely understood. Standard skeletal measures of the foot derived from plain weightbearing x-rays are considered as a reliable basis to determine the degree of hallux valgus deformity and to guide the surgeon in the selection of the operative procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460217">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460217">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712460217">24</xref></sup> In particular, first ray instability and its impact on hallux valgus have been the subject of ongoing controversy and debate for deca-des.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460217">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460217">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712460217">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460217">29</xref></sup> Since clinical evaluation of first ray instability is considered a rather subjective finding, in the past numerous attempts were undertaken to more precisely investigate, describe, and quantify first ray mobility to define pathologic instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460217">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460217">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712460217">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460217">29</xref></sup> Attempts at analysis with manual measurement procedures were suggested, and although they were scientific in their approach, a residual subjective component remained for these findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460217">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460217">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>More sophisticated mechanical devices have been developed by Rodgers and Cavanagh, Glasoe and Klaue for quantitative measurement, during which the first ray was deviated in the sagittal plane at a defined force while the amplitude of dorsiflexion was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460217">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460217">25</xref></sup> Alternatively, Faber described a modified Klaue device with Doppler imaging of vibration analysis as a suitable tool to quantify first tarsometatarsal joint instability in hallux valgus patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460217">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460217"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460217">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460217">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>For all these static measurements, constant or preferably neutral ankle position is mandatory to obtain reliable mobility values, since the degree of plantar fascia tension is considered to be a relevant factor for actual first ray instability, which should be kept constant during analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460217">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460217">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, dynamic measurement of first ray instability with an optic infrared camera system was introduced by Allen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460217">1</xref></sup> It may be more representative of the dynamic weightbearing situation than the static measurements with limited axial force application introduced by Klaue and Glasoe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460217">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pedobarography or the analysis of dynamic plantar pressure distribution has been used to evaluate a variety of foot pathologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460217">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460217">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460217">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460217">28</xref></sup> Numerous authors assume or argue that a decrease of weightbearing under the hallux and the first metatarsal, as well as an increase of loading of the second metatarsal and even the third, may be associated with metatarsalgia representing a specific plantar pressure pattern in advanced hallux valgus deformity with a corresponding load transfer to the second and third metatarsals and the lateral toes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460217">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460217">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460217">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460217">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460217">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460217">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460217">28</xref></sup> While clinical and standard radiographic criteria for the operative treatment of hallux valgus condition are well established, we believe that dynamic pedobarographic findings might be equally helpful for the evaluation and description of the severity of the hallux valgus. Until now, any systematic quantification of hallux valgus on the basis of pedobarography in the literature is missing. Although various works on the quantification of first ray instability are available, we assume that a radiokinematic investigation of the first ray and, in particular, the first tarsometatarsal joint during gait in combination with the pedobarographic pattern may help to provide further insight into the correlation of functional first ray instability and hallux valgus deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460217">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460217">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712460217">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460217">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>We hypothesized that the degree of hallux valgus deformity on plain weightbearing radiographs would correlate with the radiokinematically described first tarsometatarsal joint instability during the rollover phase and that the degree of radiokinematically determined instability of the first ray would correlate with the clinical (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society [AOFAS] forefoot score) and pedobarographic findings specific for hallux valgus.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>To investigate the role of quantitative first ray instability in hallux valgus deformity by a first-step pedobarography, we arranged a mobile C-arm fluoroscope (Ziehm Vision RFD, Ziehm Imaging, Nuremburg, Germany) with a capacitive platform (emed-x-system, novel Inc., Munich, Germany) for simultaneous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460217">Figure 1</xref>). For our study, 8 patients with hallux valgus of 1 foot or both feet were included. All had been examined and scheduled for corrective first tarsometatarsal arthrodesis (modified Lapidus procedure) by 2 experienced orthopaedic foot surgeons. Seven patients were female; 1 was male. Mean age was 43.8 ± 15.6 years (range, 15 to 65). Mean body weight was 73.9 ± 19.2 kg (range, 49 to 102). Mean height was 1.66 ± 0.1 m (range, 1.5 to 1.84). On examination, all patients had pain and instability of the first tarsometatarsal joint. For the AOFAS forefoot score (hallux metatarsophalangeal scale), pain, function, footwear requirements, MTP joint motion, and instability as well as hallux alignment were recorded. The mean preoperative AOFAS forefoot score was 50.3 ± 10.2 points (range, 31 to 65). Furthermore, the hindfoot axes in all patients were within anatomic limits, and no structural foot pathology other than the hallux valgus was present. Standard weightbearing anteroposterior and lateral views were obtained from which hallux valgus angles and first intermetatarsal angles were recorded.</p>

<title>Radiokinematic and Pedobarographic Analysis</title>
<p>For our radiokinematic analysis, a novel mobile C-arm fluoroscope (Ziehm Vision RFD) was employed. This new-generation fluoroscope with its flat-panel detector technology allowed distortion-free x-ray imaging for consecutive computer-assisted analysis. Therefore, work-intensive adaptation commonly associated with conventional in vivo kinematic videofluoroscopy compensating for typical varying magnifications depending from the distance from the focus and distortions of images was not necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460217">25</xref></sup> In our experimental setting, the C-arm was placed horizontally under a pair of sport benches, functioning as a “catwalk” for gait analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460217">Figure 2</xref>). The radiation source and the flat-panel detector were turned 45 degrees to image the whole foot during the fluoroscopic analysis, representing the “examination window.” X-ray pulsing was set automatically by the fluoroscope to 25 images per second (40 Hz). The image resolution was 1024 × 1024 pixels at the active detection panel (30 × 30 cm). For calibration of the image, a sphere of known diameter was placed on the central position mark in the middle of the catwalk. The sphere’s size was 40 mm, relating to 163 pixels at the image, establishing a multiplying factor of 40/163 for conversion of pixels into millimeters.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1071100712460217-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Within the fluoroscopic analyzing zone, a high-end dynamic pressure distribution measurement platform (emed-x-system, novel Inc.) was placed for pedobarographic analysis. The capacitive platform incorporated 6080 sensors in an active sensor area of 475 × 320 mm (spatial resolution, 4 sensors/cm<sup>2</sup>); sampling frequency was 400 Hz; and the platform was calibrated within a pressure range of 1 to 127 N/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Patients were instructed in the first-step rollover technique and were eventually asked to walk following an acoustic signal over the capacitive platform in a steady motion for 5 trials for each foot, whereas only 1 trial of each foot was performed under simultaneous fluoroscopic imaging to limit radiation exposure. To guide the step through the examination window onto the platform in a reproducible manner, a landing mark (line) was placed on its surface, and patients were instructed to aim with the second toe and midheel for the marking line. Patients walking through the radiation beam were protected by standard lead waistcoats and thyroid gland protection sleeves. The recorded footprints of pedobarography were divided into the following 8 preset standard masks: 5 metatarsals, hallux, and second and lateral toes by presets of the applied software (novel database medical, novel Inc.). Subsequently, the standard pedobarographic parameters, such as peak pressure, maximum force, time force interval, and pressure time interval, were calculated with specific software (novel database medical, novel Inc.) and averaged over the repeated trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712460217">
<title>Image Processing and Analysis</title>
<p>From the fluorokinematic analysis, we obtained an image sequence in a 2-dimensional mediolateral view where the first ray of the foot was fully displayed from talus to first metatarsal head during the entire rollover phase of walking. Fluoroscopic image data were imported into a CAD system (Solid Works 2007, Dassault systemes, Velizy-Villacoublay, France) for marking and calculation of position and orientation of the bone boundary projection. As a basis for the further digital analysis, the cortical borders of the involved bones were manually drawn and fixed. The enclosed area and the principal axes of inertia as well as the coordinates of its gravity center were calculated representing the position and orientation of the bone projection within the image coordinate system. Since the initially fixed bone shape differed only marginally under reproducible conditions, the created mask of bone boundaries was transferred to every following fluoroscopic frame to determine relative translation and rotation movements between the principal axes and gravity centers. For the calculation of the entire first ray instability, 2 control points were fixed: 1 at the talus and the other at the dorsal first metatarsal head. During the gait cycle, coordinates of the control points were calculated with help of the CAD system. The deviations were determined (ie, the maximum dorsiflexion angles and maximal dorsiflexion distance). Due to variable gait velocities from patient to patient, duration of first-step foot-to-ground contact time varied among participants. For adequate comparison, contact times were normalized into a standardized time ratios.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1071100712460217">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data were stored and analyzed using the SPSS 17.0. Descriptive statistics were computed for continuous and categorical variables. The statistics included mean and standard deviations of continuous variables and were presented as mean ± SD. The relationship between radiologically determined measures on the weightbearing radiographs and pedobarographic findings of the first ray was specified by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ever since the early days of hallux valgus deformity research, the first ray instability theory has been a controversial etiologic entity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460217">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460217">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460217">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460217">18</xref></sup> Until now, apart from clinical assessment, standard angular measurements on plain weightbearing x-rays are considered reproducible criteria for defining the degree of hallux valgus deformity and guiding the surgeon in selecting the appropriate surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460217">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460217">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460217">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460217">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712460217">24</xref></sup> On the basis of clinical findings and standard radiology, we wanted to examine hallux valgus feet pedobarographically and radiokinematically during the dynamic rollover phase to further describe the biomechanical characteristics of the first ray of the foot, including the first tarsometatarsal joint in hallux valgus.</p>
<p>Until now, an accepted quantitative definition of physiologic mobility versus pathologic instability of the first ray and the first tarsometatarsal joint is not available. Some authors have described manual testing as a sufficient evaluation of first ray instability and first tarsometatarsal joint mobility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460217">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460217">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712460217">27</xref></sup> while other studies have challenged these results, claiming that this only leads to a subjective nonquantifiable result.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460217">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460217">14</xref></sup> Subsequently, employing static assessment of the first ray mobility, a range of values were found (5.9 ± 1.0 mm to 9.3 ± 1.9 mm) and considered to be the threshold for instability.</p>
<p>In a cadaver study, first tarsometatarsal joint mobility was assessed with a computer-assisted 3-dimensional tracking system, presenting joint-specific angular mobility. In the sagittal plane, 3.5 ± 1.9 degrees were reported as physiologic mobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460217">23</xref></sup> In another cadaver study, normal first tarsometatarsal joint mobility was determined as of 6.2 degrees or 2.6 mm for dorsoplantar (sagittal) mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712460217">29</xref></sup> These values are comparable to our findings, although not specifically described for hallux valgus. Having identified the first tarsometatarsal joint as a key pathologic entity in a comparative approach, Klaue with his device described the static sagittal mobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint as 2.6 ± 1.4 mm in hallux valgus patients and 1.5 ± 0.7 mm in controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460217">17</xref></sup> Thus, he provided a numeric value where natural mobility may turn into pathologic instability. As our dynamic fluoroscopic data of first tarsometatarsal joint mobility during the rollover process are well within the range of the in vitro examinations and the assessment of static loading with limited force application (55N), gross instability of the first tarsometatarsal joint could not be diagnosed.</p>
<p>Studies on pedobarographic findings in hallux valgus have focused mainly on foot pressure pattern changes following specific operative techniques of corrective foot surgery (ie, scarf, McBride, proximal first metatarsal osteotomy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460217">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460217">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460217">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460217">21</xref></sup> Quantitative characterization of plantar pressure patterns in hallux valgus in particular related to the first ray or first tarsometatarsal joint mobility in the literature is scarce. Whereas local peak pressure and maximal force distribution were analyzed quite frequently, more integral parameters of regional load transfer, such as pressure time and force time integrals, were not considered, in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460217">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460217">28</xref></sup> For the hallux valgus situation, there seems to be at least some agreement on reduced loading under the first metatarsal and an increase in loading under the second and third metatarsals, particularly in patients with metatarsalgia or relative shortening of the first metatarsal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460217">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460217">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712460217">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Static instability, as measured by the size of the first intermetatarsal angle, correlated quite well with dynamic maximum dorsiflexion motion of the first ray of the foot, determined fluoroscopically. Analysis of dynamic plantar pressure distribution revealed that there was a good correlation between the amount of fluorokinematically determined first ray instability and unloading of the first metatarsal in favor of load transfer to the central and lateral metatarsals with concomitant unloading of the lateral toes.</p>
<p>The strength of our study lies in the first application to our knowledge of combined assessment of dynamic first ray instability using a novel radiokinematic technique and dynamic plantar pressure distribution. The newest-generation C-arm fluoroscope (Ziehm Vision RFD) with its flat-panel detector technology for distortion-free imaging, synchronized with a high-resolution capacitive platform, provided data recording and analysis conditions allowing quantitative correlation with standard weightbearing x-rays. Furthermore, in our experimental setting, radiokinematic first ray mobility and first tarsometatarsal joint mobility were evaluated, thus allowing assessment of first ray instability in patients with hallux valgus.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations. First, 8 patients with hallux valgus with instability is a small sample. Second, radiokinematic imaging was, for technical reasons, performed in only the lateral (sagittal) view, thereby neglecting mobility in the anteroposterior (frontal plane) view. Third, pedobarographic analysis was preferably performed during a steady-state gait situation, thereby eliminating acceleration or deceleration effects. Since we decided on a simultaneous radiokinematic and pedobarographic measurement, the patients were able to perform only a minimal gait sequence (first-step analysis).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study results suggest that radiokinematic evaluation of first ray mobility to estimate instability of the foot may provide an innovative approach to functionally characterize hallux valgus. In particular, the consideration of well-accepted forefoot angle measurements in weightbearing radiographs (first intermetatarsal angle and hallux valgus angle) in combination with pedobarographic foot analysis and radiokinematic assessment appears to be a meaningful tool to elucidate the mechanism of dynamic load transfer at the forefoot.</p>
