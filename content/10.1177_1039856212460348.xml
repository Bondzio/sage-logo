<p>One of the priorities during my term as President has been to forge and increase international links, particularly with our nearer neighbours in the Asia Pacific region. As well as the introspection of improving our governance and connection with the membership, it is also important for a vibrant organisation to have broad external links and relevance in the wider mental health sector. As well as progressing this agenda in our countries of Australia and New Zealand, we also have a place and role in the international mental health landscape. This is not only from a sense of responsibility to countries with fewer resources and expertise than ours where we can respond to their requests for assistance, but also enables communication and learning from other nations and psychiatric organisations’ experiences.</p>
<p>The College’s International Affairs Working Party was established in late 2010 to coordinate such links. Some of its priorities have been to collate the good work many individual psychiatrists and organisations have already been doing, and put members in touch with others doing similar work. In collaboration with Asia Australia Mental Health (AAMH) we successfully obtained AusAid funding to assist Fiji; AAMH focusing on the development of community mental health services, and the College assisting with development of Fiji National University postgraduate courses in mental health. There is also a plan to coordinate our members providing teaching and voluntary work in services in Fiji, with this progressing more slowly given some of the logistic difficulties Fiji faces. We have enhanced our links with the Psychiatric Association of Thailand and continued our links with the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology.</p>
<p>In addition to contributing to mental health in our region it is important for us to build relationships with international psychiatric organisations so that we can exchange ideas, liaise with our international colleagues and benchmark international best practice in the area. As such I attended the International Congress of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Liverpool in July which provided the opportunity to meet with their President, the President of the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the President Elect of the World Psychiatric Association.</p>
<p>On the way to the UK I was invited to the International Psychiatric Conference in Dubai, which was organised by the Pakistan Psychiatric Research Centre and cosponsored by the World Association for Social Psychiatry and the World Psychiatric Association, where I attended a round table of key leaders of psychiatry from Asia and the Middle East to discuss psychiatry in the region.</p>
<p>The activities, relevance and functioning of the College can only be enhanced by communicating and collaborating with our international colleagues and contributing to the improvement of mental health globally.</p>
