<abstract>
<p>In the 1980s, in Québec history textbooks, authors presented history through linear, monocausal designs and attributed most social, political or economic changes favourable to democracy to unstable external causes or to stable external causes. They seldom attributed the evolution of democracy to ‘unstable internal causes’. These textbooks presented citizens as having almost no active role in socio-historical changes. This invited students to analyse past controversial social issues from a fatalistic perspective or through subjective moral criteria, while reinforcing the assumption that people from the past had bad ideas that good people have fortunately refuted since. Québec history programmes were reformed, in the 2000s, for middle and high schools. This article presents the results of a content analysis of the new history textbooks used in Québec, to see whether they still present such a deterministic and relativist perspective of social change. The preliminary results show that they do.</p>

<body>
<p>Writing from a socio-cultural perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483649">Barton and Levstik (2004)</xref> argued that since socially determined goals necessarily affect human activity, some underlying logic, therefore, always guides history teaching, be it tacit or overt, and that scholarship should contribute to public debate about untested assumptions relating to the ends history education is really pursuing. Contribution to democratic citizenship being one of the main grounds for including history in the curriculum of many states (including Canada), research should analyse the means (practices and tools) mobilised in history classrooms to achieve those goals. Textbooks are often such means.</p>
<p>Textbooks (sometimes under new guises, like iBooks) are still held by many teachers to be bearers of official educational aims as well as the definite authority on historical fact and interpretation – or historical truth, according to the dominant objectivist paradigm still commonly espoused by teachers, as recent research reveals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197913483649">Therriault, 2008</xref>). As many history teachers appear to rely heavily on textbooks in their daily practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197913483649">Lebrun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483649">Charland, 2003</xref>), we seek to develop an understanding of the discourse found in such material in relation to general educational aims such as critical citizenship education, political literacy and the development of justice-oriented analysis and praxis. Aims of that kind were put forward to justify Québec history programmes reform, in the 2000s, for middle and high schools. Are textbooks that are presently used in Québec’s classroom for history teaching helping or thwarting attempts by teachers to prepare students for democratic citizenship? Are they helping students to appraise multiple causes of historical events and patterns, such as discrimination, exploitation, intolerance, oppression, violence and other democratic issues?</p>
<p>In the first part of the article, we present the context of our research and its theoretical framework. Issues of methodology will then be discussed, followed by the presentation of our preliminary analysis of textbook content pertaining to 5th century BC Athens and four Québec/Canada historical contexts.</p>
<sec id="section1-1746197913483649">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Among other lofty democratic claims formulated by Québec’s new history programme, official documents stipulate that by the end of their compulsory schooling, students will have been taught to see themselves as historical agents capable of and required to participate in collective decisions. They will also master the cognitive processes required to learn to deconstruct narratives and memory as well as to intervene in autonomous, critical, effective, informed, open, reasoned and rigorous ways. School history is presented by the formal curriculum as assisting students to construct and freely exercise the social and political dimensions of their citizen conscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197913483649">Lefrançois et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The official discourse goes on to claim that history education has broken away from chauvinistic narratives, be they Canadian, Québécois, male and so on, and from the mechanical memorisation of ‘facts’. There is not much new to these stated wishes, nor to the fact that once again, they are not fulfilled yet by the actualisation of this programme, although they are achievable. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483649">Cooper (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197913483649">1995</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197913483649">Cooper and Capita (2004)</xref>, for example, have established that even young children can deploy historical reasoning in early elementary years. But before going on with criticism of the new history programme, it must first be presented.</p>
<p>The programme is structured along 4 years of secondary school, from the 7th to the 10th grade. The first 2 years focus on what is officially referred to as World History, though it would be more appropriate to refer to History of Western Society, for a total of 150 hours. The last 2 years focus on national Québec history, first, from a chronological standpoint and second, along a more thematic approach, for a total of 200 hours. As early as 1996, a sub-committee mandated by the Education Ministry of Québec had requested that history education be given more hours in the overall school curriculum. The new programme is in keeping with this request.</p>
<p>The official title of the programme – ‘History and Citizenship Education’ – eloquently demonstrates the extent and central importance of the mandate given, first and foremost, to history teachers. Educating citizens, while a general educational aim to be striven for by all teachers, is officially considered to fall within the purview of history teachers in particular, who are asked to helpstudents develop an understanding of key concepts such as society, state, liberty, nation and so on, as well as three competencies, which should habilitate them for ‘open and enlightened social participation within the public sphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197913483649">Québec Ministère de l’Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport (MÉLS), 2006</xref>: 1). This implies that students will learn to problematise issues facing contemporary societies and question the origins of these issues (subject competency 1), to establish and interpret facts through historical attitudes, processes and concepts (subject competency 2), and, finally, to rationally debate, then act, while taking into account social and political implications and motivations of stakeholders’ propositions (subject competency 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197913483649">Québec Ministère de l’Éducation (MÉQ), 2004</xref>: 344–349). In sum, they should be able to make decisions, about public issues, that are ‘carefully reasoned, based on evidence and logical thought, and grounded in a realistic understanding of how the social world operates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483649">Barton, 2012</xref>: 131).</p>
<p>History didactics, in general, present two reasons in defence of history learning. Decision makers also use these reasons to justify curricular change. The first of these refers to the idea that attitudes, methods and cognitive processes subsumed by the historical method allow citizens to intervene in an open, enlightened and effective way in social and political life. By studying history, students are expected to learn to question and problematise social phenomena, as well as to deconstruct, rationally weigh, take position on and tolerantly debate arguments relative to contemporary public controversies. The second refers to the thesis that studying history can help students recognise human action as the motor of historical change. Some extrapolate this to the idea that students who are conscious of their historical agency (who consider themselves as co-authors of their own actions and of history<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746197913483649">1</xref></sup>) should be motivated more to act politically(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197913483649">Éthier and Lefrançois, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These skills embody citizenship aims of the ‘History and citizenship education’ programme. To help develop these skills, teachers requested they be integrated in teaching materials. In fact, since 2005, 17 new didactic sets and more than 25 workbooks destined for the ‘History and citizenship education’ course have been published, in French or in English, and purchased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746197913483649">Lefrançois et al., 2011</xref>). However, no study has yet verified whether massively renewing teaching materials supports the development of competencies that programmes aim to develop, and, in the case of history, the fulfilment of the programmes’ citizenship aims. We wonder whether textbooks contribute to students’ recognition of the power of collective agency to act upon the present and mould the future; whether they are likely to lead students to see themselves as the subjects of a complex history, which they believe they can, at least in part influence through social debate and action within the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197913483649">MÉLS, 2006</xref>: 60, 80); and whether they provide conditions to lead ‘students to understand that democracy is the result of a long process which each generation is called upon to pursue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197913483649">MÉQ, 2004</xref>: 348).</p>
<p>This is the curricular renewal context that has led the Education Ministry of Québec to grant over US$350 million, since 2002, for the purchase of officially approved instructional packages (comprising students’ textbooks and teachers’ handbooks), ‘forcefully requested by schools to help implement the curricular reform’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197913483649">Chouinard, 2002</xref>: A3). Between 2006 and 2010, Québec schools purchased 13 French-language and 4 English history instructional packages – a total of 9922 pages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483649">MÉLS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This mass entry of new textbook material in schools has of course awakened history didactics researchers’ curiosity, further encouraged to invest this field of investigation by the opportunity to put their theoretical framework to the test upon unexplored, though familiar, ground.</p>
<p>Endless research has indeed – for many years and with great consistency – documented the major flaws of history textbooks – notably with regard to omissions, bias and social, ethnic and sexual stereotypes, to name but a few (one can refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746197913483649">Pratt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197913483649">Derman-Sparks, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197913483649">Baquès, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483649">Boutonnet, 2009</xref>). Recent research and literature reviews, nonetheless, point to how textbooks impose discourse upon students, exert a decisive influence on lesson planning (sometimes even being used as substitutes for curriculum), occupy the greater portion of class time and induce educational practices that are ill-fitted for learning higher order intellectual skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483649">Lebrun, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746197913483649">Spallanzani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197913483649">Lebrun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483649">Éthier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197913483649">Therriault, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In Québec, research has been funded to look into how new secondary school history textbooks perpetuate stereotypes against Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197913483649">Triki-Yamani et al., 2011</xref>), how they contribute to improve reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197913483649">Blaser, 2008</xref>), or the importance they give to the main ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483649">Lefrançois and Éthier, 2011</xref>), for example, focusing mainly on the French-language texts. In other words, research has of yet shown little interest in paratext (instructions, tasks and questions, maps, figures, iconography, historical sources, historiographical excerpts, etc.), teacher handbooks, student workbooks or English-language instructional packages.</p>
<p>More importantly, current research appears to neglect a fundamental aspect of the citizenship education expected from the history programme, that is, the function and actions that instructional packages ascribe to the various historical agents in socio-political change. If students are indeed expected to emerge from school conceiving of themselves as empowered historical subjects, they must not be prevented from understanding history as a process constructed, inter alia, by such historical subjects in the past. Recent research does not establish either individual or collective historical actors’ identity or role in the conquest of democratic rights lauded by the textbooks. To this day, it has not been ascertained to whom or to what textbooks attribute the causes of democratically favourable change. What kind of citizenship practices underlies iconographic and textual content? In other words, are citizens and human groups ever portrayed as causing historical change? Who is portrayed as agents of change?</p>
<p>We propose to present within the limited scope of this article the preliminary analysis of a subset of the data gathered in preparation for a systematic and comparative content analysis of textbooks. Our research objectives are as follows:</p>

<sec id="section2-1746197913483649">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Our theoretical framework borrows from semiotics. By adapting some literary analysis categories from the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197913483649">Bakhtine (2003)</xref> on the structure of prose, we seek to identify to whom (which historical figures, which groups, etc.) the causes of rupture, continuity and change over time are attributed, and which agents are portrayed as protagonists, receivers or beneficiaries, executants or spectators of action. In addition to defining categories of agents associated with historically significant quests, we hope to identify, as they appear, models of citizenship practices intrinsic to historical agents’ actions. This research thus aims to use content analysis adapted from Greimas’ semiotic theory, more specifically, the actantial model, to identify which models of citizenship practices are set forth by textbook texts and paratext (including illustrations).</p>
<p>Greimas’ model defines narrative as a quest in which characters (actants) play one of six roles: sponsor, receiver, subject or hero, object, opponent or auxiliary. Hence, calling on the most-often used example, one could take the legend of King Arthur and narrate it this way: Percival (the subject) seeks, on Arthur’s request (sponsor) to find the Holy Grail (object) in order to save humanity (receiver or beneficiary), with the help of Merlin (assistant or auxiliary) and in spite of Morgana’s (opponent) obstruction. As this example demonstrates, narrative analysis based on the actantial model identifies the recurrent roles assigned to characters (whether they are individual, collective, living, inert, real or imaginary) of various literary genres (such as fairy tales), but also in argumentative text such as historical accounts or essays. They refer to actants as those who accomplish, are submitted to or obstruct the main action of a story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197913483649">Greimas, 1966</xref>: 33, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197913483649">1983</xref>: 155).</p>
<p>In the case which concerns us, quests may aim to diminish, maintain or increase equality as the basis for democracy – in other words, to confer the governed with a greater hold on public power, increase its reach, ensure it is not reduced, and so on. In such cases, quests would be defined as democratic, whereas those that aim to increase or maintain inequality, to restrict the governed’s effective capacity to determine their own fate, or to exploit them would be defined as anti-democratic.</p>
<p>The actantial model designates those acting as subjects of these quests (consciously pursued or not), their receivers or beneficiaries and so forth. These actors may be special or ordinary individuals, abstract entities and so on. The sponsors, receivers, subjects, assistants and opponents of these quests, if they are human, may be those who govern as well as those who are governed. Some attributes of this assortment of actors allow us to group them according to the perceived causes of success or failure of democratic and anti-democratic quests. The latter can, in fact, be efficient, neutral or counterproductive. We will come back to this later.</p>
<p>Expanding democracy can be conceived as a political quest, that is, an act by subjects to obtain greater equality and reciprocity (quantitatively or qualitatively) or to prevent them from diminishing (or, conversely, to diminish equality and reciprocity or prevent them from increasing), whether the act bears a positive or negative outcome. Narratives from selected textbook chapters must be described and analysed with regard to political evolution in order to find out which actors textbook authors destine for which quests, which objects have been assigned to these quests and who receives or benefits from them. We hypothesise that very few actants will be part of the narrative and that in spite of a few exceptions, citizens will be absent or have their role restricted to that of assistants or auxiliaries.</p>
<p>The perception of causes can be classified according to three attributional dimensions formulated by analogy with Weiner’s classic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197913483649">Weiner, 1979</xref>: 18; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1746197913483649">Viau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483649">Éthier, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483649">2006</xref>). The first dimension refers to the location of the cause, which may be internal or external to the subject. Hence, if intellectual aptitude constitutes a cause, success or failure is derived from an internal locus of control, whereas if difficulty of the task or economic condition is perceived as a cause, locus of control for success or failure is external. The second dimension deals with the stability of the cause, distinguishing between permanent (and stable) causes and those that can vary repeatedly and are modifiable. Effort and organisation can be seen as modifiable causes, while attributing success in partisan politics to charisma is by nature invariable. The last dimension refers to controllability, where causes are seen to be controllable if agents are perceived to have influence over them. If the fact that the agent decides to get involved or to organise (or not) and this involvement or organisation is deemed to be a cause of success or failure, one can refer to controllable cause. Conversely, when agents exert no power over causes, these are seen to be uncontrollable. We would include in this category causes that are out of agents’ control: fatality, providence, chance, human nature, and so on.</p>
<p>By combining two of these dimensions, it is possible to delineate four categories of actors in an historical text, which can be conceived through the actantial model as the subjects of a quest. The first category refers to external stable causes and includes transcendental causes or causes that are not known by the governed and cannot be modified, such as chance or the laws of history. The second category comprises external modifiable causes, which are external to the governed, but which can vary, such as the will of an exceptional individual. The third category encompasses internal stable causes, which are inherent to the governed, who nevertheless have no hold over them, such as human nature, egotism and wickedness. The final category relates to internal modifiable causes, which are under the governed’s control and which they can modify – their individual involvement or their membership in and contribution to an organisation would be such a cause.</p>
<p>Although they base their writing on a vast corpus of evidence, historians attribute, most of the time (if not always), causes for historical change to one or more of these four categories of agents. The above framework allows for analysing their scholarly writings, as well as textbooks.</p>
<p>In addition, authors may perceive quests to have different outcomes: Quests can be successful or in vain, they can even produce outcomes opposite to those expected. Claiming a democratic right may be considered a democratic quest, even in circumstances where it produces no positive change in claimants’ fate. Such an outcome would make it a neutral or counterproductive quest. The 70 BC revolt of 70,000 Roman slaves ‘led’ by Spartacus was a democratic action (because they fought for freedom against slavery), though it ended in bloody repression. Textbook authors may thus qualify or describe quests as efficient, counterproductive or neutral.</p>
<p>While Greimas’ actantial model allows for the analysis of historical actors’ agency, our analysis of citizenship models promoted by textbook authors through paratext requires another layer of theoretical framework. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746197913483649">Westheimer and Kahne’s (2004)</xref> research regarding the types of citizens schools aim to educate provides three categories that can be used to analyse citizenship practices. According to this typology, citizens can be</p>

<title>Method and data set</title>
<p>The structure, content and tasks presented by the Québec history textbooks reviewed for this research were analysed in order to establish how authors presented the social groups which constitute Québec society, and which social and historical roles they attributed to these groups. The method used was based on coding and categorising text segments according to the theoretical framework. More specifically, the units of analysis were composed of texts written by textbook authors, historical documents (written and iconographic) and paratext (i.e. student tasks). Thematic analysis through pre-established categories lead to coding semantic units according to a list of indicators associated with aforementioned actantial model elements. Relevant to this study was the triangulation through ‘interjudge agreement’ (agreement of researchers) on their respective coding. This allowed for the adjustment of the initial analytical grid. A subsequent analysis of the stability of coding by researchers proved the grid to be effective. The data set is composed of five French-language textbooks’ treatment of 5th century BC Athens and written for first-year secondary Québec students, as well as the chapters from four French language textbooks, called <italic>Les Premiers Occupants</italic> (‘First Nations’), <italic>Les Français et l’émergence d’une société en Nouvelle-France</italic> (‘The Emergence of a Society in New France’) and <italic>Le changement d’empire</italic> (‘Change of Empire’) for grade-9 students, and <italic>Culture et movement de pensée</italic> (‘Culture and Currents of Thought’) for grade-10 students – chapters that were selected because they address political and democratic ‘development’, comprising a total of 1242 pages. Teacher handbooks and student workbooks were omitted from this subsample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746197913483649" sec-type="results">
<title>Results: textbooks, historical agency and democracy</title>
<p>There emerges from the analysis of all five textbooks a prevailing premise regarding democracy: real, true democracy is the right to participate in the decisions of the society in which one lives. However, the idea that democracy is acting to guarantee rights (to housing, healthcare, residency, etc.) is almost nowhere present.</p>
<p>Such a premise stems from specific assumptions about democracy and also leads to other correlates and certainly to some contradictions. First, democracy is associated with the possibility to defend one’s opinions, to vote or to get elected. Second, the history of present-day democracy is seen to originate with 5th century BC Athens, having existed nowhere else or at no other time before, then having disappeared for a long time until its re-inception in 18th-century Western Europe and North America. However, Athens’ first democratic experience differs from democracy as we presume it to be today, as it excluded over three quarters of the city-state’s population and was furthermore founded on collective rather than representative participation. Textbook authors present this latter point not as a quality of Athenian democracy but as a flaw.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a contradiction: Athens is both good, as the birthplace of <italic>Real</italic> democracy, the very same democracy found in Québec, and bad, as it functioned according to a model different from that associated with <italic>Real</italic> democracy. Textbooks must reveal and overcome this apparent contradiction.</p>
<p>Despite the Athenian Assembly’s importance, textbooks do not provide students with examples of acting citizens or collective action. On the contrary, assemblies are portrayed as inefficient, time-consuming and controlled by military and demagogic elites. The governed (ordinary citizens, slaves, women, etc.) are rarely present. When they do appear, they are never portrayed as actors (with rare exceptions), but as objects, assistants, beneficiaries or victims. Indeed, textbook authors stress that women are not allowed to vote and that they perform all domestic tasks, that metics have no political rights and cannot own land and that slaves are property and perform the most difficult manual labour. No examples of these categories of actors struggling against or resisting their condition are ever presented.</p>
<p>‘Great’ historical figures, on the contrary, are presented as those who make history, as its true subjects. The names of Cleisthenes and Pericles are very much in evidence, as sponsors of democracy, and other traditional heroes appear, though not as often. This is the case for Draco, Solo, Pisistratus, Themistocles, Ephialtes and Cimon.</p>
<p>Discourse found in the selected chapter contains almost no traces of social struggles directed at obtaining greater democracy before or during the period under study. The people, as they were, are portrayed as having done nothing favourable for the advent of democratic institutions or ideals. Everything is shown to happen as if democracy self-generated or was borne from the will of great individuals enlightened by some democratic revelation. Cleisthenes, for example, is shown to push for the adoption of measures to limit the power of rich families.</p>
<p>There are, nonetheless, two notable exceptions (or quasi-exceptions) to this single-minded narrative. The first takes on the issue of stasis (this is the textbook excerpt in question): ‘Everyone wishes for change. Revolts break out. The rich families lose the exclusivity of power’. While it does reveal that struggle took place, no subject of this struggle is identified, no person is the bearer of the action. The second excerpt involves a collective agent portrayed favourably: ‘Athenian leaders will head the first democratic experience in the history of Greece’. Here again, however, students are presented with the governing elite rather than the governed as agents of change.</p>
<p>In the chapter ‘Culture and currents of thought’, social interactions are often presented as conflictual (as power relationships), and their treatment by authors demonstrates that the evolution of currents of thought is a product of confrontation, and conditioned by the ruling class, though some groups remain present and have obtained important gains (workers, women, First Nations). For grades 9 and 10, 55% of items relating to social change show groups as instigators of social change and actors/subjects of history. Most often, groups are members of the clergy (Jesuits, missionaries, priests, etc.) or the ruling class (nationalists, Grits, Liberals, etc.) but also social groups (workers, French-Canadians, women, etc.). Evidence of social struggle is more apparent and most probably reflects the nature of the chapter (‘Culture and currents of thoughts’), which deals more clearly with this theme. Yet, groups are making history: workers, feminist, First Nations and linguistic minorities.</p>
<p>Otherwise, 26% of items pertain to ‘great’ historical figures presented as the true actors/subjects of history. Most often, they are part of the ruling class (the monarch, Prime Minister, politicians, clergymen) or actors from the liberal professions (journalists, merchants, artists, writers, etc.). An important part of items (16%) pertaining to historical agency is associated with anthropomorphised agents who act as human beings but are merely political or cultural entities: the state, governments, countries, socialism, communism, and so on.</p>
<p>There are variations, from one textbook to the next, in the importance assigned to ‘great figures’ of history. We can note, for example and without any statistical pretensions, that the authors of one textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>) refer to 35 religious and military figures, industrialists, aristocrats, prime ministers, governors and intendants in contrast to 7 cinematographers, writers, artists, philosophers, intellectuals, architects and journalists in a chapter pertaining to ‘Culture and currents of thought’ (a total of 42 historical agents), while the authors of another textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483649">Dalongeville et al., 2008</xref>), for the same chapter, refer to 10 figures from the first category and 10 from the second (20 historical agents).</p>
<p>In addition to the <italic>great historical figure</italic>, authors also attribute a pivotal role to another type of historical agent: the anthropomorphised abstract entity.</p>
<p>Ideology, for example, is frequently anthropomorphised:<disp-quote>
<p>French-Canadian nationalism between 1920 and 1950 attempts to find solutions to the consequences of the Depression, but also to counter socialism, communism, and fascism, which also propose alternatives to capitalist and industrial development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 62)</p>
<p>At the end of the 1970’s and in the 1980’s, feminism, whether it be reformist or radical, diversifies its means and extends its opposition to other factors of discrimination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 72)</p>
<p>The militarisation of society imposes a strict system of moral values on the Japanese […]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 232)</p>
<p>Industrialisation and urbanisation, which are beginning in Japan, foster a new cultural and intellectual effervescence. It will however be used by military imperialism (1912–1945), which instrumentalises culture to nationalistic ends. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 232)</p>
<p>Traditionalist French-Canadian nationalism is a current of thought which goes beyond the defence of French Canadians’ rights. It is also a response to the concerns arising from the rapid modernisation of society. On the political level, this nationalism did not aim for Québec’s independence, though the temptation to do so may have existed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 202)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their narration, authors frequently assign external causes to change in the form of another type of anthropomorphised historical agent: the geographical or political entity:<disp-quote>
<p>Among others, from this period on and for centuries to come, the Ottoman Empire reinforces its grip on the North African coast, with the exception of the Kingdom of Morocco. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 237)</p>
<p>During the second half of the 19th century, France dominates the whole of Senegal, which generates a profound upheaval for its population. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 238)</p>
<p>In the same period, many European nations (Belgium and Poland, for example) as well as is the case in Latin America (such as in Venezuela, Columbia and Argentina) revolt against the established political order and fight to take control of their destiny. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483649">Bédard and Cardin, 2007</xref>: 376)</p>
<p>Between 1639 and 1853, Japan indeed refuses all diplomatic and commercial contact with the outside world, though the study of Western sciences continues on a limited scale. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483649">Bédard and Cardin, 2007</xref>: 417)</p>
<p>Near the end of the 1990’s, India begins important reforms by liberalising its economy and providing more space for private business. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483649">Dalongeville et al., 2008</xref>: 88)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At times, agents are presented as abstract entities that, in essence, correspond to institutions, such as the constitution and human rights. They may also be constituted of groups of people, which may be confused with territory, the State or other political creations:<disp-quote>
<p>By adopting the Act of Québec, which replaces the Test Oath by an oath of allegiance to the king, re-establishes French civil laws, and recognizes the Catholic religion, Great-Britain believes that unlike their neighbors, Canadians will not demand the same rights as their British counterparts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 32)</p>
<p>Within the framework of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, individual fundamental rights are guaranteed by a constitution and by law. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 33)</p>
<p>In 1867, Confederation calls upon all Canadians to unite within one nation and to share a single identity, in spite of past disagreements. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483649">Bédard and Cardin, 2007</xref>: 388)</p>
<p>In order to rectify flaws in the educational system, Jean Lesage’s liberal provincial government, elected in 1960, implements a series of measures. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 66)</p>
<p>This is the perspective from which the provincial government signs the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and promises to consult with the Inuit and Innu nations in regard to issues which concern them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 71)</p>
<p>The government of Quebec draws inspiration from policies adopted on an international scale regarding the preservation of world heritage. It has notably adopted a new definition of heritage, as proposed by the UNESCO at the turn of the 21st century. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 85)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Human activities or actual objects created by man sometimes come to life in the textbooks:<disp-quote>
<p>The newspaper printed by Mesplet beginning in 1778 constitutes the principal means of spreading liberal ideas. The newspaper also defends the separation of church and state, and denounces the Canadian nobility and clergy who are opposed to the establishment of a legislative assembly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 35)</p>
<p>The adoption of conscription in 1917 gives rise to riots in many parts of the province, in particular in Quebec City, where people are killed by the riots. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 59)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the second example, the riots, rather than, say, the police, cause the loss of human life (including that of the rioters). In fact, ordinary humans, the governed, the oppressed and the exploited of all walks of life are not only rarely present, but when they are presented as subjects of history (which is even more rarely), they are shown to be inefficient or isolated agents, as demonstrated by the next two examples:<disp-quote>
<p>Reformist feminist demands face many opponents who consider that granting women access to education, and political and legal rights constitutes a threat to the social order. The Catholic Church and the tenants of survival nationalism are not alone in their rejection of feminist demands: some women also share their opinion, In 1922, a petition requesting that government not recognize women’s right to vote is published in the daily <italic>La Presse</italic>. It is signed by 45 000 women. In spite of the unfavourable welcome received by feminist demands, women are granted voting rights in 1918 at the federal level and in 1940, at the provincial level. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483649">Fortin et al., 2008</xref>: 52)</p>
<p>Since the 1980’s, the feminist movement, strengthened by its victories and gains, has been gradually running out of breath. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 211)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the chapters titled ‘First Nations’ and ‘The emergence of a society in New France’ for grade-9 students, the authors of one of the textbooks insists on indigenous resistance to French explorers and to Native contributions to the exploration of new territories by the French (in a common territorial construction). At the same time, as is the case with the other textbooks, the pervasive idea that Natives can be reduced to historical objects manipulated by various Western interest groups remains present (‘members of the Canadian elite preferred the Panis, an indigenous nation of docile temperament from the Mississippi Valley’), rather than the idea that indigenous people were participants in a relationship, which was at times mutually beneficial with regard to some socio-historically situated criteria:<disp-quote>
<p>In order to promote the adoption of Christian values by indigenous nations, the Catholic clergy encouraged the settlement of the colony. It encountered resistance from the trading companies, whose interest lied in commerce and profit, and who perceived anything which distracted Natives from hunting as a threat. In 1635, Jesuits founded their missions in Huron-Wendat territory, where they worked to evangelise the population. From there, they explored the territory to reach other nations and thus contributed to the fur trade.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Every textbook author emphasised presumably unilateral European influence. The European way of life is presented as having been little transformed by contact with indigenous people, excepting some influence on vocabulary and clothing. In the development of the fur trade as organised by the French crown, trading companies and their merchants, Natives are portrayed as auxiliaries: ‘the Montagnais [sic] become commercial intermediaries between the French and other indigenous nations’. In the chapter titled ‘Change of Empire’, indigenous resistance is present, but discreet, and it serves the history of the French ethnic group: ‘a short time prior to the signature of the Treaty of Paris, native allies of the French resisted against British occupation’. The textbook that produced this excerpt is the only one that presented consequences of the change of Empire for indigenous nations (‘Pontiac is the main instigator of the rebellion of the Great Lakes indigenous nations against the British’).</p>
<p>This preliminary analysis allows one to see that national history textbooks leave little space for non-European agents. In addition, causal explanations of historical change as presented by textbook authors leave the impression of derogation by agents who are not great historical figures (in the case of the French, then the Canadians and later the French-Canadians, military leaders, the nobility, bishops, etc., hold all the power to provoke social change). Geopolitical entities are personified as acting historical agents, as we have already seen. Examples of participation in collective life and opportunities for public debate about social issues are seldom presented, thus weakening the critical, utopic and prospective functions ascribed by scholarly history and political theory to the learning of history and its processes. Here are some examples of a monolithic depiction of agents:<disp-quote>
<p>In contrast with what had occurred under the French regime, one now dares to openly discuss political and ideological issues … and even to oppose the powers in place. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483649">Bédard and Cardin, 2007</xref>: 371)</p>
<p>In the wake of the Quiet Revolution, the Québecois reject religious values associated with past traditionalism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483649">Bédard and Cardin, 2007</xref>: 405)</p>
<p>Through fashion, they [women] manifest their desire for freedom as well as their political and social demands. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483649">Dalongeville et al., 2008</xref>: 54)</p>
<p>Francophones, who have little schooling, do not participate in business and make up the labour force of businesses managed by Anglophones. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483649">Dalongeville et al., 2008</xref>: 58)</p>
<p>Individualist values become increasingly important among the population. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483649">Thibeault et al., 2008</xref>: 229)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Text is also accompanied by extensive paratext, the latter being essentially made up of iconographic documents (maps and illustrations), in addition to a glossary, timeline, diagrams and written documents, such as historical source documents or more contemporary interpretations.</p>
<p>The textbooks present an abundance of maps of Europe and some world maps. However, the latter show North America as uninhabited in the 5th century BC, which is surprising, to say the least. Illustrations are mainly composed of pictures of statues of ‘great’ historical figures –artefacts, as it were. The figure most often presented is a statue of Pericles, though Solo, Themistocles, and some philosophers are also represented.</p>
<p>One also notes that the chronology presented is exclusively related to political institutions and war, from which emerges a teleological discourse based on a mechanical evolution or linear succession of steps inevitably leading to greater and greater democracy, moving from monarchy to oligarchy to Solo, Cleisthenes and the Athenian golden age of democracy.</p>
<p>The diagrams serve to illustrate either the structure of political institutions (those of Québec as well as those of Athens) or the social and political exclusion associated with Athens, though here no reference to such exclusion in Québec is provided.</p>
<p>Some contemporary examples of democracy or democratic action are presented. This is the case of one textbook, which presents the petition initiated by a young woman, Virginie Larivière, against firearms, and of another, which presents a demonstration against a coal-generated power station (the Suroît). In both cases, the emphasis is placed on the importance of having one’s voice heard, as if to say that all leaders need is to hear the information provided by the people’s voice to understand a phenomenon and put an end to its negative consequences.</p>
<p>Every one of the middle school textbooks also provides students with short quotes, mostly from Euripides and Plato, arguing against democracy, ironically, though they do quote Pericles as saying just the opposite.</p>
<p>The student tasks, which are presented alongside these sources and the questions found in the textbooks, focus students’ attention on scanning for and understanding information presented in documents or in the main text. They do not require that students problematise real phenomena nor do they call for heuristic use of concepts, method and so on to evaluate historical interpretation or for argumentation.</p>
<p>These tasks promote citizenship practices and participation associated with responsible or participatory citizens – types 1 or 2 from Westheimer and Kahne’s typology. Participation and practices, which could be associated with a type 3 citizen – one who is oriented towards justice – are nowhere to be seen. Here are some examples of tasks:</p>
<list id="list3-1746197913483649" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Describe how Pericles fosters democracy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Demonstrate how all citizens in Québec are equal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify an impact of the lack of interest towards democracy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Name venues where one can express his or her views.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Create a survey about democracy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Organise a poster contest to promote voting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Give one’s opinion: ‘Should freedom of expression be limited?’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify public institutions in one’s community and determine which services they provide for citizens.</p></list-item>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The exploratory research presented here entails a number of limitations. First, we have yet to analyse all the textbooks. Second, and most importantly, we have not taken into account how teachers use the textbooks, and we have no idea of how students understand or interact with their content. The second phase of our research will include all the other chapters, while the third phase aims to examine how students and teachers use the textbooks, workbooks and handbooks, in both languages and throughout Québec.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can already determine that textbooks provide students with the basis for a misleading vision of the world, which does nothing to empower them as citizens, despite explicit claims to the contrary in the curriculum documents. Research on history teaching and learning demonstrates the persistence of ‘transmissive’ teaching practices, characterised by a single ‘factual’ narrative that students must reproduce, by the absence of socially sensitive issues, source heuristics, call to authority (of sources), reducing student tasks to spotting information and faithfully reproducing it. The same body of research shows that most often, observed teaching practices model themselves to the structure of textbooks, thus hindering the development of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483649">Barton, 2012</xref>). In our study, one can see that textbooks present the cause of political change as external and modifiable, and that the governed are not portrayed as subjects of history. Finally, textbook narrative and paratext are marked by a <italic>telos</italic> and a portrayal of history and indeed history education as reification. As such, textbooks do not provide fertile ground for – and may even become obstacles to – reflecting on the roots of systemic injustice, which characterises many social and cultural interactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1746197913483649" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Some brief comments, to conclude. Scientific implications of this first stage of our research are twofold: first, the analytical grid based on the actantial model and on Westheimer and Kahne’s typology has proven theoretically sound in analysing textbook narrative and paratext and it will be improved. Second, some hypotheses can be tested on the basis of this preliminary analysis, specifically in relation to teaching and learning history.</p>
<p>In addition, the results of this exploratory study hold some social implications, the first being that in their present state and if used <italic>as is</italic>, Québec history textbooks do not appear to be useful tools for educating critical citizens. Finally, there are educational implications pertaining to textbooks, namely, that they should be deconstructed in class, with students learning to problematise their narrative as a historically and socially situated phenomenon.</p>

<p>We use the concept of ‘historical agency’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483649">Barton (2012)</xref> defines it. The concept is composed of three dimensions: (1) agency and the subjects of history – subjects of history are seen as actors of history, as (explicit or implicit) initiators of actions in which is assigned accountability, a responsibility for events, processes and so on in history; (2) agency and the actions in history – there are intentional human causes of actions and constraints on these actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746197913483649">Seixas, 2006</xref>). Actions are complex and may involve nameable individuals, collective entities (which, to varying degrees, deal with internal diversity) and interactions and (3) agency and choices in history – the actions of people in history are related to beliefs, attitudes, moral standards, socio-economic perspectives on the world and so on, in which their choices are exercised (in order to maintain or change them).</p>
