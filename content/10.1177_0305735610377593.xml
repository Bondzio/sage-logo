<abstract>
<p>This article examines empirically and systematically whether a string quartet (SQ) ensemble is perceived as a self-managed team (SMT). SMTs, which were initially employed in the industrial world, are groups of employees that have a total responsibility for a defined project. The hypothesis that the SQ would exhibit more typical SMT characteristics than other music ensembles was established in one experiment and reconfirmed in a second experiment. The assessment of the SMT characteristics in these experiments was based on an adaptation of the Self-Managing Work Team Effectiveness questionnaire that had been originally devised for working groups in the business context, and was proven in the present study to be appropriate for music ensembles as well. Possible ways to implement these interdisciplinary findings are suggested.</p>

<body>
<p>The string quartet (SQ) has been grabbing the attention of musicians and theoreticians for the past two centuries, not only for being an outstanding musical ensemble but also because of its unique organizational characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735610377593">Menuhin’s (1996)</xref> words serve as an example for this view:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The quality of listening, the quality of ‘teamwork’, of adjusting to one another, of recognizing the main voice wherever it may be, of reconciling the different accents and inflections, and purity of intonation, is unequalled by any other ensemble except perhaps human voices themselves. (p. 248)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The SQ has become the chamber ensemble par excellence of western art music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735610377593">Brinner, 1995</xref>) and much attention has been given to the ways in which the members of this ensemble succeed in producing such outstanding products. Musically speaking, there is a complex interplay between the individual roles of the players and their collective role as a group. On the one hand, each SQ player preserves his or her identity while playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610377593">Baron, 1998</xref>) but, on the other hand, members of an SQ work as a team to create a cohesive and compelling musical performance. This duality is stimulating not only from the musical perspective but also from organizational and social aspects, which will be the focus of the present study. There has been a continuing search to combine the individual’s contribution with the group outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735610377593">Fogg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735610377593">Schweiger &amp; Sandberg, 1989</xref>; Stevens &amp; Campion, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735610377593">Robbins, 2003</xref>). The SQ could be a great source of inspiration for analyzing and designing effective working groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610377593">Hackman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735610377593">Lagace, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There are different types of teams in organizations, and each type may be involved with specific tasks and exhibit unique characteristics. These include business teams, cross-functional teams, project teams, ad-hoc teams, problem-solving teams, and virtual teams (Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, &amp; Cardy, 1998). However, it seems that there is one type of team that resembles the work of the SQ, namely the Self-Managed Team (SMT).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305735610377593">2</xref></sup> This is a group of employees that is responsible for a whole product or process, that does work that involves designing, evaluating and performing, takes posession of the results, and manages many of the things for which supervision or management are usually responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610377593">Attaran &amp; Nguyen, 2000</xref>). Research has shown that under certain conditions, such as a proper organizational culture, SMTs are productive and effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610377593">Frankforter &amp; Christensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735610377593">Sagoe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735610377593">Yeatts, Cready, Ray, DeWitt, &amp; Queen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study we aim to take a first step in examining whether SQs can actually be considered as SMTs. Substantiating such a connection and refining its limits will serve further studies, which could use the information to optimize SQ work as well as SMT working patterns. In the following literature review we will refer in more detail to SMTs, to their unique characteristics and to their effectiveness in the organizational world. We will also refer to SQs and to studies that have examined their social and organizational aspects.</p>
<sec id="section1-0305735610377593">
<title>About self-managed teams</title>
<p>The concept of the SMT originated with the socio-technical approach in which autonomous groups emerged as producing the most efficient work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735610377593">Emery &amp; Trist, 1960</xref>). The SMT concept is also linked with the Quality of Work Life Movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610377593">Hackman &amp; Lawler, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610377593">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0305735610377593">Wall, Kemp, Jackson, &amp; Clegg, 1986</xref>) oriented toward job enrichment and improved employee satisfaction.</p>
<p>SMTs are empowered to be responsible for a ‘whole’ work process, which delivers a product or service to an internal or external customer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735610377593">Wellins, Byham, &amp; Wilson, 1991</xref>). Workers are responsible for managing themselves. Team members work together to improve their operations, to handle day-to-day problems, and to plan and control their work. The work carried out is usually designed to give ‘team ownership’ of a product, service or process. SMTs set their own goals (aligned with the corporate strategy) and choose their own working methods. The team members manage their own schedule and review their own performance. They may prepare their own budget, coordinate with other departments, order materials from suppliers and be responsible for developing skills within the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735610377593">Goodman, Devadas, &amp; Hughson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735610377593">Manz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735610377593">Milkovich &amp; Boudreau, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735610377593">Polley &amp; Van Dyne, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735610377593">Sharp &amp; Kagioglou, 1997</xref>). SMTs are best suited for situations where the work requires the cooperation of several people working interdependently on complex tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610377593">Frankforter &amp; Christensen, 2005</xref>). Since SMTs operate within a larger organization, they must coordinate their efforts with other organizational units. Thus, they do not have complete autonomy but rather function as semi-autonomous groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735610377593">Polley &amp; Ribbens, 1998</xref>). Various companies, such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Federal Express, General Electric, Motorola, FDA, AT&amp;T, Boeing, Digital, and the Harley-Davidson Motor Company plant, have implemented SMTs successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735610377593">Lawler, Mohrman &amp; Ledford, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735610377593">Orsburn, Moran, Musselwhite, &amp; Zenger, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have shown the advantages of the SMT over traditional working groups. Factors such as increased employee job satisfaction and motivation, improved communication and shorter decision time, improved employee self-esteem and decreased cost control (i.e., this approach requires fewer managers and supervisors), have been found to be better in SMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735610377593">Beekun, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610377593">Cohen &amp; Ledford, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610377593">Frankforter &amp; Christensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735610377593">Sagoe, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610377593">Cohen and Ledford (1994)</xref> systematically matched SMTs in a telecommunication company against comparable traditional teams performing the same type of work and showed that members of SMTs had higher levels of satisfaction concerning their jobs, growth and social needs. Ratings of group performance generally favored the SMTs and the level of absenteeism was relatively low (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610377593">Frankforter &amp; Christensen (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735610377593">Sagoe (1994)</xref> regarding growth in productivity after implementing SMTs).</p>
<p>Leadership in SMTs is quite unique. Team members share or rotate leadership and hold themselves mutually responsible and accountable for a set of performance goals. Each team member must develop qualities of a leader such as risk taking and receptivity to new ideas and directions in addition to technical expertise. Studies have shown that this approach to leadership resulted in increased commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735610377593">Mothusamy, Wheeler &amp; Simmons, 2005</xref>), a higher level of cooperation and performance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735610377593">Erez, Lepine &amp; Elms, 2002</xref>), and motivational, social and cognitive advantages over teams led by a single individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735610377593">Solansky, 2008</xref>). It would be a mistake, however, to assume that SMTs are ‘leaderless’ or that they never need management intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610377593">Capozzoli, 2006</xref>). These teams need coaching or guidance. The organization’s management can appoint people to fill the role of ‘coordinator’, a leadership role external to the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735610377593">Manz &amp; Sims, 1987</xref>). This person might be a facilitator or a counselor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735610377593">Moravec, Johannessen &amp; Hjelmas, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Several researchers have tried to formulate a theoretical framework to define the factors connected to good SMT work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735610377593">Carson, Mosley &amp; Boyar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735610377593">Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735610377593">Molleman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735610377593">Orsburn et al., 1990</xref>). Cohen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610377593">Cohen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen, Ledford &amp; Spreitzer, 1996</xref>) offered an integrative model of self-managed team effectiveness based on several theories of organizational behavior and empirical work. The model includes four major factors:</p>

<title>The string quartet as a social and organizational unit</title>
<p>Various scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735610377593">Ellis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735610377593">Nissel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0305735610377593">Page, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735610377593">Poulson, Christian, &amp; Abraham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610377593">Scott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0305735610377593">Seth, 1999</xref>) have focused on the importance of the interpersonal relationships among SQ members. These relationships include characteristics such as learning to weave together separate personalities, managing conflict, sharing responsibility and supporting each other. Other empirical studies examined the SQ in terms of group function. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735610377593">Butterworth (1990)</xref>, for example, undertook a case study of the Detroit String Quartet, using observations and interviews, to learn how it worked as a team. Findings showed that social-organizational factors were important elements in the work of the SQ and that they were some of the major reasons for its success. Ensemble members had complete autonomy to decide which tasks they would perform and what norms of conduct would guide their behavior. Members experienced a strong sense of collective responsibility for the outcome of their work and there was no supervisor or manager constraining the quartet’s choices. Apparently, this was a self-governing ensemble (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610377593">Blum (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735610377593">Rounds (1999)</xref> who have explored the group processes of SQs by examining conversations and inside stories of SQ members, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735610377593">Young and Colman’s (1979)</xref> theoretical essay on the subject).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610377593">Murnighan and Conlon (1991)</xref> performed a large-scale study of 20 professional British SQs, using semi-structured interviews and observations. They found that the more successful quartets tended to concentrate on making music during rehearsal, rather than talking about it. These quartets were able to perceive conflict as a positive and healthy part of their working process. Leadership style was also found to influence the effectiveness of the quartet. In the most successful quartets, the first violinists tended to be both directive and democratic, whereas in unsuccessful quartets, leaders often feigned a democratic approach to other group members but ultimately controlled decision making.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735610377593">Davidson and Good (2002)</xref> focused on a student SQ that had been working together for six months. Through video recordings of rehearsals and interviews with the members of the group, the social and musical coordination was examined during their preparation for their first recital. This research provides insights into the ways SQ musicians develop an awareness of their colleagues’ styles of playing, musical gestures and communicative behaviors. It was evident that particular individual roles were adopted in the group. Thus, the first violinist often acted as technical adviser and supporter of the second violinist and viola player. The cellist was the most independent and isolated in terms of not offering suggestions to the group. The viola player quietly made all her communications to the second violinist. This research suggests that musical work is not only a product of sociocultural factors, but that it is also influenced by the interpersonal dynamics of the musicians rehearsing and performing the work.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735610377593">Ford and Davidson (2003)</xref> compared group processes in wind quintet (WQ) ensembles and SQs. Their results showed that WQs share certain features in common with SQs; they require good interpersonal dynamics in order to function effectively and they advocate democracy. However, the WQ had a distinctive set of issues to deal with. In WQs seating positions are not stable because they have to change in order to achieve the best overall blend of sound, whereas SQs tend to choose between two basic positions. Furthermore, unlike string players, wind instrumentalists cannot see how their colleagues are producing their sound. Articulation, tone and dynamics are produced inside the body of the instrument, so that wind players more often need to use discussion to clarify technical matters.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735610377593">King (2006)</xref> conducted a study that focused on the collaboration between student musicians in a wind quartet, a saxophone quartet and an SQ during quartets’ rehearsals. Using observations and interview methods, the roles of these student musicians were defined within and across rehearsals over a period of four weeks. Data showed that common roles appeared across the quartets. The roles included: leader, deputy-leader, contributor, inquirer, fidget, distracter and ‘quiet one’. This role model was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610377593">Belbin’s (1993)</xref> team roles. The students personified one or more of these roles during rehearsals and sometimes changed roles in different rehearsals. Results indicated that quartets with a regular leader exhibited more stable team-role behavior, consistently focused group dynamics and better progress than those without a regular leader.</p>
<p>These studies point at the centrality of social aspects in SQs. However, they do not examine directly whether the SQ resembles the working patterns of any specific organizational unit. Though the possibility that SQs function as SMTs is reasonable, it was not examined empirically. Moreover, it might be that the comparison is incorrect because some aspects of the SQ are fundamentally different from those of a standard SMT. First, unlike a business-oriented SMT, SQ members can do their work only as a unit; they cannot perform a composition without all four members working together simultaneously. Second, while management within a SQ may rotate, the particular jobs performed by each member of the team are usually fixed. Third, SMTs usually work within the framework of a supervising body, while there is no parallel ‘body’ in the SQ. Finally, the leadership patterns in the SQ are not quite clear; is there a clear leader of the group (e.g., the first violinist) or do all the participants act as leaders interchangeably? The latter issue is of great importance in this study because it can provide evidence for the question of similarity between SMTs and SQs. An SQ with no pronounced leader is more of an SMT, while one-man leadership of an SQ resembles the work of a traditional team.</p>

<title>The current study</title>
<p>In the present study we conducted two experiments to examine whether SQs could actually be considered as SMTs. In the first experiment, Israeli musicians with performance experience in a variety of musical ensembles (e.g., orchestra members, solo players, members of various chamber ensembles) were presented with SMT characteristics as depicted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al.’s (1996)</xref> questionnaire and were asked to indicate if they suited the work of SQs as well as the work of three other musical ensembles. We hypothesized that the SQ would exhibit more typical SMT characteristics than other music ensembles and that the SQ would not be perceived as a team with a leader. In the second experiment we aimed to replicate the findings of the first experiment. A different sample of musicians, this time of various nationalities, was addressed and they were asked to answer a shorter version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al.’s (1996)</xref> questionnaire. This time they were asked to compare the SQ with other musical ensembles not addressed in the first experiment and with non-musical working teams. Here, too, we hypothesized that the SQ would exhibit SMT characteristics to a higher extent in comparison to other music ensembles and to non-musical non-SMT working teams. However, we expected similar levels of SMT for the SQ and for a typical non-music SMT. Another goal of this study was to develop a questionnaire that would measure organizational dimensions of musical teamwork. In the present study the focus was on SQs but in future studies such a questionnaire could be used to examine any other musical ensembles.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Seventy-two musicians participated in the experiment, 45 women and 27 men.

Forty of the participants had specific experience with chamber ensembles (SQ, trio, and duet) and the rest had experience with other non-chamber musical ensembles. The rate of musical experience ranged between 2 and 56 years (<italic>M</italic> = 18.5, SD = 12.22). A majority (<italic>n</italic> = 52) of the sample had more than 10 years of musical experience. Of the participants, 56 were born in Israel and the remainder immigrated to Israel from other countries such as Russia (7), North America (3), Eastern Europe (2) and South America (1); (three participants did not provide information regarding their country of origin). They ranged in age from 22 to 92 years (<italic>M</italic> = 38.32, SD = 13.68).

<title>Group Characteristics in Music Ensembles Questionnaire (GCMEQ)</title>
<p>This questionnaire was used to measure the extent to which people perceive musical ensembles as SMTs. The questionnaire was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al.’s (1996)</xref> Self-Managing Work Team Effectiveness questionnaire. The questionnaire presents 74 items that describe various characteristics and behaviors of teamwork (e.g., ‘Group members set their own goals’), and the respondent is required to respond to the statement on a 7-point Likert scale (from 0 = strongly disagree, to 6 = strongly agree). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al.’s (1996)</xref> questionnaire was based on four theoretical models describing team work and self-managing work team effectiveness including: overall group job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610377593">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976</xref>), encouraging supervisory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735610377593">Manz &amp; Sims, 1987</xref>), overall group characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610377593">Cummings, 1981</xref>) and overall employee involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735610377593">Lawler, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735610377593">Lawler et al., 1992</xref>).

Items were included only if: (1) they reflected the work of music ensembles, including the phases of rehearsal and performance; (2) they took the organizational context of professional music ensembles into account; and (3) they were easy to comprehend by people not acquainted with organizational terminology. The chosen items were rephrased and adapted to fit the context of music ensembles. All the aforementioned four theoretical models were represented by appropriate items in the short version.

<p>In the present study, participants were required to answer the questionnaire referring to four different types of music ensembles, including SQ, symphony orchestra, chamber orchestra and choir.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305735610377593">Figure 1</xref>, SMT levels of music ensembles (SQ, symphony orchestra, chamber orchestra and choir) are compared. It could be seen that the SQ received the highest SMT ratings, higher than any other music ensemble. A one-way ANOVA with repeated measures was calculated in which type of ensemble was the independent variable and SMT level was the dependent variable.

<p>Further analyses were conducted to see whether the SQ was perceived as an SMT by different sections of the sample. We first analyzed the data comparing SMT levels of music ensembles separately for experienced and very experienced musicians. Possibly, more experienced musicians would have different opinions regarding music ensembles and their self-managed teamwork than those expressed by the full sample. However, a two-way mixed design analysis in which type of ensemble served as a within-subject independent variable, musical experience (more than or less than 10 years of experience) served as a between-subject independent variable, and SMT level served as the dependent variable showed no such differences. Though experienced musicians tended to rate the music ensembles with lower SMT levels (<italic>M</italic> = 3.30, SD = 0.53) than did the very experienced musicians (<italic>M</italic> = 3.59, SD = 0.58; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-0305735610377593">

<p>To examine the leadership/pluralism issue, special measures were calculated. For each ensemble we computed the mean of the answers to questions that referred to leadership/pluralism. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted in which type of ensemble was the independent variable and level of pluralism was the dependent variable. Results showed that there was a significant difference between ensembles [<italic>F</italic> <sub>(3, 213)</sub> = 191.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula10-0305735610377593">

</inline-formula> = 0.73]. Simple contrasts showed that the level of pluralism was highest for SQs (<italic>M</italic> = 3.46, SD = 0.99) and lower for the chamber orchestra (<italic>M</italic> = 1.16, SD = 1.0), the choir (<italic>M</italic> = 1.01, SD = 0.83) and the symphonic orchestra (<italic>M</italic> = 0.83, SD = 0.78).</p>
<p>It was important to examine the psychometric quality of the questionnaire in the adapted version for music ensembles in order to be sure that it could be used in further organizational research. In general, high levels of internal consistency were found: α = .82 for symphony orchestra, α = .83 for chamber orchestra, α = .87 for SQ, and α = .85 for choir. Alpha coefficients of each of the models were calculated separately and high levels of consistency were found: α = .93 for Cummings et al.’s model, α = .81 for Lawler’s model, α = .94 for Manz and Sims’s model, α = .83 for Hackman and Oldham’s model, and α = .87 for the Literature model.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, results show that the SQ is perceived as an SMT. These results have proven to be quite consistent because participants rated the SQ as highest in SMT level whether they had high or very high levels of musical experience, whether they had instrumental experience or not, whether they were born in Israel or elsewhere, or whether they were women or men. Moreover, a close examination of each of the question clusters has shown that the SQ was perceived as highest in SMT level for all theoretical frameworks. In regard to leadership/pluralism patterns, it was shown that SQs were the most pluralistic of all ensembles. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously because the SQ was compared to ensembles that have natural leaders (i.e., conductors). It is also important to note that, although the level of this measure was <italic>relatively</italic> high for SQs, its <italic>absolute</italic> value was intermediate (i.e., 3.46 on a 0 to 6 scale).</p>
<p>This experiment was based on the assumption that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al.’s (1996)</xref> questionnaire, which was devised for use in the context of working groups in the business context, would be appropriate for the context of music ensembles as well. Results were in line with this assumption. Thus, the internal reliability of the questionnaire, when adapted for music ensembles, was convincing. Participants, who were all musicians with no connection to the world of business and marketing, filled in the questionnaires flawlessly, understanding the relevance of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al.’s (1996)</xref> questionnaire items to the world of music organization. It seems, then, that most of the parts of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610377593">Cohen et al. (1996)</xref> questionnaire can be used in further exploration of the connections between music ensembles and patterns of teamwork.</p>
<p>The exception to this rule was the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735610377593">Manz and Sims (1987)</xref> model, which dealt with supervisory behaviors. According to this model, the function of external leaders of SMTs is to encourage and facilitate employees to use essential behavioral strategies such as team self-evaluation, self-goal setting and self-reinforcement. In the context of music ensembles, the function of a supervisor was not quite clear. Participants in this experiment frequently asked whether the ‘supervisor’ of an ensemble was the conductor, the coach or an agent. Although this problem was not evident in the pilot conducted prior to Experiment 1, it seems that special caution should be taken regarding this set of questions in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Although the results in the present study were quite convincing and consistent, there are a few issues that still need to be addressed. The first question to ask is: was the sample used in this study sufficiently representative? One must bear in mind that all participants were residents of Israel and could, therefore, have had a particular or limiting musical orientation. It could be that a culturally heterogeneous sample of musicians might yield different results. Moreover, the participants in the present study were a blend of instrumentalists, SQ players, orchestra players and vocalists. It could be that a more focused sample, including players of small ensembles only, might yield more focused (and perhaps different) results.</p>
<p>A second issue that should be addressed relates to the team units with which the SQ was compared. In the present study the SQ was compared to the symphony orchestra, to the chamber orchestra and to the choir, all big ensembles. It would be advisable to compare the SQ to other, smaller music ensembles. Comparison to musical ensembles not as big as an orchestra and not as small as a quartet (e.g., vocal octet) could indicate whether the size of the ensemble is connected to the perceived SMT qualities of the ensemble or whether there are other factors involved. Another point is that in the present study the SQ was compared to other music ensembles but not to non-musical work teams. Comparison to such non-musical work teams could enhance the validity of the findings of this study: comparing the SQ to a typical non-musical SMT would enable examination of the convergent validity while comparing the SQ to a typical non-musical, non-SMT would enable examination of the discriminant validity. It should be noted that although the nature of the tasks of industrial SMTs might be extremely different from those of the SQ, we are referring to those abstract features of group organization that could be applied to various work teams regardless of their task orientation. Cohen’s questionnaire, for instance, refers to factors such as employee involvement and behavioral standards of the team no matter whether the team is hi-tech or low-tech and no matter whether the group task includes a rehearsal phase or not.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 was designed to examine these issues. An international sample of musicians, all with extensive experience with chamber music making was compiled. In this way, the possibility that our previous results were a consequence of a provincial trend could be examined. In addition, we broadened the comparative power of the experiment. The SQ was not compared only to other music ensembles, but to other non-music teams as well. Again, we hypothesized that the SQ would exhibit more typical SMT characteristics than other music ensembles as well as the non-musical non-SMT work team. However, similar levels of SMT were expected for SQ and a typical non-music SMT.</p>

<p>Among the organizational units, the HT received a significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) higher mean level of SMT (<italic>M</italic> = 4.18, SD = 0.61) than the RT (<italic>M</italic> = 3.8, SD = 0.76).

<p>To examine the leadership/pluralism issue, special measures were calculated. For each ensemble/work team we computed the mean of the answers to questions that referred to leadership/pluralism. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted in which type of ensemble/work team was the independent variable and level of pluralism was the dependent variable. There was a significant difference between ensembles [F(5, 120) = 39.72, p &lt; 0.001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula12-0305735610377593">

</inline-formula> = 0.62]. Simple contrasts showed that the level of pluralism was highest for SQs (<italic>M</italic> = 4.11, SD = 1.15), then for the vocal octet (M = 3.24, SD = 1.24) and the start-up team (3.42, SD = 1.08), then for the reconstruction team (M = 2.62, SD = 1.39), and finally for the choir (M = 1.25, SD = 0.90) and the symphonic orchestra (M = 0.99, SD = 0.81).</p>
<p>Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735610377593">Table 1</xref> show that the SMT levels were consistent across Experiments 1 and 2. Data from both experiments were aggregated and a two-way ANOVA was calculated, taking into account only those ensembles that were common to both experiments (SQ, choir, symphony orchestra). The type of ensemble was the within-subject independent variable, the experiment was the between-subject independent variable and SMT level was the dependent variable. There were no significant differences between experiments [<italic>F</italic>(1, 96); = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05] and there was no interaction effect [<italic>F</italic>(2, 192); = 1.45, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05]. Significant consistent differences were found among the ensembles in both experiments [F(2, 192); = 532.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001]. Noteworthy is that the SQ received the highest SMT scores in both experiments to a strikingly similar extent [<italic>t</italic> (96) = 1.95, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05]. However, when we compared the ‘pluralism’ measure in both experiments it was found that the SQ was perceived as more pluralist in the second experiment (<italic>M</italic> = 4.11, SD = 1.15) than in the first experiment [<italic>M</italic> = 3.46, SD = 0.99; <italic>t</italic> (96) = 3.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula13-0305735610377593">

<p>Further analyses were performed to examine whether the perception of the SQ would be different when rated by participants who had practical experience with SQ ensembles versus those who had practical experience with ensembles other than the SQ. A two-way mixed design analysis was computed in which type of ensemble served as a within-subject independent variable, music background (experience with SQs and experience with different ensembles) served as a between-subject independent variable and SMT level served as the dependent variable. No significant difference was found between participants having practical experience with SQs and those with no practical experience [<italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 0.117, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05] and no interaction effect was found between the independent variables [<italic>F</italic>(5, 115) = 0.76, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05]. Similar analyses revealed that the results were not dependent on participants’ gender [non-significant interaction <italic>F</italic>(5, 115); = 0.74, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05].</p>
<p>As in the previous experiment, the psychometric quality of the revised questionnaire was of interest. Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient for internal consistency of the questionnaire was calculated and found to be high (α = .96). High levels of consistency were found across all the ensembles. The figures were: .85 for symphony orchestra, .83 for chamber orchestra, .85 for SQ, .85 for choir, .83 for vocal octet, .86 for high-tech start up team, .90 for reconstruction team. High levels of consistency were found across all models: α = .93 for Cummings et al.’s model, α = .85 for Hackman and Oldham’s model, α = .89 for Lawler’s model and α = .87 for the literature model.</p>
<p>The main goal of the present experiment was to build on the findings from Experiment 1. In general, the findings of this experiment reinforced those of Experiment 1. The results consistently show that the SQ is indeed perceived as a music ensemble with the highest level of SMT characteristics. The examination of these two different samples and the similar results from each enables us to generalize and validate the initial hypothesis.</p>
<p>With regards to leadership patterns, it was shown that the SQ was higher than any other music ensemble or work team. This time comparisons included two other small groups that do not have a natural leader (i.e., vocal octet, a four member high-tech team). Even so, the SQ was perceived as demonstrating the most pluralistic working patterns.</p>
<p>The comparison of the SQ to non-music organization teams further strengthens the perception that SQs are SMTs not only when relative to music ensembles, but also when compared to other organizational units. As expected, we found that the SQ was more similar in its SMT characteristics to the HT than to the RT, because the HT represented a typical non-music SMT. In the general analysis of the SMT score, in the models of Hackman and Oldham, and the Literature model, the SQ was ranked even higher in SMT characteristics than the HT. This finding may be explained by the fact that SQs remain a group of four members over the long term, whereas HT teams possibly strive to expand in large projects or firms.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>The objective of the current interdisciplinary study was to expand our understanding of the SQ by exploring the behavioral aspects of its teamwork. Specifically, this study examined whether the SQ is perceived as a self-managed team (SMT), which is an effective genuine collaboration that has a total responsibility for a defined project. The hypothesis that the SQ would exhibit more typical SMT characteristics than other music ensembles was confirmed in Experiments 1 and 2 using different samples and comparisons with different types of ensembles and non-musical organizational units.</p>
<p>Results also suggest that the application of an assessment instrument from the field of group behavior (i.e., GCMEQ and GCMEQr), may facilitate a comparative investigation of music and non-music teams. However, two theoretical SMT models out of five used in these experiments, namely the Lawler and the Literature models, yielded a greater differentiation between SQ and the other music ensembles. Lawler’s model refers to employee involvement in the work process by providing the employees with the required information for decision making and other necessary resources, such as training, materials and equipment. The Literature model relates to managerial processes regarding the group (goal setting, task responsibility) and group dynamics that encourages members’ initiative, creativity, and innovation. These particular models should be further examined in order to confirm their efficacy as detectors of most of the important parameters in the activity of SMTs. If a short version were needed to identify the SMT characteristics of musical teams, a questionnaire based on these two models could be developed. Manz and Sims’s model, on the other hand, which dealt with supervisory behaviors, was weaker than others. As discussed before, in the context of music ensembles, the function of a supervisor was not quite clear. We will refer to this point later in the discussion.</p>
<p>It appears that the number of members in a group is connected to the way the unit is perceived. Apparently, among musicians, having SMT characteristics would fit an ensemble that is relatively small such as SQ. In Experiment 2, participants were presented with a vocal octet and it received high SMT levels, though not as high as the ratings of the SQ. It might be that there is a negative correlation between the number of people on the team and its viability to be (perceived as) an SMT; that is, the smaller the unit, the more likely it will function as an SMT. In the literature, SMTs are defined as groups of employees consisting of 6 to 18 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735610377593">Orsburn et al., 1990</xref>), the exact number being a function of the task in question. It seems, though, that no focused examination has been done to see whether there are optimum sizes of SMTs for different types of tasks. This is an issue that we think should be encouraged in the organizational world, and much could be learned from the musicological discussion referring to the ‘magical’ four figure. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735610377593">Ratner (1995)</xref> suggests that the size of the SQ has acoustical implications. He highlights the fact that an SQ forms a perfect geometrical figure on the stage that could be easily encompassed by the listener-observer. He argues that this cast is more complete than that of a solo, duo or trio, yet it does not have the overwhelming mass of a chorus or orchestra. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735610377593">Young and Colman (1979)</xref> provide social and organizational reasons for the size of the SQ. They argue that groups of four are in certain respects more likely to develop conflicts that are essential for the growth of the group. A SQ is the smallest group that can be split into two equal groups. In groups such as trios and quintets, this is not possible, and intractable rifts are relatively unlikely because the majority view will tend to prevail. In large groups such an equal division is extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Results in this study support the notion that SQs do not have a clear leader. On the contrary, in Experiment 2, the SQ was reported as an ensemble that demonstrates pluralistic working patterns even higher than a typical SMT. These findings might be perceived as contradicting studies that have pointed at the necessity of a leader in SQ to guarantee successful output (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735610377593">King, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735610377593">Loft, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610377593">Murnighan &amp; Conlon, 1991</xref>). However, a closer look into what was found regarding group dynamics in SQs shows a more complex picture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610377593">Murnighan and Conlon (1991)</xref> showed how leadership and democracy serve as a paradox in SQs. Although the first violinist was usually referred to as the leader, there were many instances in which democratic decisions were made. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735610377593">Tovstiga, Odenthal, &amp; Goerner (2005)</xref> argued that leadership can be flexible; players might assume leadership on an ‘as needed basis’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610377593">Blum (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735610377593">Butterworth (1990)</xref> highlighted the constant ‘working-out’ process in which the roles of SQ players change over time as the tasks demand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735610377593">King (2006)</xref>, too, did not find, as she hypothesized, that players maintained the same team roles across rehearsals. Rather she suggested that there is a certain amount of flexibility in team-role behavior. Such group dynamics fit very nicely into the SMT layout in which leadership is possible but not on a constant basis. In adherence to this, several musicians claim that SQs are more democratic than they used to be (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735610377593">Hoffman (2000)</xref> who refers to the Tokyo Quartet) and that there is on ongoing rejection of dictatorial and controlling personalities which is probably a result of liberal emancipations throughout society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610377593">Blum, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735610377593">Loft, 1992</xref>). In sum, the present study shows that SQs are perceived as leaderless. Even if this finding does not directly represent reality (i.e., SQs do have a declared leader), it probably reflects a more subtle quality of SQ dynamics, that of working as a typical SMT. This possibility needs further examination. Perhaps a worldwide survey of professional SQ players referring to this specific issue could give a more accurate answer to this question.</p>
<p>What are the practical implications of the present study? One possible answer to this question is that the equation formulated in the study, that SQs are perceived as SMTs, gives rise to further comparisons between the SMT and the SQ and hopefully to improvements in both. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0305735610377593">Figure 4</xref>, there is an overlap between the teamwork forms. However, there are unique properties that exist in the SQ that do not yet exist in industrial SMTs, and that could be implemented there to improve their effectiveness (line A). On the other hand, there are organizational patterns that exist uniquely in SMTs but are not customary in the traditional teamwork of SQs and, if employed, might refine its functioning (line B). According to this, it would be useful to initiate programs of organizational development in order to implement SMT working patterns in music ensembles as well as implementing work patterns of SQs in other organizations.</p>

</fig>
<p>Here are a few examples of possible implementations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610377593">Murnighan and Conlon (1991)</xref> present interesting strategies that were adopted by successful SQs in the UK. They show how the work of SQs includes a dialectic management of three characteristic paradoxes: the leader–democracy paradox, the confrontation versus compromise paradox and the ‘second fiddle’ paradox (i.e., the second violinist needs to stand out in his or her ability to reflect and shadow the first violinist). The study shows that successful SQs establish ground rules that enable their members to perceive conflicts as being a positive constructive and healthy part of their working process. According to this line of thought an SMT could find the paradoxes that are characteristic to it and, subsequently, adopt a dialectic way of dealing with them. For instance, SMTs might encounter a ‘responsibility’ paradox in which it is not clear where the responsibility for the success of the team is placed. As every single team member has total responsibility for his or her part of the task, there is no one person to be responsible for the product as a whole. If not addressed properly, this paradox might cause frequent errors. However, treating it dialectically, as would be done in a SQ, might solve the problem.</p>
<p>Another characteristic unique to the work of the SQ is that its work is typically comprised of two distinct phases: rehearsal and performance. These phases differ in terms of communication patterns between the members of the group as well as their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735610377593">Seddon &amp; Biasutti, 2009</xref>). In the rehearsal phase, members discuss the repertoire, negotiate interpretation, practice, experiment, work on technical issues and repeat complicated excerpts. The main objective of a rehearsal is to establish shared musical goals within the ensemble as soon as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610377593">Davidson &amp; King, 2004</xref>). The performance phase, on the other hand, requires different communication channels. Participants must create an implicit communication strategy to make time-critical decisions such as cueing, dynamic balance and articulatory adjustments. Auditory communication and body language prevail. The performance phase combines anxiety and artistry; performance remains mysterious even to the musicians themselves. During a performance there are external factors that affect the ensemble, including the audience along with such physical variables as the acoustics, temperature, the stage and the hall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610377593">Dunsby, 1995</xref>). SMT members might find it very helpful to converse with SQ players and to hear how they deal with the challenges of each of the phases. Moreover, the mere dichotomous distinction between rehearsal and performance might be of value to SMT theorization. It could be that planning SMT tasks in this order might improve the functioning of the team and make clearer what it is that needs to be done in order to achieve the required goals (and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610377593">Dogantan-Dack, 2008</xref> for further insights regarding players’ distinct functioning during rehearsal and performance).</p>
<p>A third example, this time implementing SMT ideas in SQs, refers to member selection to a group. The literature that deals with SMTs has paid a great deal of attention to the required profile of members selected to participate in such teams. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735610377593">Orsburn and Moran (2000)</xref> define the best candidates for SMTs as follows: people who like to contribute their ideas, listen to others, want to expand beyond a specialized role, and demonstrate positive initiative in the absence of direct supervision. Members of an SMT must obtain technical, administrative and interpersonal skills. Among the necessary interpersonal skills are: listening, giving performance feedback, having one’s voice in a team meeting, solving group problems, counseling with peers, learning a new job, resolving conflicts and working collaboratively. This aspect is recommended to be taken into consideration for SQ ensembles at the phase of establishment and whenever a new member is recruited to the ensemble. An efficient selection process could spare much trouble in the future work of SQs and prevent frequent turnover.</p>
<p>A fourth example refers to the supervisory entity, which we found to be confusing in the context of SQs. However, since this entity was found to improve effectiveness in SMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735610377593">Druskat &amp; Wheeler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0305735610377593">Morgeson, 2005</xref>), we think that it should be further examined in the SQ environment. It is important to first define who or what the ‘supervisor’ is in the context of an SQ (e.g., a coach, an agent, a conductor) and then to raise SQ members’ awareness to it and to encourage their cooperation with it. Further studies could then examine whether a supervisor improves the functioning of SQs.</p>
<p>As the subjects clearly and systematically rated SQs as SMTs, and as many SMTs in the business world have been proven to be very effective teams, the question that arises is whether SQ ensembles with a high level of SMT are more effective than those with a lower level of SMT. Of course, there is the question of how to measure the effectiveness of SQs. For business organizations, effectiveness can easily be defined based on the core activities and processes of the business such as profit growth, production (quantity and quality), sales and customer satisfaction. These elements are often measured for a defined period of time such as quarterly or annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610377593">Attaran &amp; Nguyen, 2000</xref>). Measurement of SQ effectiveness, however, is not as obvious and involves a certain complexity.</p>
<p>One possibility would be to refer to the SQ from a business point of view in which the effectiveness of SQs is measured according to criteria such as the number of concerts per year, the number of albums recorded, the number of concerts in the last year and ticket prices. This approach was indeed taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610377593">Murnighan and Conlon (1991)</xref> who focused on the relationship between the SQ’s internal dynamics and its success as a group. Another, more music-oriented possibility would be to define the effectiveness of a SQ according to the quality of sound that it produces. Professional SQs are known and admired for their unique sound patterns. It is, therefore, possible to refer to quality of sound as a product of the SQ and to hypothesize that the better the working patterns of the team (i.e., the higher its SMT levels) the more compelling its quality of sound. Apparently, this line of research awaits further investigation.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the integration of music theory with organizational behavior and evaluation methods from social science will stimulate further research in this unique interdisciplinary field. Thus, this study has formalized the conception of the SQ as an operative human system with characteristic organizational functioning that culminates in high-quality musical performance. The unique characteristics of SQs as SMTs may contribute to improvement in other types of ensembles as well as non-music working groups that are of interest from the organizational perspective.</p>
