<abstract>
<p>This paper attempts to deal with the elusive nature of quality in quality management, using a case study to examine quality control measures implemented in an academic context and to show an emergent framework for quality enhancement. This paper introduces the concept of the ecology of quality assurance and examines efforts to maintain and advance quality through a systems approach in which interrelated subsystems contribute to a dynamic ecosystem of quality control. A framework is developed to demonstrate and evaluate a quality assurance system, pointing the way forward for quality enhancement and reflecting the central dynamics of quality assurance and enhancement.</p>

<p>To demonstrate value for money performance, higher education establishments are applying industrial and commercial concepts, formulae and techniques to management while basing performance assessment initiatives on quality. The indeterminate and ambiguous nature of the quality concept in higher education has been discussed by various researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020611424608">Bauer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020611424608">Vroeijenstijn, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020611424608">Williams, 1990</xref>). <italic>Quality</italic> is a term that is ‘elusive of prescription’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020611424608">Gibson, 1986</xref>: 128) and value laden because it is associated with being worthwhile and good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020611424608">Pfeffer &amp; Coote, 1991</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020611424608">Harvey &amp; Green (1993)</xref>, ‘Quality is often referred to as a relative concept … Some conceptualizations of quality are rather more “absolutist” than others’ (p. 10). Recently, there has been a multidimensional approach towards defining ‘quality’ in higher education, highlighting the fact that different stakeholders could have different interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892020611424608">Westerheijden et al., 2007</xref>) and that discussion should be on the qualities instead of the quality of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020611424608">Blackmur, 2007</xref>). This trend has assumed the significance of different perspectives, suggesting that ‘quality’ is concerned with ‘fitness for purposes’ as well as ‘fitness of purpose’. Regarding the concepts of quality assurance and quality enhancement in higher education, there is also a wide range of perspectives – from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020611424608">Swinglehurst et al.’s (2008)</xref> emphasis on the dichotomy between the two concepts with assurance focusing on teaching and enhancement focusing on learning, to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020611424608">Middlehurst’s (1997)</xref> view of the different but complementary roles of assurance and enhancement in the management of quality.</p>
<p>In this paper I would like to contribute to the discussion about ‘quality’ by putting forward an ecological perspective to address quality assurance and enhancement issues, stressing the importance of the interrelationship between variables and the environment against which the variables are situated. The paper begins with a description and analysis of the management approach and quality control measures in an academic unit at university, which then is followed by an introduction to the concept of ecology of quality assurance and a framework that describes the quality assurance system, suggesting themes for enhancement.</p>
<sec id="section1-0892020611424608">
<title>Context</title>
<p>This study is a piece of insider research, looking into and reflecting on the work practice in an academic unit, as well as sharing insights about the practice and presenting a conceptual framework for the issues of quality assurance and enhancement. It examines the activities of a self-financing group (known as the Group in this paper) at an English language centre in a university in China. The Leader of the Group is the researcher and she had the support of the workplace (an English Language Centre) to conduct this case study. Permission was sought from the Director of the centre to make use of workplace resources in this case study. The Leader oversees and coordinates all the self-financing activities at the Centre. The Group is an ancillary unit whose mission is to seek and create opportunities to provide various English language teaching services on and off the university campus. The goal is to contribute to the financial resources of the Centre while acting as a link between the university and the community at large. The objectives of the Group are fourfold: to facilitate the setting up and running of self-financing initiatives; to provide a forum for exploring and generating ideas on English language learning and teaching; to identify and seek to address the language needs of society; and to enhance the centre’s profile in both academic and non-academic environments. The Group offers off and on-campus English language training and language assistance. Its on-campus activities are initiated by the departments at university; the off-campus activities usually are in response to requests from companies, organisations or other educational institutions. A great diversity exists in terms of clients’ needs and requirements.</p>
<p>Although the Group is within an academic unit, its remit is business-oriented. Therefore the Group adopts a market-oriented approach, with quality usually being defined by the client. It focuses on searching for new ways to satisfy clients’ needs regarding English language learning. To compete, there is a general understanding that the Group has to be more sensitive to the needs of clients or it will lose its business opportunity to their rival language providers. Since the Group is operating within the centre, its way of conducting business is expected to be compatible with the centre’s policy. The Group’s management of quality issues is in line with the assurance policies for mainstream academic programmes, with the control measures and procedures mirroring those the centre implemented to ensure teaching and learning quality. Activities managed by the Group are not within the normal workload of the teachers at the centre. Teachers interested in taking up the activities will receive remuneration for these activities. In the absence of official policies related to quality assurance or the control of self-financing activities, guidelines and codes of practice specific to management and the delivery of self-financing activities are devised by the Group Leader (GL).</p>
<p>The following is an account of the management approach and quality control measures taken in an attempt to guarantee excellence of service as well as increase clients’ confidence in the service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0892020611424608">
<title>Management approach</title>
<p>As many decisions and procedures related to the Group activities are contingent upon a variety of unpredictable external and internal factors both inside and outside the academic environment, the GL adopts a contingency management approach to capitalise on the changes and opportunities in the process. One of the characteristics of this approach is the resilience and/or flexibility in the management of workflows so that job-specific tasks can be aligned with resources and priorities as these tasks evolve.</p>
<p>The Group emphasises the importance of achieving a delicate balance among variables, such as the purpose and direction of the centre, the interests and needs of clients/learners and the teaching beliefs and practices of teachers when dealing with all activities. Factors such as the excessive workload at the centre, compatibility of activities with the centre’s mission and beliefs and individual teachers’ multi-tasking abilities also are considered in all decisions.</p>
<p>The GL relies on negotiation and discussion skills to promote and advertise the centre’s self-financing activities. She is responsible for planning and designing activity blueprints, monitoring progress, evaluating performance and generating informed exchanges on continuous improvement. As most pedagogical and administrative issues emerge over time, <italic>esprit de corps</italic> and close collaboration with teachers in the centre are central to the GL’s activities management.</p>

<sec id="section3-0892020611424608">
<title>Key aspects of quality control</title>
<p>Design and coordination of activities, service delivery and participants’ satisfaction are the major areas of interest regarding the evaluation of the Group’s services. Primary tasks undertaken by the Group to ensure service quality include identifying clients’ needs and wants, planning and assembling resources, and maintaining communication with clients and participants. Establishing and determining performance standards and verifying achievements could be difficult, as the Group’s services are quite varied, ranging from workshops and seminars to group or individual mentoring, from working with a multinational organisation to a group of postgraduate students. In order to monitor progress towards improvement and ensure the adoption of best practices, the Group’s services are guided by four aspects of quality.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Teaching quality.</italic> The Group encourages teaching practices that are supported by sound pedagogical rationale but have not yet been tested at the centre. The Group hopes to promote innovative teaching ideas and methods that will meet the needs and preferences of its clients and blaze a trail for the centre to follow.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Learning quality.</italic> This consists of clients’ interaction with the teachers during contact hours and their experience of learning independently, their perception of usefulness and appropriateness of the activity, and their response or reaction to the logistical issues and administrative requirements of the activity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Material quality.</italic> This refers to the preparation of teaching and learning materials, as well as the materials’ accuracy, clarity and usability.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Rapport or interaction quality.</italic> This aspect is concerned with the available channels for communication and accessibility of assistance in the process of learning.</p>

</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0892020611424608">
<title>Quality control measures</title>
<p>Generally speaking, the measures taken to monitor the quality of the Group’s activities fall into four main categories: documentation, activity review, collaborative effort among teachers and access to resources.</p>
<sec id="section5-0892020611424608">
<title>Documentation</title>
<p>Proper documentation acts as a safety net for clients in all activities. Every activity is formalised in an agreement between the centre and the clients, which includes intended learning outcomes, budget and schedule, modes of delivery and any other relevant details. This agreement helps the centre with its strategic planning and monitoring of the activity progress. Duties and responsibilities are spelled out clearly in a job specification document for activity developers (see the <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-0892020611424608">box</xref> on job duties). The delineation of roles clarifies the duties and responsibilities of the persons responsible for each activity. This aims to ensure effective and efficient support for teaching and learning.</p>

</boxed-text>
<p>Apart from the agreement and job specifications, there is a report on the activity achievement reflection and improvement purposes. The details to be included in the report are specific to the objectives of the activity or needs of the various parties concerned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0892020611424608">
<title>Activity review</title>
<p>Clients’ needs, wishes and desires are the Group’s core concern during the design, preparation and delivery of all activities. A survey of clients’ feedback is administered by the activity developer(s) to find out the extent to which the activity has met the clients’ expectations. Such a review also provides a basis for appropriate follow-up actions. If a team of teachers is involved, the activity developer(s) will hold focus meetings or collect teachers’ feedback through a questionnaire survey at the end of the activity in order to address issues or challenges that arose in the course of running the activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0892020611424608">
<title>Collaborative effort among teachers</title>
<p>Informal discussions and meetings are held between the teachers and the GL to enhance cooperation and team spirit. For example, materials produced for an activity will be double-checked and commented on by the GL or her deputy to ensure accuracy and clarity. The GL or her deputy then will pass the suggestions and comments on to the teachers for consideration and/or action. The Group is considering peer classroom observations as an additional means of ensuring teaching quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0892020611424608">
<title>Access to resources</title>
<p>A vast array of learning resources and teaching materials is available at the centre to provide learners with an ideal environment in which to learn independently. To ensure that clients have a total quality experience, the Group includes the availability of resources for independent learning as part of the clients’ total learning experience.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, much of the effort put into the quality assurance and enhancement are at the activity and practitioner levels.</p>

<sec id="section9-0892020611424608">
<title>An ecological perspective of quality – a discussion of the Group’s quality measures</title>
<p>Quality control or monitoring measures aim to pre-empt flaws and weaknesses in the work process and ensure quality. In compliance with the centre’s policy on quality assurance, the Group has identified key aspects of quality control and implemented measures to deal with each aspect of the control or monitoring process. However, as the Group’s activities are market-oriented, the Group’s interpretation of ‘quality’ is not exactly the same as that of the mainstream learning and teaching activities at the centre. There is, therefore, a need to revisit the quality assurance mechanism and locate a more appropriate stance on discussing quality issues.</p>
<p>The quality control measures taken by the Group (as previously described) provide a clear picture about three major issues of quality assurance: the ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘how’. The ‘who’ refers to the people or practitioners involved in the task(s); the ‘what’ is the infrastructure that supports learning and teaching; finally, the ‘how’ includes the decision-making process, the operational approaches and implementation details.</p>
<p>The Group’s services are delivered by teachers at the centre. The teachers may act as course coordinators, developers or tutors. Since each activity is expected to be run and delivered by the most or best qualified person at the centre, the emphasis is on recruiting ‘quality’ people. ‘Quality’ people need the right infrastructure to develop or further enhance their skills and abilities. Three infrastructure elements that may be regarded as conducive to this cause can be identified in the Group’s quality assurance measures: a communication system regarding control and feedback, resources that allow effective and efficient execution, and an organisational culture that cultivates team spirit and encourages fresh approaches to new tasks.</p>
<p>To operationalise the infrastructure, the Group employs vigorous peer and external review of expectations and guidelines to weed out irrelevant or less-than-satisfactory practices, with standards and guidelines being changed or modified as necessary to ensure smooth operation. Selection of appropriate guidelines and standards for teachers helps advance quality practice and ensure that the right people implement the right processes in, for example, scanning the situation for an activity, assessing the importance of the activity in the mission of the centre established in the centre’s policy, designing work details for a specific activity, and evaluating the completed work upon completion of the activity. All this work usually requires a degree of ingenuity to deal with challenges unique to the context.</p>
<p>Upon a closer reading of the previously described quality control measures, three major themes appear: integration, responsiveness and innovativeness. Integration refers to the interrelatedness and interdependence of the three subsystems: practitioners or teachers, the infrastructure, and policies and practice, which constitute the larger system of quality assurance. The entire system responds to and is influenced not just by external factors (which may be outside the Group’s control), but also by the subsystems themselves. Inherent in the entire system would be the capability to adapt and thrive as well as change and innovate. This interactive system would act much like an ecosystem. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0892020611424608">Figure 1</xref> depicts the concept of the ecology of quality assurance.</p>

</fig>
<p>The ecology concept highlights the importance of the environment and the interactions or relationships of the various components in the system, the importance of an understanding of the processes that determine the phenomena or actions, and the importance of certain indispensable conditions for the ‘survival’ or ‘flourishing’ of particular traits in the whole system. In the ecology of quality assurance of the Group in this paper, practitioners and infrastructure, as well as policies and practice, can each be viewed as having a sub-ecosystem of their own in the larger ecosystem of quality assurance. Each system can be evaluated with regard to its integration, responsiveness and innovativeness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0892020611424608">
<title>Emerging framework for quality assurance and enhancement – a discussion on the Group’s quality measures</title>
<p>Regarding the Group’s efforts to ensure quality work, the discussion can be about the ecology of the quality assurance mechanism, focusing on the three main features: integration, responsiveness and innovation.</p>
<p>Integration refers to how well the environment or current conditions (that have been created by the practitioners, infrastructure, and policies and practices) have helped achieve coherence in beliefs and action, thereby achieving efficiency in the business operation, such as the deployment of suitable practitioners, the design of supportive infrastructure and the formulation of appropriate policies and practice codes and standards. To a certain extent, evaluation of the environment is an examination of the collective efforts made in an institution. Knowledge of the efforts made and the constraints experienced are the keys to understanding the extent to which integration is achieved. Regarding responsiveness, timeliness and effectiveness are among the many issues that may be of relevance. Questions to be asked may include: Has the environment allowed prompt and swift responses to challenges? Is the environment conducive to dealing with clients’ needs or expectations and/or satisfying their interests? These questions and more have to be addressed from the perspectives of the institution and of the client, as clients’ perceptions are just as valid. Regarding innovativeness, uniqueness and functionality of the process and the products/services usually are of major interest. Innovativeness may be found in practitioners’ approaches to the task(s), implementation procedures established in the practice codes, support offered by the infrastructure, and/or the distinguishing features of products or services that address problems or issues in a specific context. Clients’ views and comments, as well as evaluations made by professionals or experts, lend credibility and value to the service or product. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892020611424608">Table 1</xref> depicts some of the dimensions of each attribute of the ecology of quality assurance, as well as the factors to be considered when assessing these dimensions.</p>

<p>The above framework can help in the evaluation and discussion of quality control measures (e.g. ways to document job details, review activities and coordinate peer efforts) and the infrastructure (e.g. availability of human and material resources). The framework may help raise questions or issues that have to be addressed by more convincing evidence and/or information. An evaluation process always searches for ways to measure benefits and costs, thus the extensive variety of data that can be produced in this framework will strengthen course/programme delivery, improve the transparency of operation and implementation, and facilitate articulation of the quality assurance mechanism that has been put into place. Such a framework also can be used for quality enhancement as it helps to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the various attributes and suggest themes for quality enhancement. The framework also can help reposition quality assurance and enhancement issues in a proper context. For example, by emphasising the importance of the environment and its interrelationships, a more meaningful discussion can be held on whether current weaknesses are the symptoms or causes of an existing problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0892020611424608">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of a quality assurance system is to support a task or endeavour. The concept of the ecology of quality assurance helps bring home the essence of quality as a work in progress. This requires constant redefinition or the refinement of performance measurements, the alignment of modified or new practices and standards with environmental variables, and facilitation of the work process to increase efficiency and enhance effectiveness of the service (e.g. the teaching) or product (e.g. the teaching/learning materials) – keys to quality enhancement. The concept of ecology also stresses the importance of creating a more enabling environment to develop and implement quality assurance and enhancement systems. The implication is that the capacity to identify and deal with a constraining aspect in an operating environment is just as crucial as the ability to identify and address inadequacy in the various aspects of the workflow. The managing skills at both the macro- and micro-levels are equally important. The rigours required of a quality assurance system can be reflected in the dynamic forces of its ecosystem and the continuing focus on adapting and changing in this ecosystem.</p>
