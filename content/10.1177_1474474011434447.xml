<p>Family photographs are often dismissed as banal and selective; the argument made is that they routinely fail to capture the gritty side of family life, the realities of domestic labour, dysfunctional relationships, or toddlers’ tantrums. In <italic>Doing Family Photography</italic>, Rose immediately dispenses with this view and instead shows us how family photos are instrumental in the creation of a narrative that helps to define the domestic in general, and domestic space in particular. She accomplishes this by shifting the focus away from the <italic>content</italic> of photos and onto family photography as <italic>practice</italic>. Her training as a geographer leads her to focus on the <italic>where</italic> of the family photograph. Whether displayed on the living room wall, shared electronically among friends and family, or subject to public display on the pages of newspapers, the addition of layers that take us beyond content frees us to see family photographs in a way that has escaped all but a few academic analyses to date.</p>
<p>In the first half of her book, Rose shows her readers that the organization, display and sharing of family photographs serves at once to both solidify and stretch domestic space. In the second half, Rose expands her study beyond that which is immediately domestic to consider how family photos were used by the media in the aftermath of the London bombings of July 2005. Repeated publication of family photos of the missing and dead reinforced the message that these victims were ordinary folk just like the newspapers’ readers.</p>
<p>As Rose herself acknowledges, one challenge is that her research is situated in the midst of a great transformation of the medium. Her first set of interviews was conducted in 2000 when all of the women she spoke with used film cameras; by the time she conducted her second round of interviews some five years later, most family photos were taken digitally and they were organized and then shared electronically. Since that time, of course, we have witnessed the explosive growth of new modes of communication including social networking which have further transformed the sharing of family photographs. In addition, in the time that has elapsed since Rose conducted her research on the role of mothers as the primary ‘drivers’ of family photography, the ubiquity of camera phones and inexpensive digital cameras has meant a generational expansion of who takes, organizes and shares family photographs. The photographic practices which Rose describes and analyses have changed so quickly that reflections on them seem, at times, quaintly outdated. On the other hand, though, the framework that she has so clearly articulated demonstrates how we can take our consideration of family photography beyond the content of the images. As such, her approach is perfectly suited for future studies that explore this new reality.</p>
