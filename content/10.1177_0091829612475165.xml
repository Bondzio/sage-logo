<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1994 the Orthodox Christian Mission Center (OCMC) was established by the Standing Canonical Orthodox Bishops of America (SCOBA) to serve as the inter-jurisdictional center for North American Orthodox Christian long- and short-term missions. I first learned about OCMC in 2003 while studying the North American Orthodox Church for the American confessional traditions project sponsored by the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals at Wheaton College. I discovered that on the eve of the twenty-first century, SCOBA sanctioned several outreach agencies including the International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), Orthodox Christian Fellowship (OCF), and Orthodox Christian Prison Ministry (OCPM).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091829612475165">1</xref></sup> These newly established ministries point the way to unforeseen Orthodox missionary activity in the United States and abroad. In this account I discuss theological beliefs, institutions, and social changes guiding short-term missions in the Orthodox Church. I describe OCMC-sponsored short-term mission activities. I conclude with discussion to guide further study of short-term mission activity in the Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>I am cradle Orthodox and have been a lifelong parishioner in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Chicago. I have been conducting ethnographic research on the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (GOA) since 1990 with a primary interest in nationalism and ethnic identity in shaping GOA parishes in Chicago. My approach draws on cultural anthropologists working on symbols, cosmology, history, memory, and human agency in shaping collective religious identity and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091829612475165">Geertz, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091829612475165">Fernandez, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091829612475165">Comaroff and Comaroff, 1992</xref>). The articulation of pan-Orthodox collaboration and interest in outreach and service in the narratives framed in recently established SCOBA ministries challenge widely held ethnic divisions, xenophobia, and ethnocentrism dividing the Orthodox Church in North America throughout the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091829612475165">Volkov, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091829612475165">Kourvetaris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475165">Kostarelos, 2008</xref>). In North American liturgical practices Orthodox Christians draw on Scripture, patristics, tradition, and the lives of saints to articulate narratives that speak to hospitality, philanthropy, personal sacrifice, and evangelism. However, only in the late 1990s do we see Orthodox leaders and laity exegete Orthodox liturgical texts and practices to mobilize parish resources in support of local outreach and short-term missions abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475165">Hopko, 2004</xref>). The language of witness, service, calling, and reaching the ends of the earth to make disciples articulated in short-term missions discourse are recent in Orthodox Christian vernacular in America.</p>
<p>The identities of Orthodox Christian settlers were formed in contested territories that gave way to nation-states defined by unifying ethnic symbols, myths, and imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091829612475165">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091829612475165">White, 2000</xref>). As Orthodox Christian settlers established churches in the United States in the 1900s, the primacy of ethnic identity and loyalty to their national homelands undermined Orthodox Christian unity in America. In earlier work I have argued that ethnocentric identities carried to the United States by Orthodox Christians combined with legal and de facto segregation and racial contempt led to the development of divided and xenophobic parishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475165">Kostarelos, 2008</xref>). Why is the Orthodox Church in North America, which largely existed within parochial enclaves on American soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475165">Erickson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475165">Kostarelos, 2008</xref>), unengaged with non-Orthodox religious bodies in the United States and abroad, launching “global” short-term missions? What theological principles and narratives guide short-term missions among Orthodox leaders and laity? What are the aims of short-term mission trips? Where do OCMC-sponsored short-term mission teams go and what do they aim to accomplish?</p>
<p>In this account, I argue that Orthodox Christian short-term mission in the Orthodox Church are rooted in the breakdown of the ethno-national hold on Eastern Christians in North America; the expansion of a plural American social and religious landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091829612475165">Eck, 2001</xref>); the use of the Internet to inform and engage Orthodox Christians across the globe; a culture of volunteerism cultivated in Orthodox parishes; and the recent publication of Orthodox theological texts accessible to lay readers that articulate universal principles of the Orthodox Church and a call for evangelism and philanthropy in a broken world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475165">Hopko, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475165">Yannoulatos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091829612475165">Bartholomew, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Orthodox Christian converts are significant in shaping missionary activity. Converts are serving as priests in Orthodox parishes across jurisdictions and thus are in leadership positions to mobilize resources for outreach and mission. Many have experience in missions prior to joining the Orthodox Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091829612475165">Doulis, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091829612475165">Gillquist, 1989</xref>) and most are eager to share the faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091829612475165">Slagle, 2011</xref>). Clergy converts I have interviewed for this study and other work on social changes in the Orthodox Church in North America have expressed keen interest in evangelism. One priest I interviewed for this article has gone on two OCMC-sponsored short-term mission trips and indicated a strong desire to return to develop relationships with local Orthodox clergy and laity he met during his trips.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>For this article I have read narratives published on the OCMC website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ocmc.org">www.ocmc.org</ext-link>) and OCMC Magazine, written by leaders and laity who have participated in short-term missions. I have also viewed OCMC short-term mission activities on YouTube. I have interviewed Orthodox clergy and laity who have participated in OCMC support short-term missions. I have observed and participated in GOA parish fund-raisers in support of short-term mission. I have read course outlines and studied theological texts used to teach missions at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology and Saint Vladimir’s Theological Seminary. I have not participated in an OCMC-sponsored mission trip.</p>

<title>Church Polity and Parishes</title>
<p>There are an estimated 250 million Orthodox Christians worldwide living in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and North America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091829612475165">2</xref></sup> Within North America there are reported estimates of two to three million Eastern Christians with ties to Russia, Greece, the Middle East, and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475165">Kostarelos 2008</xref>). The Greek Orthodox Church is the largest Orthodox group in North America, reporting one-and-a-half million adherents. The Antiochian Orthodox Church and the Orthodox Church of America each report about one million adherents. Remaining Eastern Christians in North America are in Serbian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Russian, and Albanian jurisdictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091829612475165">3</xref></sup> While the Eastern Church is separated by geographic and administrative jurisdictions rooted in the long history of Orthodox people across the globe, the Eastern Church is united by shared doctrine and religious practices across jurisdictional, linguistic, and geographical locations.</p>
<p>The local parish is the primary locus for Orthodox Christian religious experience. Orthodox immigrants established parishes to serve their communities as they settled in the United States throughout the 1900s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091829612475165">Fitzgerald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475165">Erickson, 1999</xref>). There are approximately 2000 Orthodox parishes in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091829612475165">Krindatch, 2010</xref>) administered by separate jurisdictions under the supervision of bishops. These parishes are widely distributed throughout the United States with concentrations in and near Chicago, Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475165">Kostarelos 2008</xref>). Orthodox parishes are voluntary associations supported by parishioners. Below we will see that OCMC depends on parishes for short-term mission volunteers and for funds to support short-term missions.</p>

<title>Orthodox Worldview and Missions</title>
<p>In 2009 OCMC moved to new quarters, the Archbishop Anastasios and Archbishop Demetrios Missionary Training and Administrative Center in Saint Augustine, Florida. Archbishop Anastasios Yannoulatos is the head of the Church of Albania and Archbishop Demetrios is the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church of America. Both leaders were born in Greece and educated at the University of Athens in the 1940s during a period of foreign occupation and civil war. Clergy and lay leaders I interviewed view Archbishop Anastasios Yannoulatos as an exemplary leader guiding global Orthodox mission. His writings and the example of his work in Albania are widely referenced among Orthodox Christian laity and leaders. His writings are used in courses at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Boston and Saint Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York. His works are also listed on correspondence-course readings offered by OCMC. He is known for rebuilding the Church of Albania in the 1990s. Archbishop Anastasios served as acting Archbishop of East Africa where he educated indigenous church leaders who supported the development of local churches and jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091829612475165">Veronis, 1994</xref>) that currently receive OCMC short-term mission teams.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0091829612475165">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Archbishop Anastasios draws on a life-long commitment and experience in Orthodox missions in the Balkans and East Africa. In his vision, missionary activity is founded on God’s love for mankind and the dignity and equality of each person before the eyes of God. Archbishop Anastasios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475165">Yannoulatos, 2003</xref>) offers the following perspective on the importance of cultivating a <italic>community</italic> (<italic>koinonia</italic>) <italic>of love</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Taking Christian principles as our starting point, it is our belief that the real problem is how we can advance from being merely a community to becoming a communion of love—or, to use the Greek work, a <italic>koinonia</italic> (pronounced kee-no-Nee-a), a “communion, society, communication, interconnection” of love—with our fellow human beings, with the entire universe, and with the Supreme Reality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475165">2003</xref>: 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He continues with a vision for unity innate in human beings:<disp-quote>
<p>The trinitarian God created and sustains “the world and everything in it” (Acts 17:24). He remains “the Lord of heaven and earth” as well as the Father of all humanity: “One Father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all” (Eph 4:5). Humanity exhibits great variety and diversity, but its true nature is rooted in unity, not only because God “made from one (blood) every nation of men” (Acts 17:26) but primarily because he “made him in the image of God” (Gen 5:1). This means that sharing in a “<italic>koinonia</italic> of love” is intrinsic to human nature, since humanity was created on the model of the Holy Trinity. By their very nature, human beings are in harmony with all creation and with the source of love, God. All human beings thus bear the image of God, regardless of their race, color language, or education; that is, they all possess intellect, free will, and love. The fact that all human existence shares in this divine image makes human nature an indivisible unity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475165">2003</xref>: 24–25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Principles articulated by the Archbishop are encoded in the liturgical life of Orthodox parishes. OCMC short-term mission team members are Orthodox Christians and have experienced the liturgical and sacramental life of the Orthodox. They also are experienced in the bodily practices enacted in the religious life of the Orthodox Church—veneration of icons, fasting, confession, communion to name a few practices. OCMC short-term team members are expected to share the faith with local people during the trip.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475165">Hopko (2004)</xref> evangelism and philanthropy must coincide, as in Orthodox missions. To the principle of love in community articulated by Archbishop Anastasios, Hopko adds teaching, confession, defense of the faith, and witness as guiding practices in Orthodox evangelism. Hopko writes,<disp-quote>
<p>God’s will for human beings to love according to God’s revelation of love in his Beloved Son—the bonded slave obedient unto a shameful death on the cross—creates and constitutes the Christian mission of love in the world. This mission is accomplished in words by the proclamation of God’s gospel in Christ to all people and nations. This Christian evangelism is always accompanied by teaching (<italic>didaskalia</italic>) and confession (<italic>homologia</italic>) and defense (<italic>apologia</italic>) and witness (<italic>martyria</italic>). And, it is accomplished in works of love for human begins performed in concrete acts of mercy without condition or discrimination. This is Christian philanthropy understood not merely as various forms of charitable actions and almsgiving, but as sacrificial service (<italic>diakonia</italic>) and witness (<italic>martyria</italic>) in all areas of human existence that contribute to human dignity, freedom, justice, and peace on earth to God’s gospel in Jesus. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475165">2004</xref>: 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the routine liturgical life of the Orthodox Church the lives of saints and the teachings of Church Fathers are articulated and speak to cultivating and seeking a life of service and sacrifice on behalf of humankind.</p>
<p>Orthodox Short-term missions draw on the legacy of the Russian missionaries landing in Alaska in the mid-1700s. Leaders and laity alike invoke Saints Cyril and Methodius among the Serbs remembered for translating the Gospel and liturgical texts into local languages and supporting indigenous practices. Orthodox Alaskan missionaries, following the example of Saints Cyril and Methodius, translated texts and supported indigenous spiritual leaders and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091829612475165">Oleska, 1992</xref>). Educating and ordaining indigenous priests is supported by OCMC. As we will see below, a primary aim of OCMC short-term mission service is to support the growth of local Orthodox churches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0091829612475165">
<title>Short-Term Mission Aims, Destinations, and Activities</title>
<p>OCMC teams are invited by local bishops to visit and serve in their jurisdictions. Bishops authorize clergy and laity to host and guide the teams. To travel with an OCMC-sponsored short-term mission team, volunteers must be Orthodox Christians and provide a letter of recommendation from their priest in their OCMC short-term mission application. Sharing Orthodox faith and supporting local churches are the major objectives of short-term missions. Team members are expected to participate in daily worship with local people. Each team includes a priest who leads daily worship alongside local clergy. Short-term mission teams are also carriers of Orthodox Christian material culture. The visual archive found on the OCMC website and YouTube records the movement of icons, vestments, and censors among other artifacts used in the liturgical and sacramental life of the Orthodox Church. Short-term mission activities include constructing and/or restoring churches in which local Orthodox Christians gather for worship and sacraments including baptism, chrismation, the Eucharist, confession, marriage, holy unction, and ordination. Clergy and deacons on the team assist with worship and administering sacraments. Team activities also include youth camp work, teaching the faith, cleaning and restoring cemeteries, caring for orphans, providing health care, and distributing food and clothes.</p>
<p>In 2010 OCMC offered 15 short-term mission trips. Destinations that year included Alaska, Albania, Romania, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, South Korea, Madagascar, and India. Team size ranged from 4 to 11 participants with a total of 101 participants listed on the OCMC site for 2010. On average trips lasted two to three weeks. The cost of the trips, not including airfare from the United States, averaged $1293. The fee covered the costs of visas, room and board, ministry expenses, local transportation, and excursions. Estimated average cost for airfare in 2010 was approximately $1300. In 2010 there was an additional cost for travel to participate in a required orientation for team members held at the OCMC training center in Florida. Team members raise money to support their trip by tapping their social networks—parents, extended kin, parishioners, and friends. Parish priests have allowed the use of parish facilities to raise funds to support short-term mission travel.</p>

<sec id="section6-0091829612475165" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Travel abroad is not new to Orthodox Christians who maintain strong ties to their homelands. Orthodox Christians travel to religious sites for personal spiritual growth. Pilgrimages to venerate icons, saints, and martyrs are prized spiritual experiences among Orthodox Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091829612475165">Schmit, 2005</xref>). Short-term mission volunteers practice and learn about their faith in new contexts with local people and team members from wide-ranging geographic and jurisdictional bodies, thus breaking down cultural barriers that hindered cross-cultural and inter-jurisdictional worship and exchange. The individuals I interviewed indicated that it was worth the time and resources to go on the team. They spoke of the humbling experience in the face of love expressed and extended by local people and new understandings of their purpose as Orthodox Christians.</p>
<p>OCMC offers opportunities for pan-Orthodox worship and engagement that were inconceivable 20 years ago. Short-term mission provides potential to awaken new understandings of Orthodox identity and purpose in the light of a theological legacy that calls for service in the context of communities of love for humanity. A new generation of Orthodox leaders and laity are drawing on an expanded Orthodox vision and experience to develop institutions and initiatives to serve the neighbor at home and abroad. Are short-term mission cross-cultural encounters that are as mutually respectful and egalitarian as expected from Orthodox theological discourse? Can Orthodox Christians participate in meaningful mission and outreach without ethnic and racial reconciliation in their parishes in the United States? Does short-term mission work create the context to develop cross-cultural understanding and reconciliation? How does the conflicted history of the Orthodox Church in the Balkans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091829612475165">Makrides, 2004</xref>) and Alaska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091829612475165">Luehrmann, 2008</xref>) under foreign invasion and colonial and postcolonial rule impact short-term missions? Leaders in the Orthodox Church experienced these historical conflicts rooted in ethnic contempt and violence first hand and have not directly addressed these historical events in their writings on Orthodox missions. These questions emerged from my study of short-term missions and are among other questions that should guide future research on the short-term missions in the Orthodox Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091829612475165">5</xref></sup></p>
