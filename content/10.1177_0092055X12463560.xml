<p>Learning how to write using the sociological perspective is a journey. Sometimes on this journey it helps to have a guide! Whether undergraduates taking sociology classes or graduate students progressing through their course work, writing becomes a vehicle for students not only to communicate their mastery of the discipline but also the voice that conveys their research. Having a “how to” book on producing well-written sociological work that students can either read and/or reference has the potential to be a powerful tool. <italic>Writing in Sociology</italic> is a book that aims to do just that: to teach students how to write in the field of sociology while embracing the struggles and triumphs that happen during the writing process. After reading this book, I view it as a “student user manual” that details different types of sociological writing, using a variety of illustrations, so that students can learn to write, and write well, in sociology.</p>
<p>Edwards’s book is well written and clearly organized. It is easy to follow his progression from brainstorming research ideas to writing up quantitative and qualitative research. An organizational feature that I find beneficial is that each chapter can stand alone or the book can be read in its entirety. This can be useful for students who need help in specific areas, such as strengthening their literature review or writing the results section of a quantitative paper. They can simply locate the chapter they need to read or reference instead of having to sift through larger bodies of text. In addition, because Edwards’s writing keeps a good pace and is laced with a bit of humor, the book itself can be read within a short amount of time; for example, a few hours here and there over a few days.</p>
<p><italic>Writing in Sociology</italic> is broken down into four primary sections: an overview of sociological writing, quantitative writing, qualitative writing, and other types of writing objectives such as applied research literature reviews. The first section, containing chapters one through five, gives students a broad overview of writing in sociology from turning research ideas into research questions, grounding research in the published literature, to citing sources. I am appreciative that Edwards starts out his book with a short discussion of how personal the writing process can be and that, at times, it takes courage to have someone else read and critique what we write. This especially holds true for students who are just starting to learn how to write from the sociological perspective.</p>
<p>The remainder of section one focuses on the “nuts and bolts” of sociological writing. Novice and even seasoned sociology students struggle with formulating research ideas and then turning them into research questions. To address this, Edwards dedicates an entire chapter to this topic (chapter two). He offers many examples to help students move beyond what may appear to them as individualistic questions to sociological questions. In chapter three, he provides a good analogy of how to construct a research paper by using the scenario of a lawyer making a strong case to convince a jury and a researcher who uses similar yet different tactics to create good and convincing arguments that contribute to their field. The analogy is easy to follow and students should be able to make the connections between the lawyer, the researcher, and the basic creation of a research paper. The next chapter addresses how to contribute to the conversation, or the body of research, using existing literature. Chapter four helps students address how to situate their research within the conversation, but also how to summarize the conversation that preceded it. Years ago my major professor once told me that I did not need to include “everything and the kitchen sink.” Edwards gives students similar advice on how to sift and filter the literature to streamline the conversation to their current research, leaving everything and the kitchen sink behind. The final chapter focuses on citations. In my teaching experience, undergraduate students continue to learn when and how to cite throughout their undergraduate careers. They also tend to be unfamiliar with American Sociological Association (ASA) citation format. Chapter five is a helpful reference guide giving students advice from ASA on when to cite and provides a detailed list of specific examples of in-text citations and bibliographic citations that use ASA format.</p>
<p>The second section of the book, chapters 6 through 10, details a “how to write” manual for each part that is typically found in a quantitative research paper: introduction (chapter 6), literature review (chapter 7), data and methods (chapter 8), results (chapter 9), and the discussion and conclusion (chapter 10). I like that Edwards explains the purpose of each part of the research paper so students can better understand why each portion of the paper is important. He gives practical advice such as writing the introduction last, how to organize your literature review around your dependent and independent variables, information that should be or not be included in the data and methods section, and other writing decisions such as using present tense versus past tense. I feel the most valuable asset of this section is the high number of writing excerpts throughout each chapter that Edwards uses to illustrate how to write each part of the paper using good writing techniques.</p>
<p>One strong characteristic of <italic>Writing in Sociology</italic> is that it offers an abundance of examples of what is considered weak writing, or writing that needs improvement, and examples of well-written work, or strong writing. For students who are visual learners, they will find this presentation style particularly attractive. Not only do they hear Edwards’s discussion of the “how to write” but also see multiple illustrations that correspond to his discussion. For example, in chapter 10, Edwards includes a piece of a student-written discussion. He makes multiple observations of how to improve the writing. Edwards then ends the example by giving the reader a revised version that moves the discussion from weak writing to strong writing. Using this method, students learn how to improve their writing over a series of steps: reading the original work, reading Edwards’s suggestions for improvement, and then reading the revised work. While not all examples follow this specific pattern, I do not feel that students will be left wanting for more examples in the quantitative chapters.</p>
<p>The third section of the book, chapters 11 through 13, discusses three types of qualitative writing: ethnographic interviewing and storytelling (chapter 11, guest authored), the case study (chapter 12), and the internship journal (chapter 13, guest authored). Chapter 11 is a published article by Richard G. Mitchell, Jr. and Kathy Charmaz titled “Telling Tales, Writing Stories: Postmodernist Visions and Realist Images in Ethnographic Writing,” and Edwards gives a small introduction to the piece. After reading this chapter, I wanted to hear more from Edwards on the “how to write” process that patterns the prior chapters such as advice on how students can work through writing such a piece or examples of weak writing to strong writing. In chapter 12, Edwards clearly defines a case study and offers useful advice on narrowing a research focus, what to report, and information to include in the write up. Here again I wanted more examples of excerpts and illustrations of weak writing to strong writing so students would have a clearer picture of how to write a case study. Because this chapter is quite short, it would have been beneficial to include one or more citations (or possibly excerpts) from a well-written case study for students to reference. The last qualitative chapter describes writing an internship journal. It contains good examples of poor, better, and strong writing fitting for a journal project. Professors could also use this chapter as a guide to create their own internship or general journal assignment.</p>
<p>The final section, chapters 14 through 16, addresses other writing tasks of sociologists: applied research literature reviews (chapter 14, guest authored), book reviews (chapter 15), and advice on writing content versus theory papers (chapter 16, guest authored). I was impressed with chapter 14 and the amount of detail the guest author provided on conducting literature reviews for applied research. This is a chapter I would suggest students read who are conducting this type of literature review.</p>
<p>Because this book can be used in its entirety or used on a chapter by chapter basis, the sections students read will be based on the discretion of the professor. This book in its entirety would be appropriate for undergraduate courses that include both quantitative and qualitative writing, although I would strongly suggest supplementing other readings on how to produce good quality qualitative work. It is important to note that due to the use of quantitative terminology, section two would be best suited for undergraduates who are currently taking or have taken a basic research methods course. Unfamiliarity with the terminology may leave some undergraduates, for instance those in an Introduction to Sociology course, overwhelmed. I would recommend chapter 16 for Introduction to Sociology because it focuses on writing content papers and theory papers. This is something they may be asked to do as an application exercise to show their understanding of the material. Pertaining to graduate students, this book would be a good starter book for first years to begin honing their sociological writing skills and to keep as a reference book throughout graduate school. Overall, <italic>Writing in Sociology</italic> has the potential to be a useful resource for a variety of sociology students, particularly with quantitative writing, but its overall use-value for the professor and his or her classroom depends on the focus of the course and the depth of students’ sociological background.</p>
