<p>This valuable collection of essays arose from seminars convened by Exeter’s project on <italic>Uses of the Bible in Environmental Ethics</italic>. The book has twenty chapters divided into three parts: the first covers biblical texts; the second covers historical theology, and the third part emphasises contemporary issues. Part one contains chapters on Genesis 1–3, Leviticus, the Prophets, Wisdom, the Synoptic Gospels, Romans 8, Colossians, and 2 Peter. Considering the relative size of the Old and New Testaments (3.5 to 1) it is weighted to the New. Further, of the four New Testament essays two are on eschatology and another on cosmology: the emphasis is clear.</p>
<p>John Rogerson (chapter 1) considers debates about the role of interpreters of the creation narratives in modern ideologies of unlimited growth. He highlights German contributions: Lohfink read ‘subdue’ as to ‘set foot on’, to occupy land. Whereas most later instances convey hostility, Rogerson admits the context of an idealised peaceful world in Genesis 1 is decisive. Jonathan Morgan (ch. 2) suggests animal sacrifice in Leviticus teaches humility and interdependence. It was deemed essential to regularly purify the sanctuary from anthropogenic corruption, to save the land from catastrophe (p. 37). Only domesticated animals, as sinless members of the covenant community, were ‘ritually capable’ of this role (p. 42). John Barton (ch. 3) in his survey of the Prophets assumes a distinction between the ‘authentic words’ of eighth- to sixth-century prophets, and later material (p. 49). The former emphasises interpersonal ethics. The latter, he agrees with Robert Murray, returns to older ideas of a ‘cosmic covenant’ under which ‘human misconduct’ disturbs nature. However, in this scheme, order is restored not by ethics but through ritual, and rebuilding the temple (p. 53). Katherine Dell (ch. 4) explores the Wisdom literature and finds God at work among nonhuman creatures, who relate directly to their Creator. They were presented as exemplary in following God’s will. Wisdom also prompts awe at God’s works of ‘weal and woe’ (as in natural disasters), and also openness to contradiction and change.</p>
<p>Richard Bauckham (ch. 5) considers two approaches to ecological interpretation of the Gospels. The first reconstructs the rural context of Galilee using science, history and imagination. Compared to rabbinic literature, Jesus’ parables connect more with the everyday world. The second half focuses on the ‘overriding theme of his mission and teaching’ (p. 77), the Kingdom of God which encompasses all creation, and points to the earth’s renewal. Brendan Byrne (ch. 6) puts Rom. 8:19-22 in the context of Paul’s explanation of overlap between this age and the age to come, and the problems of that situation: suffering, mortality and ethics (p. 85). Negatively, he finds no concept of direct human agency harming the earth; instead ‘human failure redounds negatively’ on earth through God’s curse (p. 88). Positively but peripherally, nonhuman creatures are included in Paul’s hope. Vicky Balabanksi (ch. 7) thinks Colossians constructs a Christological cosmology by adapting ideas from Philo and Plato’s <italic>Timaeus</italic> (pp. 95, 99). She wonders if cosmic Christology, strong in Eastern Christianity, can be revived in the West where the Spirit fills this role. Edward Adams (ch. 8) rejects readings of 2 Peter 3 that discern a purifying transformation of creation with both discontinuity and continuity. Instead he argues that the letter’s writer follows a modified Stoic cosmology with a cycle of dissolution (to primal fire or light) and fresh creation. Adams construes this positively as ‘recycling’ (p. 116): well yes, but only at a sub-elementary level. This scheme offers no continuity for human beings, let alone for planet earth. No attempt is made to reconcile Stoic-style dissolution with bodily resurrection. Adam’s case hangs on a belief that 2 Peter’s background ideas are not from the Old Testament but from later Jewish and Greek cosmology (p. 113), since the remainder of his arguments are insufficient to overturn the transformative interpretation.</p>
<p>Part two asks if historical theologians can be appropriated. A virtue here is that most of the invited authors are not known as ecotheologians but as specialists in their fields. Francis Watson (ch. 9) suggests Irenaeus’s arguments against Valentinians can be helpful today in critiquing a similar distortion: the anthropomonism of regarding human fall and redemption as the whole story. Irenaeus opposed the Gnostic idea that ‘human existence is a life in exile from one’s true home’ (p. 135). Morwenna Ludlow (ch. 10) surveys readings of Genesis 1 by Origen, Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine. Not only were the Fathers guided by Greco-Roman philosophy but their version was even more anthropocentric due to their interpretation of the Incarnation, and of rationality as the image of God. Positively, their idea of hierarchy was linked to a helpful emphasis on connectedness. Mark Wynn (ch. 11) finds foundational ideas for ecotheology from Aquinas’s ideas about the goodness of being, and the value of diversity. For example: ‘He produced many and diverse, so that what was wanting in one expression of his goodness might be supplied by another’ (p. 158). Each species therefore rightly has a goal to preserve itself so it can contribute to this diversity.</p>
<p>Paul Santmire (ch. 12) explains that Luther’s theological inattention to nature resulted from his emphasis on faith by hearing, not by sight, which was linked to the rejected ‘theology of glory’. Luther occasionally marvelled at God’s immanence, and at grace mediated through creation (p. 175), especially in his later years: for example he preached in 1544 that nature is ‘full of Bible’ and ‘God knocks on our eyes’ (p. 177). Geoff Thompson (ch. 13) sees common ground between ecotheology and Karl Barth’s critique of human-centred theology. Barth saw symptoms of this malaise in the eighteenth century’s anthropocentric model of the universe, and its preference for humanised versions of nature (p. 183). He also discerns that nonhuman creatures have ‘their own dignity and right’ and are ‘enveloped in the secret of their own relation to their Creator’ (p. 193). David Moss (ch. 14) admits Balthasar is ‘thin’ on ecotheology but sees value in his aesthetics of beauty. Andrew Louth (ch. 15) shows that within Orthodoxy the ‘great arc of God’s economy moves from creation to transfiguration’ (p. 211) and this is ‘not a transformation into something else…but reveals the true reality of what is transfigured’ (p. 216). This big picture frames the lesser arc of fall–redemption. Louth also presents the ecotheological value of the doctrine that God creates <italic>ex nihilo</italic>. Jeremy Law (ch. 16) provides a guide to Moltmann’s ecotheology, a concise summary that will be widely useful. Law outlines five biblical motifs, and explains Moltmann’s path from exegesis to theology. Hope in the future ‘resurrection of nature’ (p. 234) should not be an excuse for passive waiting because Christian ‘anticipation’ is the ‘construction of representations of what is to come’ (p. 236).</p>
<p>In part three, Harry Maier (ch. 17) observes eschatology’s significance in the USA, but finds divergent receptions. On the one hand, Todd Strandberg of <italic>Rapture Ready</italic> tells Christians to save souls and not waste time on the earth. On the other hand, among premillenialists and progressive dispensationalists many emphasise creation care. Maier acknowledges the practical virtue of green Evangelical deployment of biblical texts. Stephen Barton (ch. 18) calls for integration of three approaches to eschatology: biblical, theological and ascetical. He agrees with Richard Hays that apocalyptic is integral to the Gospel and should not be historicised only in first-century fulfilment. He notes Kathryn Tanner’s ‘surrender’ to fatalism: she claims ‘the world does not have a future’ and her hope is in God’s ‘ongoing redemptive’ work in the present world (p. 273). Barton instead commends personal discipline or formation through praise, liturgy, and the sabbath. Tim Gorringe (ch. 19) reflects on six biblical texts. Among these, Gen. 2:15 suggests that working on the land is a paradigm of human service, and of keeping Torah. Lev. 18:3-5 warns against Egypt, which is a symbol of the structures of oppression we encounter today. The jubilee laws critique the amassing of land (the means of production) by a few rich people. Phil. 4:5 calls us to ‘moderation’ rather than unbridled growth.</p>
<p>Ernst Conradie (ch. 20) discerns that ecological hermeneutics has a problem shared by all who seek to apply Scripture to life. Analogy (similarity in difference) is needed to bridge the domains of Bible, tradition, and today’s world. Preachers’ use of analogies from moral principle, situation, or promise, could be arbitrary but in practice is guided by doctrinal constructs. Conradie notices ecotheological writers commonly use three types of construct: human responsibility, a sense of nature as sacred, and future hope. He commends three others which have been less popular: liberation, wisdom, and the ‘household of God’. He admits that all constructs are imperfect and none by itself is adequate. All the chapters discuss hermeneutics, and they agree that ecotheological application is difficult because of the cultural distance. The book’s introduction by David Horrell sets out strategies for ecological hermeneutics that are ‘coherent (and in dialogue) with a scripturally shaped Christian orthodoxy’ through learning critically from the history of interpretation while acknowledging that ‘ethical appropriation is necessarily a constructive endeavour’ (pp. 8-9). This multidisciplinary collection of essays is a substantial contribution to that endeavour and will be helpful to those interested in theological approaches to environmental ethics.</p>
