<abstract>
<p>This analysis examines Arizona’s English fluency evaluation initiative, which aims to address the fluency standards for teachers of English Language Learners (ELLs) set forth in the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act. The authors deploy a sociolinguistic framework to consider what components of teachers’ language are being evaluated by the policy, illuminating how the policy conflates fluency, accent, and pronunciation. After determining that the initiative does in fact evaluate teachers based on accent, the authors argue that Arizona’s unique interpretation of NCLB’s fluency standard exceeds Congressional intent and has no foundation in the professional standards for teachers of ELLs as established by either the National Council of Teacher Accreditation (NCATE) or the Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages organization (TESOL). The authors then interrogate the initiative and the evaluation protocol, discussing implications on the development of democratic school communities, language-based discrimination, and the academic experiences of ELLs. Concluding that the initiative and protocol fail to evaluate fluency, threaten democratic school communities, and risk discriminatory practices, the authors recommend that Arizona revoke the initiative and return teachers affected by the policy to the ELL classrooms for which they were initially hired.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arizona’s practice of measuring the English language fluency of teachers who teach English Language Learner (ELL) students includes a nuance not present in either the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which calls for fluency in the teaching of English to nonnative speakers, or in standards set by the National Council of Teacher Accreditation (NCATE) or the Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages association (TESOL). The Arizona Department of Education (ADE) evaluates teachers’ speech, and in the last year the ADE has come under public scrutiny for what is seen as evaluating teachers based on their accent. Writing for the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904811429293">Jordan (2010)</xref> reported that teachers<disp-quote>
<p>whose spoken English it [ADE] deems to be heavily accented or ungrammatical must be removed from classes for students still learning English. State education officials say the move is intended to ensure that students with limited English have teachers who speak the language flawlessly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Arizona’s initiative is an attempt to implement federal policy requiring states that receive federal funding to certify that teachers of ELL children are fluent in English. State officials assert that the initiative does not target accent, but rather targets pronunciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0895904811429293">Zehr, 2010</xref>). While critics push state education officials to clarify just how, exactly, evaluation based on pronunciation differs from evaluation based on accent, larger concerns loom in the background and beg the attention of policy makers, educational leaders, and the public. These concerns, which we seek to address in this analysis, are as follows:</p>

</list>
<p>In this article, we employ research in sociolinguistics and the teaching of ELL students to investigate the potential ramifications of Arizona’s fluency policy and practice of evaluating teachers of ELLs based on their accent. We seek to shed some light on why the ADE chose to include teacher accent as a component of English language fluency evaluation, discuss the decision in relation to the requirements of federal policy and the requirements of Arizona’s state code, identify how including teacher accent as a component of English language fluency may affect the local school climate, and critically examine a rationale for supporting the inclusion of teacher accent as a component of English language fluency evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0895904811429293">
<title>Conceptual Approach</title>
<sec id="section3-0895904811429293">
<title>Fluency, Accent, and Pronunciation</title>
<p>Before proceeding with our analysis, it is necessary to first establish a sociolinguistic framework to delineate fluency, accent, and pronunciation. The policy language of NCLB requires that teachers of ELLs demonstrate “fluency” in the language of instruction, stating that<disp-quote>
<p>Each eligible entity receiving a subgrant under section 6824 of this title shall include in its plan a certification that all teachers in any language instruction educational program for limited English proficient children that is, or will be, funded under this part are fluent in English and any other language used for instruction, including having written and oral communications skills. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0895904811429293">No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus we begin our sociolinguistic framework by pointing out how linguists define fluency. Subsequently, ADE has been accused of using accent to evaluate fluency, while rebutting that it uses pronunciation to assess it. To settle this dispute, we consider how linguists define accent and pronunciation. Doing so will demonstrate that pronunciation is most often a feature of accent. Thus, while the ADE claims it is not evaluating teachers based on accent, we argue that by evaluating teachers’ pronunciation, it is in fact evaluating components of language that correspond to accent.</p>
<p>While research on language fluency recognizes the intricacies of the construct, linguists generally agree that a basic definition of language fluency encompasses two characteristics: (a) the ability of a speaker to produce language smoothly, and (b) the rate of speech production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0895904811429293">Lennon 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904811429293">Chambers 1997</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904811429293">Housen and Kuiken (2009)</xref> state, “fluency is primarily related to learners’ control over their linguistic L2 [second language] knowledge, as reflected in the speed and ease with which they access relevant L2 information to communicate meanings in real time” (p. 462). While this definition summarizes the scholastic understanding of language fluency, for the sake of our analysis it is important to note that Housen and Kuiken likewise submit that the lay usage of fluency “refers to a person’s general language proficiency, particularly as characterized by perceptions of ease, eloquence, and ‘smoothness’ of speech or writing” (p. 463). Thus, regardless of whether Congress consulted linguistic research or relied on common understandings of language fluency, it seems that Congressional intent in the “fluency” mandate of NCLB must have been to ensure that teachers of ELLs are able to produce English with ease. It is noteworthy that neither scholastic nor lay definitions of fluency include accent or pronunciation.</p>
<p>This is because accent and pronunciation have little to do with fluency in a second language. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904811429293">Grosjean (2010)</xref> illuminates misconceptions of accent, stating that<disp-quote>
<p>Having an accent or not in a language does not make you more or less bilingual . . . In fact, some extremely fluent and balanced bilinguals have an accent in the one, or the other, language; other, less fluent, bilinguals may have no accent at all. (p. 77)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Grosjean clarifies that there are primarily two reasons that an individual would exhibit accented speech: (a) she has acquired a specific dialect of a language (i.e., Bostonian dialect of English), and (b) she is bilingual (or trilingual or quadrilingual, etc.) and one or more languages is having an influence on the language being spoken. Thus, among linguists, accent captures local, regional, and international variations in speech production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811429293">Derwing and Munro (2009)</xref> solidify this point, stating that<disp-quote>
<p>When we talk about accents, we’re talking about different ways of producing speech. Of course, everyone has an accent, and no accent, native or non-native, is inherently better than any other . . . when we use the word accent here, we refer to the ways in which [non-native] speech differs from that local variety of English and the impact of that difference on speakers and listeners. (p. 476)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, accent is a highly subjective construct. What some speakers may consider accented speech could be considered perfectly standard to others. In fact, Derwing and Munro caution that accent “has been used as a cover-up for racism and other kinds of discrimination” (p. 476). The risk of discrimination based on accent makes it all the more crucial to determine if the ADE is measuring accent when it evaluates teachers of ELLs for their pronunciation. Thus we ask, “What is the relationship between accent and pronunciation?”</p>
<p>A concise answer is that pronunciation is a feature of accent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904811429293">Giles (1970)</xref> states, accent represents, among other features, “one’s manner of pronunciation” (p. 213). Stated differently, pronunciation in a second language may be affected by accent. Likewise, local varieties of language (i.e., Bostonian English) may alternatively produce variations in pronunciation within the same language. Moreover, “pronunciation is learnable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811429293">Derwing &amp; Munro, 2009</xref>, p. 480), meaning that it can be adapted to local varieties with exposure and/or intentional practice. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, we disagree with the ADE’s claim that it is not targeting accent when it evaluates teachers of ELLs for pronunciation. Pronunciation is a feature of accent, and subjecting teachers to evaluations of their pronunciation is merely a euphemistic strategy for avoiding the ridicule associated with acknowledgment of evaluating teachers for accent. For the purposes of this analysis, we hold that the ADE is, in fact, evaluating teachers for accent.</p>

<title>Framework for Analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the ADE’s policy initiative, we generally follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904811429293">Bardach’s (2005)</xref> recommendations for conducting a policy analysis. First, we define the problem by providing historical background on ELL educational policy in Arizona and synthesizing available media coverage of the accent evaluation initiative. Then, using publicly available documents from the ADE, the Arizona Education Association (AEA), NCATE, and TESOL, we assemble evidence to examine why the ADE includes evaluation of teacher accent as a measure of English language fluency, particularly as it relates to NCLB and the Arizona Revised Statutes.</p>
<p>After establishing background information and assembling evidence, we then select evaluative criteria to interrogate the ADE’s inclusion of teacher accent as a component of English language fluency using applicable literature from applied linguistics, education, and sociology. Such an investigation will unearth potential ramifications of the initiative. After evaluating the ADE initiative, we appraise Arizona’s English language fluency policy and discuss policy recommendations pertinent to state and federal educational policy.</p>

<title>Defining the Problem</title>
<sec id="section6-0895904811429293">
<title>Historical Context and Implementation of Accent Evaluation</title>
<p>Arizona is, by statute, an English-only state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904811429293">Combs, Evans, Fletcher, Parra, &amp; Jiménez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0895904811429293">Wright, 2005</xref>). Moreover, it has codified a state-sanctioned instructional program for addressing the needs of its ELL student population. Arizona implements Structured English Immersion (SEI), an educational methodology that is “an English language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in English but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0895904811429293">1</xref></sup> In Arizona, teachers whose primary responsibility is instructing ELLs are known as SEI teachers, and it is SEI teachers that are being evaluated for accent.</p>
<p>The ADE has been assessing SEI teachers for English language fluency, including teachers’ accents, since at least 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0895904811429293">Zehr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904811429293">Gartell, 2010</xref>). According to several online news reports and public documents available from the Arizona Education Association, the ADE began evaluating teachers that staff their SEI programs for excessive accent to comply with the aforementioned section of NCLB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904811429293">Balan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904811429293">Gartell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904811429293">Jordan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0895904811429293">Stegall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0895904811429293">Zehr, 2010</xref>). However, as is evident by the language of NCLB, federal policy neither mentions nor requires the evaluation of teacher accent as a component of ensuring English language fluency among teachers of ELL students. If NCLB does not require accent evaluation, then why does Arizona evaluate its SEI teachers for accent?</p>
<p>It does so because it has chosen to uniquely interpret the federal policy in such a way that accent becomes a component of fluency. As a national educational policy, NCLB recognizes the diverse educational needs of individual states. The relationship between NCLB and the states is such that policy makers are able to interpret and implement NCLB’s federal mandates differently from state to state, provided that their interpretations and implementations do not violate the U.S. Constitution (U.S. Const., amend. X; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904811429293">Christie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904811429293">Eginton, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0895904811429293">Kessinger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0895904811429293">Manna, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0895904811429293">Mohammed, Pisapia, &amp; Walker, 2009</xref>). Thus the ADE’s interpretation of NCLB’s English language fluency requirement is permissible in that it is within the state’s authority to develop unique policies, processes, and procedures that allow it to comply with federal policy. What remains to be seen is whether or not the ADE’s interpretation of fluency is reasonable, justifiable, and in line with constitutional safeguards against discrimination.</p>

<title>Assembling Evidence</title>
<sec id="section8-0895904811429293">
<title>Problems With ADE’s Interpretation of Accent as a Component of Fluency</title>
<p>The ADE’s rationale for including teacher accent as a component of English language fluency evaluation is elusive. The ADE’s only explicit statements about the policy appear in the aforementioned media coverage. Therefore, we consulted several logical venues in an effort to bring clarity to the ADE’s rationale for implementing the policy. The first was the professional organizations that govern the standards for teachers of ELL students: NCATE and TESOL. Entertaining the possibility that professional standards for ELL teachers may include fluency evaluation as an important component of ELL teacher effectiveness, we consulted the professional standards that were coestablished in 2003 and revised in 2010 by NCATE and TESOL. If the professional standards of teachers of ELL students had included measures of teacher accent as a demonstration of teacher effectiveness, then it would have followed that the ADE’s inclusion of teacher accent in evaluations of fluency may have a foundation in the scholarly work of such professional organizations.</p>
<p>However, an examination of the NCATE/TESOL professional standards revealed that neither teacher accent nor teacher pronunciation are included in evaluation rubrics designed to assess a teacher’s ability to provide effective instruction in ELL classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0895904811429293">TESOL, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0895904811429293">2010b</xref>). Thus the ADE’s rationale that teacher accent is crucial to SEI teacher effectiveness is suspect. It does not align with the standards established by the professional organizations that guide ELL teacher preparation.</p>
<p>If NCLB fails to specify teacher accent as a component of English language fluency evaluation, and the professional standards established by NCATE and TESOL also fail to include teacher accent as an indicator of teacher effectiveness, then why would the ADE decide that teacher accent should be included as a component of English language fluency evaluation? In continuing to search for an answer to this question, we next consulted the Arizona Revised Statutes. If Arizona had formally expanded on NCLB’s fluency mandate by legislating accent evaluation, then the mystery surrounding the origins of ADE’s inclusion of accent in fluency evaluation could be solved. However, an investigation into the Arizona Revised Statutes that govern education for ELLs generated more confusion than clarity. While the statutes governing ELL issues address program monitoring, teacher training, financial auditing, and even “how many of the sample [of 300 ELL students] can read the randomly ordered alphabet in thirty seconds or less,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0895904811429293">2</xref></sup> there is no mention of evaluating teacher accent as a component of English language fluency.</p>
<p>In the absence of any formal federal or state policies requiring an evaluation of teacher accent as a measure of English language fluency, we lastly looked to the ADE for a publicly available chronicle of why it chose to include teacher accent as an evaluation component for its SEI teachers. However, the closest rationale we could compose is a piecemeal reconstruction of the ADE’s initiative from presentations posted to its web site and a publicly available SEI Observation Protocol supplied to a journalist by an ADE official.</p>
<p>According to materials posted on the ADE’s Office of English Language Acquisition Services (OELAS) web site, SEI teachers in Arizona must be Highly Qualified, properly certificated, and hold a Structured English Immersion (SEI), English as a Second Language (ESL), or Bilingual Endorsement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0895904811429293">OELAS, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0895904811429293">Stollar, Gutier, Johnston, Santa Cruz, &amp; Gilbreath, 2009</xref>). These criteria do not include an evaluation of either teacher accent as a qualifying credential for SEI teachers in Arizona, and a clear statement from the ADE about teacher accent as a measure of English language fluency has not been found. In fact, the only publicly available document we could find that provides any insight into how and why ADE includes teacher accent as a measure of English language fluency is the SEI Program Observation Protocol supplied by an ADE official to an assistant editor for <italic>Education Week</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0895904811429293">Zehr, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, our investigation indicates that the only conclusive statement that can be made about Arizona’s rationale for including teacher accent as a component of English fluency evaluation is that the ADE intended the initiative to address the English fluency requirement of NCLB. The ADE has offered no clear explanation about why it interprets fluency as accent. However, after scrutinizing the initiative under federal and state policy, the professional standards of NCATE and TESOL, and the Arizona Revised Statutes, it is reasonable to conclude that the ADE has chosen to evaluate its SEI teachers for accent simply because it has developed a unique interpretation of NCLB. Such an interpretation not only exceeds the intentions of federal policy but also exceeds the educational codes of its own state. Moreover, in choosing to create and implement a policy based on a unique interpretation of NCLB, the ADE risks not only expanding English fluency evaluation criteria into realms never intended by Congress but also discriminatory practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0895904811429293">
<title>How Does ADE Evaluate Teachers for Accent?</title>
<p>Using the only document available for contextualizing the English fluency evaluation process, we consult a brief section of the SEI Program Observation Protocol titled <italic>Federal Compliance: Teacher Fluency</italic>. In this section of the protocol, program evaluators are asked to respond to only two statements intended to capture the teacher’s English language fluency. One statement refers to accurate grammar use, and the other to pronunciation, which is linguistically a component of accent. Both statements have categorical response options (Y for yes/ N for no), and in the event that the program evaluator observes errors in grammar and/or pronunciation, he or she is asked to record the mistakes.</p>
<p>As the SEI Observation Protocol is the only available document that illuminates how the ADE evaluates teacher accent as a component of English language fluency, it is also pertinent to mention several guidelines that appear under the protocol’s <italic>Federal Compliance: Teacher Fluency</italic> section. Evaluators are told,<disp-quote>
<p>If there are usage errors in grammar made by the instructor in his/her oral and/or written communication, this constitutes a “NO” response . . . if the monitor hears a message that is incomprehensible in English from the instructor, this constitutes a “NO” response . . . if the monitors hear words used that are impeding communication, this constitutes a “NO” response. (SEI Classroom Observation, 2009-2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to several reports, following an evaluation for English language fluency, SEI teachers who are deemed too heavily accented face the threat of removal and relocation from their SEI teaching position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904811429293">Jordan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0895904811429293">Zehr, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0895904811429293">
<title>Issues of Validity and Reliability: Does the SEI Observation Protocol Measure Fluency?</title>
<p>The SEI Observation Protocol is neither valid nor reliable instrument for assessing English language fluency for at least three reasons. First, as previously discussed, fluency deals with a speaker’s ease of language production, most notably the ability to produce language with “native-like rapidity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0895904811429293">Lennon, 1990</xref>, p. 390). Notably, fluency has little to do with pronunciation and accent. Rather, it has to do with the rate at which an individual is able to produce language. On this point, the criteria of the ADE evaluation protocol confounds fluency with accent. In fact, the SEI evaluation protocol does not measure fluency at all. On the contrary, it attempts to measure pronunciation, which is a feature of accent.</p>
<p>Second, by design the protocol is ambiguous. Beyond grammar errors, the protocol offers evaluators only two criteria for determining English language fluency: incomprehensibility and impeding communication. Yet, incomprehensibility and impediments to communication are largely subjective. What one evaluator deems incomprehensible or difficult to understand may be entirely comprehensible and easy to understand to another individual. A simple illustration clarifies this point: To Bostonian students, a teacher from Boston who pronounces words with a Bostonian accent presents no challenges to comprehensibility. However, if this same teacher from Boston moves to Arizona and is hired to teach in an SEI program, under the ADE protocol, this teacher may suddenly be deemed insufficiently fluent in English because of her pronunciation. Such an illustration highlights not only the absurdities that result from using accent and pronunciation as a measure of English language fluency but also the unreliable nature of the SEI Observation Protocol instrument.</p>
<p>Moreover, such incomprehensible messages and impediments to communication are just as likely to occur in mainstream classrooms as they are to occur in SEI classrooms. Unless the ADE is willing to evaluate all teachers in Arizona for flawless grammar use and impeccable communication skills, then an argument could be made that only evaluating the grammar and comprehensibility of SEI teachers targets a specific population of professional educators that have contact with ELL students. Thus the ADE assumes that teachers in other departments speak and write English flawlessly and do not need to be monitored for accurate grammar and incomprehensible messages as they instruct students who are in various phases of acquiring English.</p>
<p>The evidence we have assembled regarding why and how the ADE evaluates SEI teachers for accent suggests that the policy represents a dangerous expansion of the fluency mandate of NCLB. In light of the dangers presented by the policy, we now turn toward three strands of scholastic literature as we evaluate the possible outcomes of the policy. Doing so reveals the risks involved with ongoing implementation of the policy.</p>

<sec id="section11-0895904811429293">
<title>Evaluative Criteria</title>
<p>At first blush, what has transpired in Arizona may appear to be inconsequential on a national scale. However, because the issue of English language fluency deals with a federal policy affecting the federal allocation of school funds, other states that are eager to demonstrate compliance with the English language fluency stipulation of NCLB may be influenced by Arizona’s inclusion of teacher accent as a component of English fluency. Because this creates a wider scope of relevance, it is necessary to evaluate the ADE policy in light of the potential educational, social, and cultural ramifications that it may produce. To reveal these potential repercussions, we consult research from education, applied linguistics, and second language acquisition.</p>

Consequently, it is a misstep to attempt the construction of a learning environment that fails to expose students to the linguistic diversity of the English language and the variety of English accents they will encounter in the work force and in institutions of higher education. Extending this rationale further, we suggest that attempting to shield Arizona’s youth from exposure to a variety of spoken and written English in the classroom is to withhold opportunities for students to develop language-based critical thinking skills and essential communication strategies for navigating the linguistic diversity they will face as adults. To better understand the expansive diversity of spoken and written English, it is helpful to consult a field of applied linguistics that concerns itself with the spread of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF). A glimpse into ELF scholarship will provoke a critical conversation about the ADE’s inclusion of teacher accent as a component of English language fluency, suggesting that it is detrimental to students who need to be able to navigate communication in a world of extremely diverse English speakers.</p>
<p>ELF scholarship recognizes the emergence of English as a universal language of the global market and documents the tremendous functionality of English use among nonnative English speaking populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904811429293">Dewey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904811429293">Ferguson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904811429293">Fraile Marcos, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904811429293">Jenkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0895904811429293">Phillipson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0895904811429293">Van Rooy, 2010</xref>). For some populations of nonnative English speakers, English has become a primary second language, resulting in a distinct variation of English unique to the population that speaks it. Some applied linguists refer to this phenomenon as the development of World Englishes (WE), acknowledging that as English has spread across the globe, the linguistic ideology of a standard or pure form of English is not appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904811429293">Bhatt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904811429293">Davies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904811429293">Jenkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904811429293">Kachru, Kachru, &amp; Nelson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0895904811429293">Mesthrie &amp; Bhatt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0895904811429293">Smith &amp; East-West Center, 1987</xref>). Many scholars have pointed out that speakers of WE and ELF vastly outnumber those who speak English as a native language, and even those who speak English as a second language and English as a foreign language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904811429293">Dewey 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904811429293">Jenkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904811429293">Ferguson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904811429293">Ferguson, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904811429293">Fraile Marcos (2000)</xref> contributes that while there are 300 to 400 million native English speakers worldwide, at least 800 million people use English as a means of communication on a regular basis. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904811429293">Dewey (2007)</xref> adds that<disp-quote>
<p>A wider, deeper, accelerated interconnectedness has far-reaching implications regarding languages, especially one so often described as a lingua franca. English is like no other language in its current role internationally, indeed like no other at any moment in history. Although there are, and have previously been, other international languages, the case of English is different in fundamental ways: for the extent of its diffusion geographically; for the enormous cultural diversity of the speakers who use it; and for the infinitely varied domains in which it is found and purposes it serves (p. 333).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The expanding domain of the English language, which includes the many diverse cultures and accents represented by the ELF phenomenon, warrants a criticism of the ADE’s evaluation of teachers based on accent. The expansion and increasing diversity of the English language is inevitable. As preparation for full participation in the 21st century is arguably the tantamount goal of contemporary educational policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0895904811429293">Spring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0895904811429293">Wagner, 2008</xref>), implementing an initiative that cleanses classrooms of teachers based on accent could underprepare children to encounter an increasingly diverse English-speaking world. On this point, it could be argued that a failure to provide Arizona’s children with frequent opportunities to encounter diverse English accents breaks bridges between these children and the globalized, linguistically diverse world.</p>

<title>Social Ramifications</title>
<p>A second dimension of the ADE’s English language fluency evaluation initiative worth exploring is its propensity to result in language-based stereotyping and consequential discrimination. The initiative’s risk of reverse linguistic stereotyping is high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904811429293">Kang and Rubin (2009)</xref> describe how reverse linguistic stereotyping (RLS) occurs, stating that, “in RLS, attributions of a speaker’s group membership cue distorted perceptions of that speaker’s language style or proficiency” (p. 442). This is a pertinent consideration given that many teachers in Arizona’s districts with high levels of ELL students are native Spanish speakers and that prior to disbanding bilingual education in the late 1990s, Arizona invested heavily in recruiting a predominantly native Spanish-speaking teacher work force to staff its then bilingual education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904811429293">Jordan, 2010</xref>). Following this bilingual recruitment, Arizonans passed Proposition 203, shifting Arizona’s educational focus from bilingual programs, or programs in which classroom instruction is given in the child’s native language as well as English, to SEI programs in which English is the sole language of instruction (Ariz. Rev. Stat. 15 § 752b). The predominantly native Spanish-speaking teachers who staffed Arizona’s now defunct bilingual programs then became the teachers that staff its current SEI programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904811429293">Jordan, 2010</xref>). Because the ADE presently includes accent in its evaluation of English language fluency, a case could be made that it is singling out a particular group of teachers, in this case predominantly native Spanish speakers, and unintentionally allowing association with a distinct cultural identity to affect how program evaluators perceive individual teachers.</p>
<p>This was the case in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904811429293">Kang and Rubin’s (2009)</xref> empirical study that sought to explore possible associations between Nonnative speaker (NNS) accents and native-speaker (NS) judgments about social status, intelligence, and language proficiency skills. They found that affiliation with a NNS cultural group is linked to skewed judgments by NS evaluators, and they conclude that<disp-quote>
<p>Language is a living object buffeted by human emotions and perceptions. RLS is an ongoing act of social discrimination in which individuals’ language use is mis-judged and misunderstood by virtue of listeners’ stereotypes of speakers’ social identities. The findings of this study imply that listeners who tend to engage in RLS also tend to find NNSs’ speech more difficult to understand, more heavily accented, and they also tend to derogate such speakers’ teaching performance. (p. 453)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, Kang and Rubin’s work only supplements the work of other sociolinguistic researchers that have likewise discussed links between NNS status and an increased likelihood of distorted judgments by NS language evaluators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904811429293">Gluszek &amp; Dovidio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0895904811429293">Ó Riagáin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Such research suggests that the ADE’s English language fluency evaluation protocol is not only invalid and unreliable but also precarious. While it is true that reports about the policy have yet to provide details about who conducts SEI program evaluations, it is likely that the ADE charges native English speaking administrators or department chairs with conducting SEI observations. One assumes that such program evaluators would be both certified as users of flawless English and trained on how to avoid linguistic stereotyping, but on this point the ADE does not provide clarification.</p>
<p>In addition to risking language-based stereotyping, the present situation in Arizona is precarious for reasons that move beyond RLS. What is truly at stake in Arizona’s English language fluency evaluation initiative is democratic pluralism as it pertains to community membership within local schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0895904811429293">Stone (2002)</xref> explains that<disp-quote>
<p>A community must have membership, and some way of defining who is a member of the community and who is not. Membership is in some sense the primary political issue, for membership definitions and rules determine who is allowed to participate in community activities, and who is governed by community rules and authority. (p. 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this regard, it is necessary to revisit how federal and state policy defines standards of membership into the education profession in Arizona. As previously noted, formal policy stipulates that to gain membership into the education profession as an SEI instructor, an individual in Arizona would need to be Highly Qualified, properly certificated, and hold one of three specialized endorsements for the education of ELLs. It logically follows that if an SEI instructor meets these standards of membership into the education profession, then he or she should be welcomed by the State of Arizona into the professional community of public educators. Is this the case when accent is included as a component of evaluations for English language fluency?</p>
<p>The ADE’s unique interpretation of the English language fluency requirement seeks to add accent as a criteria for membership into the community of professional educators in Arizona. In its current configuration, this initiative poses a threat to democratic pluralism by implying that otherwise qualified professionals are undeserving of equal community membership based on accent. This risks accent discrimination, a phenomenon legally linked to national-origin discrimination, which has been deemed unconstitutional by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0895904811429293">Lippi-Green, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0895904811429293">Matsuda, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0895904811429293">Nguyen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0895904811429293">Wyld, 1997</xref>). Accent discrimination pushes the boundaries of educator community membership into realms of personal identity never intended by NCLB. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0895904811429293">Matsuda (1991)</xref> elaborates,<disp-quote>
<p>When certain accents are deemed inappropriate for the workplace, for political life, for use in schools and boardrooms, a policing of public and private boundaries occurs. Who may speak, when, and where, is a typical mechanism for distributing power. Who is competent to testify in court, who may speak at political meetings, who is an expert authority-answers to these questions stand at the border between the public realm of power and the private realm of the personal . . . As it has become increasingly unacceptable to deny public speech on the basis of race or gender, accent becomes a significant means of maintaining boundaries. (p. 1397)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The social ramifications of establishing boundaries of community membership based on accent are potentially severe. The inclusion of teacher accent as a measure of English language fluency breaks bridges between nonnative English speaking teachers and the larger professional community of educators by insinuating that native-English speakers are somehow more highly qualified for membership based solely on their status as native-English speakers. Not only does this represent faulty logic but it also endangers the vitality of the local democratic community that best thrives when pluralism is safeguarded and deliberation is encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904811429293">Dahl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904811429293">Dryzek, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Cultural Ramifications</title>
<p>Pierre Bourdieu is credited with developing the sociological construct of cultural capital and theorizing its implications for educational systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904811429293">Bourdieu, 1971/1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904811429293">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904811429293">DiMaggio, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0895904811429293">Kalmijn &amp; Kraaykamp, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0895904811429293">Lareau &amp; Weininger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0895904811429293">Monkman, Ronald, &amp; Théramène, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0895904811429293">Olneck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0895904811429293">Yosso, 2005</xref>). As a construct, cultural capital seeks to offer a theory capable of explaining persistent achievement gaps between the socioeconomic classes. Kalmijin and Kraaykamp elaborate,<disp-quote>
<p>In general, Bourdieu argued that in a time of the rapid expansion of higher education, cultural capital arose as a new ascriptive force in the status-attainment process. More specifically, he contended that children from high socioeconomic backgrounds are more often exposed to highbrow cultural activities at home and that those who acquire cultural capital at home are more likely to do well in school and subsequently to have better chances of achieving high levels of schooling than others. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While Bourdieu’s theorizing about cultural capital created spaces in educational research for exploring how access to cultural knowledge affects children’s preparation for and participation in formal schooling, it also stopped short of scrutinizing hegemonic constructions of cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0895904811429293">Lareau &amp; Weininger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0895904811429293">Yosso, 2005</xref>). Thus educational studies about the role of cultural capital in student achievement have developed a tendency toward deficit thinking, treating students and teachers from nondominant cultures as individuals who lack key components for success in U.S. schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904811429293">Comber &amp; Kamler, 2004</xref>). This inclination toward deficit-based configurations of cultural capital has pushed some researchers to expand the boundaries of this construct to acknowledge the inherent cultural capital of minority populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904811429293">González &amp; Moll, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0895904811429293">Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0895904811429293">Yosso, 2005</xref>). One such expansion is Yosso’s reconceptualization of cultural capital as “community cultural wealth” (p. 70), in which she recognizes six distinct forms of cultural capital that minority individuals bring into the education system. These are aspirational capital (maintaining hope for a successful future), familial capital (cultural knowledge transmitted by family such as community history, memory, and unique perspectives on epistemology/ontology), social capital (networks for building vital relationships and gaining access to community resources), navigational capital (ability to maneuver through various institutions), resistant capital (ability to confront inequality), and linguistic capital (shared bilingual language skills and shared historical connections through language). By reconstructing cultural capital to include a wider range of influential community cultural wealth, Yosso’s work allows us to freshly consider the benefits of employing nonnative English speaking teachers in instructional programs for ELLs. In fact, when one weighs the exceptional amount of community cultural wealth that circulates between ELLs and nonnative English speaking teachers against the ADE’s punitive stance toward teacher accent, the threat of removal and relocation of SEI teachers based on accent becomes insupportable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a growing canon of literature that acknowledges the beneficial and pivotal role that Non-Native English-Speaking Teachers (NNESTs) play in the education of second language learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904811429293">Braine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904811429293">Hayes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0895904811429293">Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0895904811429293">Llurda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0895904811429293">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0895904811429293">Moussu &amp; Llurda, 2008</xref>). Scholars in the field of English language teaching are working to unveil the unique ability of NNESTs to facilitate the educational experience of ELLs because of their shared cultural wealth, a resource that is typically inaccessible to native English-speaking teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0895904811429293">Llurda (2004)</xref> elaborates, stating that<disp-quote>
<p>Non-native speakers have lived through the process of becoming bilingual and expressing themselves in different languages. English learners will become speakers of EIL [English as an International Language], through which they will express their own selves in a multilingual world that uses English as the means of expression and as the instrument for interaction among people from disparate cultures. Non-native-speaker teachers are the ones who are inherently endowed with better expertise in guiding this process. (p. 318)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not only have NNESTs shared in the educational experience of acquiring a second language, but they also understand firsthand the obstacles that ELLs face, the resilience required to succeed, and the triumphs of perseverance through substantial challenges. Arguably, this quality of NNESTs touches on every aspect of cultural capital as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0895904811429293">Yosso (2005)</xref>. As professional educators, NNESTs serve as role models of fulfilled aspirational capital. As members of ELL cultures and communities themselves, NNESTs are more likely privy to the community history and alternate epistemological/ontological perspectives of minority populations. Finally, having successfully progressed through the language acquisition process, it is likely that NNESTs have procured the navigational, resistant, and linguistic capital necessary to assist their students as they encounter institutional bureaucracy, inequality, and language-based limitations.</p>
<p>Given the likely benefits gained by the circulation of shared community cultural wealth between NNESTs and ELL students, it becomes necessary to consider why the ADE would endanger the loss of this powerful influence on the lives of ELLs by removing and relocating the very teachers who represent educational success and prosperity among nonnative English speaking populations. One possible explanation is the push for the “ideal” native-speaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904811429293">Hackert, 2009</xref>). There has been a persistent although false notion among educational leaders and policy makers that native speakers of a target language are best suited for the second language teaching profession. However, scholars have long contested this line of thinking by pointing out not only the tremendous linguistic diversity between native speakers of the same language but also the fallacy in assuming that native-speaker status somehow equates to pedagogical training and talent. TESOL, Inc. and its Arizona state affiliate, AZ-TESOL, Inc. summarize the effect of the native-speaker myth, offering that<disp-quote>
<p>For decades the field of English language teaching has suffered from the myth that one only needs to be a native English speaker in order to teach the English language. The myth further implicates that native English speakers make better English as a second language (ESL) or English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers than nonnative English speakers because native English speakers are perceived to speak “unaccented” English and understand and use idiomatic expressions fluently. The distinction between native and nonnative speakers of English presents an oversimplified, either/or classification system that is not only misleading, but also ignores the formal education, linguistic expertise, teaching experience, and professional preparation of educators in the field of English language teaching. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0895904811429293">Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus the decision to remove or relocate NNESTs from ELL classrooms based on the inclusion of accent as a component of English language fluency evaluation seems to adhere more strongly to the myth of a linguistic ideal rather than the reality of an expansive linguistic diversity in both the native and nonnative English speaking populations.</p>
<p>While removing or relocating SEI teachers on the basis of accent threatens the circulation of cultural capital between NNESTs and ELL students, there is another reason this practice is dangerous. The message it communicates to ELL children and to nonnative English speaking peoples throughout the United States is one of exclusion and rejection. At its core, the choice to evaluate accent as a measure of English language fluency proclaims a perilous point of view about Arizona’s values, namely, that accented English and the cultural and linguistic diversity that it represents are not welcome in the Grand Canyon State. In the age of globalization this is distressing. As the flow of human capital from nonnative English speaking talent pools becomes more selective in choosing where to relocate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904811429293">Lobo &amp; Smole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0895904811429293">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0895904811429293">Spring, 2008</xref>), states ought to be cautious about communicating such messages about the accents these individuals will bring with them. In an analysis of the global circulation of international talent pools, Pan concludes that stereotypes and discrimination targeted at nonnative English speaking peoples serve as a disincentive for relocation to the United States, stating that, “The third push force relates to implicit and explicit discrimination against foreigners and the long-standing issue of foreigners being treated as second- or third-class citizens in developed countries” (p. 2713). Thus the ADE’s inclusion of teacher accent as a component of English language fluency evaluation risks pushing talented nonnative English speaking peoples away from Arizona as a potential site of residence.</p>

<title>Discussion: Appraisal of the ADE Policy</title>
<p>The preceding critical evaluation of the ADE’s inclusion of SEI teacher accent as a component of English language fluency illuminates how the policy exceeds state and federal statutes, uses an invalid and unreliable instrument for assessing English fluency, and results in evaluation practices that break social and cultural bridges more than they build them. Such shortcomings provide persuasive criticisms that challenge both the benevolence and the appropriateness of the ADE policy. Now, to appraise the policy, we weigh the preceding evaluation against second language acquisition scholarship to determine how its findings may support or negate a rationale for evaluating teachers by accent.</p>
<p>Scholars in second language acquisition recognize the importance of consistent and comprehensible instructional messages in students’ language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904811429293">Derwing &amp; Munro, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0895904811429293">Krashen, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904811429293">Krashen &amp; Terrell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0895904811429293">Krashen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0895904811429293">Krashen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0895904811429293">Loschky, 1994</xref>). Similarly, scholars in second language learning recognize the valuable role of emphasizing and incorporating grammar structures into instructional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904811429293">DeKeyser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904811429293">Ellis, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904811429293">Ellis, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904811429293">Fotos, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904811429293">Hinkel &amp; Fotos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0895904811429293">Nassaji &amp; Fotos 2004</xref>). Given the importance of both comprehensible messages and grammar instruction in second language learning, it is necessary to explore whether or not second language acquisition scholarship could support an evaluation of teacher accent based on an accent’s ability to impede understanding between a teacher and her students. Doing so suggests that the accents of SEI teachers in Arizona are not at all likely to threaten effective instruction.</p>
<p>Research has been conducted to explore a direct relationship between teacher accent and students’ progress in second language acquisition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904811429293">Cheong (2007)</xref> set out to understand how students perceived native versus nonnative speech. Her work suggests that both the amount of time an individual is exposed to a particular accent as well as the degree of interaction with a particular accent were both mediating variables in students’ perceptions of instructor accent. She concluded that<disp-quote>
<p>. . . regression analyses indicated that <italic>length of time</italic> in the program made the largest contribution to the perception of accentedness while <italic>interaction</italic> made the largest contribution to predict comprehensibility. Regression analyses and hypotheses testing of the two regression models showed that the listeners’ perception of accentedness and comprehensibility were predicted by listener affiliated socio-cultural factors (<italic>length of time</italic> and <italic>interaction</italic>). (p. 149)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cheong’s findings not only support the idea that human beings have an inherent ability to tolerate accent without compromising message comprehensibility but also suggest that human beings are capable of adapting to accent as they gain exposure to it. If, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904811429293">Cheong’s (2007)</xref> findings suggest, students are capable of tolerating and adapting to variation and variety in spoken language, then the SEI evaluation protocol implemented by the ADE becomes dubious.</p>
<p>In addition, while second language acquisition research supports the notion of comprehensibility as a crucial element of learning a second language, it does not fundamentally support the ADE’s reasoning that accent prohibits comprehensibility. In second language acquisition research, comprehensibility is often defined as, “the listener’s perception of how easy or difficult it is to understand a given speech sample” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811429293">Derwing &amp; Munro, 2009</xref>, p. 478). It is important to note that some research on comprehensibility has found that even a strong accent may not impede fully comprehensible communication between speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0895904811429293">Munro &amp; Derwing, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0895904811429293">Munro &amp; Derwing, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811429293">Derwing &amp; Munro, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811429293">Derwing and Munro (2009)</xref> clarify that, “Having an accent is not a sign of overall low proﬁciency. People who are indistinguishable in other ways from native speakers can still have accented speech. Having an accent doesn’t necessarily impinge on communication” (p. 478). Such findings trouble the ADE policy and warrant the question, “How likely is it that SEI teachers in Arizona schools would have an accent so heavy that it precluded comprehension and hindered fluency?”</p>
<p>On this point it is necessary to recall that to attain full licensure in Arizona, an SEI teacher must be Highly Qualified, properly certificated, and hold one of three specialized endorsements equipping her to instruct ELL students. Given the extensive coursework, official competency testing, and English language proficiency required to obtain such credentials, it is difficult to imagine that there are any SEI teachers in Arizona schools incapable of meeting the fluency requirement established by NCLB. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to imagine that a principal would recommend a teacher for hire if that teacher’s grammar skills, ability to speak at a fluent rate of production, and pronunciation were so poor that they required an evaluation of language proficiency. Arizona’s hiring practices reflect this. The majority of SEI teachers in Arizona meet the federal definition of a highly qualified teacher. They have earned degrees and endorsements, passed rigorous state licensure exams, and were recommended for hire by those that interviewed them. Given these facts, a scenario in which SEI teachers’ English language fluency, accent, or grammar renders them incapable of being understood in the classroom is very difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Globalization also informs our appraisal of ADE’s policy. For children who complete Arizona’s P-12 education program and continue on to a postsecondary institution, the ability to adapt to variations in spoken English is essential. According to the Institute of International Education,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0895904811429293">3</xref></sup> there were 113,494 scholars from 187 countries teaching in U.S. institutions of higher education during the 2009-2010 academic year. Similarly, there were 690,923 international exchange students who studied in the United States last year. Most of these professors and students speak English as a second language and employ English as a lingua franca. Similarly, for children who complete Arizona’s P-12 education program and enter the workforce, the ability to adapt to variations in spoken English is likewise indispensable. In the last decade, 13.1 million new immigrants have entered the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0895904811429293">4</xref></sup> The accents of immigrant populations only add to the already existing range of English accents present in the United States (i.e., Bostonian accent, southern accent). Arizona’s children are not going to be able to isolate themselves from encountering variations in spoken English, and their academic and vocational success are likely to involve the need to adapt to widespread variations in spoken English.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Arizona must consider how its attempt to cleanse classrooms of accent is a disservice to its students. Suggesting to children that the world will accommodate their intolerance of linguistic diversity is not only untrue but also culturally arrogant. To the detriment of Arizona’s children, the ADE is suggesting that linguistic pluralism is undesirable while linguistic homogeneity is favorable. Certainly this does more to reinforce language-based stereotypes and cultural ideologies than to empower children with the language-based skills they will need to be successful in a globalized society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0895904811429293">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Considering the full scope of this analysis, we assert that a rationale capable of supporting the ADE’s evaluation of SEI teacher accent does not exist. Consequently, our first recommendation is that the ADE revoke this policy and return those SEI teachers who have been affected by this policy to the teaching positions for which they were initially hired.</p>
<p>Second, on a federal level, Congress should reconsider its use of the term “fluency” in setting legislative standards for teachers of ELLs. Including measures of “fluency” in federal policy seems preposterous when one entertains the logical implications of this term: Did Congress really intend to legislate the rate at which teachers produce speech or the ease with which an individual can communicate in English? Yet, given both the scholastic and lay definitions of “fluency” highlighted in this analysis, this is precisely what the fluency mandate produces. The absurdities of such a mandate seem obvious: How does one determine an acceptable rate of speech production? If a speaker slows down instruction to give students time to take notes, does this violate an acceptable rate of production? Will fluency evaluators carry stopwatches to classroom observations to measure language production rates? We certainly hope not.</p>
<p>This does, however, allow us the opportunity to suggest that Congress clarify its intent behind the language-based standards it established for teachers of ELLs. It seems much more likely to us that Congress meant to address language proficiency holistically, rather than isolate language fluency, accent, or pronunciation specifically. On this note, Congress may consider consulting research from applied linguistics, which has honed in on components of second language proficiency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904811429293">Housen and Kuiken (2009)</xref> elaborate,<disp-quote>
<p>Many researchers and language practitioners believe that the constructs of L2 performance and L2 proficiency are multi-componential in nature, and that their principal dimensions can be adequately, and comprehensively, captured by the notions of complexity, accuracy and fluency (p. 461)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Specifically, we recommend that during the pending reauthorization of NCLB, Congress consider replacing the word “fluent” with “proficient,” and that it encourage states to develop evaluation protocols consistent with holistic determinations of language proficiency.</p>
<p>Third, the time to evaluate teachers for language-based proficiencies is not when they have already been hired. Assuming that Congress reconfigures the fluency mandate to involve language-based proficiencies, then the appropriate time to conduct language assessments for NNESTs is during the hiring process. Of course, as we’ve mentioned, it seems unlikely that Arizona’s SEI teachers lack proficiency in English. As the majority of SEI teachers are highly qualified, they have already passed the necessary exams and coursework for licensure. It is hard to imagine that a highly qualified SEI teacher would be able to pass such rigorous standards without English language proficiency. Regardless, if the ADE has concerns about the English language proficiency of a particular teacher, then the time to express that concern and conduct a language proficiency evaluation is before the department has approved that teacher for hire. To threaten SEI teachers with removal or relocation after they have already been hired dismisses the ADE of its responsibility to endorse and support those teachers who have met the state’s rigorous expectations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0895904811429293" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The ADE’s unique interpretation of NCLB’s English language fluency requirement and subsequent implementation of policy initiatives to evaluate SEI teachers for accent is not supportable. It threatens educational objectives, democratic pluralism, and the circulation of cultural capital. In addition, it is difficult to imagine that SEI teachers who have passed the state’s rigorous educator licensing exams and satisfactorily completed teacher preparation programs could be insufficiently proficient in English. In light of this policy analysis, the ADE should revoke its policy of evaluating SEI teachers for accent, and Congress should subsequently consider revising the fluency mandate of NCLB to better reflect the holistic nature of language proficiency. Failure to revoke this policy on the part of the ADE may result in accusations of language-based discrimination and the loss of shared cultural capital between NNESTs and their ELL students. Worse, it may construe Arizona as an intolerant state and risk instilling in Arizona’s children false notions of a linguistically homogenous world.</p>
<p>Moreover, failure on the part of Congress to replace the fluency mandate of NCLB with more holistic models of English language proficiency for teachers of ELLs risks a replication of the types of state-level policies created by the ADE. During the reauthorization of NCLB, Congress should unambiguously clarify its intent regarding English language proficiency standards for teachers of ELLs. Doing so would make clear the missteps of language proficiency evaluations that include subjective constructs such as accent or pronunciation.</p>
