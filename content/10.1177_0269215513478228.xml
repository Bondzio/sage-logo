<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Limitation on the ability to walk after stroke is one of the most important losses in the view of the patient, and, although there are treatments that work, there are still many patients left with reduced mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513478228">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513478228">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most walking rehabilitation strategies take advantage of the role played by sensorial and proprioceptive stimulations in the context of patients’ motor performances. Mulder and Hochstenbach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513478228">3</xref></sup> stated that ‘no control, learning, change, hence no improvement can exist without information (sensorial input)’. It was also demonstrated that proprioceptive stimulation can influence postural control and ambulatory recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513478228">4</xref></sup> The augmented proprioceptive feedback acts both at the high sensorimotor integration level and at the spinal level, having a strong impact on the motor re-learning process after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215513478228">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Walking exercises capable of creating a premeasured afferent proprioceptive stream can be performed wearing an elastic element-based suit, called ‘Regent Suit’, developed by the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513478228">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513478228">7</xref></sup> This suit was first used as a means of creating an axial load to compensate for the deficient proprioceptive information available in the weightless environment of space flights, and proved to be an effective means of preventing muscle weakness owing to gravitational unloading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215513478228">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The greater proprioceptive input provided by the suit might improve motor recovery after stroke, but its use in clinical settings has not been investigated in detail. In a study published in Russian,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215513478228">9</xref></sup> the authors stated that the use of this suit after ischemic stroke improves postural stability and walking ability. Recently, a case study was performed, showing that the use of the Regent Suit is satisfactorily accepted during training by a patient affected by a recent episode of stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513478228">10</xref></sup> Although motor performance, global autonomy, and locomotion were improved, the authors recommended conducting a randomized controlled trial with an adequate follow-up.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to compare the improvement in motor abilities and activities of daily living of a neurorehabilitation programme using the Regent Suit with that of usual care in a population of patients with subacute stroke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215513478228" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The aim of this randomized, parallel-group, controlled superiority trial conducted following the CONSORT recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513478228">11</xref></sup> was to compare the efficacy of a neurorehabilitation programme using the Regent Suit (experimental group) with that of a conventional rehabilitation programme (control group). The study was carried out at the Operative Unit of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of the Salvatore Maugeri Foundation’s Scientific Institute in Lissone (Milan, Italy).</p>
<p>The principal investigator randomized the subjects to one of the two treatment programmes using a list of blinded treatment codes previously generated by a biostatistician, and an automatic assignment system to assure the concealment of the allocation.</p>
<p>The principal investigator and two research assistants obtaining and assessing the data, and the biostatistician making the analyses, were blinded to the treatments; the physiatrists, physiotherapists, and patients could not be blinded. No information was collected concerning adverse effects.</p>
<p>The study was approved by our hospital’s Institutional Review Board and conducted in conformity with ethical and humane principles of research.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215513478228">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Inpatients referred to our hospital were consecutively included in the study between January and December 2010.</p>
<p>The participants satisfied the following inclusion criteria: adult age (40–75 years old), a recent cerebrovascular stroke involving the left hemisphere and occurring &lt;40 days before study entry, a good understanding of Italian, and an ability to walk without direct assistance. The exclusion criteria were major cognitive deterioration (Mini Mental State Examination score ≤24), cardiovascular instability (New York Heart Association class III, recent ischemic heart attack, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, and respiratory instability as revealed by an oxygen saturation of &lt;90%), systemic diseases, and neurodegenerative or neuromuscular diseases.</p>
<p>All of the patients were enrolled by two physiatrists coordinated by the principal investigator, and those satisfying the entry criteria were given further information and asked to declare their willingness to comply with whichever treatment option they were randomly assigned to, and to attend all of the follow-up visits.</p>
<p>In order to limit any expectation bias, the patients were blinded to the study hypothesis by telling them the trial was intended to compare two common rehabilitation approaches whose efficacy had not yet been established. Those who agreed were asked to give their written informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269215513478228">
<title>Interventional programmes</title>
<p>The interventional programmes involved four physiotherapists (two per group).</p>
<p>Both intervention groups underwent 20 neuromotor rehabilitation sessions on 20 consecutive days during their hospitalisation, receiving the same total amount of time in the therapy. Each session was divided into two parts: one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. The morning subsession, lasting about 60 minutes, was the same for both groups: it was made on a couch and basically included neuromotor techniques, articular mobilisation, and stretching exercises. The afternoon subsession was different for the two groups. For the experimental group, it included a preparatory phase to wear the Regent Suit (10 minutes) and an executive phase (30 minutes), consisting of ‘sit-to-stand’ exercises with and without impediments, load transfer exercises under active static conditions (on fixed and soft surfaces and using a 70 × 40 cm balance footboard), step division exercises, and ambulatory training (with or without aids) on different types of surfaces and treadmills. During the whole executive phase, patients wore the Regent Suit.</p>
<p>The Regent Suit consists of supporting elements (vest, shorts, knee caps, and foot straps) made of synthetic materials, and a set of elastic loading elements equipped with located fixtures (metal spring hooks) and regulating and locking buckles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215513478228">Figure 1</xref>). There are three sizes of the suit and, for each size, the volume of the vest and shorts can be further adjusted by means of zips sewn on the supporting elements. The elastic elements are fastened to the outer surface of the supporting elements along the patient’s body and lower limbs, and not only create a central load on the body and leg muscles, but also allow postural corrections as well as providing for body rotation, stoop, and stretch, which helps to reduce pathological muscular synergisms. During the interventions, the physiotherapist had to customise the best way of attaching all of the elastic elements in order to hinder the movements that needed to be reinforced. When the patient was affected by severe drop foot, an elastic element was used to facilitate dorsal flexion in order to allow ground clearance during gait. The Regent Suit was adjusted and calibrated every day by the physiotherapist on the basis of the progress of each patient’s clinical-functional case history and ambulatory performance.</p>

<sec id="section13-0269215513478228">
<title>Outcome measures and statistics</title>
<p>The patients were tested before and after the intervention period, and during a follow-up assessment six months after the end of treatment. The principal investigator, aided by two research assistants, was in charge to perform the assessment tests.</p>
<p>The performances of motor activities and activities of daily living (ADL) were measured, as well as the level of global satisfaction with treatment.</p>
<p>Motor performance was investigated by means of the 6-minute walking test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513478228">12</xref></sup> and the Berg Balance Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513478228">13</xref></sup> During the 6-minute walking test, the patients were asked to walk along a given route and the distance covered in six minutes was measured. Their cardiorespiratory condition was also evaluated by measuring oxygen saturation and heart rate at the end of the test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513478228">14</xref></sup> The Berg Balance Scale evaluated balancing abilities during 14 motor performances; each task was scored 0–4 (0 indicating total inability and 4 total ability): the potential risk of falling was assessed on the basis of the total score as high (0–20), medium (21–40), or low (41–56).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215513478228">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A subset of 10 subjects in each group was also assessed by means of a 10-m GaitRite® test (CIR System Inc., Clifton, NJ 07012) in order to measure the spatio-temporal parameters of gait. The GaitRite® system consists of an electronic walkway (5.6-m long and 0.9-m wide) incorporating multiple sensor pads that are activated by the pressure of footfall and deactivated when the toe leaves the surface. This allows the system to capture the relative pattern of footfalls in two-dimensional space as function of time. The measurements of the analysed spatio-temporal gait variables (gait speed, cadence, step time, and step length of both legs) were based on the geometric centres of the heels in each of three consecutive footprints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513478228">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215513478228"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215513478228">18</xref></sup> Moreover, the length symmetry index (the ratio between step lengths on the paretic and healthy side) and the time symmetry index (the ratio between the step times of the paretic and healthy side) were computed.</p>
<p>ADLs were investigated by means of two specific indicators: the Barthel Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215513478228">19</xref></sup> and the Functional Independence Measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215513478228">20</xref></sup> The Barthel Index described 10 ADLs (with the total score ranging from 0 (the greatest limitation) to 20 (no limitation)), whereas the Functional Independence Measure described 18 ADLs associated with motor, cognitive, and sphincteral problems (total score ranging from 18 (greatest limitation) to 126 (no limitation)).</p>
<p>Global satisfaction with treatment was investigated by means of the Global Perceived Effect scale: the patients were asked to indicate their level of satisfaction with their motor performance, ranging from 1 (‘definitely worsened my performance’), to 7 (‘definitely improved my performance’).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215513478228">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary endpoint of the study was the pre- and post-treatment difference in walking speed. A sample size of 40 patients was capable of detecting a between-group difference of 0.16 m/s, considering a standard deviation of 0.22 m/s, a type I error of 5%, and a power of 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215513478228">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215513478228"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215513478228">24</xref></sup> In order to cater for a 20% of drop-out rate, at least 25 patients were included in each group.</p>
<p>Baseline comparability was assessed using a Student <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples. For all of the outcome measures but the Global Perceived Effect scores, linear mixed model analyses for repeated measures (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were made, with group and time as fixed effects and the outcome measures as dependent variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215513478228">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215513478228">26</xref></sup> The crossover effect of time and group was entered as an interaction term.</p>
<p>The Global Perceived Effect scores were analysed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test to evaluate the between-group difference at the time of the posttraining and follow-up evaluations.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software.</p>

<p>Sixty patients were recruited and randomized to the two programmes: 30 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group. Two of the patients in the experimental group dropped out before the posttraining assessments, and a further three were lost to follow-up. Three patients in the control group dropped out before the completion of the intervention, and a further two were lost to follow-up. The intention-to-treat analysis included all 60 randomized patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215513478228">Figure 2</xref> shows the CONSORT flowchart.</p>

<p>Motor performance significantly improved in the experimental group: gait speed during the 6-minute walking test increased from 0.63 m/s to 0.93 m/s, and the Berg Balance Scale increased from 38.3 to 49.6. The improvement was less in the control group: gait speed increased from 0.64 m/s to 0.71 m/s, and the Berg Balance Scale from 40.1 to 44.4. The improvements were maintained by both groups at follow-up. The repeated measure linear mixed model revealed a significant effect of time, group, and time-by-group interaction on gait speed in favour of the experimental group. There was no within- or between-group difference in the systemic variables (oxygen saturation and heart rate) measured at the end of the 6-minute walking test. The Berg Balance Scale indicated a significant effect of time and time-by-group interaction, while no significant group effect was found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215513478228">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study show that the Regent Suit-based neurorehabilitation programme was superior to the conventional rehabilitation programme in improving locomotion and ADL performance in a population of subjects with subacute cerebrovascular stroke.</p>
<p>The effect of treatment on gait speed (the primary end-point of the study) was clinically tangible (&gt;0.16 m/s) in the experimental group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215513478228">22</xref></sup> lasted for at least six months after the intervention ended, and corresponded to a progression from one speed category of the gait speed classification (limited community ambulators) to the next (unlimited community ambulators).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215513478228">28</xref></sup> However, it did not correspond to a significant change in systemic variables during the 6-minute walking test, presumably because the extent and intensity of the training was not enough to produce cardiovascular conditioning in either group.</p>
<p>The more significant improvements achieved by the experimental group may have been owing to a dual mechanism: on the one hand, the elastic loading elements of the suit increased the physical effort the patients put into the exercises and this may have enhanced their muscular strength; on the other, the suit increased proprioceptive feedback, which may have increased central nervous system activation at both cortical and spinal level, and therefore led to effective brain reorganisation. Indeed, it has been previously demonstrated that the increased sensorial input obtained by mechanisms such as functional electrical stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215513478228">23</xref></sup> or segmental muscle vibration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215513478228">29</xref></sup> enhances post-stroke motor relearning.</p>
<p>The greater satisfaction with treatment in the experimental group indicates the superiority of the intervention, presumably because the proprioception enhancement provided by the suit improved the patients’ perception of their motor control abilities. Furthermore, most of the patients declared that the suit increased their stability and confidence during walking.</p>
<p>Although only a subset of 20 participants underwent the 10-m walking test, the measurements of spatial-temporal parameters indicated how their gait pattern had improved: i.e. the significant increase in gait speed corresponded to a bilateral increase in step length. Both groups showed a significant improvement in symmetry between the paretic and healthy side, with no difference between them. However, the intervention was not specifically designed to improve symmetry as both legs were trained to the same extent. The gait speed measured during the 10-m walking test was slower than that measured during the 6-minute walking test, possibly because patients unfamiliar with a laboratory setting tend to walk in a more ‘controlled’ manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215513478228">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>This randomized controlled trial had a high level of internal validity, was capable of distinguishing effects in the two groups, was adequately sized, and included concealed randomization, blinded data collection, and the effective masking of assessors and analysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513478228">11</xref></sup> However, the enrolled population consisted of subacute stroke patients who were capable of walking without direct assistance before the beginning of the intervention, and were therefore characterised by mild impairment (gait speed at baseline was about 0.6 m/s in both groups). Consequently, the results cannot be generalised to the wider subacute stroke population. However, the inclusion criterion of being able to walk was needed since the suit did not provide any balance support. When patients do not preserve balance and posture control during standing and walking after stroke, other types of gait training, such as body-weight-supported treadmill training or robot-assisted gait training, may be preferable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215513478228">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another limitation is that the described intervention cannot be delivered in every setting as it requires the use of this specific suit.</p>
<p>The findings of this study demonstrate that neuromotor exercises performed while wearing the Regent Suit are more effective than usual care in improving locomotion and ADL performance in subacute stroke patients. In the future, it might be interesting to investigate the efficacy of such training in chronic stroke patients. Further studies might explore the possibility of using the suit in combination with body-weight-supported treadmill training, thus involving a larger population of subjects with subacute stroke.</p>
