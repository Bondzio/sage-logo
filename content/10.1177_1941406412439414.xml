<p><italic>Background</italic>. In this pilot study, the authors aimed to examine the implementation of standing desks on classroom performance and behavior. They also examined how the standing desks affected in-class physical activity and body mass index. <italic>Methods</italic>. Eight sixth graders from Hope Lutheran elementary school participated in the study (age 11.3 ± 0.5 years). Baseline and 8-month postintervention measures were step counts using (W4L Classic pedometers), height, weight, and behavioral markers. <italic>Results</italic>. Data showed that there were no statistically significant changes in the participants’ body mass index (19.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs 19.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), step counts (1886 steps vs 2248 steps), and behavioral markers including classroom management, concentration, and discomfort. Height and weight changes were significant and are attributed to the normal growth rate associated with the age of the participants (146.8 cm vs 151.8 cm, P &lt; .0001; 41.4 kg vs 44.5 kg, P &gt; .0007). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. It is feasible to integrate standing desks into a classroom without negative effects. Although the authors observed over a 19% increase in pedometer activity, it was not statistically significant. This highlights the importance for larger experimental groups and the use of more advanced physical activity tracking and body composition technologies.</p>

</p>
<p>Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. It has recently been estimated that nearly 32% children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years are overweight and obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412439414">1</xref></sup> If these trends continue, some predict that by 2015, 75% of adults will be overweight with 40% obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412439414">2</xref></sup> To combat this epidemic, many health professionals believe that schools will need to play a key role. Although some argue that the public school system is not responsible for health of pupils, it is accepted by most that schools are a partner, along with families and communities, with respect to child health. There are multiple school-based programs that benefit the health of children. Also, some data suggest that healthier learn better.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412439414">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412439414">5</xref></sup> Noting the statistics on childhood obesity, schools cannot be left behind in the quest for a healthy population.</p>
<p>Peer-reviewed research pertaining to the use of standing desks in an elementary school setting is lacking. One aspect of childhood obesity is low levels of physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412439414">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412439414">10</xref></sup> With the progressive decline in school physical activity participation coupled with declining numbers of physical education teachers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412439414">7</xref></sup> there is growing interest in the potential role of stimulating physical activity during routine lessons. In adults, this can be achieved by using standing desks without being detrimental to workplace performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412439414">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412439414">12</xref></sup> However, adult performance can be easily assessed by examining work output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412439414">13</xref></sup> This is more complicated in children whose primary goal in school is to learn. There has been substantial debate on how best to evaluate classroom management and pupil behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412439414">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412439414">17</xref></sup> We wanted to assess how physical activity (measured with pedometers),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412439414">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412439414">20</xref></sup> classroom management, and pupil behavior were affected by a standing desk used by students. This study was designed to determine if standing desks, when administered in the classroom environment, are feasible and can provide school administrations with an attractive alternative to the standard seated desk.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1941406412439414">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Eight sixth graders from Hope Lutheran elementary school in Idaho Falls, Idaho, participated (5 males, 3 females, age 11.3 ± 0.5 years, height 149.1 ± 9.1, weight 35.7 ± 15.9 kg). All students in the class were given the opportunity to participate, and there was 100% participation. The research protocol was approved by the Idaho National Laboratory’s Institutional Review Board. Parents of the participants provided written consent and were provided with a copy of the research protocol. Collection of baseline data began in September 2009 and concluded in December 2009. Standing desks were installed in January 2010, and data collection concluded at the end of the 2010 school year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1941406412439414">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Eight standing desks (VisualEd Tech, Wharton, NJ) were used in this study to restructure the classroom environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412439414">Figure 1</xref>). Standing desks were installed by an ergonomic specialist who set the height of each standing desk according to the participants elbow height (EH; 91.4 ± 6.6 cm). The desk’s design allows for the use of a stool; although not initially included in the package, a stool was procured from School Outfitters and was individually adjusted to the appropriate height of the user. W4L Classic (WALK4LIFE, Inc, Plainfield, IL) pedometers were used to study the effects of standing desks on walking. Classroom behaviors were assessed by teacher observations. Classroom behavior variables included classroom management, concentration, and discomfort. Height was measured using a calibrated tape measure and weight using the digital Thinner-Model TH204W scale.</p>

<sec id="section4-1941406412439414">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Height and weight measurements were collected from the participants twice a month, both in baseline and during the intervention. The data collected from the measurements were kept confidential and not shared with the participants. The data were used to calculate body mass index using the formula: kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All height and weight measurements throughout the study were recorded by the same researcher.</p>
<p>Pedometers were used to assess in-class physical activity. Participants were provided with both verbal and written instruction regarding the proper placement and use of the pedometer. Participants were instructed to wear the pedometer during class time only and were instructed to remove the pedometer at recess and at the end of the school day. Daily pedometer readings were recorded by the participants under the supervision of the instructor. Participants were instructed to reset the pedometers every morning prior to the start of class. Monthly log sheets were submitted to the principle investigator for analysis.</p>
<p>Teacher observations were recorded daily in 3 categories, namely, classroom management, concentration, and discomfort/fatigue. Classroom management included behavioral issues in the classroom that disrupt the teaching and learning process of the students in the classroom (excessive talking, touching, or bothering another student). The teacher has to stop the teaching and learning process to intervene. Concentration, especially in cases when the student is off task (staring off into space; playing with fingers, pencils, and paper; wandering around the room). Students are not disruptive of the teaching process or the learning of other students. Redirect the student by saying name, moving in proximity of student, putting hand on shoulder, and making eye contact. Discomfort/fatigue involves drowsiness, yawning, and complaining of muscle aches. There is a need to distinguish between discomfort and fatigue associated with the school environment and preexisting conditions.</p>
<p>This project was realized at zero cost to the school. The funds were raised by the parent body who sought fiscal support by the community.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All study data were entered into a JMP 8.0 database. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the subject descriptive data and all variables. Paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to identify differences in participant body mass index, height, weight, and activity readings. Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to identify differences in the behavior-related variables. All statistical analyses were performed by a professional statistician employed at the Idaho National Laboratory. For all analyses, the criterion for significance was set at an α level of <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>

<p>Differences in participants’ body mass indexes were not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .3416 [<italic>t</italic> test]). Participants weight did increase significantly (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .0007 [<italic>t</italic> test]) as did the participants height (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .0001 [<italic>t</italic> test]). Pedometer readings also improved with a mean difference of 362 steps but failed to reach statistical significance at the .05 level (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .1127 [<italic>t</italic> test]). Changes in classroom behavior were realized. However, each variable failed to be statistically significant (classroom management, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .5 [<italic>z</italic> test]; concentration, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .81 [<italic>z</italic> test]; discomfort, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .06 [<italic>z</italic> test]).</p>
<sec id="section7-1941406412439414">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>At the beginning of the study, only 1 participant was classified as “at risk of overweight” (88th percentile), with all remaining participants falling into the “healthy weight” range (µ = 56<sup>th</sup> percentile; standard deviation = 19.65). With regard to height and weight, the changes recorded were to be suspected with normal growth patterns for that age group.</p>
<p>The pre- and postpedometer recordings increased by 19% (1886 steps/day vs 2249 steps/day). However, because of the small study size, the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, pedometers do not record non-hip-related movement.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study showed that standing desks can be used in classrooms without negative effects and provide an attractive alternative to seated desks. In addition, levels of physical activity may increase, but larger studies with more robust measures are needed.</p>
<p>Changing the classroom environment to allow more activity is often questioned because of the possibility of deterioration of student behavior and concentration. Behavior markers were assessed to ascertain teacher observations related to classroom management. All behavior-related markers were developed specifically for this study and were not scaled and therefore will be subject to interteacher biases. What became clear throughout the study was that no statistically significant difference was identified when pre-/postobservations were compared.</p>
<p>This study looked only at 1 variable, the addition of standing desk instead of the standard seated desk. The aim of this study was to answer 2 fundamental questions regarding standing desks: (1) Is it feasible to use standing desks in the classroom environment? (2) Do standing desks have an impact on in-class spontaneous physical activity? The results demonstrate the feasibility of using standing desks in the classroom environment. During the duration of the study, visible displays of student discomfort decreased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .06), contributing to a more supportive learning environment. With regard to the standing desks’ impact on spontaneous in-class physical activity, further examination is needed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, standing desks may provide an attractive alternative to traditional seated desks as they provide the potential for a less sedentary student body while maintaining and possibly improving academic performance.</p>
