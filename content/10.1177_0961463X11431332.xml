<abstract>
<p>One hundred years after committing a genocide, the German government offered an apology to Hereros in Namibia, thereby making a significant step towards meeting their demands for restorative justice. In combination with changes to how the genocide was understood in Namibia and in Germany, the occasion of commemorating the genocide – which offered new contexts for remembering – marked a turning point in the way this past was remembered in both countries.</p>

<p>‘In the words of the Lord’s Prayer that we share, I ask you to forgive us our trespasses and our guilt. Without a conscious process of remembering, without sorrow, without apology, there can be no reconciliation.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X11431332">Wieczorek-Zeul, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0961463X11431332">1</xref></sup> With these words, in 2004 the German government finally responded to years of requests to engage with the descendants of victims of colonial violence in Namibia. Speaking at a ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the beginning of a colonial war that is now widely understood to have led to genocide, the German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, formally apologized for the atrocities committed by the German colonizers in what once was German South-West Africa (SWA). For many Hereros,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0961463X11431332">2</xref></sup> this moment marked a significant step towards reconciliation after many previous failures to sufficiently engage Germany in ‘healing the wounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11431332">Hongoze, 2003</xref>) of this painful past: the war and its aftermath, known by Hereros as <italic>Otjitiro Otjindjandja</italic> (meaning ‘many people died in one place’) and referred to by most Namibians simply by the years marking its duration: 1904–1907.</p>
<p>This moment was part of longer processes of remembering the German colonial period in SWA and the 1904–1907 war by various groups of Hereros, Germans and Namibians. Over the past century understandings of this past had shifted among these groups. Changing socio-historical contexts in both Namibia and Germany have determined when and how the two societies turned their attention to this case of historical injustice. The efforts of a group of Hereros to elicit an apology or reparations from Germany served to reframe and draw international attention to this past. Finally, the approach of the 100th anniversary of the genocide provided both a stimulus and opportunities for dialogue across groups and national boundaries that was necessary to meaningfully address this past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961463X11431332"><title>An account of colonial violence</title>
<p>Prior to Germany claiming SWA as a colony at the Berlin conference of 1884–1885, German Rhenish missionaries and traders had been active in the area since the mid-nineteenth century. While the first purpose of the colony was an economic one, populating SWA with German settlers swiftly became a priority due to economic and social pressures in Germany as well as demographic concerns in SWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961463X11431332">Walther, 2002</xref>: 9–27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X11431332">Sarkin, 2011</xref>: 51–53).</p>
<p>Prior to a rinderpest epidemic at the end of the nineteenth century, Hereros depended on land and cattle for their livelihood. The epidemic forced many Hereros into wage labor and led chiefs to sell large areas of land. German settlers bought this newly opened land and began cattle farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 1999</xref>: 110–140). Hereros became increasingly dispossessed and economically dependent on Germans.</p>
<p>Following increasingly tense relations between Germans and Hereros, fighting began in Okahandja in January 1904. Historian Jan-Bart Gewald argues that the war, in fact, began because Germans – who were already fearful of a rebellion – misinterpreted a coincidental gathering of Hereros as the beginning of a revolt (1999: 142–153).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0961463X11431332">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>German emperor Wilhelm II appointed experienced Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha to engage in an offensive against the Herero population. German colonial troops, the <italic>Schutztruppe</italic> (protection forces), and Herero fighters engaged in a number of battles in the following months as Hereros retreated northeast across central SWA towards the Waterberg Plateau.</p>
<p>In mid-August 1904, von Trotha’s troops encircled Hereros at Waterberg and cordoned off other escape routes, leaving defeated Hereros to flee towards the Kalahari Desert, on the other side of which was the relative safety of British Bechuanaland (now Botswana). The <italic>Schutztruppe</italic> pursued Herero groups, driving them away from wells and poisoning water supplies. In October, von Trotha’s <italic>Vernichtungsbefehl</italic> (extermination order) was read aloud to prisoners of war, who were subsequently released into the desert to carry the message to other Hereros. The <italic>Vernichtungsbefehl,</italic> now cited as primary evidence of Germany’s intent to commit genocide, declared that all Hereros found within German territory would henceforth be killed on sight.</p>
<p>Some Hereros fled northward when war broke out, while others were able to escape via the desert. A few groups managed to hide out in central Namibia for several years. Many who were not killed or captured by the Schutztruppe died of dehydration and exhaustion. Merely 1000 reached Bechuanaland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11431332">Drechsler, 1980</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>By the end of 1904, Germany was compelled by domestic social and political pressure to accept the surrender of the Hereros. The German chancellor ordered the construction of five concentration camps to contain those who surrendered and to facilitate a system of controlled labor to meet military and settler demands in the colony. Conditions in the camps were brutal and the mortality rate was high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11431332">Olusoga and Erichsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 1999</xref>: 186–191). The concentration camps were finally closed in early 1908 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 1999</xref>: 141 n. 1). By then, at least 60,000 to 100,000 Hereros – approximately 80 per cent of the population – had perished as a consequence of the war and its aftermath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11431332">Drechsler, 1980</xref>: 214; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X11431332">Sarkin, 2011</xref>: 139). Upon release from the camps, Hereros, along with other ‘natives’, were incorporated into a new system to track and allocate labor, necessitated in part by the tremendous loss of life in the war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X11431332">McGregor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 1999</xref>: 190–191).</p>
<p>Many Hereros and historians argue that Herero society as it existed prior to 1904 was shattered through the events of this period. Due to the rinderpest epidemic and the German takeover of cattle farming, Hereros lost land and cattle, which was central to their cultural practices and economic livelihood. They subsequently lost rights to both due to the Native Ordinance of 1907, which prohibited ‘natives’ from owning land, cattle or horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11431332">Prein, 1994</xref>: 103). As a result of the events of 1904–1907, Herero families that survived the violence were widely dispersed across southern Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>A turning point for Herero society was the 1923 funeral of former Paramount Chief Samuel Maharero. It marked the effective creation of a unified Herero society that was tied to the history of the war with Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 1999</xref>: 192–230; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2000</xref>: 26–29). Maharereo’s funeral marked the start of an annual commemoration important for re-telling <italic>Otjitiro Otjindjandja</italic> among Herero communities<italic>.</italic> The <italic>Otruppe</italic> movement, a social welfare and political network, also began with this funeral and came to organize commemorations recalling the events of 1904–1907 by honoring leaders of that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961463X11431332">Werner, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961463X11431332"><title>1904–1907 and Namibian independence</title>
<p>Just after the Second World War, some Herero political elites (including former Paramount Chief Hosea Kutako, the successor of Samuel Maharero) reportedly discussed the idea of seeking compensation from Germany. Neither discursive space nor resources were available to pursue such claims while Herero leaders, along with leaders of other groups, were actively engaged in conflicts about and efforts towards seeking Namibia's independence from South Africa. Compensation then was framed differently and lacked the international media attention and interest across Herero communities that post-independence efforts developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>From the 1950s, Namibian liberation activists in exile mobilized particular memories of 1904–1907 to strengthen resistance against the South African colonial state and argue for independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11431332">Sarkin, 2009</xref>: 55–56).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0961463X11431332">4</xref></sup> The South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO), the officially recognized liberation movement, argued that Herero and Nama resistance against the Schutztruppe marked the beginnings of a long history of struggle against oppressive colonial rule in SWA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0961463X11431332">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The organizations that campaigned for Namibian independence were, in general, informed by ethnic divisions, members’ different historical experiences (that is, based on their location in Namibia or involvement with SWA administrations), and by political views about how Namibia should seek independence from South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0961463X11431332">6</xref></sup> Many Hereros supported organizations other than SWAPO. Amid increasing political tension and violence in SWA from the 1960s onward, some Herero leaders who remained in the territory thought they couldn’t afford to alienate the economically and politically powerful German settler community of SWA and thus tried to divert attention away from past conflicts by playing down remembrance and commemoration of 1904–1907 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>: 293–296). However, from 1978 the South African Defense Force and its local branch, the South West African Territorial Force (which included many Herero and German settler conscripts), supported a form of the annual Herero commemorations that recall deceased leaders, especially Samuel Maharero – and through him Herero experiences of German colonialism – to foster alliances in opposition to SWAPO.</p>
<p>In 1990, Namibia gained its independence. The new government promoted nation-building and declared a national policy of reconciliation. Thus, the emphasis on a particular group’s past did not accord with the government’s priorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0961463X11431332">7</xref></sup> The new government instead wanted to formalize an inclusive, national history: the struggle for Namibian independence, in which SWAPO featured centrally as the primary driver of liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X11431332">Melber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X11431332">Kössler, 2007</xref>: 362). Reconciliation effectively meant adopting a Namibian identity and ‘moving forward’ rather than debating the historical responsibility of various groups. It entailed what Sabine Höhn describes as ‘collective amnesia’ (2010: 484–487).</p>
<p>Despite this aim, tensions resulting from liberation struggle politics among those who had opposed SWAPO, those who had been in exile, those who were seen to have cooperated with the South African administration and those who had fought in the armed struggle continued to undermine unity in Namibia after Swapo’s first election victory in 1989.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0961463X11431332">8</xref></sup> Some Hereros aligned with opposition parties were left feeling marginalized, if not scorned, from political life and economic development by the new Swapo government. They not only felt that their varied roles within the struggle were excluded and devalued, but also that their ancestors’ resistance against early colonial oppression was virtually erased from the new nation-state’s official history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11431332">Sarkin, 2009</xref>: 184).</p>
<p>In short, divisive politics around Namibia’s independence and statehood significantly influenced the ways in which many Hereros perceived their place in Namibia and especially their relationship to the state. I suggest that such feelings of being sidelined in the new nation-state and even of betrayal by SWAPO during the liberation struggle heightened the interest of some Hereros in publicly remembering and addressing their early experiences with German colonialism. Amid these politically and ethnically based tensions some Hereros reclaimed 1904–1907 as a genocide and a matter to be taken up with Germany, in part as a means of regaining political agency that was effectively lost in the transition from South African to Swapo administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>: 298).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961463X11431332"><title>German approaches to the colonial past</title>
<p>If Hereros had demanded restorative justice earlier, it is unlikely that any German government would have been receptive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0961463X11431332">9</xref></sup> While other former colonial powers were contending with independence struggles in their colonies and beginning to critique their colonial projects in the latter half of the twentieth century, Germany had been forced to abandon its colonial ambitions several decades earlier. Germans became instead increasingly preoccupied with addressing the ghosts of their own domestic past.</p>
<p>From the 1960s some German scholars began to critique German colonialism, initially from Marxist perspectives on colonialism and critiques of West Germany’s ‘neo-colonialist’ involvement in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11431332">Drechsler, 1966</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X11431332">Bley, 1979</xref>: 149). In 1966 the East German journalist Horst Drechsler published the first account which described von Trotha’s strategies in the 1904–1907 war as genocidal. The West German historian Helmut Bley forwarded a similar interpretation in 1968. Notably, both works located the origins of National Socialism in German colonialism in SWA, and particularly in the genocide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>: 294). Most German historians and social scientists now accept that the Schutztruppe committed genocide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11431332">Kössler, 2008</xref>: 322). In brief, historical interpretations about what happened in SWA between 1904 and 1907 shifted from the crushing of an uprising (defensive violence) to a massacre (excessive violence in the context of war) to a genocide (criminal violence born of the intent to eradicate Hereros). However, there were few critical studies of German colonialism prior to the early 1990s. Some scholars suggest that Germans had forgotten their colonial past, or, in as much as it was remembered, it was only recalled uncritically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11431332">Friedrichsmeyer et al., 1998</xref>). Others argue that even today there is little public awareness in Germany of the country’s colonial past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X11431332">Melber, 2008</xref>: 271).</p>
<p>Reinhart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11431332">Kössler (2008)</xref> argues that the colonial past is not only important to Hereros but that it is also central to the identity of German-Namibians, or rather to the identity of those who identify as Südwesters (from the German name of the former colony, Deutsch-Südwestafrika) (p. 318; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961463X11431332">Walther 2002</xref>). Most of those do not agree with an interpretation of the events of 1904–1907 as genocide and want to end discussions about historical responsibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11431332">Kössler (2008)</xref> argues that there have long been connections between Südwester circles and those in Germany who deny the Holocaust as well as connections between the two genocides.</p>
<p>Another lens through which Germans have understood 1904–1907 is their experiences in coming to terms with the crimes committed by Nazi Germany, beginning with debates by government officials and civil society members during the 1950s in West Germany. The question of collective guilt was linked with a political and moral challenge to ‘master the past’ – something that has become known as <italic>Vergangenheitsbewältigung</italic> in Germany. In the late 1980s, a public debate among German intellectuals (the Historians’ Debate<italic>,</italic> or <italic>Historikerstreit</italic>) developed around the meaning of the Nazi past for German identity and the nature of the crimes committed by Nazi Germany. With German reunification in 1990, the past was looked at for the role it could play in founding a new, ‘normal’ nation-state as well in serving a German nation that could move on from the burden of the Holocaust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11431332">Jarausch, 1997</xref>: 28–31).</p>
<p>In sum, although some Germans have more recently come to approach their colonial past critically, they were, in one sense, particularly sensitive to Herero claims because of their domestic experiences. Germans were familiar with notions of collective, historical responsibility and restorative justice concepts. On the other hand, the weight of their immediate past constrained their possible responses, particularly because the ‘Herero genocide’ called into question the singularity of the Holocaust upon which the new nation-state was constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X11431332">Kössler and Melber, 2004</xref>). At the same time, some Südwesters and right-wing Germans have separately and together attached very different meanings to the colonial past that have also influenced the ways in which 1904–1907 has been dealt with in Namibia and Germany more broadly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961463X11431332"><title>Post-independence: Towards restorative justice</title>
<p>By 2004, many Hereros continued to view the German colonial past as ‘painful’ and the main source of their suffering. They witnessed elders crying while telling stories of this time, and they perceived the effects of these past injustices to significantly affect their own lived experiences, generations after the war. For some Hereros, their ancestors’ losses under German colonialism initiated almost a century of political and economic marginalization as well as great losses of land, cattle and cultural heritage. In other words, <italic>Otjitiro Otjindjandja</italic> was not only traumatic for their ancestors but also resulted in pain and suffering for the descendants of those affected.</p>
<p>Many Hereros I spoke with saw little change with Independence in 1990. They perceived that the Swapo-led Namibian government directed land redistribution, development projects and service provision improvements almost exclusively towards northern Namibia, historically the primary area of Swapo support. Indeed, some Hereros implied that if their government was unwilling to help them, they would have to look for help elsewhere.</p>
<p>Beginning shortly after Namibian independence, a group of Hereros under the leadership of Herero and Ovambanderu Paramount Chief Kuaima Riruako began public efforts to involve Germany in restorative justice practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0961463X11431332">10</xref></sup> This group called upon Germany to recognize the events of 1904–1907 as genocide, to admit its culpability and to reconcile these wrongs of the past with Hereros.</p>
<p>The Namibian state seemingly tried to quieten Herero demands of Germany in the interests of national reconciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11431332">Sarkin, 2009</xref>: 55–56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11431332">Höhn, 2010</xref>: 472). To many Hereros the government appeared to privilege the strengthening of bilateral state relationships over the demands of a citizen group. Some Hereros even told me that the German and Namibian governments had (allegedly) agreed not to use the word <italic>genocide</italic> in speaking about 1904–1907 due to its potential legal implications. In essence, where the Namibian government saw Herero claims as a challenge to the nation-state, some Hereros saw their marginalization by their own government to benefit the German state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0961463X11431332">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Riruako stated publicly in 1991 that Hereros demanded either the return of their stolen land by the Namibian state or just compensation from the German government, Riruako’s group only sought restorative justice from Germany. For many years the German state dismissed requests to engage with Hereros. Then in preparation for German President Roman Herzog’s March 1998 visit, Riruako presented a document about reparations to the German embassy in Windhoek, the UN, the International Court of Justice at The Hague and German newspapers. During the visit, Herzog said the Herero war was ‘not in good order’ and labeled the consequent suffering by Hereros as ‘a burden on the conscience of every German aware of our country’s history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11431332">Anonymous, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961463X11431332">Tkalec, 1998</xref>). He explained that Hereros could not claim compensation from Germany because there were no international laws in 1904 concerning genocide and the treatment of prisoners of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0961463X11431332">12</xref></sup> Herzog met with a Herero delegation, but merely emphasized that Germany was living up to its historical responsibility via its development projects in Namibia.</p>
<p>In 1999, with no satisfactory response from the German government, Riruako’s group attempted to charge Germany with genocide and to be awarded reparations at the International Court of Justice at The Hague (ICJ); however, the ICJ only presides over cases involving nation-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11431332">Gewald, 2003</xref>: 301). Riruako later claimed that his intent was only to garner global media attention for Herero claims and to provoke a response from Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11431332">Riruako, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In September 2001, Riruako and Herero individuals filed a lawsuit against the German government and three German corporations (for their ties to and profits from alleged colonial-era crimes) in the District Court of the United States District of Columbia under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789 for violations of international law, crimes against humanity, genocide, slavery and forced labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0961463X11431332">13</xref></sup> The suit complaint argues that the defendants committed criminal acts. Most notably, the claims compare the Hereros' genocide to the Holocaust, some victims of which had been awarded redress via this statute. Although the lawsuit failed to yield legal accountability and payment of reparations, it served as a powerful mobilizing tool inside and outside of Namibia. That Germany demanded Hereros withdraw the lawsuit in exchange for pursuing dialogue about reparations after the 2004 apology suggests that the lawsuit may have served as a threat to inaction for the German government. Indeed, many Hereros, whether or not they supported Riruako or the lawsuit, perceived that Riruako’s efforts to seek restorative justice had increased international attention for these claims. Germany surely experienced increasing pressure to respond as a result of prolific international media attention around Hereros' claims and initiatives by non-governmental organizations in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X11431332">Melber, 2008</xref>: 270).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0961463X11431332"><title>Commemorating the 100 year anniversary of 1904</title>
<p>To recognize the centenary of the start of the fighting between Hereros and Germans, public commemorative programs of varying popularity were carried out during 2004, primarily at important 1904 battle sites throughout central Namibia. Public television and radio discussions as well as some church services also served as sites for talking about this past. Although not coordinated with Namibian commemorations, a variety of interested parties in Germany held commemorative programs in 2004 as well. Media flows increased, and many scholars and government officials passed between Namibia and Germany for these special events.</p>
<p>While at least two of the occasions chosen for 2004 events in Namibia have been commemorated annually for decades (albeit in other forms) by small groups of Hereros, the centenary was largely an ‘invented’ commemoration. In other words, this critical moment for remembering was produced by modern practices of marking time, but the occasion became a historical turning point in its own right.</p>
<p>There was no consensus in Namibia about how 1904 should be commemorated, or about the ongoing effects of the genocide. Because various groups regarded this past and its present meanings differently, public contests emerged in Namibia about how best to understand what happened and to reconcile between impacted groups.</p>
<p>Different parties in Namibia had different reasons for formally or informally discussing and planning for 2004. Consequently, even after some parties agreed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of 1904, the framing of the centenary and decisions about dates or events to recognize persisted as points of conflict into 2004. At issue was not only the question of how to categorize the violence perpetrated by the Schutztruppe, but also who rightfully had a stake in claiming and mobilizing particular meanings of this past in Namibia. Although some common meetings occurred at the beginning of preparations in 2002, two different national-level committees ultimately formed to plan programs for 2004: the National Preparatory Committee for the Commemoration of 1904 (NPCC04) and the Coordination Committee for the First Official Commemoration of the Ovaherero Genocide (the ‘Genocide Committee’).</p>
<p>The Genocide Committee reportedly arose in 2003 out of conversations within Namibian Herero communities about a desire to bring attention to how Hereros have been affected by the genocide. To bring this history to a wider audience, the committee wanted to commemorate the genocide nationally and, thus, it needed to balance its focus on Hereros with attempts to appear apolitical and non-tribal. Some members even explained that they intended the commemorations to bring international attention that might pressure Germany with regard to Hereros' reparations claims.</p>
<p>The NPCC04 began around the same time in 2003 when some organizations affiliated with the German-Namibian community – the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Namibia and the Namibisch-Deutsche Stiftung (Namibian-German Foundation) – tried to create a space for dialogue between German-Namibians and Hereros. Divisiveness among Hereros about how to commemorate reportedly led the Church to effectively choose a side based on its own desire to see inclusive commemorations. Overall, an explicit interest in promoting national reconciliation among all the peoples of Namibia as well as a concern with protecting the German-Namibian community underpinned the creation and focus of the NPCC04.</p>
<p>Some Genocide Committee members thought that the Namibian government or the churches (in collaboration with the government) intentionally tried to sideline the Genocide Committee and its aims by establishing a second committee – to reclaim the war in 1904 as part of the national liberation struggle to appease the German government. On the other hand, the NPCC04 worried that the Genocide Committee not only distorted the impact of the 1904 war towards its own interests, but that the Committee’s work could further divide Namibian society. While these committees cooperated in the planning of the most important commemoration at Ohamakari, this was understood by committee members as a necessity rather than a reflection of an actual reconciling of differing perspectives.</p>
<p>The Ohamakari commemoration recalled the battle at Waterberg between German and Herero fighters on 14 August 1904, which was taken to be a decisive moment in the fighting. Indeed, both Hereros and German-Namibians had long commemorated this battle, albeit differently. The main event was held at a newly constructed cultural and tourism center, located on the edge of Herero communal lands, in the shadow of the Waterberg Plateau in central Namibia. The Center was funded by the DED (Deutscher Entwicklungsdienst), a German government agency, and was situated on one hectare of land (part of the 1904 battle site), which a German-Namibian farmer had recently donated to the local Herero community for this purpose, in the spirit of remembrance and reconciliation.</p>
<p>On the day of the commemoration, the small stadium area at the Center was flooded with people – Hereros and chiefs of all sub-groups, German dignitaries, journalists, Namibian officials, chiefs of other Namibian ethnic groups, religious leaders and several German-Namibians. The cooperation of the two national committees in planning this event led to an unprecedented number and variety of attendees. Indeed, even the diversity of Herero groups present was not repeated at other commemorations that year.</p>
<p>After other speeches by cultural and political leaders and performances by school and cultural groups, Minister Wieczorek-Zeul began by expressing a sense of honor at being invited to participate in the commemoration and explaining that she had also come to listen and had already met with Herero and Nama representatives. She then proceeded immediately to the language that had been avoided by every German official in the past.
<disp-quote>
<p>Today I want to acknowledge the violence inflicted by the German colonial powers on your ancestors, particularly the Herero and the Nama. I am painfully aware of the atrocities committed: in the late nineteenth century, the colonial powers drove the people from their land. When the Herero, when your ancestors, resisted, General von Trotha’s troops embarked on a war of extermination against them and the Nama. In his infamous order General Trotha commanded that every Herero be shot – with no mercy shown even to women and children. After the battle of Waterberg in 1904, the survivors were forced into the Omaheke desert, where they were denied any access to water sources and were left there to die of thirst and starvation. Following the uprisings, the surviving Herero, Nama and Damara were interned in camps and put to forced labor of such brutality that many did not survive. …</p>
<p>A century ago, the oppressors – blinded by colonial fervor – became agents of violence, discrimination, racism and annihilation in Germany’s name. The atrocities committed at that time would today be termed genocide – and nowadays a General von Trotha would be prosecuted and convicted, and rightly so.</p>
<p>We Germans accept our historical and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time. And so, in the words of the Lord’s Prayer that we share, I ask you to forgive us our trespasses and our guilt. Without a conscious process of remembering, without sorrow, without apology, there can be no reconciliation – remembrance is the key to reconciliation … Those who fail to remember the past become blind to the present. By remembering the past, we should gain strength for the present and the future. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X11431332">Wieczorek-Zeul, 2004</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>She made it clear that ‘everything that I said in my speech was an apology for crimes committed under Germany’s name.’ Her words were met with applause and some shouts of thanks.</p>
<p>The first speaker to respond was the representative of the Namibian government, then Minister of Lands and Resettlement (and Swapo presidential candidate), Hifikepunye Pohamba. He seemed surprised about the apology and went on to describe in broad terms the battles fought in 1904 and the sacrifices of those who fought the Schutztruppe. He spoke vaguely of the ‘unfortunate genocide of Ohamakari’ and the efforts of ‘our’ or ‘Namibian’ people; he didn’t mention Hereros or any other group specifically. In closing, he implored Namibians to accept the Minister’s apology and acknowledged that he accepted her apology on behalf of the audience.</p>
<p>Paramount Chief Riruako then also accepted the apology and reminded the audience that he had long fought for such an acknowledgement. Riruako framed the apology as ‘the truth about the government of Germany’s guilt’ and he expressed appreciation for Wieczorek-Zeul’s attendance and for doing what was right in offering the apology. He made it clear that he conceived of the apology as a step towards restorative justice, but also acknowledged that merely speaking a historical truth leads to forgiveness which, in turn, leads to re-humanizing both Germans and Hereros. Finally, Riruako asserted that while everyone in German SWA suffered because of the war, Hereros were particularly affected.</p>
<p>Preparations for 2004 and the commemorative programs themselves clearly triggered sustained opportunities for Namibians to publicly and privately remember and discuss the many interpretations of 1904–1907. This proliferation of dialogue in Namibia, along with explicit memory- and history-producing practices (especially the commemorations), produced a shared account of the past, even if it did not wholly or permanently displace other accounts. While both Pohamba and Riruako claimed authority to respond to the apology, their responses reflected a shared understanding: agents of the colonial German state committed genocide against Hereros and others, and as a result they continue to suffer at present.</p>
<p>The Ohamakari commemoration created a novel context for remembering 1904–1907 – one which included all Herero communities, the Namibian government, the German government, other ethnic groups and even some German-Namibians. Here, the audience learned this shared interpretation of the past and something of its meaning for affected communities in the present. Also, they witnessed what was arguably a symbolic reconfiguring of relationships between the German state and Hereros, in particular.</p>
<p>The commemorative year seemed to have also fostered space in Germany to negotiate a new understanding of this past and it provided a symbolic impetus for action. While the impact in Germany was certainly far less than in Namibia, the apology itself – a divergence from official German policy at the time, which Henning Melber attributes to intensive campaigns by individuals and NGOs in Germany (2008: 270) – was evidence that this occasion for remembering created opportunities for influential dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11431332">Kössler, 2008</xref>: 328).</p>
<p>The conflicts over commemorating 1904 brought the genocide to the fore in Namibia, marking a departure from the practice of subjugating this past within the national struggle over history. The centenary commemoration produced an experience of ‘historical discontinuity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X11431332">Zerubavel, 2003</xref>: 82–100) and, thereby, periodized the past such that Hereros’ experiences before 1904 appeared wholly different and separate from all that came after the watershed event of the genocide. This commemoration also served to compress the temporal distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X11431332">Zerubavel, 2003</xref>: 40–48) since 1904 and thus highlight the ongoing suffering of generations of Hereros.</p>
<p>In short, the 2004 commemorations reflected changing attitudes in Germany towards the genocide and heightened interest in Namibia. The centenary presented numerous opportunities for dialogue and negotiation among a variety of invested groups: Hereros of various factions, Swapo and Namibian government affiliates, Namibian civil society groups and individuals, as well as members of German civil society and government. The commemorative year was a critical moment for remembering in new, shared ways and amid new audiences. Although emerging from longer history- and memory-making processes, the 2004 commemorations resulted in the production of common understandings of what happened in 1904–1907, its significance, and reconfigurations of relationships among the German government, the Namibian government and Herero groups.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0961463X11431332" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The 2004 apology by a representative of the German government to Hereros and Namas, particularly, for crimes committed by the German colonial regime was a product of decades of changes in the way memories of 1904–1907 had been constituted and mobilized. Although after 1907 surviving Hereros had commemorated deceased leaders of <italic>Otjitiro Otjindjandja</italic> in various forms, until 1990 the story of anti-colonial resistance was subsumed within the broader politics of the Namibian independence struggle. This began to change from the 1990s as Germans also moved towards a more critical understanding of their colonial past. Simultaneous debates over historical responsibility for the Holocaust seemingly left Germany more sensitive to the emerging Herero movement to engage in restorative justice.</p>
<p>The discussions and debates in Namibia and Germany provoked by this movement achieved great success in bringing attention to the events and consequences of 1904–1907 as well as in reframing this past as a particular kind of historical problem, one which could and should be resolved in some symbolic manner (restorative justice). Aside from differences born of politics, it was in part because the Namibian government’s notion of national reconciliation precluded the privileging of any particular ethnic group’s history that this group of Hereros failed to garner government support for addressing this past. However, the creation of new types of opportunities for talking about the past via restorative justice practices drew attention internationally and enabled the creation of an account of genocide shared by many Hereros.</p>
<p>The centenary of the beginning of the genocide emerged as a critical moment for the invested groups in Namibia and Germany to debate how this past should be remembered and dealt with in the present. Indeed the preparations and commemorations themselves were opportunities for dialogues across groups and for negotiating a common interpretation of what happened in 1904–1907. The anniversary seemingly encouraged Wieczorek-Zeul to offer an apology that was meaningful and acceptable to both the Namibian state and the group of Hereros that had long requested it. Although the question of whether the minister had been authorized by her government to apologize was raised in Namibia, for many Hereros the apology embodied significant meaning in itself. They thought that Germany’s symbolic acceptance of culpability and openness to dialogue (at least at that moment) marked a significant step towards coming to terms with this painful past.</p>
<p>If 2004 marked a turning point in the remembering of 1904–1907, it was not only for meaningful engagements between Hereros and Germany as Herero claims for restorative justice would suggest, but also for the dramatic shift in the way the Namibian state recognized the genocide and its citizens’ claims against Germany. Experiences of marginalization at the hands of the Namibian state compounded the sense of social suffering that underpinned Herero demands for reparations. Thus, it is significant that in several instances after 2004 the Namibian government supported the reparations initiatives of Hereros and other groups. For example, in October 2006 the Namibian National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion to support demands for reparations that was tabled by Riruako (as a Member of Parliament). That the Namibian state’s approach to remembering <italic>Otjitiro Otjindjandja</italic> and support for Hereros' claims changed significantly during the course of planning for and participating in 2004 commemorative events constituted a significant achievement in Namibian politics. This was a step towards addressing historical inequities and improving the relationships between the Namibian state and a minority population (Hereros).</p>
<p>Although the 2004 apology was not followed by the reparations demanded by some Hereros and other victims of German colonial brutality, the apology and the commemorative year in which it was offered significantly changed the terrain of remembering the German colonial past – at least in Namibia.</p>
