<abstract>
<p>This article compares the oldest Hindu versions of the Golden Rule found in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> with those in the gospels. What may the Hindu texts, which usually receive little attention, contribute to the understanding of the New Testament renditions? Methodologically the article draws from Clooney’s Comparative Theology and Moyaert’s approach of hermeneutical hospitality. In the Hindu texts the rule is understood in terms of <italic>ahimsa</italic> (non-violence). This seems to be close to Luke’s version, in which the maxim is closely connected with the appeal to love one’s enemies. The <italic>Mahabharata</italic>, however, reveals also the maxim’s potency to use reciprocity as a strategy for making peace. So, the reciprocity stressed in Matthew is also important.</p></abstract>

<bold>Résumé :</bold> Le présent article compare des versions hindoues les plus anciennes de la Règle d’Or trouvées dans le <italic>Mahabharata</italic> avec celles des évangiles. Comment le choix des mots hindous, qui d’ordinaire ne nous intéresse guère, peut-il nous aider à comprendre l’interprétation du Nouveau Testament ? Mon récit se base méthodiquement sur la théologie comparative de Clooney et l’approche herméneutique de Moyaert. Dans les textes hindous, la règle de conduite est comprise en termes de non violence, <italic>ahimsa</italic>. Ceci donne une place prépondérante à la version de Luc, puisque cette maxime, dans l’évangile de Luc, est étroitement liée à la demande que nous aimions nos ennemis. En fait, le <italic>Mahabharata</italic> nous révèle aussi la richesse de la formulation en utilisant, comme stratégie, la corrélation dans l’établissement de la paix. Cette idée de réciprocité est également importante dans l’évangile de Mathieu.</p></trans-abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In his book <italic>Understanding Religion</italic> the British-Persian scholar Moojan Momen demonstrates that the Golden Rule, an ethical code which is often formulated as ‘do not do to others what you do not want to be done to yourself,’ is found in various religious traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the Baha’i religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008429812460141">Momen, 2009</xref>: 344).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429812460141">1</xref>
</sup> The <italic>Religious Tolerance</italic> website even mentions 18 religions, though a careful reading of the texts on this webpage shows that they are not all about the Golden Rule. Nonetheless the ancient Egyptian religion, Confucianism and Jainism may be added as well (website <italic>Religious Tolerance</italic>). This conveys the impression that formulations in the spirit of the Golden Rule are deeply rooted in global cultural and religious traditions. However, if one takes a closer look at the contexts and phrasings of the Golden Rule in these traditions, one will inevitably discover some differences. It seems, therefore, that the Golden Rule does not have exactly the same meaning everywhere.</p>
<p>The Internet also reveals that participants in interreligious dialogue consider the Golden Rule to be a good theme for their meetings or a maxim to create a global ethics, which ultimately will create global peace. People can even buy T-shirts to promote this rule as a global commandment (see also: Armstrong, on <italic>TED: Ideas Worth Spreading</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812460141">Armstrong, 2011</xref>: 1–2, 40, 42–44, 47, 64, 69, 90, 103–104, 139, 155, 163, 166; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812460141">Bordat, 2007a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429812460141">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429812460141">Küng, 2005</xref>; and the following websites: ‘Committee for the Golden Rule’; <italic>Religious Tolerance</italic>; <italic>Scarboro Missions</italic>; <italic>The Golden Rule</italic>). It has to be admitted, however, that these websites reflect mostly North American and sometimes German initiatives, and many have a Roman Catholic background.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Golden Rule has been the subject of many books, although only four present a study of this maxim in the contexts of various different religions. This series of four was initiated by two monographs written by the Greek theologian Leonidas J. Philippidis: his dissertation, defended at the University of Leipzig in Germany in 1929, and a second booklet issued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008429812460141">1933</xref>. Both publications pay attention to the maxim in the contexts of the religious world of India, Confucianism, the ancient Greek and Roman religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The third book, Jeffrey Wattles’ <italic>The Golden Rule</italic>, remarkably enough only deals with the Golden Rule in a Western context, as it discusses the axiom in the context of the ancient Greek world, the Jewish and Christian religions and various Western philosophies. The Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim contexts are only referred to in a note (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0008429812460141">Wattles, 1996</xref>: 191–192). The fourth book, <italic>The Golden Rule: The Ethics of Reciprocity in World Religions</italic>, is a compilation edited by Jacob Neusner and Bruce Chilton in 2008. This volume gives large space to the Buddhist and Hindu versions next to the renditions present in Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Islam and Confucianism. It is obvious that until recently the Hindu versions of the Golden Rule have received less attention than the Jewish and Christian formulations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812460141">2</xref>
</sup> This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the references to the Hindu versions are often fuzzy or even incorrect. Therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to the Hindu renditions. For this reason the first question to be dealt with in this article is what exactly these Hindu phrasings are, in particular the most ancient of them. Subsequently a second question will be discussed, namely what these Hindu versions of the Golden Rule contribute to the interpretation of the New Testament renditions of this maxim in the context of Christian theology? The background behind the second question is that the Golden Rule may serve as a good starting point for an interreligious dialogue between adherents of different religious traditions. A comparison of the renderings and meanings of this maxim in the contexts of both the Hindu scriptures and Christian scriptures may, therefore, be helpful to start a dialogue between Hindus and Christians.</p>
<p>As it is impossible to pay attention to all versions of the Golden Rule both in Hinduism and in Christianity, the focus will be on the most ancient ones. This means, however, that first it must be determined which texts can be regarded as the oldest renditions of this rule not only in the Hindu heritage but also in the Christian tradition. In Christianity it is clear which renderings are the most ancient ones, since the Golden Rule is found in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, which belong to the oldest texts of the Christian tradition. Which versions are oldest in Hinduism, however, is less obvious. The next section of this article will pay attention to the method used for comparing these versions of the Golden Rule. Subsequently the texts and contexts will be considered. Then the interpretations of the Golden Rule in both religious traditions will be discussed, to be followed, at the end, by a conclusion and an epilogue.</p>
<p>First, however, it is necessary to point out where the oldest Hindu version of the Golden Rule can be detected. Philippidis supposes that the most ancient rendition is found in the great Hindu epic, the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008429812460141">Philippidis, 1929</xref>: 76). Furthermore he asserts that the maxim is also traced in some other texts,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812460141">3</xref>
</sup> but the only other place where I could find the maxim is in <italic>Yajñvalkya Dharmashastra</italic> 3.65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0008429812460141">Stenzler, 1970</xref>: 87 and 96). In the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> the Golden Rule appears at three places, <italic>Mahabharata</italic> 5.39.57; 12.279.23; and 13.114.8.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812460141">4</xref>
</sup> Remarkably enough, the American indologist Richard H. Davis, in the volume edited by Neusner and Chilton, only pays attention to one of these places, <italic>Mahabharata</italic> 13.114.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812460141">Davis, 2008</xref>: 146–156). The present article will discuss all three instances in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> for its interpretation of the Golden Rule in Hinduism. The maxim as formulated in the <italic>Yajñvalkya Dharmashastra</italic> will not be discussed, because this law-book dates very probably from a later date than the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429812460141">Olivelle, 2010</xref>: 46).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812460141">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Golden Rule is found at two places, Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0008429812460141" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The way of comparing these Hindu and Christian texts is inspired by the method developed in the new or revised Comparative Theology as contrived by the American Roman Catholic theologians Francis X. Clooney (b. 1951) and James L. Fredericks (b. 1951)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429812460141">6</xref>
</sup> and by the method of hermeneutical openness or hermeneutical hospitality designed by the Belgian Roman Catholic theologian Marianne Moyaert (b. 1979).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429812460141">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clooney’s and Fredericks’ revised Comparative Theology is an attempt to understand the meaning of Christian faith by exploring it in the light of the teachings of other religious traditions. Its purpose is to assist Christians in coming to a deeper understanding of their own religious tradition. So, in revised Comparative Theology the focus is on what the contents of non-Christian texts contribute to the interpretation of Christian texts and not the other way round, because the interpretation of non-Christian texts is first and foremost the business of the non-Christian believers themselves. Revised Comparative Theology operates within the context of Christianity and Christian belief.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0008429812460141">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Anyone who is acquainted with the works of Clooney knows that he not only attempts to understand the texts of the other tradition, but he also tries to find out what the commentaries of this tradition add to the interpretation of these texts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812460141">Clooney, 2008</xref>). So, he delves really deeply into the backgrounds of these passages. Only then does he return to their meaning for the interpretation of Christian texts. ‘Knowledge, taken seriously, changes the lives of the knowers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812460141">Clooney, 1993</xref>: 5). In this way non-Christian texts are ‘inscribed’ into the minds of Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812460141">Clooney, 1993</xref>: 5). Fredericks mostly comes to his interpretations more quickly.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0008429812460141">9</xref>
</sup> Although both of them do their work from a Christian point of view, it is obvious that they take the message of the other tradition very seriously. They even claim that theologians earnestly studying texts belonging to another tradition will always be changed by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812460141">Clooney, 2010a</xref>: 155–157; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812460141">Fredericks, 2010</xref>: xii). Various publications, moreover, have pointed out that a completely neutral position is impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812460141">Knitter, 2005</xref>: 157–164; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429812460141">Nicholson, 2009</xref>: 616–618).</p>
<p>The benefit of this type of theology is that it is of great use in a modern pluralist society. More than ever before, people are unavoidably confronted with beliefs and expressions that are part and parcel of different religions. So it becomes increasingly natural to read and interpret the narratives, doctrines and ideas of one’s own religious tradition after having been confronted with similar stories, teachings and thoughts of religions that one does not adhere to. From this perspective it is only self-evident that one should interpret the Christian versions of the Golden Rule while reckoning with the variants offered by Hinduism.</p>
<p>Marianne Moyaert’s new book published in 2011, <italic>Fragile Identities: Towards a Theology of Interreligious Hospitality</italic>, can be regarded as a ground-breaking contribution to the field of Comparative Theology, because the theology of interreligious hospitality she develops here, based on the views of Paul Ricœur (1913–2005), “offers comparative theologians a compelling hermeneutics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0008429812460141">Takács, 2011</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0008429812460141">10</xref>
</sup> which was long overdue. In this book Moyaert conveys another important motive for seeking contact with people and investigating texts and phenomena belonging to other religious traditions. She points out that the tension between the strange and the familiar can be theologically creative. The encounter with the religious other challenges Christian believers and compels them to be flexible with regard to their faith. “[N]ew dimensions of meaning arise, and interreligious hermeneutics breathe new life into familiar meanings.” Therefore the encounter will “willy-nilly”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0008429812460141">11</xref>
</sup> influence their faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812460141">Moyaert, 2011a</xref>: 272).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0008429812460141">12</xref>
</sup> So, reading texts and meeting people from other religious traditions can be beneficial to the progress and development of Christian theology, being a stimulus for the creativity of its practitioners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0008429812460141">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, Moyaert also emphasizes that it is possible that something strange will preserve its strangeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812460141">Moyaert, 2011a</xref>: 239–241) and she rejects the idea that the believer is always totally transformed by the encounter. One’s faith is inevitably influenced indeed, but this does not mean that the faithful undergoes a complete transformation. Yet, changes are possible and it is even theologically necessary that the tradition and faith change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812460141">Moyaert, 2011a</xref>: 268). In other words, it is possible and even very probable that the encounter with people and texts and other elements of another tradition will change one, but it is not inevitable. There are situations in which the message of Hindu texts does not lead to a new and different understanding of Christian texts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to make another reservation: in the past, texts derived from another tradition were used on occasion to support the meaning of the texts of the tradition the writer belonged to, or to show that the formulations and meanings of the tradition of the authors were superior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0008429812460141">14</xref>
</sup> In order to prevent this I will give preference to those meanings of the Hindu renditions of the Golden Rule that might seem to unsettle most the security of Christians. In this way the equal position of both traditions may be guaranteed, or, at least, Christian hegemony is avoided.</p>

<title>The New Testament</title>
<sec id="section4-0008429812460141">
<title>Texts</title>
<p>The best-known rendition of the Golden Rule in the Christian tradition is Matthew 7:12. The Greek formulation of Matthew 7:12 is:</p>
<verse-group>
<verse-line>Πάντα οὖν ὅσα ἄν θέλητε ἵνα ποιῶσιν ὑμῖν οἱ ἄνθρωποι, οὕτω καὶ ὑμεῖς</verse-line>
<verse-line>ποιεῖτε αὐτοῖς· οὗτος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται.</verse-line>

<verse-line>
<bold>for this sums up the Law and the Prophets</bold>.</verse-line>
</verse-group>
<p>In the New Testament the maxim has one parallel, Luke 6:31. Its Greek rendition is:</p>
<verse-group>
<verse-line>Καὶ καθῶς θέλετε ἵνα ποιῶσιν ὑμῖν οἱ ἄνθρωποι ποιεῖτε αὐτοῖς ὁμοίως.</verse-line>
</verse-group>
<p>In English:</p>
<verse-group>
<verse-line>Do to others <bold>as</bold> you would have them do to you.</verse-line>
</verse-group>
<p>The bold-printed words are the ones that are different.</p>
<p>It is obvious that Luke’s rendition differs slightly from the one found in Matthew. However, not only the formulation is different, the context differs as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0008429812460141">
<title>Contexts</title>
<p>The gospel of Matthew was written in Greek, perhaps in the 80s of the first century <sc>ce</sc>. Its place of origin may be Syria, just outside the region of Palestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008429812460141">Theißen and Merz, 2001</xref>: 46). The gospel of Luke was also written in Greek, somewhere between 70 and 110 <sc>ce </sc>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008429812460141">Theißen and Merz, 2001</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>Research conducted by New Testament scholars led to the conclusion that the versions of the Golden Rule that are found in Matthew and Luke have a common origin in a text that they mostly indicate as ‘The Sayings of Q’ and which might date from around 50 <sc>ce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008429812460141">Theißen and Merz, 2001</xref>: 45). There is a high degree of confidence among New Testament scholars that the text of Luke maintained the order of the Sayings of Q most accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812460141">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>: 42–43), which means that Luke also preserved the original context of the Golden Rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812460141">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>: 82–87). This does not mean that there is no difference between Luke and the Sayings of Q, because in Luke’s text the order of the verses is slightly rearranged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812460141">Betz, 1995</xref>: 42–44; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812460141">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>: 80–91). Matthew, however, completely removed the Golden Rule from this context to place it after Mt. 7:7–11, a section speaking about the fatherly concern and generosity of God, which is reflected in the fatherly concern and generosity of men. The last verse of this section says:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,</p>
<p>how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Hereafter comes the Golden Rule as a kind of conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount. Hans Dieter Betz (b. 1931) is of the opinion that Mt. 7:13–14 forms the beginning of a new section in the Sermon on the Mount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812460141">Betz, 1995</xref>: 65).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0008429812460141">16</xref>
</sup> This means that Mt. 7:9–11, and not what follows Mt. 7:12, is decisive with regard to the context of the Golden Rule in Matthew. Consequently, the Golden Rule in Matthew has to be interpreted as a follow-up to the fatherly concern and generosity of God. God’s abundant love will provide what Jesus’ disciple prays for. For this reason he is able to adopt an attitude in which he takes the initiative to do to others what he would have them do to him. The final words of Mt. 7:12, referring to the Law and the Prophets, return in a slightly altered form and context in Mt. 22:40, which says that ‘[a]ll the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments,’ namely the commandments to love God and to love one’s neighbour as oneself. This means that the Golden Rule and the love for God and the neighbour – being both a summary of the Law and the Prophets – stand on the same level in this gospel. Mt. 22:40, moreover, relates the attitude towards someone else closely to one’s view of oneself. Furthermore, it points to the love for God. So the conclusion is justified that the context in Matthew suggests that the Golden Rule may be regarded as the loving reaction of a human being to the love of God for him. God’s love gives him the self-confidence needed to extend God’s love to other people through his own love by doing to the others what he would have them do to himself. This ‘legitimates a certain kind of reciprocity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1990</xref>: 396; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812460141">Betz, 1995</xref>: 518–519). It seems that the disciple is not asked to go beyond what he would have the others to do to himself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0008429812460141">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It was already pointed out that the direct context of Luke 6:31 in the gospel itself is not very different from that in Q. The biggest difference concerns the order of the verses. The wider context in Luke is that this verse is part of the Sermon on the Plain (Lk. 6: 20–48), a speech much shorter than the Sermon on the Mount, but also starting with beatitudes. They are followed by exclamations of woe. Then comes the section including the Golden Rule. Here the maxim is preceded by an appeal to love one’s enemies and followed by a section condemning the people who only love those who love them, succeeded by a second appeal to love the enemies. Luke’s version of the Golden Rule is completely enclosed by the appeal to love one’s enemies, so that it is only natural to interpret the Golden Rule in Luke from the background of the love for one’s enemies. The verses directly following the Golden Rule resolutely reject a purely retributive interpretation of the rule. The disciple is exhorted to take the initiative and to do as he would have them to do to him without directly expecting anything in return.</p>
<p>It is palpable that the contexts of the Golden Rule in the two gospels differ. In Matthew the disciple is encouraged by God’s fatherly love and exhorted to do to others what he would have them to do to himself, and is not asked to go beyond this. The Golden Rule still contains an element of reciprocity. In Luke the disciple is urged to make a start without expecting direct reciprocation. Luke’s rendition is, moreover, set against the background of a double appeal to love one’s enemies. Although this appeal is also found in Matthew, even in the Sermon on the Mount, it is placed in Matthew 5, two chapters earlier in a completely different part of this speech. Therefore it does not play an important role with regard to the interpretation of Matthew’s rendition of the Golden Rule.</p>

<p>The Golden Rule is found in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> at three places. It first appears in the fifth book of the epic, <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57. The Sanskrit rendition there is:</p>

<p>Another version is found in the twelfth book, <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23. This version differs widely from the previous one, for it is formulated as follows:</p>

<title>Contexts</title>
<p>All three verses are found in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>. This epic represents a whole library rather than a single homogeneous work; it constitutes a veritable treasure house of Indian lore, both secular and religious. It is four times as voluminous as the whole Bible. Today many scholars believe that the epic began as <italic>Jaya</italic>, a poem of about seven thousand verses about the victory of the Pandava brothers, which was extended to a work of about three times its former length, the <italic>Bharata</italic>. In later times the epic was further expanded to a major work of one hundred thousand stanzas called the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>, of which the final redaction probably dates from around 400 <sc>ce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008429812460141">Van Buitenen, 1973</xref>: xxv; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429812460141">Fitzgerald, 1983</xref>: 612–613; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812460141">Klostermaier, 2007</xref>: 60–61). It is very hard to find out at which date a certain part of this library was written. Yet, it was assumed at the beginning of the 20th century that the didactic parts were added at a later date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812460141">Hopkins, 1901</xref>: 397–398). Later M.R. Yardi made an attempt to determine more accurately on the base of the writing styles of the various parts of the epic which of them could have belonged to the original text, the <italic>Jaya</italic>, and which formed the various later additions. Yardi also believes that none of the three stanzas containing the Golden Rule was included in the <italic>Jaya</italic>. He is of the opinion that <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57 belongs to the first large addition and that <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23 and <italic>Anushasana Parvan</italic> 114.8 were part of the second large addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0008429812460141">Yardi, 1986</xref>: 156 -158). This would suggest that the version of the <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57 is the oldest formulation of the Golden Rule within Hinduism. Furthermore, it is likely that <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23 and <italic>Anushasana Parvan</italic> 114.8 date from a rather later period, perhaps even from the 4th century.</p>
<p>
<italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57 is part of a lecture given by Vidura to his half-brother, the blind King Dhritarashtra, the father of Duryodhana. Duryodhana was the leader of his so-called Kaurava brothers who ruled the country at that time and refused to give it back to their cousins, the Pandava brothers, although this had been agreed upon when Pandu, another half-brother of Dhritarashtra and father of the Pandavas, had died. Before he passed away, it was Pandu who was ruling the kingdom. King Dhritarashtra succeeded him at his demise. Because of the refusal of the Kauravas to return the country to the Pandavas, a war was threatening now. Therefore various attempts were undertaken to prevent this conflict, although the armies of both sides already had been built up and were ready to fight. In the night before the probable outbreak of the fighting King Dhritarashtra could not sleep. He worried about the pending massacre and asked for advice. One of the people sharing their wisdom with the ruler that night was Vidura, the other half-brother of Dhritarashtra, but from a mother of a lower caste. Vidura attempted to persuade the king, in a long, morally coloured lecture, to interfere and to grant the Pandavas at least a small piece of the kingdom:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[L]ord of the people, behave with grace toward the poor Pandavas. Give them some little villages for them to live on, my lord, and thus, ruler of men, you will earn fame in the world. … In this world kinsmen save and kinsmen ruin: it is the good ones who save, the evil that ruin. Be good to the Pandavas, Indra of kings, giver of pride, and surrounded by them you will become invincible to your foes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0008429812460141">Van Buitenen, 1978</xref>: 280)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here Vidura referred to the following proposal, which Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandava brothers, had made, in <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.20-21, to Dhritarashtra’s envoy Samjaya at an earlier time:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Give five villages to the five brothers, [Duryodhana]!<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0008429812460141">21</xref>
</sup> So, sagacious Samjaya, shall there be peace between us and our kinsmen. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0008429812460141">Van Buitenen, 1978</xref>: 251)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, Vidura showed the monarch a small opening, giving him an opportunity to prevent the outbreak of this war. Next, Vidura reminded his half-brother that wise men are not governed by their emotions and anger. Then, coming to the last part of his speech, he referred to the virtues of wisdom, self-control, tolerance, generosity and good manners. Thereafter Vidura formulated the Golden Rule. Finally, he gave the sovereign a firm warning not to rely on bad people and not to strive for wealth. Even powerful kings ultimately meet their end.</p>
<p>When the words of <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23 resounded, the situation had changed radically. The war was over. The corpses of dead warriors and the bodies of dying combatants were scattered all over the battlefield. One of these dying warriors was Bhishma, the teacher of both the Pandava and the Kaurava brothers. Only the five Pandava brothers, Krishna, who acted as Arjuna’s charioteer, and Dhrishtadyumna, as well as three Kaurava brothers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0008429812460141">22</xref>
</sup> had survived after the great massacre. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother − who because of his loyalty to the <italic>dharma</italic> (justice) was regarded as the personification of <italic>dharma</italic> itself (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812460141">Klostermaier, 2007</xref>: 65) − had become king now. He felt devastated and desperate. Then he heard that the dying Bhishma had requested him to come to the battlefield and to ask him for advice. Yudhishthira went to Bhishma, who lay among the victims of the massacre. Some still moaned. Bhishma started to share his wisdom in a series of lectures comprising almost the whole of two of the eighteen books of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>. <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23 was part of the lessons of a previous guru, Parasara, which Bhishma now related to Yudhishthira. Parasara was also the father of Vyasa, who is assumed to be the author of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>. Parasara spoke about the <italic>dharma</italic>, in this context translated by Ganguli as ‘righteousness.’ Righteousness meant that a human being accomplished his duties.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Four methods of living … have been ordained in this world. (Those four methods are the acceptance of gifts for Brahmanas; the realisation of taxes for Kshatriyas; agriculture for Vaisyas; and service of the three other classes for the Sudras.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981a</xref>: 346)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Subsequently, Parasara emphasized the importance of self-restraint, forgiveness, patience, energy, contentment, truthfulness of speech, modesty, abstention from causing injury, and freedom from the evil practices, for they produce happiness. Then he formulated the Golden Rule. Thereafter he warned that if the members of the four main classes would not accomplish their duties, they deserved pity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981a</xref>: 346–347). In the following chapter he showed the evil consequences that would hit them in that case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981a</xref>: 348–349).</p>
<p>The context of <italic>Anushasana Parvan</italic> 114.8 was barely different from the situation of <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23. Bhishma was still teaching his wise lessons to Yudhishthira. Suddenly, however, Brihaspati, the divinity who acted as the priest of the gods, descended from heaven. To a question put by Yudhishthira, Brihaspati answered that every man is born alone and dies alone. After death a human being will be followed only by his <italic>dharma</italic>. After a long lecture about what happens to someone in the circle of subsequent lives, the godly priest emphasized the importance of non-violence and of control over the three faults, <italic>viz</italic>., lust, wrath, and cupidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981b</xref>: 227–235).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>That man who regards all creatures as his own self, and behaves towards them as towards his own self, laying aside the rod of chastisement and completely subjugating his wrath, succeeds in attaining to happiness. … Such a person leaves no track behind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981b</xref>: 235)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Then follows the Golden Rule. Next, he indicates the importance of reciprocity in the behaviour of people: ‘“When one injures another, the injured turns round and injures the injurer. Similarly, when one cherishes another, that other cherishes the cherisher”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981b</xref>: 235). ‘ “This is the subtle way of righteousness” (<italic>dharma</italic>). Then Brihaspati ascended to return to heaven’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429812460141">Ganguli, 1981b</xref>: 235).</p>
<p>In retrospect, it may be concluded that the situation of the first time the Golden Rule is phrased is completely different from the circumstances of the second and the third time that this maxim is uttered. The context of <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57 is an attempt to prevent the outbreak of a great battle, while the context of the other two occasions on which this rule is formulated is one of death and destruction after the war. Now, the focus is on the consequences of one’s behaviour for one’s afterlife.</p>

<title>Further Discussion</title>
<sec id="section9-0008429812460141">
<title>The New Testament</title>
<p>The New Testament versions of the Golden Rule are subject to so many commentaries within the world of Christianity that it is impossible to discuss them within the scope of a single article. Therefore, I will focus merely on the interpretation provided by the French Protestant philosopher Paul Ricœur. The main reason to do so is that he gives careful heed to the different contexts of the two formulations of the Golden Rule in the New Testament, asserting that this difference has to do with love and justice.</p>
<p>Ricœur points out that the features of the discourse of justice are opposed to those of the discourse of love, for love is about feelings and justice is about social practices and principles. Justice is something for the courts, which have to decide between the claims of opposed parties. Justice argues, love does not. It is important that justice also has to do with the monopoly of power. Justice deals with equality of rights and the proportional equality of advantages and responsibility in an unequal division. Justice is therefore often characterized by an attitude of disinterested interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1995</xref>: 321–324).</p>
<p>Love has its origin in the economy of gift. The first chapter of Genesis, with its story about the creation of the universe, and the first words of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20, saying ‘I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage,’ reveal that human life is embedded in the love of God who created and liberated him. The commandment to love one’s neighbour, or even one’s enemies, is rooted in the love of God. This is reflected in both the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain, where the love for one’s enemies is motivated by God’s love for all creatures (Mt. 5:45; Lk. 6:36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1995</xref>: 324). Ricœur formulates it as follows: ‘the commandment to love one’s enemies is not sufficient by itself; rather, it is the [hyperethical]<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0008429812460141">23</xref>
</sup> expression of a broader economy of the gift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1995</xref>: 324), meaning that a human being is commanded to follow the example of God towards others. How far this goes, is revealed in Luke 6:38:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>‘The lack of measure is the good measure. […] superabundance becomes the hidden truth of equivalence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1990</xref>: 397). Earlier, however, in Luke 6:32–33 it was said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These two verses make Ricœur wonder: ‘Is not the golden rule retracted by these harsh words?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1995</xref>: 326). Luke 6:38 shows that this is not the case. The intention of Luke 6:32–33 is merely to criticize a reading of the Golden Rule in which the maxim is purely interpreted as a principle of reciprocity. In other words, the Golden Rule can only function well if it is governed by the logic of superabundance, which is rooted in the superabundant love of God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1990</xref>: 395–396; 1995: 325–326). It is clear that Ricœur completely follows the intention of Luke’s version of the Golden Rule.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I do not claim that love for enemies, held as the touchstone of the logic of superabundance, and the Golden Rule, held as the highest expression of the logic of equivalence, coincide. The one is unilateral. The other is bilateral. The one expects nothing in return. The other legitimates a certain kind of reciprocity. My contention is … that the tension between them is … essential and central to genuine Christian ethics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1990</xref>: 396)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is because, to avoid the hyperethical commandment of love for one’s enemies becoming a-moral, if not immoral, it must reinterpret the principle of morality summarized in the Golden Rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812460141">Ricœur, 1990</xref>: 397). If actions inspired by the logic of superabundance lead to injustice, they will no longer be understood as actions of love, which is something that could happen, for example, when a criminal does not receive any punishment out of love. This, however, is my own formulation. Ricœur does not say it so explicitly. He prefers to remain loyal to the logic of superabundance, thus opting for the message of the Golden Rule in Luke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0008429812460141">
<title>The Mahabharata</title>
<p>In contrast to Christianity and Confucianism, the Hindu commentaries do not pay special attention to the Golden Rule as a subject in its own right (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812460141">Hallisey, 2008</xref>: 130). The Hindu authors focus on themes like <italic>dharma</italic>, self-control, <italic>ahimsa</italic> (non-violence), asceticism, the effects of certain deeds on afterlife and the importance of living in accordance with the caste hierarchy, while the Golden Rule itself is scarcely mentioned separately. Therefore it is only possible to look at the contexts of this maxim.</p>
<p>Richard H. Davis also refers to the importance of the concept of <italic>dharma</italic> in Hindu philosophical and ethical discourse. He, moreover, shows how closely the <italic>dharma</italic> is linked with the hierarchical society of India. In his opinion it is only possible to regard the other really as oneself if one does not pay attention to the social identity and the bodily appearance of a person, but only to his soul or <italic>atman</italic> (self), the principle which goes from one life to another. Furthermore he points out that desire (<italic>kama</italic>) is the opposite of <italic>dharma</italic>. So self-control is the best way to implement the <italic>dharma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812460141">Davis, 2008</xref>: 152–153). For this reason it is no surprise that ‘Indic formulations of the Golden Rule … repeatedly point toward a principle that is much more significant within classical Indic ethical discourse, namely the principle of <italic>ahimsa</italic>, nonharming or nonviolence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812460141">Davis, 2008</xref>: 147).</p>
<p>Davis’s point of view is supported by the Indologist Wilhelm Halbfass (1914–2000), who explains that the word <italic>dharma</italic> is etymologically closely related to the word <italic>dharana</italic> because both are derived from the root <italic>dhri</italic>, which means ‘to support,’ ‘to uphold.’ <italic>Dharana</italic> means ‘supporting’ or ‘maintenance,’ but in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> <italic>dharana</italic> does not mean a supporting principle that is inherent in things, but rather a ‘maintenance’ or ‘preservation’ which is incumbent on humanity. This involves the ideal of <italic>ahimsa</italic>, of ‘non-injury,’ or ‘the sparing’ of living beings, which is presented as the core and essence of <italic>dharma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429812460141">Halbfass, 1988</xref>: 316–317).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0008429812460141">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Now it is time to return to the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> itself. The first stanza of the epic containing the Golden Rule is <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57, which is part of a lecture in which Vidura tries to persuade King Dhritarashtra to give the Pandavas at least the five villages Yudhishthira asked for. He reminds the sovereign of the wise men: they practise self-control. Vidura’s most important motive is, however, that by giving these villages to his cousins, the king will be able to prevent a bloody massacre as the Pandava brothers have already indicated that they will be moved by this sign of reconciliation and stop their preparations for warfare. So the context of the Golden Rule is the prevention of violence, that is, in fact, <italic>ahimsa</italic>. Therefore the monarch has to summon his sons and tell them to make a positive gesture to their enemies and welcome the proposal made by Yudhishthira.</p>
<p>The second verse including the Golden Rule, <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23, is situated shortly after the battle. Dying on a bed of arrows and surrounded by the victims of this fight, Bhishma teaches Yudhishthira how to become a good ruler. The Pandava has to abide by the rules of the caste hierarchy, but he has to do so with self-restraint, contentment, modesty and abstention from inflicting injury. Then he will attain happiness, but in this case he also must implement the Golden Rule. Otherwise he will be confronted with the evil consequences of his bad behaviour. This refers, of course, to the circumstances in which this maxim is uttered, the battlefield, full of the victims of those who were not willing to control themselves. Again the Golden Rule is placed in the context of <italic>ahimsa</italic>.</p>
<p>The third verse with the Golden Rule, <italic>Anushasana Parvan</italic> 114.8, is spoken in the same circumstances, but now by Brihaspati, the priest and preceptor of the heavenly gods. He also speaks about it in a context of self-restraint. He ends his lecture with these words: ‘That man who follows the <italic>dharma</italic> taking recourse to non-violence (<italic>ahimsa</italic>) attains the highest end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812460141">Davis, 2008</xref>: 152). For the third time in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> the Golden Rule resounds in a context in which people refer to <italic>ahimsa</italic>.</p>
<p>Davis was completely right in pointing out that in Indic ethical discourse the Golden Rule points to <italic>ahimsa</italic>. It is as if <italic>ahimsa</italic> is the most important motive for following the Golden Rule. This means that, within classical Hinduism, the Golden Rule and <italic>ahimsa</italic> are closely intertwined. However, in the last part of his article, Davis asserts that Yudhishthira considers this <italic>dharma</italic> of <italic>ahimsa</italic> to be inadequate for kings. Kings and other members of the ranks of the <italic>kshatriyas</italic> have to have recourse to violence to maintain order in society. <italic>Ahimsa</italic> is good for gods, sages and Brahmins, but not for kings, concludes Davis, comparing the intervention of the heavenly priest with a lecture of a pacifist on the ethics of non-violence to soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812460141">Davis, 2008</xref>: 154–155). Brihaspati seems to be out of place here. However, I doubt whether Davis is right, as, earlier in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>, Vidura and Bhishma also refer to the Golden Rule as a form of <italic>ahimsa</italic> for kings (<italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57; <italic>Shanti Parvan</italic> 279.23). This suggests that what is taught by Brihaspati is not out of place, but very common and at least in agreement with the lessons of other prominent individuals in this epic. In my view it is therefore necessary to think of another interpretation, which probably is more adequate as it does justice to all the places in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> that include the Golden Rule. The concept of <italic>ahimsa</italic> must most likely be conceived more broadly, not only as meaning refraining from harming other people or from using violence against others, but also as initiating a longer process, of which the outcome will be the prevention of a bloody war. This form of <italic>ahimsa</italic> is not only a possibility for kings, it is even repeatedly advised in this great epic.</p>

<title>Conclusion: The Lesson of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> for Christians</title>
<p>It is time to consider what the verses of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> and those of Matthew and Luke which include the Golden Rule have to say, and to ask what the Hindu texts may suggest to Christians, when they attempt to interpret the Golden Rule in their own scriptures.</p>
<p>First, however, I would like to warn against a certain pitfall. The attentive reader may already have observed that all formulations of the Golden Rule in the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> were negative, whereas the phrasings of the Golden Rule in Matthew and Luke were positive. So the suggestion seems to be natural that, according to these two gospels, Jesus had interpreted the Golden Rule in a way that was superior to that of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>, since his formulation was positive and therefore more radical than those of the greatest epic of India. This can be taken – and is sometimes taken – as another proof of Jesus’ superiority over Hinduism.</p>
<p>It is this interpretation that made me warn, above, not to use texts of another tradition as tools for showing that the formulations and meanings of one’s own tradition are superior. I prefer interpretations that unsettle the normative understandings of Christians.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wish to point to the fact that in Matthew’s version, the Golden Rule ‘sums up the Law and the Prophets,’ while in <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> 39.57 and <italic>Anushasana Parvan</italic> 114.8, the maxim is defined as a summary of moral duty. In both stanzas, moral duty is a translation of <italic>dharma</italic>. So, in both the Christian and the Hindu traditions, the idea is that this rule reflects an essential attitude articulating the core of their own ethical tradition, even though this maxim does not receive much attention in Hindu commentaries.</p>
<p>The <italic>Mahabharata</italic> teaches that the Golden Rule is part and parcel of an attitude in which kings attempt to implement the concept of <italic>ahimsa</italic>. So <italic>ahimsa</italic> conveys the perspective from which the Golden Rule has to be fulfilled. This means that the Golden Rule has everything to do with peace making, and, as the Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin (1922–1995) once explained: ‘One does not make peace with one’s friends. One makes peace with one’s enemy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008429812460141">Pipes, 2009</xref>). This seems to tie in with the message about the Golden Rule in Luke 6:31, where this maxim is preceded as well as succeeded by the appeal to love one’s enemies. It may even be possible to regard the way the Golden Rule is used, in particular in the <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic>, as a kind of implementation of the maxim in Luke, for in this part of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> the Golden Rule is used as a strategy to create peace. At first sight, it is love and superabundance that are important, not justice or reciprocity. This superabundance is, moreover, not directed towards one’s friends, but towards enemies. It will be no surprise that this interpretation unsettles Christians more than if the emphasis had been on Mattthew 7:12, for in this gospel the stress is more on justice and reciprocity.</p>
<p>But, on second sight, things may become different. In the previous paragraph I already pointed out that in the <italic>Udyoga Parvan</italic> the Golden Rule is developed into a strategy for making peace. One of the most important aspects of this strategy is the element of reciprocity in the Golden Rule. For the Golden Rule appears in a lecture in which Vidura tries to persuade King Dhritarashtra to make a last attempt to prevent the outbreak of war. Vidura advises the monarch to grant the Pandavas at least five villages, because if the Kauravas give five villages to their enemies, the Pandava brothers will be prepared to start new negotiations and rescind their plans for war. If one makes conciliatory gestures, one does so because one hopes that they will challenge the other to do something similar. In other words, despite the emphasis on love, the idea of justice or reciprocity has not completely faded away. Vidura, moreover, does not ask the Kauravas to give half of the kingdom. He asks them to give only five villages. This may be sufficient for entering, if they do so, into a new process, of which the outcome can result in peace. This outcome will be attained by a probably lengthy process of reciprocity, not through revenge, but by giving, by acting positively time and again, hoping that in this manner a horrible massacre will be prevented.</p>
<p>In this way it is possible to regard the Hindu versions of the Golden Rule as illustrations of the Christian ones. But perhaps these Hindu renditions do more than just give illustrations, since they also show that it may be possible to implement the Golden Rule in the practice of daily life. On the other hand, it must be admitted that, in the end, King Dhritarashtra declined to take Vidura’s advice. But after the massacre the Golden Rule was taught again, now to Yudhishthira, who, before the bloodshed, had already shown that he was different by proposing that there would be no war, if he and his brothers got only five villages, and who was known as a person wholly dedicated to the <italic>dharma</italic>, of which the Golden Rule was considered to be a summary. Thus the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> teaches that there are also kings who differ from King Dhritarashtra. Consequently it is not completely impossible to follow this maxim in the practice of daily life. It is feasible to do so, even if the maxim is provided in the context of Luke, a context determined by an appeal to love one’s enemies, something which many people – among them also many Christians – still consider to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. The <italic>Mahabharata</italic> may help them to overcome their hesitations or even unbelief.</p>

<title>Epilogue</title>
<p>It is my hope that this article fills the gap opened up by the lack of attention to the Hindu versions of the Golden Rule. Moreover, I hope that by now the readership has discovered how fruitful it can be to carefully examine the interpretations and contexts of the Golden Rule in another religious tradition for interpreting the same maxim in one’s own tradition: it helps them to discover completely new meanings but sometimes also to rediscover old meanings in the texts belonging to their own tradition.</p>
<p>In March 1990, Mrs Gedong Bagoes Oka (1921–2002), a Balinese Hindu woman leading an ashram on the Indonesian island of Bali, visited a Bible group in a Protestant congregation in Heemskerk in the Netherlands. The group members were studying the Sermon on the Mount as found in Matthew 5–7. Because of her having stayed in a Christian environment in the 1930s, Mrs Oka was well-versed in the Bible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429812460141">Bakker, 1993</xref>: 195–201). When the group discussed the possibility of really implementing this sermon, some people present were of the persuasion that it was impossible. Then Mrs Oka pointed to the fact that the Lord’s Prayer, which Jesus taught to his disciples, was placed exactly in the heart of this preaching, thus indicating that prayer and meditation must be at the centre of the life of someone living according to the principles of this text. The participants in this group were impressed: a Hindu woman had opened up a dimension of the Sermon on the Mount that they had not seen before. There was more, however: they could not deny that the circumstance that a Hindu person had opened their minds to this dimension had given their meeting something extra. They had a strong feeling that it was only natural that she – as someone belonging to a religion with much emphasis on meditation – had shown them this new, enriching insight. It helped to promote the dialogue of this evening, which because of her presence had turned into an interreligious one.</p>
<p>What occurred in this meeting makes clear that in the context of an interreligious dialogue the novelty of some understandings is less important than the perception of the typical character of the religious background of the other. For, if one is exposed to this heritage, one perceives the profoundness of the other’s religious tradition and this will stimulate one’s curiosity and therefore also one’s ardour to continue the dialogue, because one will be eager to perceive more enriching insights coming from that other tradition.</p>
<p>This is exactly what both the representatives of the revised Comparative Theology and the practitioners of hermeneutical hospitality aim at, and, hopefully, the readers of this article have experienced something similar, that is, realizing how the Golden Rule within the Hindu tradition is coloured by its context of non-violence may affect the interpretation of the same maxim in the Christian tradition. Moyaert, moreover, argues that interpreting the texts of one’s own religious tradition after having taken notice of the message of similar texts in other religious traditions stimulates the creativity of theologians, which is demonstrated in the publications of Clooney, Fredericks and other scholars practising this form of theology.<sup>

<p>This is also the case in one of Karen Armstrong’s last publications, the book entitled <italic>Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life</italic>. In this book she does not pay explicit attention to the Golden Rule in Hinduism; she solely addresses the explanations of this maxim in Confucianism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Christianity.</p>

<p>Philippidis refers to passages found in other, mostly philosophical texts, but he adds that he only read them in a German translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008429812460141">Philippidis, 1929</xref>: 76). He mentions the <italic>Bhagavad Gita</italic> among them, but it is certain that this text does not include the Golden Rule. So it is improbable that he is right. J.O. Hertzler asserts that the maxim is found already in the Upanishads, but the note supporting this statement refers to the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008429812460141">Hertzler, 1934</xref>: 420).</p>

<p>There are various ways used to count the verses of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic>. This article is predominantly based on the Mahābhārata Electronic text (C) of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune, India, 1999, which is based on the text that Muneo Tokunaga et al. introduced and that is revised by John Smith from Cambridge. The same text is used in the English translation of the <italic>Mahabharata</italic> made by J.A.B. van Buitenen and since continued by James L. Fitzgerald. Sometimes it was impossible to use this text. In that case the textual edition of Ramachandrashastri Kinjawadekar is used.</p>

<p>Clooney himself calls his method Comparative Theology, but Hugh Nicholson rightly pointed out that the approach of Clooney and Fredericks differs so fundamentally from the comparative theology that had its pinnacle in the 19th century that it is more appropriate to call their form of theology New Comparative Theology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429812460141">Nicholson, 2009</xref>). But perhaps it is better to speak about ‘Revised Comparative Theology,’ since every ‘new’ theology will become ‘old’ in the course of time.</p>

<p>In fact, Moyaert speaks of ‘linguistic flexibility’ and of a language that inevitably changes.

<p>Jonathan Z. Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008429812460141">Smith, 1982</xref>: xiii) already touched on this phenomenon when he referred to the concept of ‘defamiliarization’ developed by the Russian scholar Victor Shklovsky. Defamiliarization means making the familiar seem strange in order to enhance our perception of the familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0008429812460141">Shklovsky, 1965</xref>: 12–13).</p>
