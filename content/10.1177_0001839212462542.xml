<p>The truth is under attack. In recent months we heard about Marc Hauser, the famed professor accused of scientific misconduct, who, ironically, studied morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001839212462542">Hauser, 2006</xref>), and Diederik Stapel, the social psychologist suspected of data fabrication, who, incredibly, researched plagiarism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001839212462542">Stapel, Koomen, and Spears, 1999</xref>). Anecdotes aside, systematic research confirms that the truth is besieged. Even in the sciences, which some see as a haven of the scientific method, between 10 and 20 percent of scientists report that “colleagues” fabricated or falsified data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001839212462542">Fanelli, 2009</xref>). Scholarly journals now retract published articles more frequently due to errors and fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001839212462542">Steen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Closer to home, an extensive survey showed that “questionable research practices” are a prevailing norm among psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001839212462542">John, Loewenstein, and Prelec, 2012</xref>). It exposed how common are practices such as the failure to report all of a study’s dependent measures (admitted by roughly two-thirds of respondents), selective reporting of only the results that “worked” (half), and claiming unexpected results as if they were hypothesized all along (one third). They are often executed in good faith, yet such practices can make an entirely false proposition appear true with statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001839212462542">Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn, 2011</xref>). In economics, a Nobel laureate pointed out, a persistent preference for beauty over truth meant that limitations of human rationality, institutions, and markets were neglected, making elegant theories barely predictive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001839212462542">Krugman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of recent events, Nord and Connell’s book is a timely contribution. They remind us of questions that have been debated for at least two millennia: how do we know that we know? What counts as knowledge? And they proceed to discuss them with impressive breadth and frank reflexivity in what may be their most important work to date: part an encyclopedic review, part an intellectual memoir, part a philosophical manifesto.</p>
<p>Mapping the culture wars over the social construction of knowledge, the authors seek via media. Both modern science and post-modernism incorporate a critical approach, they point out, so it may be a starting point for reconciliation. Much as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001839212462542">Hacking (1999)</xref> did, Nord and Connell question the claims on both sides, urging combatants to climb down from the stratosphere of abstraction in which they war. They propose “generative uncertainty” as the realization that we may never be certain of the answers to some fundamental questions, yet we can build “useful patterns” from “regularities of observed phenomena.” Practicing generative uncertainty, they write, will assist in separating assumptions from certainties and maintaining parsimonious theories. Moreover, it can temper the “intense, disruptive controversy about what counts as knowledge” that has “plagued” the study of organizations (p. xix). The authors review the implications of the notion for topics such as the self, other minds, agency, and free will. Generative uncertainty is also relevant to communication: it questions how we can be sure that what we understood is indeed what the sender meant.</p>
<p>Nord and Connell proceed to show how ancient is the debate about what counts as knowledge. Opening their review with Grecian philosophy and ending in contemporary thought, they show that concerns about how we know that we know, or uncertainty about the truth, have recurred. They then turn to criticize what some pejoratively call “scientism”: the belief that science secures a privileged path to the truth. Echoing the claims of social construction, they argue that the desire of “American social scientists” for legitimacy and political gain—not rational or technical considerations—led to the adoption of “the methods and approaches of the natural sciences, especially physics” (p. xxiii). But the authors argue that this legitimacy did not last, as evidenced by the debate about “orthodox science” and the subsequent “breakdown of orthodoxy.”</p>
<p>The following section catalogs some approaches for dealing with the “knowledge controversy.” Each approach in the long list is accompanied by ample quotes, followed by lists of features that “we especially like” and those that “we have problems with.” “Letting Go,” the final section, begins with the authors’ view of what physicists really think of philosophy of science and what they really do. Why physics? Because arguably some of us suffer from “physics envy,” believing that the truth can be discovered and ascertained. The chapter “Letting Go of Agonism” advances a desire and method to reduce “ritual adversativeness”—non-listening, distortion of rival views—behavior that fuels the dysfunctional knowledge controversy, according to the authors. Conveniently, Nord and Connell follow with some advice for improving communication: provide definitions, avoid “quicksand terms,” employ active listening, and consult multiple sources. A final chapter summarizes what the book urges us to do: pay attention to the context of intellectual and institutional processes, recognize the social nature of research, avoid treating certainty as necessary or even attainable, and recognize the philosophical limitations while crediting the achievements of the scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Nord and Connell engage in applied philosophy, bringing to our intellectual home some of the big questions in philosophy of science. For a comprehensive syllabus in research methods, add to it some exemplars of the pro-science view, some on how science is actually practiced (e.g., Bruno Latour), and some on scholarly productivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839212462542">Hirsch, 2005</xref>). But <italic>Rethinking the Knowledge Controversy</italic> is more than a textbook, for it revives old debates that apply to and inform developments in current events. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839212462542">Daft and Lewin (2008</xref>: 178) warned against “creeping parochialism” in journals, in which “focus systematically narrows to reflect the orthodoxies of the community of scholars” around them. People tend to congregate into social clusters, perhaps a result of our evolutionary past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001839212462542">Levine and Kurzban, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001839212462542">Baum (2011)</xref> relied on citation data to trace how sub-communities of scholars arise and proliferate. Although the division is not simply American vs. European, he shows, scholars of the same feather flock toward certain journals and academic departments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001839212462542">1</xref></sup> So grandstanding over theory may be rarer now, but not thanks to better communication, as Nord and Connell hope, but because of <italic>less</italic> communication. Here is why: if a discipline fractures into sub-communities, each associated with certain journals and departments, there is less need to converse with those in the neighboring sub-community. On the upside, less strife makes us feel better, and isolation can lead to experimentation. On the downside, fragmentation can degrade quality and lessen the flow of ideas across scholarly communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001839212462542">March, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the sciences, extreme fragmentation has prompted a novel solution: robotic scientists, which collect data, identify patterns and conclude which are insightful (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001839212462542">King et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001839212462542">Schmidt and Lipson, 2009</xref>). Free from theoretical and disciplinary orthodoxies, artificial scholars may be able to navigate separate literatures and identify novel connections, all without prior knowledge or theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001839212462542">Evans and Rzhetsky, 2010</xref>). It fits with the advance of the “data-harvesting approach,” whose advocates argue that useful findings can arise from the mechanical analysis of troves of data, theory-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001839212462542">Golub, 2010</xref>). The same capacity to collect and analyze massive amounts of data is coming to the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001839212462542">Lazer et al., 2009</xref>), promising a new round of debates about what constitutes the truth.</p>
<p>Nord and Connell are not certain that social scientists have been sincere (or even cognizant) in their adoption of the scientific method. One may see reaffirmation in the recent cases of scientific fraud, the preference for elegant theories, and the frequent replacement of the truth with a hallowed but hollow artifact: statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001839212462542">Starbuck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001839212462542">Ziliak and McCloskey, 2008</xref>). Yet even if we agree that absolute certainty is unachievable, some mechanism is needed to prevent mistaking a fluke for a pattern. The very fact that fraud is exposed, questionable research practices are condemned, and the philosophy of science is debated is a cheerful indicator, because “science is one of the very few human activities—perhaps the only one—in which errors are systematically criticized and fairly often, in time, corrected. This is why we can say that, in science, we often learn from our mistakes, and why we can speak clearly and sensibly about making progress there” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001839212462542">Popper, 1963</xref>: 216).</p>
