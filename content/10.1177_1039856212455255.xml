<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Dr Restifo has done a valuable service documenting patients who failed to obtain remission until a third antidepressant was added to the preceding treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212455255">1</xref></sup> I am sure a significant number of psychiatrists around Australia and overseas, including myself, have had similar experiences.</p>
<p>The title of his article, ‘Walking on thin ice: the use of triple antidepressant combinations in refractory melancholic depression’, is a telling reflection of the combination antidepressant scenario in Australia. In the event of problems arising in patients undergoing such treatment, the opponents of double (or triple) combination antidepressants are seen as likely to endanger the treating doctor. Presumably, doctors using unusual pharmacotherapy, all other treatments having failed often, are trying to help patients, and trying to minimise the danger to these patients.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that some doctors, despite patients having failed to respond adequately to evidence-based treatment, disapprove of colleagues then trying other approaches. Patients are legally and ethically entitled to complete information about the pros and cons of all treatment options. In fact, to withhold globally accepted techniques legally endangers over-cautious doctors, the legal principle being that non-feasance by professionals, or withholding of information, is potentially culpable.</p>
<p>We all wish the best outcome for patients. It should not be a scenario where the danger to patients’ welfare and lives is seen as of secondary importance, compared to the fear of disapproval from some colleagues. Many years ago, none of the multiple psychiatrists in attendance would try intracardiac adrenaline on a young woman who could not be revived by conventional techniques after a cardiac arrest. What if it was a member of your family? Does the Australian community want doctors to put their own (possibly mistaken) medicolegal comfort ahead of the suffering and risk to patients? Who are we protecting from thin ice?</p>
