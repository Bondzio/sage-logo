<abstract>
<p>This article investigates how nanotechnology is presented and framed in Slovenian national newspapers. The focus is on the mass media’s influence on citizens’ perceptions of the social implications of nanotechnological progress. An empirical analysis of newspaper coverage of nanotechnology in Slovenia between 2004 and 2009 suggests that Slovenian newspapers are in an early stage of covering nanotechnology issues since they emphasize the positive aspects and scientific interpretations. Additional in-depth interviews with nanotechnologists reveal considerable dissatisfaction with the level and quality of the media’s reporting of the issue of nanotechnology in Slovenia.</p>

<title>Introduction: The Media on Science and New Technologies</title>
<p>It is hard today to imagine scientific practice without popular accounts of it appearing in the news media. Conversely, when public attitudes to science and technology are being discussed, the mass media and its role in shaping public perceptions of science and technology are seen as very important. The media is “a central institution of modern life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011427974">Antilla, 2010</xref>, p. 241). The media has the function of a forum both reflecting and organizing broad public opinion. Many basic studies emphasize that it is through scientific communication in the media that new emerging technologies reach the public. Generally, studies of media coverage of and public attitudes to new emerging technologies focus on three outcome variables: the dominant frame, general support for the emerging technology, and perception of the risks versus benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011427974">Gaskell, Ten Eyck, Jackson, &amp; Veltri, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011427974">Macoubrie, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A large number of studies have found that when a specific topic receives significant news coverage, that issue increases in priority in the public’s mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547011427974">Christidou, Dimopoulos, &amp; Kouladis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011427974">Hargreaves, Lewis, &amp; Speers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1075547011427974">Zimmerman, Bisanz, Bisanz, Klein, &amp; Klein, 2001</xref>). Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547011427974">Faber (2006)</xref> put it, “Popular media coverage influences the ways the general public and scientists perceive science. In addition, media coverage also influences the ways these groups will perceive new developments in science and technology” (p. 144). A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1075547011427974">Scheufele and Lewenstein (2005)</xref> shows that mass media attention is one of the strongest predictors of attitudes to new technologies such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and so on. Namely, they found that “attention and exposure to science and technology news in newspapers, on television, and on the web had a consistent significant positive impact on attitudes toward technology” (p. 664). It is especially those people with little or no direct experience with science and its applications who receive related information from the media. Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011427974">Goodman and Goodman (2006)</xref> put it, “. . . the media’s selection and emphasis on aspects of an issue define that issue for the public particularly when the public’s level of personal experience with the topic is limited” (p. 361). The printed media is still recognized as a key source of information about science and technology issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547011427974">Bucchi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011427974">Dimopoulos &amp; Koulaidis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547011427974">Hijmans, Pleijter, &amp; Wester, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1075547011427974">Weingart, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although scientific and technological development has become ever more global in nature, science communication activities through the media remain tied to the local context. This is particularly important in the case of newspapers, which are usually situated in specific national contexts. The ways new technologies are represented in newspapers and how this may affect public opinion on science and technology are often shaped exclusively by the national context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1075547011427974">1</xref></sup> Following the argument that “print media in national context seem to offer a more elaborated and thorough view on many topics than do other media” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011427974">Schäfer, 2009</xref>, p. 485), our analysis focuses on Slovenian newspapers as a case of a culturally specific context within which nanotechnology is discussed. The main purpose of our study is to explore the ways national newspapers in Slovenia cover issues on nanotechnology and how scientists in the field of nanotechnology in Slovenia perceive media coverage of these issues. Empirical studies of newspaper coverage of nanotechnology have so far mostly focused on big countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011427974">Anderson, Petersen, Wilkinson, &amp; Allan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011427974">Kulve, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>). Our assumption is that because of their specific national and cultural contexts, cases from small countries such as Slovenia are also interesting.</p>
<p>The article is organized in three sections. In the first section, the article discusses some basic issues of the benefits and risks of the progress of nanotechnology in Slovenia. Nanotechnology has already brought many economic benefits. However, the advance of nanotechnology produces high levels of uncertainty related to health, environmental, ethical, and societal aspects of human life. In this part of our discussion, a caution is offered that, despite the various activities at the European Union (EU) level to create more active “scientific citizenship,” Slovenian R&amp;D policy and legislation largely lag behind in these efforts. Unlike in some other EU countries, in Slovenia not a lot has been done in terms of citizens’ involvement in R&amp;D decision-making processes and the openness of experts to the general public.</p>
<p>In the second section, some general arguments are presented about different aspects of the (national) media coverage of nanotechnology. Certain case studies (the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Germany) are briefly presented to show how media framing of new emerging technologies during the early stages of their public visibility tends to be crucial to (national) publics’ perceptions of these technologies.</p>
<p>The third section discusses newspaper coverage of nanotechnology in Slovenia over time. To identify the intensity of the media coverage of nanotechnology, a content analysis of articles appearing in three key Slovenian newspapers from 2004 to 2009 is made. In addition, to gain a more in-depth view of scientists’ perceptions of media reporting on nanotechnology, semistructured interviews with a small group of selected scientists are also conducted. By employing this approach to the empirical research, our contribution does not limit the research’s scope to mere quantitative parameters (e.g., the number of articles) but invites an analysis of (nano)scientists’ viewpoints on engaging with the mass media in general and the print media in particular in order to gain a brief overview of media coverage of nanotechnology in Slovenia.</p>

<title>The Public’s Role in the Social Regulation of Nanotechnology</title>
<p>Nanotechnology subsumes interdisciplinary fields that have developed over the past two decades at the interface of physics, chemistry, biology, molecular biology, and material science. Although nanotechnology is still partially facing several controversies regarding the definition of its research field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011427974">Allhof &amp; Lin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547011427974">Kurath &amp; Gisler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011427974">Uskokovic, 2007</xref>), it is currently referred to as one of the most promising and innovative niches of modern scientific activity. Discoveries in the area of nanotechnology have opened the door to an entirely new field of innovations in which the possibilities for real-world applications are seemingly endless. From the 1990s onward, research productivity in the field of nanotechnology has practically grown exponentially.</p>
<p>The continuous progress of nanotechnology is also reflected in Slovenia, one of the smallest new EU member states. Already at the end of the 1990s, scientists at the Slovenian Josef Stefan Institute had made an important contribution to the development of nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547011427974">Remskar et al., 2001</xref>). Concerning publications on nanotechnology in the period from 1997 to 1999, with 36 publications per million population Slovenia was ranked 15th on the list of the most productive countries in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2003</xref>, p. 395). It seems that Slovenia has also enjoyed a high rate of growth in the field of nanotechnology in the first decade of the 2000s. For example, with regard to nanomaterials as a specialized subfield of nanotechnology, in Slovenia the absolute numbers of citable articles rose from 87 to 113 from 2000 to 2010 (SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scimagojr.com">http://www.scimagojr.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The progress of nanotechnology has attracted considerable attention in the Slovenian business sector as well. Ten centers of excellence were formed in 2004 as an institutional response to EU-wide efforts to establish stronger cooperation between the academic science and business enterprise sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547011427974">Mali, 2010</xref>). Compared with other centers of excellence in Slovenia, the Centre for Nanotechnology has been very successful in the commercialization of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1075547011427974">2</xref></sup> Unfortunately, although nanotechnology has attracted more attention in formal R&amp;D policy formulations in Slovenia,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1075547011427974">3</xref></sup> and considering the large potential of the convergence of nanotechnology with other new emerging technologies, there is still a lack of organized governmental R&amp;D policy efforts to ensure the more synergetic combination and integration of nanotechnology with biotechnology, information and communication technology, and the cognitive sciences. Orientation to “converging technology,” which refers to the rapidly developing integration of various scientific and technological areas, has not yet found its way to R&amp;D policy discourse in Slovenia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1075547011427974">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The future development of nanotechnology in Slovenia will strongly depend on whether two fundamental challenges are mastered: first, if the translation of scientific results in the field of nanotechnology into marketable products will be constantly ongoing and, second, and much more important, if the public will accept and support greater processes involving the commercialization of nanotechnology. Despite its benefits for economic progress, nanotechnology causes a significant amount of concern in terms of related health, environmental, ethical, and societal risks. Today, it is very important to reconcile the need to develop nanotechnology with the need to protect humans from its possible harmful effects. Although numerous questions have been raised regarding the risks of developing nanotechnology for human dignity, privacy, and security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011427974">Allhof &amp; Lin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547011427974">Doubleday, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1075547011427974">Rodrigues, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1075547011427974">Schütz &amp; Wiedemann, 2008</xref>), experts agree that most of the uncertainty relates to its potential negative health and environmental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011427974">Bawa &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547011427974">Bennett-Woods, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547011427974">Ebbesen, Andersen, &amp; Besenbacher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1075547011427974">Sheetz, Vidal, Pearson, &amp; Lozano, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A new framework for evaluating the risk of nanotechnology is leading to a new dialogue between various interest groups. There is a growing concern among policy decision makers, scientists, and citizens that nanotechnology could provide a target for intense debates about its environmental, health, and other ethical consequences and dangers—analogous to those on biotechnology in the recent past. At the EU level, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547011427974">European Commission in 2005</xref> published “Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An Action Plan for Europe 2005-2009.” More recently, the EU parliament issued a call to ban nanoparticles from food products until their safety is fully established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547011427974">Guere, 2011</xref>). A more systematic legislative approach to nanotechnology at the EU level is expected in 2013. In addition, several projects on communicating nanotechnologies funded by the European Commission have been established to stimulate public debate on the issue (e.g., Nanodialogue, Nanologue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2010a</xref>, “Communicating Nanotechnology”).</p>
<p>Concerning the situation in Slovenia, it is necessary to say that despite these activities at the EU level Slovenian policy and legislation largely lag behind in the rapid development of this field. Notwithstanding this, it is very positive that a discussion of the potential toxic effects of nanoparticles for human health and the environment has been stimulated by the Slovenian Consumers’ Association.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1075547011427974">5</xref></sup> The Slovenian Consumers’ Association is making a list of nanoproducts and informing the public about the presence of nanoparticles in consumer products. Further, scientists in Slovenia have gradually begun to deal with the issue of nanosafety. For example, an extensive report on nanoparticles and nanosafety has been prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1075547011427974">Remskar, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the public interest in nanotechnology is complex and difficult to define, the central assumption of recent public discussions among the various stakeholders interested in nanotechnology is the ability of R&amp;D policy decision makers to acknowledge not only the innovative and economic aspects of advances in nanotechnology but also the wider public attitudes to this new technology.</p>
<p>Recently, cross-national surveys have afforded the opportunity to gain an insight into public perceptions of nanotechnology in individual European countries. Although we have to be careful not to draw too strong conclusions from public polls, in the context of our discussion here it is interesting that the latest Eurobarometer results show that public awareness of nanotechnology is relatively low as suggested by the survey data: More than one half (55%) of Europeans have not heard of nanotechnology, and only around 25% have engaged with it (talked about it or searched for information on the subject), while 20% have only heard of nanotechnology (“Europeans and Biotechnology,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2010b</xref>, p. 22). However, when the question of encouragement for the development of nanotechnology arises, the figures show considerable public support for nanotechnology: Of every 10 EU citizens, 6 support nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2010b</xref>, p. 22). The level of support varies among the countries from 48% to 83%. Slovenia is not among those countries displaying a great deal of support for nanotechnology: Only 52% of respondents strongly agree or agree that nanotechnology should be encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2010b</xref>, p. 23). When looking at these figures, it is evident that nanotechnology is still perceived as a novelty by the public, although it was claimed to be a strategic technology at the beginning of the year 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2010b</xref>, p. 17).</p>
<p>As part of recent rethinking about the public acceptance of new emerging technologies, greater attention has to be focused not just on the issue of how to encourage citizens to participate in public debates about new emerging technologies but also on how they should be more active in R&amp;D policy decision-making processes. Following events involving genetically modified soya and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Europe during the mid-1990s, at least in some Western European countries more innovative, open, and informal public engagement processes for science-related issues have been introduced. In the past two decades, we have witnessed the development of a variety of mechanisms to include the voices of lay citizens in R&amp;D decision-making processes: focus groups, consensus conferences, citizens’ juries, and so on. Each of these forms has its own characteristics, and there is not always necessarily a strong connection between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011427974">Bowman &amp; Hodge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011427974">Futrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547011427974">Kleinman, Powell, Grice, Adrian, &amp; Lobes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547011427974">Kurath &amp; Gisler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547011427974">Macnaghten, Kearnes, &amp; Wynne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1075547011427974">Pidgeon &amp; Rogers-Hayden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547011427974">Rowe &amp; Frewer, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In Slovenia, little has been done regarding citizens’ involvement in R&amp;D decision-making processes and the openness of experts toward the general public. Slovenia is a small country whose transition from a communist to a democratic political system occurred 20 years ago, generally resulting in a very slow improvement in citizens’ participation in different areas of policy making. In Slovenia, civil society played a crucial role in the collapse of communism and the introduction of democratic rule. Numerous civil society groups were subsequently absorbed in the new political elite and in government functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547011427974">Rizman, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, after the new state was established, processes involving the creation of new civil society groups were very slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1075547011427974">Mali, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the science, technology, and society literature, we often encounter three theoretical models describing citizens’ participation in R&amp;D policy decision making. In the autocratic model, R&amp;D decisions are made autocratically by political elites, without the provision of public information concerning their positive and negative impacts on society. In the information model, public information on R&amp;D governance is provided, but there is lack of citizens’ active engagement in the decision-making processes. Finally, in the democratic model, it is assumed that from the very beginning citizens have the opportunity to be involved in R&amp;D decision-making processes that shape the future progress of new emerging technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547011427974">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1075547011427974">Schummer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Slovenian R&amp;D policy decision-making processes have not attained the stage of the democratic model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1075547011427974">6</xref></sup> What is particularly absent is the possibility of citizens engaging in more open bidirectional dialogue with experts about risk assessments of the new emerging technologies. Experts in Slovenia are too often in a position of supreme authority in the risk assessment and risk governance of nanotechnology. We do not advocate the view that R&amp;D policy decision-making processes be simply left to nonexperts, but we believe that the citizens of Slovenia should be assured a more open dialogue with the experts. As expressed by many authors, democracy cannot dominate every domain—that would destroy expertise; and expertise cannot dominate every domain—that would destroy democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547011427974">Collins &amp; Evans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1075547011427974">Weingart, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Media Coverage of Nanotechnology</title>
<p>It is impossible to understand 21st-century nanotechnology without viewing the role of the media seriously. The public acceptance of nanotechnology strongly depends on what is presented about nanotechnology in the mass media. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547011427974">Nelkin (1987)</xref>, “For most people the reality of science is what they read in the press” (p. 2). The mass media’s significance in shaping public views and starting a discussion on nanotechnology has been acknowledged in several recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011427974">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547011427974">Ho, Scheufele, &amp; Corley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011427974">Kulve, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011427974">Petersen, Anderson, Allan, &amp;Wilkinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1075547011427974">Scheufele &amp; Lewenstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>). It is often argued that in the case of new emerging technologies, along with their uncertain nature and implications, the question of media framing of issues during the early stages of their public visibility tends to be crucial to public perceptions of these technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011427974">Petersen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand how culturally specific contexts influence the shaping of public views by the mass media, more case studies in the national context are needed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1075547011427974">7</xref></sup> Indeed, several studies of news media coverage of new emerging technologies in different national contexts have been made already. They demonstrate that European newspaper coverage of new emerging technologies is complex and not necessarily ubiquitous. Let us briefly consider some of these national case studies.</p>
<p>An empirical analysis of Dutch newspapers showed that their representations of new emerging technologies over the past few decades included not only scientific contexts but also broader social and ethical views as well as discussions about risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011427974">Kulve, 2006</xref>). Analysis in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>) and in Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547011427974">Anderson, Allan, Petersen, &amp; Wilkinson, 2005</xref>) showed that only a few years ago opinion-making newspapers started offering a huge number of articles about nanotechnology. A case study from Italy showed that in four Italian national newspapers (<italic>Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, La Stampa</italic>, and <italic>Il Sole24 ore</italic>) news stories about nanotechnology had predominantly been framed as stories of progress. In the news, there was mostly an absence of frames referring to the risks of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011427974">Arnaldi, 2008</xref>). A case study that analyzed the Spanish national press coverage (<italic>El Pais, El Mundo</italic>, and <italic>ABC</italic>) to determine which issues are associated with nanotechnology found an overall positive interpretation of new technology. Risk discourse that was present in the early years has become more and more marginal over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1075547011427974">Veltri &amp; Crescentini, 2010</xref>). Unlike in Italy or Spain, some empirical analyses in Germany showed that already from 1990 onward the leading German newspapers paid attention not only to the scientific and economic implications of the new emerging technologies but also to the related social, ethical, and legal aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1075547011427974">Weingart Salzmann, &amp; Wormann, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Media discussions of nanotechnology currently involve ever more hype. For instance, many advanced forms of foreseeable surveillance nanotechnologies do not exist yet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1075547011427974">8</xref></sup> Therefore, separating rhetorical hype from realistic expectations continues to remain a challenge.</p>
<p>In any case, the impact of the news media has tended to be crucial to shaping public discourse about nanotechnology when framing the debate on the benefits and risks. These processes may also be referred to as “the agenda-setting or priming powers of the media” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011427974">Antilla, 2010</xref>, p. 241). The concept of framing has been intensively investigated in several studies; however, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547011427974">Kohring and Matthes (2002)</xref> note, “The term still lacks a clear definition—sometimes frames are understood as a characteristic of a text, sometimes like cognitive structures (cognitive maps) of journalists or recipients” (p. 144). One reason for this might be that there are several factors that constitute a particular frame. For example, in the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard’s (2010)</xref> analysis of newspaper reporting on nanotechnology in Denmark, the frames can be identified in relation to the character of the headlines and subheads, the selection of sources and quotes, or identification of the newspaper section. In general, as noted in the introduction, the focus of the analysis of media coverage of emerging technologies and public attitudes to them is usually based on three variables: the dominant frame, general support for the emerging technology, and perception of the risks versus benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>). The importance of framing is recognized in the impact the framed issues in news reports have on the public’s understanding of those particular issues. In the case of nanotechnology as a new emerging technology, news framing can have a considerable influence on public attitudes and opinions. Some analysts take a more guarded view of this media effect by arguing that we can only estimate the possible impact of science in the media on public opinion since “we actually do not know if the information given by the media has any effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010</xref>, p. 82). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1075547011427974">Scheufele and Tewksbury (2007)</xref> conceptualize framing as an assumption about the influence of issue characterization in news reports on “how it is understood by audiences” (p. 11). Nevertheless, it cannot be ignored that also within the agenda-setting concept the main idea is that “there is a strong correlation between the emphasis that mass media place on certain issues (e.g. based on relative placement or amount of coverage) and the importance attributed to these issues by mass audiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1075547011427974">Scheufele &amp; Tewksbury, 2007</xref>, p. 11).</p>

<title>Newspaper Coverage of Nanotechnology in Slovenia</title>
<p>Considering the Slovenian national context, it can be argued that the field of science and technology is still poorly represented in Slovenian print media. An analysis of coverage of science and technology topics by daily newspapers after 2008 indicates an extremely low percentage of articles related to science, research, and education (less than 5%); among the six newspapers analyzed, only three (<italic>Delo, Dnevnik</italic>, and <italic>Vecer</italic>) had covered news from this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011427974">Mediana, 2009</xref>, p. 51). It is important to note in this context that the practice of providing special science section pages or pages devoted to science news in Slovenian daily newspapers is not very common. Only one has a four-page weekly edition specially focused on science and technology issues (since 1986, <italic>Delo</italic> has been publishing a science section).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1075547011427974">9</xref></sup> Based on this information, it could be argued that Slovenian newspapers are not very interested in covering these issues.</p>
<p>To survey the more specific issue of the coverage of nanotechnology in the main Slovenian newspapers, as a basis for our empirical analysis we considered reporting on nanotechnology in three daily newspapers, <italic>Delo, Dnevnik</italic>, and <italic>Slovenske novice</italic>, between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1075547011427974">10</xref></sup> The selection of these national newspapers followed two criteria: first, their broad readership and, second, their national outreach as indicated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547011427974">“National Research of the Most Readable Media” (2009)</xref>. The analysis focuses on the period that may perhaps be considered as the time in which nanotechnology emerged as a public issue in Slovenia. Namely, in 2004 the Centre for Nanotechnology was established, and a key science policy document called “The National Research and Development Programme for the 2006-2010 Period” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011427974">Republic of Slovenia, Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology, 2005</xref>) declared nanotechnologies as one of the research priorities. We were interested in how various aspects of nanotechnology were conveyed by the Slovenian press in that period.</p>
<sec id="section5-1075547011427974">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The content analysis was based on searching for relevant articles in publicly available electronic archives of each newspaper using the keyword <italic>nanotechnology</italic> or <italic>nanotechnologies</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1075547011427974">11</xref></sup> With these keywords, the online archives of <italic>Delo, Dnevnik</italic> and <italic>Slovenske novice</italic> were scanned. Subsequently, only articles that contained a concrete reference to nanotechnology were selected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1075547011427974">12</xref></sup> Composed in this way, the sample consisted of 73 articles derived from the three newspapers. Each article was then analyzed using a coding schedule that recorded quantitative details, including the name of the newspaper, date, headline, page number, author, newspaper section, and if any sources were cited or referred to. We also noted qualitative aspects of the data. Each article was coded for its leading “frame” with the assistance of a schedule developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011427974">Schäfer (2009</xref>) for his analysis of news media frames of three topics (stem cell research, human genome research, and neutrino research) in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1075547011427974">13</xref></sup> In our analysis of newspaper reporting on nanotechnology in Slovenia, we found that four basic frames—scientific, political, economic, and ELSI (ethical, legal, and social)—were useful since they applied to different research fields and fit the purpose of our research. The “tone” of the article was determined from the public’s viewpoint: Would the article alarm me (negative), comfort me (positive), or do neither (neutral) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011427974">Goodman &amp; Goodman, 2006</xref>)? It is important to note that the frames and tones of the articles are a matter of subjective judgment and interpretation. Keeping this in mind, an intercoder reliability check was conducted for these two most subjective variables in the analysis (by the first author and a trained PhD student) of a random sample (25%, <italic>n</italic> = <italic>18</italic>) of the articles. Using Krippendorf’s alpha, we found an intercoder reliability of .75 for the dominant frame and .83 for the dominant tone of reporting. These data provided us with comprehensive information about the print media’s attention to nanotechnology during the entire period under investigation.</p>
<p>To investigate more dimensions of media reporting on nanotechnology, in-depth interviews were conducted, focusing on scientists’ perceptions of current media coverage of nanotechnology and the media’s role regarding public knowledge of nanotechnology. We explored their views via semistructured interviews conducted in October 2010 with 8 Slovenian experts and scientists who had been identified as authors or coauthors of articles in the popular press (or, to be precise, in editions of <italic>Delo</italic>, since most of them have been published there). Altogether, 11 scientists and experts were approached by an invitation letter and phone call for participation in our survey; however, only 8 expressed their willingness to collaborate. The interviews of the experts and scientists lasted from 30 to 45 minutes, since the semistructured format allowed further questions based on their responses. The questions pertained to their evaluation of media reporting on nanotechnology (the quality and intensity of reporting, also in comparison with other foreign daily newspapers), how they estimated the level of public understanding of nanotechnology (its relevance to developments in this field, the potential media impact on public opinion on this matter), and their own experiences with media engagement. All interviews were recorded and later transcribed so that the key issues could be identified more easily. The analysis of the transcripts was done on several levels. Perceptions of scientists were later assessed (e.g., how each scientist evaluated the quality and intensity of reporting on nanotechnology in the Slovenian press), as were explanations of these perceptions (what were the main reasons for the current state of the art and suggestions to change it, etc.).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Looking at the results of our empirical analysis, it is interesting that the number of articles on nanotechnology in the 6-year period was extremely low (only 73 articles), even if we take those with no direct relevance to the field into account. This means that, over the entire period, there were an average of 12 relevant articles on nanotechnology in all three newspapers per year. Hence, nanotechnology is a poorly covered science issue in the Slovenian print media,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1075547011427974">14</xref></sup> even though the number of articles has more or less increased after 2004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1075547011427974">Figure 1</xref>). This is partially in accordance with the situation in Western European countries and the United States. Empirical analyses in those countries show that the number of articles on nanotechnology began to increase from the end of the 1990s onward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011427974">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547011427974">Bennett &amp; Sarewitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011427974">Kulve, 2006</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We find that the coverage of nanotechnology has been variable over the years. Media attention to nanotechnology began to grow around 2006. Yet the reverse trend in <italic>Slovenske novice</italic> (the number of articles on nanotechnology decreased) must be seen in perspective. The share of science-related articles in this newspaper is relatively small, focusing more on sensational news. In general, coverage in this newspaper is more focused on everyday events in Slovenia and the most notable news from around the world (crime news, political affairs, scandals, etc.).</p>
<p>Most of the articles on nanotechnology were identified in <italic>Delo</italic> (78.1%); in the two other newspapers, coverage of this subject was minimal (<italic>Dnevnik</italic> 13.7% and <italic>Slovenske novice</italic> 8.2%). The concentration of coverage by <italic>Delo</italic> (especially in its science edition, which published more than a quarter [29%] of all articles on nanotechnology), as an “elite” daily newspaper, means that the field’s visibility has largely been restricted to readers of this newspaper, which may account for the low level of recognition of nanotechnology noted by the Eurobarometer surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011427974">European Commission, 2010b</xref>). Other articles were dispersed through different sections of the three newspapers. Most articles about nanotechnology in <italic>Slovenske novice</italic> were found within the section usually reserved for more alternative topics (astrology, alternative medicine, obscure themes, etc.). In <italic>Dnevnik</italic>, articles on nanotechnology were dispersed in seven sections (daily events, business news, etc.). These results of our analysis led us to conclude that the distribution of these articles in the main Slovenian newspapers is very pluralist. Notwithstanding this, their relatively high concentration within the science section indicates that the debate on nanotechnology is largely scientifically dominated. The data revealing scientists and experts as sources of information support our assumption. Namely, scientists and experts were quoted or cited as sources almost across the entire sample of articles (94.5%).</p>
<p>Journalists were typically the authors of the articles (60.3%). Scientists and experts were the authors of a little more than one quarter of the articles (27.4%). For the remaining 12.3% of articles, we could not identify whether the authors were journalists or experts. Most of the articles written by scientists or experts were found in <italic>Delo</italic> or, to be more precise, in its weekly editions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1075547011427974">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>One could say that in the main Slovenian newspapers there is a relatively high presence of scientists as authors of articles on nanotechnology (not simply as sources of information). This does mean that there is some desire among members of the scientific community in Slovenia to present their scientific field to larger audiences. Studies in other countries found similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011427974">Bucchi &amp; Mazzolini, 2003</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011427974">Hargreaves et al. (2003)</xref> noted that while scientists might be more comfortable with the stories told by specialists, there is a danger of losing journalistic and audience interest. From this point of view, it seems important for nanotechnology to become part of a more general discussion also covered by journalists, leaving scientific debate to the domain of scholarly journals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when looking at the results of the dominant frame of press coverage of nanotechnology, we found that a large proportion of the articles featured a scientific frame (91.8%), which indicates strong news interest in scientific implications and interpretations of nanotechnology (i.e., the articles have concerned scientific facts or interpreted the research in scientific terms). In addition, this indicates that nanotechnology in Slovenia seems to be in an early stage of coverage. Apart from scientific interpretations, the economic frame was dominant in just 5.5% of articles. Political (2.7%) interpretation was minor, while the ELSI frame was not identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1075547011427974">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In general, articles on science and technology as well as nanotechnology rarely find a place on the first page of Slovenian newspapers, although a clear majority of the articles referred to the national context (48%), meaning that the articles most frequently contained information on the R&amp;D activity of Slovenian research groups and centers in the field of nanotechnology (also in combination with other emerging technologies) and on their breakthroughs in this field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1075547011427974">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Looking across all of the coverage in the period, we found that positive aspects and consequences of developments in nanotechnology received more extensive coverage than possible negative consequences. The tone of reporting was determined from the public’s viewpoint following questions concerning whether the article would alarm (exposing negative consequences and risks), comfort (highlighting positive aspects and benefits), or do neither (neutral). In some cases, the tone was already evident from the headline of the article. The following examples are headlines from some of the coded articles: Headlines like “Exciting Opportunities for the Fight Against Incurable Diseases” (<italic>Delo</italic>, September 22, 2005, p. 18), “When Old Theories Do Not Work” (<italic>Delo</italic>, October 25, 2007, p. 20), and “With Nanotechnology to Drinking Water” (<italic>Dnevnik</italic>, March 9, 2009) already indicate a positive tone, while headlines like “Magical Nanoparticles Can Be Dangerous” (<italic>Delo</italic>, June 1, 2006, p. 25), “Nobody Knows What It Brings” (<italic>Slovenske novice</italic>, September 8, 2006, p. 15), and “So Small That Nothing Can Stop Them” (<italic>Slovenske novice</italic>, August 25, 2006, p. 15) lead to a negative tone of reporting. There were only a few examples of such headlines; otherwise, to identify the tone the whole content of the articles was analyzed. In general, most of the articles exposing a negative tone were found in <italic>Slovenske novice</italic>, a tabloid newspaper that focuses on sensational news. The other two newspapers report on nanotechnology mostly in a positive or neutral tone. In sum, the coverage of nanotechnology has been relatively positive in tone and optimistic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1075547011427974">16</xref></sup> It is interesting that reports of negative aspects and possible risks of nanotechnologies were made by journalists and (to a small extent) by scientists as authors and also as sources of information. This indicates the socially responsible work of some Slovenian nanotechnologists when they inform the public about the possible negative consequences of developments in the nanotechnology field.</p>
<p>With our analysis of newspaper coverage, we identified some questions to be further explored. Therefore, the next step in our empirical research was to investigate how scientists perceive the media and interact with it and how they see the role of the media in contributing to public knowledge on nanotechnology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1075547011427974">17</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547011427974">Petersen et al. (2009)</xref> argue, scientists’ perceptions of the role of the press may reflect different assumptions about the nature of science and the role of scientists, about the public’s role and knowledge, and about the media’s influence in forming public opinion. Based on many earlier studies on science communication, it is widely recognized that scientists often criticize media reporting of scientific issues. However, although scientists often blame the media for “misrepresenting nanotechnologies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011427974">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>), they have become increasingly aware of the significance of collaborating with science journalists either from the point of view of the scientist’s visibility” or in terms of creating more opportunities to gain financial resources (Gregory &amp; Miller, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1075547011427974">Weingart et al., 2008</xref>). Yet the opposite is also true: The importance of cooperation and communication with top scientists is also recognized by science journalists. Due to the complexity of new emerging technologies, they are always searching for expert explanations and opinions. However, the communication of research results through the mass media is important to both sides, namely, journalists and scientific specialists. The respondents in our empirical research expressed similar views on practices of popularizing science in the mass media. Most of the scientists we interviewed believe that the intensity of media reporting on nanotechnology in Slovenia is relatively low. Some ascribe this to the complex and uncertain nature of the topic, which has to be delivered to the broad public after a lot of consideration. As one respondent noted,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is important—as shown in similar cases in the past (like biotech and other new technologies)—that information on nanotechnology is disseminated to the wider public very carefully, thoughtfully, and based on expert findings so as not to give the wrong message about nanotechnology based on only partial information. Positive and negative effects of nanotechnology have to be presented to the public with due consideration and with an expert background, without inaccurate data, sensationalism, etc.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This concern seems to be in place when looking at data from recent American surveys on public attitudes to nanotechnology-based medical applications and physical enhancements that show increased support for technology when the public is informed about both the risks and the benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1075547011427974">Science Daily, 2010</xref>). A number of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the Slovenian media focusing merely on the positive aspects of nanotechnology. According to one respondent, this is parallel to the proportion of investments made in nanotechnology research, where currently “too little research attention is devoted to nanotoxicology.” Indeed, many agreed that at the moment there are not enough data on risks to human health and the environment. In this context, a radically different opinion was expressed by one scientist that, because the negative effects of nanotechnology are not yet well-defined, too much media attention to this field of development could lead to unnecessary public panic and fears about nanotechnology. The respondents are clearly against sensational reporting of nanotechnology and other fields of research as well. In general, most of the experts feel that media reporting on nanotechnology does not differ much from reporting on other science and technology topics. Nanotechnology seems to share the same marginal position as other research fields when it comes to competing for media space. In addition, some of the scientists interviewed expressed a critical observation that some of the blame for the poor media coverage of science and technology in general also lies with Slovenian journalists, who are presumably scientifically illiterate (it was argued that they often lack sufficient knowledge of science and technology issues and consequently do not know how to ask the appropriate questions). When asked how to improve this clearly detrimental situation, the suggestion was that Slovenian science journalism follow the example of reporting practices from foreign news production houses (e.g., <italic>BBC, New York Times, Spiegel</italic>), where former researchers who only later become reporters cover the fields of science and technology.</p>
<p>When our respondents were asked to estimate the Slovenian media’s role in contributing to public understanding of science and technology, several answered that public debate on nanotechnology has not yet developed in Slovenia. The problem seems to be on the societal level, with one respondent arguing that “it is hard to expect that public debate will develop in Slovenia since we derive from a distinctive political system where having an opinion is not a virtue.” When asked if they thought that the general public is sufficiently well-informed about nanotechnology, the prevalent answer was negative. The concern about the level of public understanding of nanotechnology applied to safety issues (since nanoproducts are largely available in the market). As one respondent pointed out, “At the moment nobody in the whole world really knows what real risks nanotechnology could involve and which possible negative effects development in this field could bring.” The main suggestion from the nanoscientists interviewed in Slovenia was that the public should be informed about nanotechnology so as to enable them to make critical decisions regarding the use of nanoproducts. Conversely, they expressed the opinion that the field of nanotechnology is often so vast and changes in this field happen so rapidly that it is impossible to expect the public to completely understand it. The above statements clearly suggest that the respondents view the public’s role in a relatively simplistic way: The public should be informed about nanotechnology to the extent that it enables people to decide on situations in their everyday lives. There is no sign of any suggestion about public participation in R&amp;D policy decision-making processes. However, the respondents were aware that the media’s effect on public opinion should not be ignored. Yet they agreed with the statement that most scientists working in the area of new emerging technologies in Slovenia are not successful in popularizing their work and communicating it to the media. Let us quote one of the respondents:</p>

<p>From the researcher’s point of view, collaboration with the media represents a big burden which has to be regarded as duty. Popularization takes a lot of time, and it has to be learnt to do it properly, and since nanotechnology is a rapidly developing field, it is not surprising that popularization is at the bottom of the list of duties.</p>

<p>The respondents’ answers allow us to conclude that nanoscientists in Slovenia lack more considered communication with the broad public. As indicated in the first part of the article, they are quite successful in their professional field (number of citable publications, cooperation with business enterprise centers, etc.), but they lag behind the recent trends in new forms of scientific communication.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our article began by stressing the mass media’s importance for the public and for conducting scientific practice. The case of nanotechnology as a new and promising technology was discussed by presenting theoretical and empirical aspects of this emerging technology. Describing the prevailing situation regarding the presence and awareness of nanotechnology in Slovenia, the study focused on exploring the ways national newspapers in a small country cover issues of nanotechnology and how scientists perceive media coverage of this issue. It was found that little is still known about scientists’ perceptions and interactions with the media in Slovenia.</p>
<p>Our starting assumption was that daily newspapers represent one of the main sources of information on scientific research and technological development. In the context of our empirical analysis, we concluded that nanotechnology is poorly represented in Slovenian newspapers. This could also be related to the notion that nanotechnology is not well-known among the Slovenian public. However, considering the limitations of our survey (the temporal choice of articles, the small number of articles and interviews), it is difficult to draw conclusions about media coverage of science and technology issues in general. Indeed, we sought to restrict ourselves to the issue of how nanotechnology is communicated and framed in the Slovenian print media. The empirical data revealed a mixed picture of newspaper coverage of nanotechnology: A significant proportion of articles were identified in science section coverage, but in general the articles were dispersed across different sections of the newspapers and merely emphasized positive aspects of nanotechnology. Yet the overall impression was that news concerning this area receives an insufficient amount of media attention. The same observation was made by scientists and experts working in the field of nanotechnology, who, besides the newspaper content analysis, also provided some provisional insights into scientists’ perceptions of media reporting on nanotechnology and their views on public knowledge of this rapidly developing area. In general, their responses reflect considerable dissatisfaction with the level and quality of media reporting on nanotechnology, although many recognized the significance of public acceptance of this field of research and the impact the media has in informing the public and shaping public opinion. In our interviews, a number of scientists mentioned the lack of public understanding of nanotechnology, which could be problematic as many nanoproducts are already on the market. Moreover, the analysis of the interviews demonstrated that scientists’ perspectives about media coverage of nanotechnology and their willingness to contribute to public debates must be considered in the context of more general attitudes to the popularization of their work and the presence of this topic in daily newspapers. This is also related to their perception of their profession, since none of them identified themselves as nanotechnologists (they were mostly physicists, chemists, and biologists). Nanotechnology seems to be still a novelty not just among the public but also within Slovenian scientific practice, partly due to the fact that this emerging technology is significantly converging with other research fields and hence in Slovenia has not yet received the status of a scientific discipline. This state of the art is also reflected in the dispersed nature of news media reports on nanotechnology. However, despite the aforementioned limitation, the findings reached here offer important empirical insights into media representation of an emerging technology in a small country like Slovenia and thus are worthy of being expanded in further research on this issue that would include a larger sample of scientists and experts directly or indirectly working in the field of nanotechnology.</p>

<p>Let us take an example from another new emerging technology, biotechnology. The intensity with which the debate on stem cell research has been carried out in German newspapers can be explained by the country’s particular sensitivity about its past. Namely, references to Nazi crimes in connection with eugenics are more frequent in German newspapers than in other European countries’ newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1075547011427974">Weingart, Salzmann, &amp; Wörmann, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>At the moment, nanotechnology is not defined in the Classification System of Scientific Disciplines at the Slovenian Research Agency. This means that this classification system still follows the traditional academic division of the scientific field. The same problem is found with professional titles, although since 2001 the Josef Stefan International Postgraduate School has had a special study program, Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies, and produced the first graduates in this field.</p>

<p>There are some rare examples of the direct involvement of citizens in decision-making or advisory structures (e.g., the Science and Technology Council, where there is one representative of the general public), but public/citizen involvement in such a structure is more or less formal in nature and does not involve any real contributions or realizations of their potential interests and demands regarding R&amp;D issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1075547011427974">Sorcan, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>In this type of analysis, there is a need to follow the concept of the “circuit of mass communication,” used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011427974">Schmidt Kjærgaard (2010)</xref>. In this model, the process of scientific communication is seen as a multidirectional circuit where newspaper reporting not only influences political decisions, popular understandings, and public opinions on science but is constantly influenced by political agendas, public opinion, social values, decision makers, and so on.</p>

<p><italic>Delo</italic> can be characterized as an “elite,” opinion-leading newspaper, influencing the national news agenda with a circulation of more than 55,000. On the political scale, some people would place it among the left-leaning papers, along with other daily newspapers like <italic>Dnevnik, Vecer, Slovenske novice</italic>, and so on. Some argue that no right-oriented daily newspaper can be identified in Slovenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011427974">Car, 2010</xref>), largely due to the fact that the biggest Slovenian newspaper publishers were established during the communist regime and are still somewhat connected with the left political option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547011427974">Adam, Makarovic, Tomsic, &amp; Lah, 2006</xref>). <italic>Slovenske novice</italic> can be defined as a tabloid newspaper. It is included in our analysis because of its high circulation (more than 78,000); as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547011427974">Anderson et al. (2005)</xref> stated, “Although it is unusual in studies of the news media to include tabloid coverage that is not regarded as ‘opinion-leading,’ in our view the high circulation rates of these newspapers warranted their inclusion within the sample” (p. 204). However, data classifying readers of these three newspapers by education show that the biggest proportion of readers of <italic>Delo</italic> and <italic>Dnevnik</italic> (with a circulation of more than 48,000) are highly educated while <italic>Slovenske novice</italic> is mostly read by people with a vocational education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011427974">Mediana, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Since our aim was to study printed articles, we excluded articles on nanotechnology published only online on the websites of particular newspapers. Due to the lack of the possibility of further refining our search (the databases so far do not allow any other options for narrowing the search), we came across numerous articles that did not refer directly to nanotechnology. That is, little more than one half of the articles (78 articles, or 51.7%) mentioned nanotechnology just once and in a different context.</p>

<p>Other analyses have also confirmed that debates on emerging technologies follow a certain pattern of media communication. The first phase of media reporting about new emerging technologies is characterized by far-reaching promises. In the second phase of the media debate, more critical voices are heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1075547011427974">Weingart et al., 2008</xref>). This is the case especially when the promises are unfulfilled or a disaster occurs—then the press becomes skeptical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1075547011427974">Stephens, 2005</xref>).</p>
