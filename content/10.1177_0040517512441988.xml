<abstract>
<p>The Wool ComfortMeter provides an objective measurement of the fabric-evoked prickle discomfort rating provided by wearers. This work aimed to quantify the sensitivity of the Wool ComfortMeter over a range of different temperature and humidity conditions to determine the recommended test conditions for its operation. The design was: three temperatures (notionally 20, 25 and 30°C) at three relative humidities (RHs, notionally 50, 65 and 80%) each with two replicates, using six different wool single jersey knits (mean fibre diameter 19.5–27.0 µm). As it was difficult to achieve exactly some of the extreme combinations of temperature and RH, some combinations were repeated, providing a total of 23 different assessment conditions. Data were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood mixed model analysis. The best fixed model included RH, RH<sup>2</sup>, temperature and the interaction of temperature and RH, accounting for 95% of the variation in Wool ComfortMeter readings. Wool ComfortMeter values were almost constant at 55–60% RH. Generally, the Wool ComfortMeter value reduced with increasing RH &gt; 60% at temperatures of 25°C and 28.5°C as the regain of the fabric increased. However, at 20°C little change was detected as RH was increased from 50 to 80% as there were only small changes in fabric regain. The observed effects were in a good agreement with existing knowledge on the effect of regain on the mechanical properties of wool fibre. Wool ComfortMeter is best operated under standard conditions for textile testing of 65% RH and 20°C.</p>

<p>Comfort properties of textiles are affected by thermal, moisture transmission, air permeability, size, fit, aesthetics and static electrical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512441988">1</xref></sup> Wearer perceptions of textile comfort, both sensory and functional, have increased in commercial importance in recent decades, particularly for animal fibres. Consumer surveys have shown that prickle discomfort, from wearing some wool next to the skin, is a negative market attribute for wool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512441988">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512441988">3</xref></sup> This discomfort in some wool garments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512441988">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512441988">6</xref></sup> has been shown to be caused by the mechanical stimulation of pain receptor nerve endings in the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512441988">7</xref></sup> caused by protruding fibre ends applying a force to the skin greater than approximately 0.75 mN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512441988">8</xref></sup> Temperature and skin moisture content were found to influence prickle intensity. Under hot humid conditions or after physical activity, people are more sensitive to fabric-evoked prickle as skin temperature is raised and skin is moistened from perspiration. When the temperature and moisture sensation is decreased, the perception of prickle decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512441988">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Until recently the evaluation of fabric-evoked prickle discomfort has only been determined subjectively. To enable objective evaluation of fabric-evoked prickle discomfort, a Wool ComfortMeter was developed at the CSIRO, Materials Science and Engineering, Belmont, Australia. In designing this device, Euler’s buckling theory, and its similarity to the equation for the bending stiffness of a rod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512441988">10</xref></sup> has been used to conclude that the measurement of the bending stiffness could be a good proxy to measure the buckling characteristics of the fibres protruding from the surface of a fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512441988">11</xref></sup> Both buckling force and bending stiffness are linearly proportional to the Young’s modulus of the fibre, both increase as a function of the fourth power of the fibre diameter, and both are a function of an inverse power of the fibre length. This relationship has been utilised in designing the Wool ComfortMeter device to evaluate the comfort of fabrics based on a measurement that is sensitive to variations in the bending rigidity of fibres protruding from the fabric surface. The device uses a tensioned fine metal wire mounted in a recording head which scans the surface of a fabric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512441988">Figure 1</xref>). The wire interacts with fibres protruding from the fabric surface and is sensitive to the bending rigidity variations of the fibres. The very small movement of the wire is detected by imposing a static magnetic field across the wire and measuring the induced current as the wire moves through the magnetic field. This gives a value that is related to the number and stiffness of coarse fibres protruding from the fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512441988">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512441988">13</xref></sup>

</fig></p>
<p>The readings of the Wool ComfortMeter have been shown to be strongly correlated with average prickle ratings assigned by wearers of the garments. The higher the prickle rating, the higher the Wool ComfortMeter value. As average wool fibre diameter and other processing variables were changed in the fabrics used in the wearer trials, the relationship between the Wool ComfortMeter value and the wearer prickle rating remained highly correlated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512441988">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proteins in keratin fibres attract water. The regain of the fibre is the mass of water absorbed/mass of dry fibre. For animal fibres the regain is generally 15 to 18% under standard laboratory conditions (20°C and 65% relative humidity). However, the regain of animal fibres follows a sigmoidal response to relative humidity and there is hysteresis in moisture absorption, with the desorption curve being higher than the absorption curve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512441988">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512441988">15</xref></sup> Regain is important as it affects many fibre attributes. When wool absorbs water it swells and the swelling is largely radial with little increase in length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512441988">16</xref></sup> The swelling is almost linear with the mean fibre diameter changing 0.48% per 1% change in regain with a maximum swelling of 16%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512441988">16</xref></sup> Increasing the water content of wool fibres also reduces the rigidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512441988">17</xref></sup> and the strength of wool fibres. At 25°C, it has been shown that the effect of increasing the regain from 5 to 25% is a reduction in Young’s modulus, relative to that at zero regain, from 0.96 to 0.56.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512441988">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study is part of the ongoing development of the Wool ComfortMeter as a test procedure that will enable the prediction of a garment’s next to skin comfort. The aim of this experiment was to quantify the sensitivity of the Wool ComfortMeter over a range of different temperature and humidity conditions to determine the recommended test conditions for its operation.</p>

<p>The design for the experiment included three temperatures at three relative humidities (RH) each with two replicates, using six different wool single jersey knits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512441988">Table 1</xref>). Temperatures were notionally 20, 25 and 30°C and relative humidities were notionally 50, 65 and 80%. As it was not always possible to achieve some of the extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, some combinations were repeated and other conditions close to those planned were used and measured for the analysis.

<sec id="sec4-0040517512441988"><title>Fabric testing</title>
<p>Each fabric was measured using the Wool ComfortMeter following the draft test method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512441988">19</xref></sup> Briefly, five samples of 30 cm × 30 cm were cut. Samples were then hung vertically and the reverse side (back) of the fabric was lightly and evenly steamed using vertical movements of a personal hand steamer. Fabrics were conditioned at the test conditions for 20 h prior to testing on the Wool ComfortMeter. The metal wire is not impacted by the temperature range used in the experiment. However, to make sure that there is no effect of humidity on the actual operation of the Wool ComfortMeter, the wire was retuned just before testing and after conditioning at the test conditions. Fabric testing was carried out in a random order each time. Each sample was subjected to 10 passes of the scanning head and the mean value recorded.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040517512441988"><title>Laboratory conditions</title>
<p>The humidity was adjusted using a humiSteam humidifier Model UE001 (Carel/Italy) with a steam production capacity of up to 18 kg/h. The temperature was adjusted by an air conditioning unit (Carrier Air Conditioning/ Korea) with cooling and heating capacities of 5.1 kW and 5.5 kW, respectively. The acquired temperature and humidity were monitored by Mesdan Lab Thermo-Hydrograph (Model TIT/01/ Italy).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0040517512441988"><title>Moisture regain measurement</title>
<p>After measurement each of the five samples for each fabric was dried in a standard laboratory oven at 115°C. The first weight measurement, using a calibrated scale, was carried out after 90 min and then samples were returned to the oven. The measurement was repeated after every 30 min. After three measurements in which the weight of the sample remained constant, the samples were deemed to be dry. Samples were then returned to the laboratory and were conditioned at the stable adjusted humidity and temperature condition for at least 20 hours prior to testing on the Wool ComfortMeter. The moisture regain percentage (R%) of each sample was calculated from the dry weight (W<sub>D</sub>) and weight of each sample at stable condition (W<sub>S</sub>) as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0040517512441988">equation 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec10-0040517512441988"><title>Wool ComfortMeter and regain</title>
<p>When wool takes up water, the initial absorption is assumed to be bound to hydrophilic groups in protein side-chains which generate a large amount of heat and contribute to overall volume swelling. The previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512441988">12</xref></sup> showed that Wool ComfortMeter values increased when fabrics made from fibres of increasing mean fibre diameter were tested under standard conditions. It also has been shown that the prickle sensation is significantly enhanced when skin moisture and temperature were increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512441988">8</xref></sup> Young’s modulus decreases markedly as regain increases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512441988">18</xref></sup> therefore the mean Wool ComfortMeter value is reduced with higher regain. The observed effects are quantitatively in a good agreement with existing knowledge on the effect of regain on the mechanical properties of wool fibre at 25°C. As an example, the Wool ComfortMeter value measured on different fabrics used in this study was compared with calculated regain at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512441988">Figure 3</xref>). The effect of moisture regain on the relative Young’s modulus at 25°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512441988">18</xref></sup> has also been plotted. This comparison shows that as regain increased, the measured Wool ComfortMeter values and Young’s modulus declined in a parallel manner. The Wool ComfortMeter data for each fabric shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512441988">Figure 3</xref> is the net effect of changes in Young’s modulus as regain changes, plus the effect of regain on swelling the fibres and changing the mean fibre diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512441988">16</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig3-0040517512441988" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The effect of moisture regain on Young’s modulus at 25°C relative to zero regain (right axis, ⋄)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512441988">18</xref></sup> and Wool ComfortMeter reading for three fabrics with different mean fibre diameter (left axis, Fabric 1, 19.5 µm, ▪; Fabric 5, 22.5 µm, ●; Fabric 6, 27.0 µm, ▴).

</fig></p>
<p>It is well known that the mechanical properties of wool are influenced by moisture and temperature. At higher regains the fibres are easier to bend and twist. The reduction in rigidity is caused by water adsorption on particular groups in keratin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512441988">17</xref></sup> The fall in rigidity with increase in regain is consistent with the idea that this is caused by the breaking of hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecular chains in the non-crystalline regions and that, at saturation regain, one molecule of water is bound to each accessible polar group which would otherwise be linked to a similar polar group in a neighbouring chain molecule by means of a hydrogen bond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512441988">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The modelled response of the Wool ComfortMeter at 20°C remained relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512441988">Figure 2a</xref>). This occurred as the change in regain at 20°C was small, averaging 2.6% (range 1.5–4.5%) for the six fabrics. This small increase in regain would lead to a relative decline in Young’s modulus of ≈4.5%. The effects of increased regain of 2.6% on increasing mean fibre diameter equates to ≈1.3%, equating to a mean increase of 0.3 µm in mean fibre diameter for tested fabrics. As bending stiffness is proportional to the fourth power of fibre diameter, the relative increase in bending stiffness resulting from a 1.3% increase in fibre diameter is ≈5.3%. Thus in this study under the test conditions at 20°C, the effect increasing regain on bending stiffness from a decline in Young’s modulus was negated by the effect of regain on increasing mean fibre diameter.</p>
<p>The effects of increasing temperature on a decline in Wool ComfortMeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512441988">Figure 2b</xref>) at 65 and 75% RH relate to increased fibre regain leading to a decline in Young’s modulus, exactly as discussed for the responses at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512441988">Figure 2a</xref>). What remains to be explained is the modelled increase in Wool ComfortMeter responses at 50% RH as temperature increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512441988">Figure 2a</xref>). Based on the observed results this is explained by a mean decline in regain of 2.9% in tested fabrics as the temperature increased from 20 to 28.5°C. The decline in regain would lead to an increase in Young’s modulus and an increase in bending stiffness, leading to increased Wool ComfortMeter values.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0040517512441988" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The Wool ComfortMeter assessments of conditioned, knitted fabrics were affected by changes in the temperature and relative humidity of the laboratory testing conditions. While the device was able to evaluate a wide range of comfort values obtained from different fabrics, it is clear that for the objective comparison of different fabrics over time and between laboratories that laboratory conditions need to be standardised for the Wool ComfortMeter.</p>
<p>The Wool ComfortMeter was most robust under laboratory temperatures of 20°C, where changes in relative humidity between 50–80% had little net effect on Wool ComfortMeter assessments. The mean Wool ComfortMeter value declined with higher temperature at 65% and 75% RH. Thus the Wool ComfortMeter is best operated under current standard conditions for textile testing laboratories where conditions should be 20 ± 2°C and 65 ± 2% RH.</p>
<p>It is likely that the decline in Wool ComfortMeter values at the higher temperatures and RHs in the present study are related to increased moisture content (regain) of the fibre. This is what would be expected as Young’s modulus declines with greater moisture content of the wool fibre.</p>
<p>What the present work indicates is that the Wool ComfortMeter measurements of wool fabrics, exposed to different environmental temperature and RH, change in a manner consistent with accepted theories relating to changes in bending stiffness and buckling forces, most likely due to changes in Young’s modulus and fibre diameter of the wool fibre as moisture content of the wool fibre changes. While the human skin changes its sensitivity to prickle discomfort as environmental temperature and RH increase, the Wool ComfortMeter is independent from these environmental changes but the instrument is able to detect changes in wool fabric bending stiffness induced by changes in these environmental conditions.</p>
