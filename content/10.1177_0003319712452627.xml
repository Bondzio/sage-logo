<abstract>
<p>It remains unclear whether severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) affects the prognosis of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). In this retrospective, multicenter study, we analyzed 537 consecutive patients with symptomatic PAD who underwent both peripheral artery revascularization and coronary angiography (CAG) prior to revascularization. We classified patients into 3 groups based on CAG: no-CAD group, intermediate CAD group (1-2 diseased vessels), and triple-vessel disease (TVD) group. We evaluated clinical outcome including all-cause death, major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), and amputation. The no-CAD, intermediate CAD, and TVD groups comprised 204, 268, and 65 patients, respectively. Mean follow-up duration was 952 ± 497 days. Freedom from any adverse outcome was highest in the no-CAD group and lowest in the TVD group (all-cause death: 86% vs 77% vs 65%, <italic>P</italic> = .043; MACE: 95% vs 87% vs 78%, <italic>P</italic> = .044; amputation: 96% vs 92% vs 83%, <italic>P</italic> = .0015). Severity of CAD affected prognosis of patients with PAD.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>About half of the patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), a fifth has cerebrovascular disease, and about a third has renal artery stenosis.<sup>

</sup> The prognosis of the patient with PAD is worse than that of the patient with non-PAD and it varies according to PAD status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319712452627">4</xref>

</sup> The 5-year survival rate is about 70% for patients with intermittent claudication (IC), and 50% for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) according to a TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II report.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>
</sup> More recent evidence revealed 24% died during a mean follow-up of 47.6 months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319712452627">8</xref>
</sup> Moreover, 75% of patients with PAD die due to cardiovascular events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, it remains unclear how the severity of CAD affects mortality in patients with PAD. And the effects of CAD on major adverse cardiac event (MACE) and major amputation have not been systematically studied. Moreover, as it is mentioned, the prognosis is quite different between patients with IC and CLI and it is unclear how the severity of CAD affects prognosis in these patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the clinical outcome was different in patients with PAD according to the severity of CAD.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0003319712452627">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>This study was based on a retrospective review of multicenter (Kansai Rosai Hospital, Kokura Memorial Hospital and Saiseikai Yokohama City Western Hospital) data in a prospectively maintained database. We analyzed 537 consecutive symptomatic patients with PAD (mean age: 70 ± 9 years; males: 74%) who underwent both revascularization for peripheral artery and coronary angiography (CAG) prior to revascularization from April 2002 to August 2009. The mean follow-up period was 952 ± 497 days. We routinely perform CAG for patients with PAD because half of patients with PAD had CAD and they often have no chest symptoms because of the limitation of cardiac load due to severe IC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>
</sup> Patients who presented with acute limb ischemia requiring emergent revascularization or functionally unsalvageable limbs were excluded from this analysis. Follow-up was performed by clinical visits or telephone contacts. Patients who were lost to follow-up were handled with dropouts. The medical ethics committee at Kansai Rosai Hospital, Kokura Memorial Hospital and Saiseikai Yokohama City Western Hospital approved the study, and all patients gave written their informed consent.</p>

<sec id="section4-0003319712452627">
<title>Angiographic Evaluation</title>
<p>Coronary artery disease was defined as more than 75% diameter stenosis visually evaluated by CAG. We classified the patients into 3 groups based on CAG: no-CAD group (which also included previously treated lesions), intermediate CAD group (1-2 diseased vessels), and triple-vessel disease (TVD) group. Left main trunk disease was defined as 2-vessel disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003319712452627">
<title>Primary and Secondary Outcomes</title>
<p>Primary outcome was all-cause death in the 3 groups and secondary outcomes were MACE and major amputation of lower extremity. We also evaluated mortality in the IC and CLI population. We also compared mortality between the TVD and non-TVD groups or no-CAD and CAD groups in patients with IC and CLI, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0003319712452627">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Hypertension was defined according to the presence of one or more of the following criteria: antihypertensive medication use, systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg. Dyslipidemia was defined as the presence of one or more of the following criteria: treatment with medication, total cholesterol ≥220 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥140 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤40 mg/dL, or triglycerides ≤150 mg/dL. Diabetes mellitus was defined according to the presence of one or more of the following criteria: oral agent or insulin treatment or hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> ≥6.5%. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as estimated GFR &lt;60 mL/min per m<sup>2</sup>. Ejection fraction was evaluated by cardiac ultrasound. Major adverse cardiac event was defined as a composite of cardiac death which included sudden death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Amputation of a lower extremity was defined as above-the-ankle amputation.</p>

<sec id="section7-0003319712452627">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Chi-square analysis was used to assess differences among categorical variables. Student <italic>t</italic> test and analysis of variance test were used to assess differences among numerical data. Time-to-event distributions in the categories were summarized with Kaplan-Meier curves. All tests of significance were 2-sided, and statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. All calculations were performed using JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>No-CAD group, intermediate group, and TVD group comprised 204 patients (38%), 268 patients (50%), and 65 patients (12%), respectively. Mean duration of follow-up was 952 ± 497 days (median 910 days [range 8-3037 days]). Significant differences were found for several baseline patient characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319712452627">Table 1</xref>). Patients were oldest in the TVD group and the frequency of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hemodialysis, and CLI was different among groups. Ejection fraction was best in the no-CAD group. There were some differences among groups in the preprocedural medication use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003319712452627">Table 2</xref>). Coronary artery disease was detected in 62%, 58%, and 71% of the overall, IC, and CLI populations, respectively. In contrast, TVD was found in 12%, 10%, and 14% of the overall, IC, and CLI populations, respectively.</p>

<title>Coronary Revascularization After CAG</title>
<p>During the follow-up periods, some patients received coronary revascularization. In the no-CAD group, revascularization was performed in 2 patients (1%), PCI in 1 patient (0.5%), and CABG in 1 patient (0.5%). In the intermediate CAD group, revascularization was carried out in 134 patients (50%), PCI in 130 patients (49%), and CABG in 8 patients (3%). In contrast, in the TVD group, 39 patients (60%) received revascularization, 29 patients (45%) received PCI, and 11 patients (17%) received CABG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our main findings were (1) 62% of patients with PAD had CAD while 12% had TVD, (2) prognosis, as reflected by rates of all-cause death, MACE, and major amputation of lower extremity worsened in relation with increasing number of disease vessels, and (3) TVD contributed to prognosis in patients with IC, while CAD contributed to prognosis in patients with CLI.</p>
<sec id="section15-0003319712452627">
<title>All-Cause Death</title>
<p>Min et al reported prognosis of patients who were suspected to have CAD based on computed tomography (CT) angiography.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319712452627">9</xref>
</sup> As severity of CAD worsened, mortality increased. However, the survival rate was 93% at 3 years even in the TVD population. This is similar to our finding of a positive correlation between severity of CAD and frequency of all-cause death; however, in our study, the survival rate was lower (80% and 65% at 3 and 5 years, respectively) in patients with PAD. This difference came from the fact that mortality of patients with PAD was worse than that of non-PAD population as previously reported.<sup>

<title>Amputation of Lower Extremity</title>
<p>Both CLI and hemodialysis have been shown to be the predictors of limb loss in patients with PAD with diabetes mellitus,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319712452627">10</xref>
</sup> and Resnick et al reported that diabetes mellitus and CKD were the predictors of amputation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319712452627">11</xref>
</sup> Therefore, patients with severe atherosclerosis were more susceptible to undergo amputated. Tanimoto et al also reported carotid artery stenosis extent worsened as the number of diseased vessels in CAD increased reflecting atherosclerosis progression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712452627">12</xref>
</sup> Consistent with these previous reports, in our study, as the number of disease vessels in CAD increased, that is, as the atherosclerosis progressed, the frequency of amputation increased.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0003319712452627">
<title>Patients With IC and CLI</title>
<p>A 70% 5-year survival rate has been reported for patients with IC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>
</sup> However, in our study, it was 84%. The survival rates of patients with and without TVD were 86% and 69%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .048). This suggests that severity of CAD had a stronger contribution to mortality in the population with IC than in those with CLI.</p>
<p>The survival rate, in this study, was higher than that in a previous report,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>
</sup> which might be explained by 2 factors: more timely and better follow-up in treatment of CAD in Japan, and the lower severity of CAD in the Japanese population.</p>
<p>The 5-year survival rate of patients with CLI has been reported to be 50%,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712452627">1</xref>
</sup> which is similar to that in our study (53%). This same result may mean that the status of patients with CLI is anyway bad even if the best treatment and follow-up are performed in Japan. One of the reasons for this result is the higher frequency of patients with hemodialysis in Japan than in other countries. The survival rates of patients with and without CAD were 72% and 44%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .0086). Therefore, the prognosis of patients with CLI, whose status is relatively worse among patients with PAD, is good if they did not have CAD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0003319712452627">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Sixty-two percent of patients with PAD who received peripheral artery revascularization had CAD. Patients with PAD are less prone to manifest chest pain because of decreased physical activity secondary to IC and presence of wound. For this reason, it is advisable to perform CAG or CT angiography, even if the patient has no chest symptom.</p>
<p>Survival rate varied according to the severity of CAD. Evaluation of CAD along with that of PAD at an early phase makes it possible to better predict survival. The frequency of MACE and amputation also differed according to severity of CAD. Early evaluation of CAD along with that of PAD might also allow risk stratification for MACE and amputation.</p>

<sec id="section19-0003319712452627">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>This present study has several limitations. First, the causes of death were unknown in 8% of patients who died. The causes of death were cardiac events (38%), infection (20%), malignancy (11%), cerebral apoplexy (8%), gastrointestinal bleeding (6%), abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (2%), interstitial pneumonia (2%), pulmonary embolism (2%), and superior mesenteric artery thrombosis (2%). Second, lesion severity of PAD, the details of restenosis after peripheral artery revascularization, the number of patients who underwent surgical revascularization, and the cause of amputation such as gangrene and infection were unknown. However, these deficiencies are unlikely to affect the result. Third, the number of patients who achieved lipid and blood pressure goals was unknown. However, we routinely tried to achieve the goals with appropriate medications. Fourth, some articles mentioned that perioperative morbidity and mortality may be beneficially affected using statins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319712452627">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319712452627"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319712452627">15</xref>
</sup> In our study, the frequency of using statins was only about 30% in each group. The prognosis may be better if statins are used more frequently. Fifth, this study was retrospective and observational in design; however, it was a multicenter study. Finally, the sample size was small and a larger scale prospective study is warranted to confirm the findings.</p>
<p>We conclude that the severity of CAD affected prognosis of patients with PAD.</p>
