<abstract>
<p>This article investigates whether school activism diminishes the alienation that accompanies urban youths’ observations of unequal educational conditions, and often leads to underachievement and school rejection. The study is based on interviews with 13 urban youth about their participation in a community-based program that supports education organizing. Findings reveal that school activism is a promising intervention that encourages more constructive responses to schooling. However, the opportunity to participate in school activism was more influential for students who were already integrated into school life and initially felt less acutely alienated. Implications for enhancing the prevalence of success among urban students are considered.</p>

<p>They set up this whole school that we have to get used to. We have to adapt to this environment. And if we feel that something is not right in the environment, we the ones that gotta deal with it.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>How students “feel” about school and how they subsequently “deal with it” is the crux of this study. The students report here that as they walk down the hallways, sit at their desks, and hang out in the cafeteria they are cataloguing their experiences. They notice the paint on the walls, how the teachers treat them, and what the food tastes like. After gathering signs of the school’s faith in them, students will often respond commensurately. “If you don’t like your school,” says Serena of Atwood High, “you probably won’t work as hard, you probably won’t do anything extra. You go to school and go home and just like the end of it. You might not even try.” However, she adds, “If you feel your school has a high standard for you, has hope, believes in you, that you have help, you’ll wanna try harder.” Students’ perceptions of their school surroundings, Serena explains, shape their response to schooling and investment in their education.</p>
<p>How urban students perceive their schools matters greatly because the educational challenges associated with these institutions are quite severe. The students in this study enumerate a host of urban school problems, including unproductive teacher–student relations, unclean schools and bathrooms, and “nasty” lunches (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211411079">Table 1</xref>). To this list, scholars of urban education would add a whole “system of concerns”: disjointed and low-level curricula, less prepared teachers, weak instruction, worries about safety, unsteady school leadership, tangled bureaucracies, and acute resource shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831211411079">Bryk, Sebring, Allensworth, Luppescu, &amp; Easton, 2010</xref>, p. 67; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831211411079">Lipman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211411079">Noguera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>, pp. 10, 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831211411079">Payne, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Urban students’ intuitions about the multitude of educational obstacles that confront them commonly evoke an alienated response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">Fine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211411079">Fine, Burns, Payne, &amp; Torre, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>). Their umbrage at the school environment, and feelings of anger, numbness, and detachment make them vulnerable to underachievement and school rejection.</p>
<p>Helping urban students refashion their distress into a drive to transform their educational circumstances may avert these outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831211411079">Ginwright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211411079">Ginwright &amp; James, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta, Shah, &amp; McAlister, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>). This article considers the possibility by examining the influence of a community-based program that fosters school activism. I investigate whether the opportunity to challenge school practice alters how urban students respond to schooling.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002831211411079">
<title>Students’ Responses to Schooling in Theoretical Perspective</title>
<p>Urban schools are positioned at the bottom of a stratified educational system that allocates fewer resources to student populations with lower racial and economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211411079">Massey, 2007</xref>). The structure of schooling most visibly limits the material supports available to urban students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>). But educational inequity also dampens subjective hopes and aspirations, orienting students toward educational defeat and pessimism about their future life chances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831211411079">Bourdieu &amp; Passerson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While acknowledging the potency of social structures, close studies of urban school life reveal that students still have the means to actively interpret their social circumstances (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831211411079">MacLeod, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211411079">O’Connor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>). Urban students generally possess a vague knowledge of an unequal society alongside specific impressions of an inadequate educational environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211411079">Fine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211411079">Nieto, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831211411079">Taines, in press</xref>). These findings indicate that students at least partially comprehend the structural impediments to their future success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>). The recognition of students’ agency calls attention to how students respond to the inequality they perceive. Rather than being propelled unwittingly by social forces, students’ responses are active and varied, and “there exists a <italic>capacity</italic> for opposition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>, p. 175).</p>
<p>Alienation is a helpful concept for theorizing urban students’ responses to schooling because it captures the interaction between the individual agent and the larger social structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831211411079">1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>, p. 172; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>, pp. 422, 427). When individuals perceive social arrangements as demeaning or unfair, they begin to recoil from major spheres of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>, p. 422). Their sense of separation from the social environment, or alienation, manifests as powerlessness, isolation, and normlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Powerlessness is a feeling of exclusion from the decision making of societal institutions, discerning little political influence over the processes that govern one’s affairs. Because of their sense of marginalization, individuals may become isolated from the other actors in an organizational setting. With the perception that the institution operates for others, an individual may not feel beholden to its rules, choosing instead to reject institutional norms. Individuals will experience alienation along these dimensions to varying degrees, depending on their intuitions about the social environment and the severity of their social-psychological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211411079">Surace &amp; Seeman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>In educational settings, alienation focuses attention on students’ agency within the bounds of unequal school structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831211411079">Williamson &amp; Cullingford, 1997</xref>). The conditions of urban education are often so acute that the range of meanings students can make is narrowed. Like all students, urban youth have choices regarding how they will respond to school. However, the choice to invest in one’s education is more effortful than for students enrolled in schools with better resources and greater academic support.</p>
<p>Students who choose to make this effort often subscribe to the dominant meritocratic ideology that hard work eventually ensures success. In <italic>Learning to Labor</italic>, the working class “ear’oles” asserted, “We’ve got to do the work, else you wouldn’t get on” in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>, p. 99). Similarly, in <italic>Framing Dropouts</italic>, the urban “graduates” believed their effort in school would pay future dividends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">Fine, 1991</xref>). These students perceived the shortcomings of their schools yet chose to “remain involved”—with their peers, their teachers, and the educational process—for “instrumental” reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>, p. 425). To better their prospects of upward mobility, both the ear’oles and the graduates decided to conform to school expectations and norms. Their accommodation did not come without a cost—the successful urban graduates were, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">Fine (1991)</xref> noted, depressed, apathetic, and fearful of challenging school practice. Underneath a model student demeanor were students who felt powerless to critique their inhospitable school environment, “contributing to a partial alienation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>, p. 426).</p>
<p>Many low-income students and students of color see delimited opportunities and make a different choice in responding to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831211411079">MacLeod, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211411079">Ogbu, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>). These youth observe that adults in their lives face discrimination and underemployment. Their schools, with inadequate facilities and repressive practices, strike them as unlikely to change the equation. This analysis produces a “feeling of detachment” from schooling and may prompt students to withdraw their institutional membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>, p. 425). Cutting themselves off from meaningful social interaction, the few relationships they do sustain are often “conflictive and broken” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>, p. 248). Students like “the lads” engage in oppositional resistance by breaking school rules, failing to complete schoolwork, and skipping class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>). In an even more extreme form of resistance, students may decide to drop out of school altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">Fine, 1991</xref>). Isolated from school life, unreceptive to school norms, and convinced the situation is irreparable, such students embody a “fundamental alienation” from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>, p. 492; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>, pp. 423, 425).</p>
<p>An awareness of social and educational inequality does not preordain alienation. Students can “interpret their subjugation” and feel empowered to voice their critique, while still maintaining their motivation to succeed in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831211411079">Lee, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211411079">O’Connor, 1997</xref>, p. 602). This socially critical, yet high-achieving school response is modeled after family members’ “disposition of collective struggle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211411079">O’Connor, 1997</xref>). Taking this example, students build their skills and talents with the intention of reinvesting in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831211411079">Lee, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831211411079">Solorzano &amp; Bernal, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>No matter which of the aforementioned orientations students adopt, the inequality of their school contexts is unchanged. Each student, then, is left with an individual choice about how to respond to detrimental school conditions. Based on the failure rates in urban school settings, constricted opportunities appear to channel students toward educationally perilous options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Youth activism for school reform is a potential intervention for the high frequency of alienation among urban students. Studies of adult activism in the 1960s and 1970s underscore its potential: Those who participated in social movements were also less alienated, and acts of protest reduced feelings of powerlessness and isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831211411079">Gecas, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211411079">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211411079">Surace &amp; Seeman, 1967</xref>). Instead, activists tended to express a vigorous sense of agency, espousing a “belief that one can influence the political system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>, p. 491). This study seeks to understand whether a community-based program that promotes youth activism can produce similar results. A favorable outcome would mean students whose alienation was replaced by a “perceived efficacy to affect the political process,” or political efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>, p. 491). Since self-efficacy is always tied to a specific domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>, p. 485), this positive result would entail a student’s transition from powerlessness to efficacy to influence school practice. Partially alienated, accommodationist students would instead envision a proactive approach to school problems. Fundamentally alienated, oppositional students would see a path to constructive advocacy. The opportunity to transform an educational institution may extend to more students the option of responding to school without endangering their success or acclimating to unequal school practices.</p>

<title>Community and Youth Activism for Educational Reform</title>
<p>Despite continuous waves of reform, inequitable resources and poor outcomes are still typical of urban schooling. Uneven political power helps to explain the lack of substantive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211411079">Anyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211411079">Noguera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>). Higher income families reside in separate neighborhoods and communities, and many are not invested in the success of urban schools. Their political advocacy is focused on the schools their children attend and is often effective at orienting public officials’ attention—and the resources they control—in the same direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831211411079">Lareau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211411079">Massey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211411079">Noguera, 2003</xref>). The reforms attempted in urban educational institutions often founder absent the political support and capacity necessary to bring them to fruition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211411079">Noguera, 2003</xref>). Achieving educational equity therefore requires a “political constituency” who will advocate for urban schools and educational reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211411079">Anyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>, p. 48; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831211411079">Warren, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The most natural candidates to fill this role are the students and parents who attend, and send their children to, urban schools. As the individuals “most affected” by the current system, they have both local knowledge about its problems and a personal stake in its reform. On their own, however, urban residents often lack the political clout to shape their educational institutions or ensure that existing reforms meet their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>, pp. 39, 109).</p>
<p>To fill this gap, community-based organizations located in urban areas are increasingly engaged in education organizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211411079">Shirley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211411079">Warren, Mira, &amp; Nikundiwe, 2008</xref>). Organizing efforts typically evolve in stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>, pp. 98–101, 109). Grassroots groups first build relationships by linking local residents together around shared interests. Next, community members develop common understandings of educational problems and envision solutions. The third step is to employ direct actions that generate public support and pressure policymakers. Through organizing, urban communities gain “collective power” that can be used to make the school system more responsive to their concerns.</p>
<p>Historically, youth have been critical to the struggle for educational equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831211411079">Cecelski, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831211411079">Delgado Bernal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211411079">Dougherty, 2004</xref>). Since the mid-1990s, a growing number of grassroots groups have emulated this legacy by involving students in local movements for urban school reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831211411079">Checkoway &amp; Richards-Schuster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831211411079">Lewis-Charp, Yu, &amp; Soukamneuth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211411079">Su, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211411079">Warren et al., 2008</xref>). Activism is ultimately a strategy of “power in numbers,” and so organizing young people adds both numbers and power to the effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211411079">Su, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211411079">Warren et al., 2008</xref>). Youth can additionally advance the reform agenda by contributing their insider knowledge of school practice, clarifying their educational needs, and advocating for innovative policy solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831211411079">Checkoway &amp; Richards-Schuster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211411079">Su, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831211411079">Taines, in press</xref>). A rationale for youth activism can also be found by unpacking its influence on the activists themselves: in terms of their academic, psychological, and political development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831211411079">Ginwright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211411079">Ginwright &amp; James, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The scholarship on youth activism for educational reform is trailing this burgeoning but still recent trend. As a result, only a handful of empirical studies are available on the youth development outcomes of participating in educational activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211411079">Kirshner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211411079">Larson &amp; Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831211411079">Morrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211411079">Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211411079">Strobel, Osberg, &amp; McLaughlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211411079">Su, 2009</xref>). All suggest that the experience alters youths’ relationship to schooling, and in a consistently beneficial direction. Increased school attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211411079">Schultz, 2008</xref>), enrollment in more challenging courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>), greater extracurricular involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>), improved achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211411079">Larson &amp; Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211411079">Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211411079">Strobel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211411079">Su, 2009</xref>), higher educational aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211411079">Larson &amp; Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211411079">Strobel et al., 2006</xref>), and the fulfillment of those aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>) are all asserted for youths’ school-focused activism. A subset of studies finds that students come to self-identify as agents of educational justice and feel confident enough to confront current and future educational obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211411079">Kirshner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211411079">Larson &amp; Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831211411079">Morrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211411079">Strobel et al., 2006</xref>). The favorable results are particularly notable since this research focuses on urban, low-income students of color and indicates expanded educational prospects.</p>
<p>Although the outcomes discussed in the prior literature appear promising, the reporting of these results is largely impressionistic. Just one article traces individual students and their development over the course of a school activism experience, and by design the researchers “did not study” the “youth who did not develop strong commitments to social change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211411079">Strobel et al., 2006</xref>, p. 210). Only three studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211411079">Schultz, 2008</xref>) present the frequencies at which students in their samples experienced better educational outcomes or enhanced self-efficacy to influence school change. None of the existing research explores variations in the effects of organizing for educational reform, choosing instead to highlight only positive youth development outcomes.</p>
<p>This study adds to the existing literature by systematically investigating whether activism for school reform changes students’ relationship to school. To do so, the study examines individual student trajectories—pinpointing where students originated and specifying if the opportunity to participate in school activism shifted their educational orientations. By carefully connecting individual students’ pre and post relationship with schooling, the study has the capacity to document both stability and change, and discern explanations for these patterns.</p>
<p>More broadly, the study is unique because it is framed by a theory of alienation that highlights the subjective harmfulness of educational inequality—and the possibility that a student’s activism for school change can buffer that harm.</p>

<title>District and School Context</title>
<p>The youth profiled in this study live in large city in the Midwest called Gorham.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002831211411079">1</xref></sup> Decades of discrimination, job losses, and population dislocations have created an urban landscape that is racially and economically isolated. Reflecting this context, the public school district in Gorham has few resources to meet the considerable needs of the student population.</p>
<p>The majority of students in the Gorham School District (GSD) are African American (59%), followed by Latinos (19%), Whites (14%), and Asian Americans (4%). Low-income students are also the majority: 60% of high school students receive subsidized lunch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831211411079">[Gorham] School District, 2005</xref>). GSD receives in total revenues about $12,000 per student, a figure that is thousands less than the assets available to students in nearby suburbs. Only 42% of students in the district reached proficiency or above on the state reading test in 2005, and even fewer, 32%, achieved this level in math. Although GSD claimed a graduation rate of 60%, the same year an independent study reported an even more alarming rate below 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211411079">[State] Information Network for Successful Schools, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831211411079">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002831211411079">2005c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831211411079">Editorial Projects in Education Inc., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As in many urban centers, the district has turned to school choice as a reform solution. Families can select from neighborhood, charter, or magnet high schools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211411079">Table 1</xref>). Gorham youth, including two from this study, also have the option of participating in a desegregation program that allows them to register in neighboring suburban districts, contingent on space.</p>

<title>Mobilize 4 Change and Its School Activism Program</title>
<p>Located in a small office building in central city Gorham, Mobilize 4 Change (M4C) is a nonprofit community organization open to teens citywide. Martin Lewis and Diane Morgan founded the organization to fill what they saw as a gap among local youth agencies. Most, they felt, operated as recreational spaces or tried to correct youths’ presumed “deficiencies.” The mission of M4C is to promote the personal and leadership capacities of youth, and inspire a youth movement to better the community.</p>
<p>Youth are recruited to M4C during lunchtime presentations at city high schools and the suburban, receiving schools of the desegregation program. Anyone who has a “passion” for community change is encouraged by the staff to join. The incoming members are predominantly African American, reside in low- to lower-middle-income urban neighborhoods, and represent a wide array of high schools. Upon signing up for M4C, the youth elect to participate in one of several programs, including a general community action program and a juvenile justice program.</p>
<p>They can also sign up for the school activism program, which is designed to “mobilize, train, and support the actions of students” to “address issues within their schools.” The program meets twice a week after school in the M4C office. There, with the guidance of the staff, the youth membership discusses pressing social and educational issues, and strategies for change.</p>
<p>Over the 2-year period covered by this study, the format of the school activism program varied. The first year the program went by the catchphrase “Students Changing Schools,” and the youth established school clubs to organize around school problems. The second year, a new group of students became the “School Accountability Project.” They designed a survey for their peers with the intention of using the results to guide future actions. More details are provided in the During the School Activism Program section.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Qualitative research is particularly suited for exploring the meanings participants construct about their social world and how they act on these interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211411079">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>). Hence, a qualitative design fits well with this inquiry into students’ views of the urban school environment, their adverse reactions, and any changes that ensue from school activism.</p>
<p>The student sample in this research includes members of both the first and second years of the school activism program (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831211411079">Table 2</xref>). I collected data in 2004–2005 just after the first-year members concluded their participation. From the staff and former members, I learned that 13 youth organizers joined, and 9 were active, the previous year. Of those, I was able to locate 6 first-year students using the contact information the staff provided. During the second year of the program, 7 students consistently participated, and I recruited all of them to the study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002831211411079">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>The data referenced here draw heavily from one-on-one interviews (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831211411079">Table 3</xref>). The 6 first-year students participated in a single, approximately hour-long interview session at M4C, in which we retrospectively discussed their experiences in the program. During the second year of the program, 5 students participated in two interviews with me, averaging 50 minutes each: the first one month into the program and the second at the end of the school year when the program concluded. Because of scheduling conflicts, I interviewed two of the second-year students only once at the end of the program for about an hour. Altogether, I collected 17 hours of interview data from the 13 youth study participants.</p>

<p>I conducted interviews to “enter the other person’s perspective,” to better understand the students’ knowledge, views, and relationship to schooling before and after their activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>, pp. 48, 341). Each interview followed a general interview guide containing focused, open-ended questions and space for exploring new themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831211411079">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The students and I talked first about their school experiences and perspectives. The discussion covered a typical school day, the “best” and “worst” thing about school, school rules, and an evaluation of “what kind of student you think you are.” I then posed a series of questions relating to the program’s outcomes. I asked the students to appraise how the program influenced them personally, and whether the program altered their views of school and the possibility that they could promote school change. I also asked them to report if they had approached their teachers or administrators about school problems, and if they planned to do so the next year.</p>
<p>I supplement these interviews with my participant observations of the school activism program in its second year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831211411079">Table 3</xref>). At M4C, I observed as the students constructed their school survey and planned for its distribution. I also went to school with Alise, Marcus, and Roland for a day. These observations allowed me to experience the students’ social worlds alongside them, providing a more contextualized understanding of the school activism program, local urban schooling, and individual realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831211411079">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831211411079">Charmaz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>“A human being is the instrument of qualitative methods,” and so my persona was evident to my study participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 64). I differed from the urban youth of the school activism program in age and in my White, middle-class, and rural background. The M4C staff facilitated the development of trust between the first-year students and me: offering introductions and staying to mingle until the interviews began. Developing rapport was simpler the second year because of the time I spent in person at M4C. The second-year members and I formed close relationships, and we called each other regularly to share information about their work. My connections with the program youth fostered an enlightening research experience. All the while, the major aspects of my identity remained important to our relationships.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The analytical process for this study began with the creation of codes to represent patterns in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831211411079">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211411079">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>). I then refined the codes into themes that recurred frequently and were evident across study participants and data sources. The theme “students’ sense of efficacy to participate in school change” stood out in the analysis. A “sense of efficacy” encompassed whether students felt differently about school, could approach educators about school problems, and believed they could personally motivate school change after participating in the school activism program.</p>
<p>On this theme, the sample appeared to diverge: Some students expressed high levels of efficacy whereas others seemed to have none. The students’ explanations pointed me toward their prior orientation toward schooling as an important determinant and additional theme.</p>
<p>To establish each student’s pre relationship to schooling, I reviewed the educational histories and experiences shared in our interviews. A theme of alienation from school began to emerge, and I turned to the alienation literature for guidance. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983)</xref>, the components of alienation include powerlessness, social isolation, and normlessness. These resonated with the data, based on the students’ self-reported perceptions of their school conditions, and belief in their power to change those conditions (powerlessness); relationships with teachers and peers, and extracurricular involvement (social isolation); and records of achievement and discipline (school norms). After examining each individual “case,” I conducted a cross-case analysis of the students in both program years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211411079">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>). I found that groups of students shared beliefs and behaviors that could be designated as low, medium, and high levels of alienation from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831211411079">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the impact of the school activism program, I juxtaposed the first and second interviews (if available), examined the students’ judgment of the program’s influence, and noted standpoints suggesting political self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Here I observed that the students’ initial level of alienation corresponded with the disparate results of the program. To search out disconfirming evidence, I also checked the students’ social background, their school enrollment, and the study’s design elements against the pattern of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211411079">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211411079">Patton, 2002</xref>).

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results sections follow the trajectory of individual students before, during, and after their organizing and activism for school reform. The Before the School Activism Program section describes students’ prior relationship to schooling, both to demonstrate the social and psychological harm of poor educational conditions and to provide a baseline for the subsequent analysis. The During the School Activism Program section offers a portrait of what students actually did to organize and improve their schools, and context for the ensuing results. The After the School Activism section analyzes the outcomes for students of participating in school organizing and activism, gauging their feelings of self-efficacy to influence school change.</p>

<title>Before the School Activism Program: A Continuum of Alienation</title>
<p>At school, a student’s alienation can consist of a sense of powerlessness, social isolation, and a disregard for school norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>). Prior to their participation in school activism, all of the youth expressed some degree of alienation from their school experience. The following discussion describes each student’s “pre” relationship to schooling: grouped by shared experience into low, medium, and high levels of alienation.</p>

<title>Low levels of alienation—Students attending suburban schools</title>
<p>That Jodi and Serena would join a school activism program appeared, at first, implausible. Both students lived in Gorham but attended school in suburban communities through a metropolitan desegregation plan. Both had high opinions of their suburban schools: “I appreciate, like, the things we have,” said Serena of Atwood High School, whereas Jodi felt “fortunate” to attend Hazelcrest with its “good supplies and good teachers.” Respect for their teachers’ talents facilitated “really close” relationships. When I asked Serena about school issues, she told me, “I don’t have any.” Jodi mentioned class size increases, a result of statewide budget cuts, but her positive experiences prevailed. Nurtured at school, both students put great effort into their education and excelled. A freshman, Serena described herself as a “conscientious” student with a “4-year plan” to get into college. Senior year, Jodi kept her “focus on school” and narrowed her college choices. Jodi played in the school band, and Serena founded a club for Black female students. They were, they felt, beneficiaries of a quality suburban education.</p>
<p>For Serena and Jodi, a disturbing reality lay alongside this esteem for suburban schooling: Their urban neighbors, relatives, and friends were shortchanged by comparison. At school, however, the subject of inequality appeared taboo. Jodi explained that if she tried to discuss the “difference between suburban schools and GSD schools” with suburban students, she faced a wall of denial. People would tell her, “No it’s not, no it’s not” and use the budget cuts at the suburban school to deny its more advantaged status. Serena, meanwhile, did not feel confident enough to speak “about the differences” without more concrete information. “I just can’t, if I didn’t know anything about it. I wouldn’t feel like talking about it.” As students who traveled daily between the city and the suburbs, Jodi and Serena observed educational disparity. Yet prior to their participation in the school activism program, they were reluctant to articulate their views, knowing they faced potential criticism.</p>

<title>Low levels of alienation—Students attending urban schools</title>
<p>Before enlisting in the first year’s school activism program, Brea, Keyona, and Deja praised pieces of their urban educational experience. About Baldwin, a renowned magnet school, Keyona said she felt “proud” to attend. Brea “loved” St. Xavier, a Catholic school in a low-income Gorham neighborhood with a good, not stellar reputation. Deja called Odana “one of the top schools in Gorham,” an opinion related to her participation in its college-preparatory sequence. All of the students felt prepared to “go to colleges.” Their teachers, they said, “make sure that their job is being done” and “if you need help” are very “supportive.” Speaking for the rest of these students, Brea said, “I had really good relationships with most if not all of my teachers.” Keyona and Brea participated in a seemingly impossible number of extracurricular activities and Deja ran track. All achieved just under an A average and enrolled in challenging courses. Through such intensive engagement, they were located at the center of school life.</p>
<p>Yet the students knew that their urban schools had significant flaws. For Keyona, the tardiness policy at Baldwin was a concern, as it stipulated suspension after three late arrivals. The lack of school safety also became unsettling following some serious student fights. At Odana, the inconsistent application of school rules was a major issue for Deja. However, “the worst thing about our school is some of the conditions we’re in because we’re an older school”: “paint is coming off” the walls, the bathrooms are “nasty,” and “classrooms in the winter is cold and the summer is hot.” Making Brea “mad” were “all the new teachers” cycling through St. Xavier because of teacher turnover. With the roster of teachers constantly changing, “How we supposed to learn?” she asked. All of these students identified a lengthy list of obstacles to their own education and that of their fellow students.</p>
<p>Distressed over their schools’ shortfalls, the students also felt responsible for their own success. Keyona “make[s] sure my grades reflect who I am.” Deja put inordinate pressure on herself to achieve highly. “I think of myself as a student who has potential but sometimes I don’t live up to that.” She “set goals” and allowed herself “no excuse[s].” Brea explained that she is ultimately accountable for her progress. “Your key to life is education,” she said. “How are you gonna better yourself if you don’t know anything? . . . You need to take that on yourself.”</p>
<p>Given the importance of achievement for these students, they were highly apprehensive about making their school concerns known. Brea’s unassertiveness emanated from classroom norms. “’Cause like, students, we have this fear. . . . You have been taught, like, what you do in class. You sit in class, you listen. You raise your hand.” Echoing this timidity, Keyona feared receiving “the wrong vibe” from school officials. “The first bad sign of negativity would just bring our spirits down,” she explained. Deja edited out her concerns for similar reasons. She had “lots of strong feelings about . . . school” but found herself “afraid to talk to people,” students or adults, about these issues. Considering the risks, the three students did not publicly express their misgivings. Instead, they did what school expected of them and focused on their achievement.</p>
<p>Two members of the second year’s school activism program shared their single-mindedness. Alise had “that goal” to attend college and resolved to be a “good student” to get there. Marcus sought to “maintain” his academic performance and had already picked out a university. Accordingly, Alise and Marcus did their homework, studied for tests, and tended to their grades. In class, I observed both students answer teachers’ recitation questions and seek help on course content. Alise kept up a teasing banter with her teachers, behavior they indulged. Marcus joined extracurricular activities that trended toward the artistic, whereas Alise’s were athletic. Overall, the two students were involved in the social and academic life of the school, held good relationships with school staff, and held strong records of achievement.</p>
<p>Indeed, from the outside, Marcus and Alise’s educational experiences looked fairly rosy. However, they described an internal struggle to engineer their academic success while constantly evading obstructions. Marcus, who attended Hayes, a citywide magnet school, objected to teachers who “don’t care about they job,” poor maintenance and safety, and unappetizing food. At Odana, Alise worried about the “dirty” bathrooms with “scorching hot water,” leftover food, a seemingly absentee principal, and the “crazy” tardy policy.</p>
<p>“Before they introduced that project, I really didn’t think much about changing the school,” Marcus said, referring to the School Accountability Project. Instead, he went “to school every day with, like, ‘Oh, that’s bad but I can’t do nothing about it.’” A junior, he resigned himself to “one more year of this.” Alise also decided to endure her educational surroundings. “I think if I never joined this program, I would have just kept all these thoughts inside.” Like their first-year counterparts, Marcus and Alise hid their unease and concentrated on their success.</p>

<title>Medium levels of alienation—Students attending urban schools</title>
<p>Kendrell and La’Nae had a middling relationship to school prior to their engagement in the school activism program’s first year. As Kendrell put it, “Odana is good moments, Odana had its bad moments” and overall “it was pretty decent.” Enrolled primarily in general education courses, Kendrell thought some of his teachers were “alright” whereas others were guilty of favoritism and “lack of attention.” La’Nae felt she was receiving “a good education” at Wright, a vocational-emphasis school with average academic standing. There were “mentors” on the faculty who she believed “taught real good.” On the other hand, she experienced sexual harassment, racism, and teachers who talked to her “any kind of way.” La’Nae described herself as “a great student,” and achieved a 3.1 GPA. Kendrell had a “horrible” record but in class he “always wanted to answer questions, always wanted to be a part of something.” Activities filled an important slot in the school day: La’Nae was a cheerleader, and Kendrell belonged to several clubs. Both moved in large social networks. “Being with all your friends” was one of the best things about Wright for La’Nae. At Odana, remembered Kendrell, “everybody knew who I was.”</p>
<p>Although they got along in their schools and participated in its mainstream events, La’Nae and Kendrell reacted strongly when problems arose with teachers, the on-campus lunch policy, and the strict dress code. For example, suggestive comments from a teacher made La’Nae “mad to the point that I stopped going to his class. And I ended up failing his class.” Similarly, Kendrell said, “I was the type of person that blew up” when teachers or administrators acted in what he felt were inappropriate ways. La’Nae and Kendrell often accepted school norms, but they also described struggling with anger over the impediments present in their schools.</p>

<title>High levels of alienation—Students attending urban schools</title>
<p>Before he participated in the first year’s school activism program, Darin was in serious educational trouble. Recently expelled, he transferred to Plymouth, a school that was “supposed to be” college preparatory, although Darin did not believe so. In a big school like his, “when it’s a lot of students, the teachers are more irritable,” Darin noticed. He also clashed with an administrator who in Darin’s assessment was “stereotyping” him based on his “baggy pants.” He received no help from his guidance counselor who “never liked me.” The security guards yelled constantly and treated him rudely. On top of these relational issues, Darin reported his school was unclean, had a terrible lunch, and imposed an “embarrassing” tardy policy that forced students to stand for 30 minutes in punishment while missing class time.</p>
<p>Darin did not take these conditions lightly. He talked back to teachers and refused to stand during the tardy period. When he disagreed with his treatment, Darin said, “I just used to be, I think, too aggressive. . . . I would intimidate people.” His behavior got him “sent home” repeatedly “for 3 days” of suspensions. As for academic investment, Darin told me he would try if his teachers also exercised effort and patience, but noted these conditions were rare. His preference for “hands-on” learning contrasted with the “reading and writing” curriculum and contributed to his low-C average. Darin expressed antagonism toward a school where he related poorly with staff, felt unsupported as a learner, and received, to his mind, unjust sanctions.</p>
<p>Three students from the second year’s program, Nikki, Roland, and Jon, also took an extremely dim view of school prior to their participation. At Crandall, a small school that often received disciplinary transfers, Nikki observed plenty of problems: “I don’t learn nothing,” “it’s boring and hot in the classroom,” the lunch hour is “chaotic,” “the teachers don’t care what the students do,” and the “students don’t care” either. Asked which of these school issues she would most like to change, Nikki replied, “It should just be closed. Is that one of my options?” Roland drew a blank when I asked him to identify the “best thing” about Odana, where he took a mix of basic and advanced classes. “I don’t really like everything at the school,” he said.</p>
<p>With its high rankings and magnet status, Jon’s school stood out in the urban district. “Baldwin was like the top of the class in terms of academics” and “sports.” For his first 3 years of high school, Jon basked in this reputation, enrolling in challenging courses and playing on several teams. Then, Jon’s counselor unexpectedly informed him that because he had not taken a required class, he was not officially an honors student. The lower track courses he was “forced” into taking instead were “the dumb classes, the classes that we don’t have any kind of curriculum, we don’t follow any textbooks, we don’t have any kind of schedule.” For students enrolled in these classes, Jon said, Baldwin was “a really low school” and “a waste of time.”</p>
<p>Jon, Nikki, and Roland judged their teachers in the same disapproving terms as their schools. “Me and the art teacher don’t get along,” Nikki declared, and her math teacher “don’t explain nothing right.” Of his school staff, Roland said, “I don’t like them. I only like one teacher of mine.” Roland’s teachers told me the feeling was mutual. Speaking of Roland, the biology teacher said, “He just sits there. Surly.” When I told the math teacher I would be following Roland for the day, he said, “I feel sorry for you but be my guest.” Jon complained bitterly of a teacher who “didn’t give a damn” and “didn’t teach anything.” The students viewed their interactions with teachers as just one more indication of a negative school experience.</p>
<p>Roland, Nikki, and Jon had no hesitation about broadcasting their displeasure over these experiences. Roland talked back to his teachers and pulled his hood over his head for “nap time” during Spanish class. Nikki frequently both slept in and skipped class, and directly confronted a teacher when she believed she was treated unfairly—an action that got her suspended twice. Jon stopped going to school altogether. “I missed so many days,” he said, that “I almost dropped out of high school this year.” The three students brazenly flouted school expectations and rules.</p>
<p>These responses to school translated into profound academic divestment. “I did nothing,” Jon said of his senior year, whereas Roland admitted, “I never study” for tests. “I could be a good student until you make me mad,” said Nikki, adding that she was often angry in school. Their lack of engagement showed in their achievement: Jon’s GPA dropped precipitously following his demotion to low track classes and repeated absences. Roland’s grades were so low he was obliged to repeat courses in summer school. Nikki received mostly “C’s and U’s,” the latter a designation for “unsatisfactory.” Neither Nikki nor Roland participated in extracurricular activities at school, and Jon joined them after being kicked off his sports teams for low achievement and truancy. Together, they were only limitedly involved in school, had fairly hostile relationships with teachers, and maintained poor academic records. The 13 youth in this study started from very different places upon engaging in school activism.</p>

<title>During the School Activism Program: Organizing and Acting for School Reform</title>
<p>Inside the M4C school activism program, students experienced different aspects of social organizing depending on the year they participated, including building relationships, developing common understandings, and taking action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>During the first year of the program, the Students Changing Schools (SCS) members worked to establish clubs on their high school campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831211411079">Taines, 2010a</xref>). They solicited their teachers’ sponsorship of the so-called “SCS chapters,” and the program staff assisted by acting as liaisons when needed. The student organizers then recruited their peers by posting flyers, drafting friends, and making presentations in homeroom. All except Darin organized enough teachers and students to create an official club for school reform.</p>
<p>In their SCS chapters, the organizers facilitated meetings designed to share information and locate common concerns. A prevalent theme across chapters was the students’ desire for better relationships with teachers. Their school-specific interests included Odana’s facilities, the lunch served at Wright, St. Xavier’s high tuition, and safety at Baldwin.</p>
<p>A few of the student collectives (and in one case, an individual) took action on the problematic features of their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831211411079">Taines, 2010b</xref>). At Wright, the student activists coordinated by La’Nae advocated for an off-campus lunch option by lobbying administrators and launching a petition drive. Over at Baldwin, unease about school safety prompted Keyona and fellow activists to request more security guards from the school’s leadership. Darin pursued an off-campus lunch policy alone by meeting with an assistant principal and a counselor. He also pushed for the expansion of a state program that covers the costs of taking college courses in high school. The students did not achieve these hoped-for reforms, as their schools resisted the campaigns. The first-year members varied over what they took from the program experience, many maintaining an efficacy to influence future school changes and others feeling less sure.</p>
<p>During the second year of the school activism program, the members of the School Accountability Project (SAP) developed a survey for local students with the purpose of identifying priorities for school change. In the process, the SAP members, who importantly attended both urban and suburban high schools, constructed knowledge of educational disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831211411079">Taines, 2011</xref>). For example, Roland, who attended Odana in Gorham said, “I learned that some schools have way more work than my school do . . . like Hazelcrest,” the suburban school Jodi attended. Serena expressed her heightened awareness, “that some kids don’t have the same stuff as I had” at suburban Atwood High. The SAP students encoded these new understandings in their survey, hoping that collecting evidence on inequality would motivate officials to act.</p>
<p>Although the SAP members experienced the first two stages of social organizing, by forming shared understandings of the educational system and building political relationships, they did not engage in the final stage, taking social action. Constraints of time and staff turnover precluded their distribution of the survey. Nonetheless, the school activism program facilitated social insights, coalitions, and sometimes an individual efficacy to influence school change.</p>

<title>After the School Activism Program: Self-Efficacy and Continued Alienation</title>

After the school activism program, the students’ development of self-efficacy varied, with two exceptions, according to their initial level of alienation from school (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831211411079">Table 5</xref>).

<title>Self-efficacy outcomes—Students attending suburban schools</title>
<p>The students who attended suburban schools recognized that they received an education of high caliber. Yet it was not until the school activism program that they felt comfortable discussing, or seeking to address, the relative quality of the urban school system.</p>
<p>Serena credited the SAP team with teaching her more about the gaps between urban and suburban schools. With this knowledge, Serena felt she could speak out. “I know, so I would feel OK talking about it.” Having survey results would add to her courage in these conversations because she could demonstrate to others, “you actually know, have proof.” Similarly, Jodi felt that with the survey, she would “have it on paper to show you” that “this is true compared to your school,” and convince suburban residents once and for all that “there is a difference between suburban schools and GSD schools.” New knowledge and confidence in the power of data expanded their resources for challenging educational inequality.</p>
<p>Jodi and Serena utilized these resources by publicly engaging with the issue while at school. Serena discussed what she learned about the contrast between urban and suburban schools with her health teacher and several other staff. When teachers raised educational topics in class, Jodi contributed her perspectives about budget cuts and teacher shortages. Through these conversations, Jodi and Serena gained some experience articulating their concerns about educational inadequacy and disparity to a suburban audience.</p>

<title>Self-efficacy outcomes—Students attending urban schools</title>
<p>Within the urban school environment, students who received good marks while containing their distress gained a belief in their contribution to reform.</p>
<p>Keyona, Brea, and Deja credited the school activism program with counteracting their “fear” of speaking out. “They always stressed that youth have a voice,” Keyona recalled, and she took this belief as her own. “We have power. We’re no different than a sixty-four year old. . . . We have the same voice.” Brea extracted this conviction from both the program and the camaraderie of her fellow activists. “You have all these students from all over the city. . . . It brings you all together. . . . You are so powerful to do anything.” The leadership experience in SCS, Deja testified, altered her entire personality. “SCS personally affected me as to be a more outgoing person and stand up for what I believe in.” The students internalized the program’s messages, and reenvisioned themselves as influential social actors.</p>
<p>Moreover, the three believed they could apply their influence to the school domain. The program “gave me confidence to know that if I feel passionate about a certain situation, going on to display that to an administrator or the staff. Or go to the school district and display what I feel.” Deja anticipates assertively stating her concerns to multiple educational stakeholders. Brea told me definitively, “I’m gonna effect my change” to the educational system through her choice of career. “I think that’s like one of the reasons why I’m going into Education now. . . . That was [what] my stake in SCS did for me.” Out of the school activism program, Keyona had the “good realization” that “students can do things on their own.” This “helped us stand up on our own two feet and realize, if no one else is gonna help us, we have to do it for ourselves.” The students felt they had a new capacity to promote school improvement.</p>
<p>Keyona, Deja, and Brea employed this capacity in subsequent educational change efforts. The year following the program, Keyona joined a different youth organization that advocated for statewide increases in school funding. Deja and a student from another high school created a petition that protested fee increases in the district. Brea became a member of her college’s multicultural students’ association and a club that promoted campus diversity. An activist inclination persisted as these students moved onto new stages of their lives.</p>
<p>Like Brea, Keyona, and Deja, Marcus and Alise had school support networks, schedules full of clubs and activities, and excellent records of achievement. And like them, Marcus and Alise drew on the school activism program to overcome their earlier adaptations of acquiescence and silence in school. “Now I say what’s in my mind when I feel like it,” Marcus reported. “Before I couldn’t do that.” Alise related that the program “showed me that I have a voice that do count” and gave her the resolve to “use it more. Take advantage of what I got.” The program legitimated the voices of these second-year participants, allowing them to conceive of expressing discontent with unfair conditions.</p>
<p>As they considered many school practices to be unfair, Marcus and Alise increasingly felt they could pose a challenge. Marcus said the program gave him the “skills to take stands for stuff that I believe in.” The program showed Alise, “You can tell your teachers, ‘OK, I understand, I respect you, but we don’t feel happy about this.’” Both Marcus and Alise asserted they were capable of striving for and accomplishing reform. “I definitely feel like I can make a change at Odana.” The school activism program provided these students with a confidence in their ability to transform their schools.</p>
<p>Independently and on their own initiative, Marcus and Alise tested this new resolve. Before their school survey was ready for distribution, Marcus circulated a copy among his friends to gauge the student body’s potential reaction. Alise took this same opportunity to interview her fellow students. “I will ask somebody, ‘How do you feel about school?’ ‘What do you think is wrong with our school?’” In these impromptu interviews, she gathered students’ perspectives on discipline, guidance counseling, and teachers’ attitudes toward students. “I had to see what some people would say,” she said, of her decision to pilot the survey. The students applied their new sense of competence by making an initial foray into school engagement.</p>

<title>Mixed outcomes—Students attending urban schools</title>
<p>For students who experienced volatility in their achievement and school relationships, the school activism program could have similarly fluctuating results.</p>
<p>La’Nae and Kendrell benefited from the school activism program by learning how to communicate the “right” way with school adults. “You have to ask. . . . You gotta be respectful also, especially when you’re talking to others,” said La’Nae, explaining her new approach. The program taught Kendrell new strategies as well. “[They] showed me a lot of leadership. Like, how to handle situations.” Kendrell’s expertise, he believed, obliged teachers to treat struggling students like him differently. “That’ll make them look [and say], ‘OK, they really serious about this.’” The students developed tactics for making educators more receptive to their concerns.</p>
<p>La’Nae and Kendrell applied these new skills to their individual school circumstances. Kendrell engendered smoother relationships with teachers by speaking calmly, “so you won’t be getting in trouble.” La’Nae became more vigilant about her welfare. “With our group, we start[ed] saying like, ‘We know our rights. . . . Respect is even.’ I know I did personally.” For example, La’Nae “talked to [the principal] about one teacher personally that I just felt . . . was kind of racist” and the school “put him under investigation.” The students used assets gained in SCS to advocate for their own education.</p>
<p>Experience with school advocacy persuaded Kendrell and La’Nae that they could advance school reform in the future. “The SCS showed you could do this,” Kendrell said. Furthermore, the outlook for these efforts appeared bright. “Me and . . . my fellow SCS members, we realized that . . . the possibilities was high,” La’Nae said, of accomplishing school change. “Just as long as we put our minds together and go about it right, we could do anything.” The school activism program encouraged optimism in the students about their potential contribution.</p>
<p>And yet La’Nae’s subsequent school experiences undermined her newfound confidence. During her tenure in SCS, La’Nae participated in a fight on school grounds, was expelled from Wright, and enrolled in another school (Crandall) for which she saw little value. The disruption prompted her to leave SCS since M4C’s office was too far away from her new school. Disconnection from the program, in turn, eroded La’Nae’s faith in her ability to accomplish school change. “If I woulda been still a part [of SCS], I think Crandall would be different and I would like going there,” she said. Instead, La’Nae observed, including herself in this assessment, “All we do at Crandall is complain.” A prior history of uneasy compliance with school, combined with a sudden detachment from the program’s support structure, undermined La’Nae’s determination to challenge school practice.</p>
<p>In contrast, the shift in Kendrell’s orientation toward schooling and activism endured. After graduation, he maintained his connections with M4C; the organization helped him locate employment and nominated him to the Gorham city council’s youth advisory board. Serving in this capacity, Kendrell continued his efforts to improve the quality of life for youth in Gorham. Thus, the participation of La’Nae and Kendrell in school activism had mixed outcomes, with the two students holding differing beliefs in their influence over school policy.</p>

<sec id="section19-0002831211411079">
<title>Continued alienation—Students attending urban schools</title>
<p>The majority of unsuccessful, disconnected, and defiant students did not take a dramatic turn after their participation in the school activism program.</p>
<p>Darin was the anomaly in this group. The change began with Darin finding new ways to communicate with teachers and administrators. After the community organization staff “showed me” how, “I think I learned how to talk to people in a way in which they understand.” These more effective communication strategies included “try[ing] to be calm and address issues of course.” Darin also learned to modulate his message and demeanor based on his audience. “I gotta sense for people. . . . Like, I can kinda read people . . . to some extent better now.”</p>
<p>Having these resources at his disposal reinforced Darin’s courage to challenge the school policies he strenuously disagreed with. “I know it built my confidence . . . in talking to the teachers,” he said. Rather than simply retaliating against unfair treatment and poor conditions, this confidence spurred a new approach: “It made me wanna make changes at my school.” After attempting to do so while in high school, his actions “made me think, ‘Man, I could be a teacher in the future. Or a principal. And I could just make all the changes.’” Darin asserted his ability to better his school and potentially contribute to even larger improvements.</p>
<p>Advocating for school-level change encouraged Darin to alter his own educational predicament. After a year at Plymouth, he negotiated for readmission to a school from which he had previously been expelled. “It worked the way I talked. ’Cause I had to talk to get back in the school I’m in now. And then I’m back there and . . . I’m graduating.” Darin successfully used his school organizing skills to promote his personal educational success.</p>
<p>Such drastic conversion experiences were rare among students with prior, intensely negative experiences in school. Roland, Nikki, and Jon believed it was pointless to engage in efforts to promote school change—even after their participation in the school activism program.</p>
<p>These students judged the feasibility of inserting themselves in school matters by the caliber of their relationships with educators. Of his teachers and administrators, Roland said, “I wouldn’t go talk to them” because “they don’t care.” Jon thought he could probably “complain,” but he was convinced that “nothing else happens” as a result. “They don’t listen. . . . I don’t think they care.” Nikki held similar views of her school’s receptiveness. “Everybody’s not going to listen to me and say what I do.” In any event, “We’re already telling them and they’re not doing nothing,” Nikki said. On school-sponsored surveys, “They ask us, ‘Are you learning anything? Are your teachers helping you out? Do you feel safe?’ . . . I don’t see no change after you turn the survey in.” In fact, these students felt certain that if they tried to advocate for school change, they would personally suffer a backlash. One of Roland’s main school concerns was the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Asked if he could initiate improvement in this area, he replied, “They might snap on [get angry at] us then.” Jon tried the year before to address his low-track course assignments, but his counselors “just pointed the blame on me,” a response he expected to be repeated if he attempted to alter school policy again. The students left the school activism program doubtful that greater engagement in school could yield a favorable response or a modicum of change.</p>
<p>Given the futility of the effort, the three students expressed few intentions of becoming involved in school practice in the future. Asked whether she approached her teachers or administrators about school problems, Nikki replied, “Only the principal and that’s when I’m about to get suspended.” Making changes in her school seemed impossible: “No, not by myself,” Nikki said. As a graduating senior, Jon “figured it wouldn’t do anything anyway” to try to change either his own situation or the school in general. Although Jon felt powerless as a student, he did express the aspiration to become a politician and someday “do something about GSD,” the urban school district. Roland believed he could accomplish changes “if I said something,” but he told me, “I don’t really want to.” He explained,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes I just don’t feel like doing nothing. And sometimes I just don’t feel like doing what I’m supposed to do. And sometimes I just do stuff when I have to or when I know there is time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Roland speaks to an unrelenting apathy that Nikki and Jon also shared. Participation in the school activism program did not alter the group’s pessimism or disengagement. Like all of the students in this study, the potential for activism to reconfigure their response to schooling was constrained by their educational histories.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inside their schools, urban students have few outlets to discuss, much less act on, the obstacles they see around them. Contending with the silences and shortfalls of underresourced urban schools elicits extensive alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211411079">Fine, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211411079">Fine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>). Students express their alienation from school on a continuum of increasing severity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831211411079">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>At lower levels of alienation, the enormity of school problems and the lack of occasion to object leave students feeling powerless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211411079">Newmann, 1981</xref>). Yet they accommodate the mores and conditions of their schools in exchange for the possibility of academic rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">Fine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211411079">Fine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>). Since less severely alienated students are often successful, we may be inclined to settle for this reaction. But students’ responses to schooling are not static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831211411079">Cammarota &amp; Fine, 2008</xref>, p. 4). Continued exposure to serious educational problems can aggravate the alienation of acquiescent students. At heightened levels, students who already feel powerless will also withdraw from institutional life and rebuff school norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211411079">Seeman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211411079">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211411079">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211411079">Twining, 1980</xref>). Retaliating instead with oppositional behavior, highly alienated students face school sanctions, limited support, low achievement, and increased odds of dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211411079">Fine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211411079">Stanton-Salazar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211411079">Willis, 1977</xref>). Enhancing the prevalence of success among urban students requires diminishing the likelihood of such an educationally destructive response.</p>
<sec id="section21-0002831211411079">
<title>Antecedents of School Activism</title>
<p>Prior to their participation in the school activism program, the students in this study responded to urban schooling on a continuum of alienation. Seven students—Serena, Jodi, Brea, Keyona, Deja, Marcus, and Alise—possessed low but consequential levels of alienation that manifested as powerlessness. Serena and Jodi suppressed concerns over the disparities between urban schools and theirs, fearing arguments from suburban residents. The others encountered the poor state of urban schools firsthand but held achievement ideologies compelling conformity to “what you do in class.” These students muffled their grievances to ensure their academic success.</p>
<p>La’Nae and Kendrell were situated in the middle of the alienation continuum. Both had good relations with some teachers, large friendship networks, and many activities. However, they occasionally “blew up” at school, anger substituting for a lack of power to improve their welfare. La’Nae and Kendrell were largely integrated in school life but at times broke with school norms.</p>
<p>Four students—Darin, Roland, Nikki, and Jon—held a highly alienated position in response to their urban school experiences. Between them, they refused to participate in class, neglected schoolwork, and were frequently truant. Bitter relations with teachers and many peers, and the absence of activities, combined to create an isolated school existence. Their isolation and disregard of school norms took a toll—all had records of course failure and disciplinary referrals.</p>
<p>The dynamic nature of this continuum is apparent in the stories of Jon and La’Nae. Early in his high school career, Jon knew that urban schools like his lacked resources but trained his attention on his own success. Yet when counselors placed him in low-level classes with underprepared teachers, Jon’s alienation flared. During her program participation, La’Nae slipped from a mixed position to the more alienated end of the spectrum: getting expelled and dissociating from her academic commitments. These developments illustrate the precariousness of students’ footing in alienating school contexts, and the tendency toward harmful responses.</p>
<p>And yet healthier responses to urban schooling are possible. Students may adopt a disposition of collective struggle, a conviction that individuals can challenge social injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211411079">O’Connor, 1997</xref>, p. 621). None of the urban youth in this study, prior to their participation in a program supporting their school activism, believed they could challenge or change their educational institutions—confirming the rarity of this orientation. Nonetheless, the constructive response found in the prior literature, combined with evidence that responses to schooling are fluid, suggests an opening for interventions into the predominant, alienated pattern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0002831211411079">
<title>Outcomes of School Activism</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that youth activism for school reform holds promise as an intervention that reduces the incidence of alienation among urban students. The majority of students—9 out of the 13—developed a sense of efficacy to influence school change after participating in school organizing and activism. The 7 students with low-level alienation no longer felt powerless in the face of harmful school circumstances. For 2 of the students with initially higher levels of alienation, school activism dissipated their powerlessness, normlessness, and isolation. However, higher alienation persisted for 4 students despite the opportunity to organize and take action in their schools.</p>
<sec id="section23-0002831211411079">
<title>From low-level alienation to political self-efficacy</title>
<p>As a result of the school activism program, partially alienated students felt their powerlessness lift, spurring them to express their critique of urban schooling. In their suburban schools, Jodi and Serena grew “OK talking about it,” and did so with their teachers and peers. Those attending urban schools—Brea, Keyona, Deja, Marcus, and Alise—found the “confidence” to “take stands” on their schools’ inadequacy, and a personal belief that “you are so powerful to do anything,” including achieve school change. The opening for school organizing and activism gave each of these students a sense of efficacy to influence school practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211411079">Bandura, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The students’ prior orientation toward school facilitated this positive result. They had been distressed, anxious, and fearful about urban school problems, but their alienation was not so acute as to sever their bonds with school. With high achievement, good relationships with teachers, and intense extracurricular involvement, the seven youth had a shorter distance to travel to become advocates for school change. Speaking with educators about school issues, and having a positive impact on their schools, seemed within reach. Their low levels of alienation predisposed them to the school activism program’s model of student empowerment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0002831211411079">
<title>From higher alienation to political self-efficacy</title>
<p>After participating in the school activism program, Kendrell and Darin’s intense alienation from school receded. Kendrell learned to communicate his “serious[ness]” about school issues and avoid “getting into trouble,” capacities he employed in his personal dealings with teachers and in his work on behalf of youth citywide. Whereas he used to be “too aggressive” with school authorities, Darin developed a “calm” demeanor that allowed him to “talk to people in a way they understand.” He successfully negotiated his way back into a preferred school, securing a diploma that had previously been in doubt. The experience with school activism instilled in both students a desire to “make changes at my school” and a belief that “you could do this.” The school activism program enabled their movement from acute alienation to self-efficacy, which they applied to their own, and their peers’, educational success. Yet among the deeply alienated students in this study, this was an infrequent outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0002831211411079">
<title>Higher alienation persists</title>
<p>For most students with higher levels of alienation from school, the school activism program had less influence. La’Nae’s resolve to “stand up” for students’ “rights” competed with rising alienation. After her expulsion from school and disconnection from the school activism program, La’Nae no longer felt powerful enough to alter the circumstances of her education. The program’s ability to durably intervene in La’Nae’s elevated alienation was finite.</p>
<p>Nikki, Roland, and Jon expressed an even more profound alienation from school—and this position persisted following their participation in the school activism program. Their schools “don’t care,” they said, and teachers and administrators would just “blame” them if they tried to address school problems. Any effort they made would do nothing to improve the situation, they believed: “It wouldn’t have done anything anyway.” Through this apathetic lens, the students could see no other options for engaging with school besides continued oppositional behavior.</p>
<p>The students least affected by the school activism program had few connections to fellow teachers and students’ and scant involvement in school activities. Detached from school life, the possibility of participating in school change appeared remote. Requesting their teachers’ cooperation seemed unimaginable based on prior, ubiquitously hostile interactions. Their feelings of marginalization made the suggestion that they could influence their schools suspect. The magnitude of their alienation from school tested the capacity of school activism to intervene.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0002831211411079">
<title>Implications for Research and Practice</title>
<p>The opportunity to participate in school activism was a potent intervention for students with partial alienation and significant investment in school. It may be tempting to dismiss this result—to assume from their academic performance that they were unharmed to begin with. However, this view overlooks the strain of navigating around the severe problems and resource shortages plaguing urban schools. The success of high-achieving urban youth typically masks the alienation these impediments evoke, and the risk that powerless indignation may deteriorate into oppositional resistance. Recognizing the struggles of successful urban students makes the significance of their transition from accepting to engaging educational inequality clearer.</p>
<p>The promise of school activism is further illustrated by the trajectory of two students who experienced a transition away from alienation along multiple dimensions. In Darin and Kendrell’s case, participating in school organizing and activism counteracted powerless disengagement, redirected normless, oppositional behavior, and lessened isolation at school. For them, and many of the other students in this study, school activism offered protection from alienation and an avenue for constructively responding to school.</p>
<p>The sparse prior literature foreshadowed these encouraging signs, posing school activism as advantageous for urban youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211411079">Kirshner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211411079">Larson &amp; Hansen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211411079">Mediratta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831211411079">Morrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211411079">Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211411079">Strobel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211411079">Su, 2009</xref>). Yet this study goes further than previous works by considering students’ prior, alienated responses to urban school conditions; following the thread of students’ development after participating in school activism; and investigating variation. Rather than universally positive outcomes, this article documents both favorable change and harmful stability in students’ relationship to schooling. Nearly all of the highly alienated students remained susceptible to powerlessness, isolation, normlessness—and school failure. As an intervention, the reach of school activism appears limited, and extremely alienated, oppositional students operate mostly out of range.</p>
<p>Although attained systematically, the small sample sizes included in this study qualify the conclusions presented here. The finding that school activism was not as effective for the most alienated students should offer guidance to future scholarship by encouraging the selection of both larger and stratified samples. The inclusion of students with histories of little engagement, low achievement, and referrals—in addition to school leaders and achievers—is vital to confirm the youth development outcomes of participating in school organizing and activism.</p>
<p>The results of this study should also provide guidance to educators in schools and community organizations interested in supporting youth movements. At its core, the study presents a conundrum: School activism is a means by which students overcome alienation, yet highly alienated students find this form of school engagement less accessible. Strengthening the intervention of youth activism may be the way forward, and we can look to students whose severe alienation subsided for direction. Darin and Kendrell identified learning how to communicate productively with educators as a critical component of their efficacy to participate in school change. This is a need particular to highly alienated students whose powerlessness is expressed as antagonism, not diffidence. To engage in school activism, such students need assistance deploying accepted school discourses and reconstructing relationships with teachers and administrators. Identifying students with these needs, customizing training, and offering steady support may foster political self-efficacy and more advantageous responses to school.</p>
<p>The limitations of youth activism also direct us toward <italic>what</italic> students are responding to in addition to how. When urban schools produce such widespread alienation, we must attend to the environment we ask them to “deal with”: from the macro obstacles—such as the neglect of our urban centers, social segregation, and inequitable educational funding—to the more micro, school-level problems that students see on the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211411079">Anyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211411079">Noguera, 2003</xref>). It will take the collective power of community members, educators, policymakers, and students to achieve the comprehensive urban educational reform required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211411079">Anyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211411079">Oakes &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831211411079">Warren, 2005</xref>). With fewer gaps in their education for alienation to flourish, more urban students will presume that a constructive, engaged disposition toward school is the obvious choice.</p>
