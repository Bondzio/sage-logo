<abstract>
<p><italic>Resilience</italic> is a term that refers to a person’s ability to successfully adapt to adversity. Resilience research has been relatively limited with older adults, particularly with older American Indians. Also, none of the resilience measures have been validated in older American Indians. This study’s objective was to assess the psychometric properties of the full 25-item and abbreviated 10-item versions of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) with a sample of older American Indians. Both CD-RISC versions performed similarly in the study sample compared with what has been reported in other populations. The full version demonstrated adequate internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity, but a meaningful factor structure was not confirmed. The abbreviated version showed good internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity and appeared to have a stable one-factor solution. These findings lend greater support to the use of the abbreviated version than the full version of the CD-RISC with older American Indians.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been growing research interest in resilience among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511431989">Becker &amp; Newsom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027511431989">Hardy, Concato, &amp; Gill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511431989">Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511431989">Hildon, Smith, Netuveli, &amp; Blane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027511431989">Kinsel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511431989">Lamond et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027511431989">Mehta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027511431989">Montross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027511431989">Wagnild, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027511431989">Wells, 2009</xref>). In this context, resilience has been most often conceptualized as adapting to life stressors and changes primarily associated with declining health. Much of the literature on aging and resilience has shown resilience to be associated with components of “successful aging” or “healthy aging,” such as functional independence, excellent or good mental and physical health, and social engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027511431989">Hardy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511431989">Lamond et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0164027511431989">Nygren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027511431989">Wells, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, we know virtually nothing about resilience in older American Indians, a group for whom the elevated prevalence of trauma exposure and higher rates of disease and disability make resilience a key construct to understand. Moreover, there are no validated measures of resilience in American Indians.</p>
<p>Understanding resilience is particularly relevant for older American Indians given the population’s increased likelihood of trauma exposure both contemporarily as well as historically. In a study of two American Indian reservation-based populations, participants exhibited higher trauma exposure than their general U.S. population counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511431989">Manson, Beals, Klein, Croy, &amp; the AI-SUPERPFP Team, 2005</xref>). It has been suggested that historical trauma among American Indians is a result of colonialism, genocide, forced relocation, boarding schools, acculturative stress, and racism that has been internalized and institutionalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511431989">Brave Heart &amp; DeBruyn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511431989">Gagne, 1998</xref>). For instance, a significant portion of today’s older American Indians attended Indian boarding schools, which were designed to assimilate American Indians into the “mainstream” and eradicate their culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511431989">Adams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027511431989">Davis, 2001</xref>). These historical events continue to be present in the minds of American Indians today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027511431989">Jervis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Older American Indians also experience hardships associated with poor health. More than one in five older American Indians have diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027511431989">Denny, Holtzman, Goins, &amp; Croft, 2005</xref>), which usually co-occurs with other chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511431989">Howard et al., 1999</xref>). Cardiovascular mortality rates in American Indians equal or exceed national all-races rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027511431989">Indian Health Service, 2009</xref>), and is the leading cause of death in American Indians beginning at age 45, whereas it does not become the leading cause of death in the general U.S. population until age 65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511431989">Howard et al., 1999</xref>). The data also indicate that older American Indians suffer some of the highest disability rates of any U.S. racial group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511431989">Goins, Moss, Buchwald, &amp; Guralnik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0164027511431989">Waidmann &amp; Liu, 2000</xref>), exceeding those of their White counterparts. Using 2000 census data, among persons aged 55 years and older, the prevalence of a functional limitation, mobility disability, and self-care disability was 36%, 21%, and 12% among American Indians compared with 25%, 17%, and 9% for Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511431989">Goins et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these issues faced by older American Indians make understanding resilience in this population especially salient. Surprisingly few studies have examined resilience among American Indians, with most focusing on adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511431989">Borowsky, Resnick, Ireland, &amp; Blum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511431989">LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, &amp; Whitbeck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0164027511431989">Strand, 2002</xref>). One study has been conducted, however, whose focus was on older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511431989">Grandbois &amp; Sanders, 2009</xref>). This study examined resilience with eight older American Indians with the objective to learn how they had coped with life’s challenges. The authors identified five themes from in-depth open-ended interviews: that resilience (a) must be understood within the context of the American Indian worldview; (b) is embedded in American Indian cultures; (c) is obtained from peers, families, and tribal communities; (d) comes from the connection with all creation; and (e) comes from a legacy of survival. These findings affirm the relevance of resilience with older American Indians and suggest the importance of ensuring that existing scales that operationalize resilience are valid with older American Indians.</p>
<p>Many survey-based resilience measures have been developed, including the Baruth Protective Factors Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511431989">Baruth &amp; Carroll, 2002</xref>), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0164027511431989">Sinclair &amp; Wallston, 2004</xref>), the Resilience Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0164027511431989">Wagnild &amp; Young, 1993</xref>), the Resilience Scale for Adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511431989">Friborg, Hjemdal, Rosenvinge, &amp; Martinussen, 2003</xref>), and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>). The CD-RISC appears to be one of the more widely used resilience measures. Although few such measures have been well validated, initial psychometric analyses of the CD-RISC have demonstrated support for its internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent and divergent validity in samples of Australian adolescents and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511431989">Burns &amp; Anstey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511431989">Gucciardi, Jackson, Coulter, &amp; Mallett, 2011</xref>), young U.S. adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>), general U.S. adults and patient populations aged 18 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>), Chinese adults aged 18 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0164027511431989">Yu &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>), and older adults aged 60 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511431989">Lamond et al., 2009</xref>). To accurately understand psychological constructs in any cultural group, it is necessary to use valid and reliable assessments. Moreover, it is imperative that culturally competent assessments be used. One way to address this need is to evaluate the utility of an existing measure with another cultural group.</p>
<p>Given the relevance of resilience with older American Indians and that no such measures have been validated in older American Indians, our study’s aim was to assess the psychometric properties of a popular measure of resilience, the CD-RISC, with a sample of older American Indians. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to (a) examine the internal consistency of the CD-RISC, (b) establish the convergent and diversity validity of the CD-RISC, and (c) compare the factor structure of the CD-RISC with what has been reported with other study populations.</p>

<title>Data Source</title>
<p>Data for this research were collected as part of the Native Elder Care Study, a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older members of an American Indian tribe. The participating tribe is a federally recognized tribe in a rural southeastern region of the U.S. The study gathered in-depth information via interviewer-administered surveys on disability-related issues, including functional ability, personal assistance needs, health conditions, psychosocial resources, and the use of health care and supportive services. Data were collected between July 2006 and August 2008. To be included in the study, participants had to be enrolled tribal members, aged 55 years or older, noninstitutionalized, cognitively intact, and residing in the tribe’s service area. A lower age criterion was used because research suggests that health declines with age more rapidly among American Indians than among other racial groups and that chronic disease burden is continuing to increase in American Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027511431989">Hayward &amp; Heron, 1999</xref>). In addition, many American Indian communities, including the tribe participating in this study, consider elders as those aged 55 years and older.</p>
<p>The tribal enrollment records indicated that there were 1,430 potentially eligible adults on the basis of age and residential location. Given that our target sample size was 500, random names were drawn from the list of potentially eligible adults and distributed to the interviewers, stratified by three age groups: 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 years and older. The age ranges in the groups were determined on the basis of the number of potential participants. In particular, there were not enough persons aged 85 years or older to use as an age group that would be equal in size to the younger age groups. We elected to stratify sampling on the basis of the age groups to ensure that we had equal representation of participants across the three age groups across the full range of ages greater than 55 years. Potentially eligible persons were invited to participate via telephone calls or home visits by interviewers. Forty-seven adults could not be located, 50 were determined to be ineligible [3 were living outside of the service area, 14 were living in a nursing home, 19 were deceased, 14 did not pass the dementia screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511431989">Inouye, Robison, Froehlich, &amp; Richardson, 1998</xref>)], and 78 declined participation. The remaining 505 participated in the study and received comprehensive, in-person assessments. All of the assessments were conducted by trained interviewers and lasted between 60 to 90 minutes. The majority of interviews were conducted in the participants’ homes (87%), and the remaining were performed in a tribal building. Propensity to decline participation increased with age, although this was not significant, and men were more likely to decline than women (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001).</p>
<p>Of these 505, a random sample was sought to participate in a substudy that included answering additional survey items regarding physical activity and resilience. At the conclusion of the main study survey, interviewers asked a random sample of participants if they would also participate in a substudy that involved answering additional questions that would take approximately 20 minutes. Our target sample size for the substudy was 175. As such, interviewers asked 191 of the 505 to participate in the substudy, with 2 refusals yielding a sample of 189 substudy participants. The tribe’s institutional review board, tribal council, and tribal elder council and the West Virginia University institutional review board approved both the main and substudies. All study participants received $20 gift cards for completing the main study interview and $10 gift cards for completing the substudy interview.</p>

<title>CD-RISC</title>
<p>This study examined the psychomotor properties of two versions of the CD-RISC, including the full scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>) and an abbreviated version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). The full CD-RISC consists of 25 items, such as “You can achieve your goals,” “I have a strong sense of purpose,” and “I am not easily discouraged by failure.” For each item, respondents indicated their level of agreement on a 5-point, Likert-type scale (0 = <italic>not true at all</italic>, 1 = <italic>rarely true</italic>, 2 = <italic>sometimes true</italic>, 3 = <italic>often true</italic>, and 4 = <italic>true nearly all of the time</italic>). To score the CD-RISC, responses for all 25 items are summed and can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater levels of resilience. In prior research, the full CD-RISC has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (e.g., α =.89; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>An exploratory factor analysis in a community-based general population sample yielded a five-factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>). These factors were labeled “personal competence, high standards, and tenacity;” “trust in one’s instincts, tolerance of negative affect, and strengthening effects of stress;” “positive acceptance of change and secure relationships;” “control;” and “spiritual influences.” However, subsequent studies have been unable to replicate this original five-factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511431989">Burns &amp; Anstey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511431989">Gucciardi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0164027511431989">Yu &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The abbreviated version of the CD-RISC examined in the present study was developed in response to the instability in the factor structure of the original (or full) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). The abbreviated version contains 10 of the original 25 items. The 10 items were identified on the basis of results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Six items were dropped because they did not load consistently onto any of the factors. The 2 items that constituted the “spiritual influences” factor were dropped, because factors with fewer than three indicators are generally viewed as poorly specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0164027511431989">MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996</xref>). An additional 4 items were dropped because they loaded onto a single factor with two disparate themes, which was, consequently, not interpretable. Finally, 3 items were dropped because of redundancy. The remaining 10 items loaded onto one factor. To score the abbreviated version, responses to all 10 items are summed and can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores reflective of greater resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). In prior research, the abbreviated CD-RISC has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (e.g., α =.85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The full CD-RISC is a widely used measure of resilience, but the abbreviated version appears to have better psychometric properties, including a more stable factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). However, neither version of the CD-RISC has been evaluated in an older American Indian population; thus, the psychometric properties of both the full and the abbreviated versions of the scale were examined in the present study.</p>

<title>Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS)</title>
<p>The MOS-SSS contains 19 items that measure emotional support, informational support, tangible support, positive social interaction, and affectionate support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027511431989">Sherbourne &amp; Stewart, 1991</xref>). When scored, the measure ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflective of more support. The MOS-SSS has been used with older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511431989">Lee, Gazmararian, &amp; Arozullah, 2006</xref>).

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>To assess the psychometric properties of the CD-RISC, we evaluated (a) internal consistency, (b) convergent and divergent validity, and (c) factor structure of both the full and abbreviated versions of the scale. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s α and item-total correlations. Convergent validity was assessed by examining the correlations of the full and abbreviated scales with the CES-D, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Personal Mastery Scale, and the MOS-SSS. These scales were selected because resilience is conceptually related to protection from depressive symptoms as well as self-efficacy, mastery, and social support, and prior studies have shown that resilience is negatively related to depressive symptoms and positively related to constructs such as social support and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>). To assess divergent validity, we examined the correlations between the full and abbreviated scale with handgrip strength and body mass index. These measures were chosen as examples of constructs that would not be expected to be strongly associated with resilience. Specifically, it was anticipated that the CD-RISC would be strongly correlated with depressive symptoms and self-efficacy, moderately correlated with personal mastery and social support, and unrelated to handgrip strength and body mass index.</p>
<p>To examine the factor structure of both the full and abbreviated versions of the CD-RISC, we tested a series of models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In the first model, we evaluated the full 25-item CD-RISC scale using the five-factor structure reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor and Davidson (2003)</xref>. The second model tested whether the five factors identified by Connor and Davidson loaded onto an overarching (second-order) construct (i.e., resilience). This model tested whether the items constituted a single, coherent scale in addition to five distinct subscales. In the final model, we evaluated whether the abbreviated 10-item scale presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills and Stein (2007)</xref> loaded onto a single factor.</p>
<p>All CFAs were conducted with maximum likelihood estimation using AMOS Version 18.0 structural equation software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511431989">Arbuckle, 2009</xref>). We considered factor loadings of .40 and higher as salient, consistent with practices reported by other investigators (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). Goodness of fit was evaluated using multiple indices of fit, including (a) relative χ<sup>2</sup>, which is the ratio of χ<sup>2</sup> to degrees of freedom, for which values less than 3 are recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511431989">Bollen, 1989</xref>); (b) the comparative fit index (CFI), which uses baseline comparisons, with values greater than .90 indicating good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0164027511431989">McDonald &amp; Ho, 2002</xref>); (c) the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), a parsimony-adjusted measure of model fit with values less than .08 indicating adequate fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0164027511431989">McDonald &amp; Ho, 2002</xref>); and (d) the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), an absolute fit index with values less than .08 demonstrating adequate fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0164027511431989">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1986</xref>). The CFI was weighted more heavily than the other fit statistics because it has been shown to be less dependent on sample size. Nonetheless, considering these indices jointly, and using these criteria, provides a cautious and sound evaluation of model fit.</p>
<p>Of the 189 substudy participants, 29 had incomplete data on one or more CD-RISC items. For our study, a complete case analysis was conducted; thus, the final sample included 160 of the 189 substudy participants. In the correlational analyses for convergent and divergent validity, listwise deletion was used for participants with any missing data on the measures used (see below for the number of participants included in each analysis). We examined whether there were statistically significant differences in age, sex, educational level, and annual household income between those with missing and those who had complete data on the CD-RISC. Tests revealed that those with missing data were statistically significantly more likely to be older.</p>

<p>The internal consistency of both the full and abbreviated CD-RISC appeared adequate. Cronbach’s α for the full CD-RISC was .93, and item-total correlations ranged from .32 to .77. In the abbreviated CD-RISC, Cronbach’s α was .88, and item-total correlations ranged from .51 to .70. Scores on the full CD-RISC in our sample were similar to the means and standard deviations reported in the initial evaluation of the measure with a community-based general population sample (<italic>M</italic> = 83.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.4 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 80.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.8, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>). Scores on the abbreviated CD-RISC were slightly higher in our sample compared with its initial evaluation with a sample of college students (<italic>M</italic> = 33.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.2 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 27.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.8, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>). The full and abbreviated CD-RISC scales were highly correlated with each other (<italic>r</italic> = .94, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001).</p>
<p>The convergent and divergent validity assessments demonstrated that the full and abbreviated versions of the CD-RISC were associated with the other measures in the expected directions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511431989">Table 2</xref>). Both the full and abbreviated CD-RISC versions were more strongly correlated with the CES-D than with any other measure; higher levels of resilience were related to lower levels of depressive symptomatology. Both versions of the CD-RISC were significantly and positively related to measures of self-efficacy, personal mastery, and social support. With regard to divergent validity, the full scale was weakly correlated with handgrip strength and had no significant relation to body mass index. The abbreviated scale was not significantly correlated with either handgrip strength or body mass index.</p>

<p>Subsequently, we tested a second model with the five latent factors from the first model loading onto a single higher order factor, representing the overarching construct of resilience. Each of the five factors had salient loadings onto the second-order construct, ranging from .61 to .98 (all <italic>p</italic> values &lt; .001; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027511431989">Table 3</xref>). As before, however, this model provided a suboptimal fit for the data. The CFI and the RMSEA did not fall within the specified a priori ranges and therefore suggested poor model fit, although the relative χ<sup>2</sup> and the SRMR suggested adequate fit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0164027511431989">Table 4</xref>). Taken together, these results did not support the notion that the five factors identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor and Davidson (2003)</xref> constituted a single, second-order latent construct (i.e., resilience).</p>
<p>Finally, we tested a third model examining whether the abbreviated 10-item CD-RISC constituted a single scale with all items loading onto one factor. All items had salient loadings onto the latent construct, ranging from .54 to .75 (all <italic>p</italic> values &lt;.001; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027511431989">Table 3</xref>). This one-factor solution provided a good fit for the data, satisfying a priori criteria for most fit indices, including the relative χ<sup>2</sup>, SRMR, and CFI. The RMSEA suggested less than optimal fit. However, the RMSEA has been shown to be negatively influenced by smaller sample sizes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to assess psychometric properties of the CD-RISC in community-dwelling older American Indians. American Indians’ elevated prevalence of trauma exposure and chronic health conditions are two reasons why resilience is an especially relevant construct for this population. As shown, our sample is no exception, with substantial percentages who attended Indian boarding schools, had traumatic experiences, had diabetes, had cardiovascular disease, and had at least one activity of daily living limitation.</p>
<p>Although the CD-RISC is one of several commonly used resilience measures, it has been neither successfully replicated nor validated with American Indians. Findings from the present study showed that the abbreviated 10-item CD-RISC showed good internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity and appeared to have a stable one-factor structure in older American Indians. In contrast, the full 25-item version of the CD-RISC demonstrated adequate internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity, but a meaningful factor structure was not confirmed. Thus, the full and abbreviated versions of the CD-RISC performed similarly in our sample compared with what has been reported in other populations. Overall, the present analysis lends greater support for the use of the abbreviated CD-RISC with older American Indians. Although both scale versions demonstrated sound psychometric properties, the abbreviated CD-RISC contained the same relations to other constructs, had greater parsimony, and had a more stable factor structure compared with the full CD-RISC.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study corroborate the results of earlier studies that examined the psychometric properties of the CD-RISC and expand these findings into an older American Indian sample. As in early research (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>), the current study demonstrated adequate internal consistency and found evidence of convergent and divergent validity in both the full and abbreviated versions of the scale. Furthermore, results of the CFA from the present study are consistent with findings from earlier investigations. Studies using samples of American college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>), Australian adults and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511431989">Gucciardi et al., 2011</xref>), and Chinese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0164027511431989">Yu &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>) were also unable to confirm the original five-factor structure of the CD-RISC proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511431989">Connor and Davidson (2003)</xref>. As in previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511431989">Gucciardi et al., 2011</xref>), the present study found the revised, unidimensional, 10-item version of the CD-RISC proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills and Stein (2007)</xref> to be preferable.</p>
<p>Our results must be interpreted within the context of some limitations. Perhaps the most important limitation is that the extent to which our findings are generalizable to all older American Indian populations is unknown, because our sample was drawn from citizens of a single American Indian tribe. Also, study participants were restricted to community-dwelling persons aged 55 years and older, and the findings may not be generalizable to other age groups or to those residing in institutions. With the exception of the CES-D, the psychometric properties of the other psychosocial scales have not been systematically assessed in American Indian populations. If the psychosocial scales do not accurately measure the intended traits in American Indian populations, our evaluation of convergent validity for the CD-RISC may be limited. Similarly, the assumption is that the CD-RISC items were meaningful and culturally appropriate with our sample. Subsequent research would be useful to determine exactly how older American Indians understand the individual scale items. Another potential limitation of the current study is the relatively small sample size for conducting CFA. However, a stable factor structure was still identified for the abbreviated CD-RISC.</p>
<p>Our study contributes to the existing literature on resilience and aging with an in-depth examination of the psychometric properties of the CD-RISC among older American Indians. No resilience measure has been validated in older American Indians. Our findings suggest that the abbreviated CD-RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511431989">Campbell-Sills &amp; Stein, 2007</xref>) is a useful tool for future inquiry of resilience for older American Indians, which is an area of research that remains relatively unexplored. The abbreviated version of the CD-RISC could be clinically useful to identify those with low resilience. There is emerging evidence that brief resilience training may be effective in promoting health behaviors and outcomes with persons with diabetes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511431989">Bradshaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0164027511431989">Steinhardt, Mamerow, Brown, &amp; Jolly, 2009</xref>). The abbreviated CD-RISC can also be used to identify those with high resilience, because many interventions use strength-based approaches, and the CD-RISC offers a quick way to identify such strengths. Future research in this area can help make important contributions by identifying components to successful aging as well as aid in clinical and public health interventions with American Indians.</p>
