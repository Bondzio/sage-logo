<p>Life is more interesting if one looks outside one’s usual situation, and if challenges are sought out and accepted. This issue should offer most people at least one challenge. Chris Ward has questioned orthodox views over the 25 years I have known him, and here he explores the <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511423850">limitations</related-article> that arise from centring attention purely on the nominated patient. Looking outside is also the subject of a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511412800">controlled study</related-article> from Norway, and it seems true that a good view may ‘lift the spirits’ of people receiving rehabilitation (as well as their healthcare team?). But what happens when someone can no longer actually see the view. A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511407219">detailed study</related-article> of 216 adults with acquired visual loss reveals a huge variety of responses and approaches. The question I ask is whether this is also true of most other acquired impairments? I assume that it is and that one could develop an evidencebased theory of adjustment and adaptation for use in all rehabilitation fields. Theory is now influencing rehabilitation research. The concept of a limited cognitive capacity and interference between cognitive and controlled motor tasks underlies <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215510394222">the study</related-article> reported in this issue which investigates whether training dual task skills might reduce interference. It might, but only a very large study will show whether it affects relevant outcomes such as falls. Cardiac rehabilitation is increasingly being studied, and two reports here investigate exercise, a core component of cardiac rehabilitation. It would seem that a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511403941">home-based exercise</related-article> regime which includes strength training as well as aerobic exercise may be more effective, and the <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511405229">second study</related-article> suggests that aerobic interval training may be better than ‘usual care’. However as a simple clinician, I constantly need to refresh my memory on the meaning of the different terms used to describe different exercises (aerobic? interval? strength training?) – perhaps we need a simple guide to terminology? Finally this issue includes two systematic reviews of note. The <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511411113">first</related-article> suggests that Pilates exercises have no specific benefit in low back pain – but did the investigators in all the studies use ‘proper’ Pilates? Again we need clear definitions and descriptions. The <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215511431921" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511412982">second</related-article> asks “what measures are available to assess sensation in people with neurological damage?” The answer is “too many!”, but none are obviously useful in daily practice. Why not choose to read at least one article that is outside your own area of interest? You might gain useful insight into your own clinical problems.</p>
