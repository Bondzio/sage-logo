Our analysis shows that the CCT pioneers embraced the humanistic/experientialist discourse to carve out a disciplinary niche in a largely antagonistic marketing field. However, this original epistemological orientation has long given way to a multilayered CCT heteroglossia that features a broad range of theorizations integrating structural and agentic levels of analysis. We close with a discussion of how reflexive debates over CCT's supposed biases toward the agentic reproduce symbolic distinctions between North American and European scholarship styles and thus primarily reflect the institutional interests of those positioned in the Northern hemisphere. By destabilizing the north–south and center–periphery relations of power that have long-framed metropole social science constructions of the marginalized cultural “other” as an object of study—rather than as a producer of legitimate knowledge and theory—the CCT heteroglossia can be further diversified and enriched through a blending of historical, material, critical, and experiential perspectives.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Consumer culture theory</kwd><kwd>epistemology</kwd><kwd>sociology of knowledge</kwd><kwd>poststructuralism</kwd><kwd>postcolonialism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In 2005, Arnould and Thompson reviewed a stream of consumer research that had been variously glossed as qualitative, interpretivist, postpositivist, and postmodern. They argued that each of these familiar monikers reproduced the very misconceptions and misleading connotations that had undermined this scholarly current’s institutional legitimacy and its capacity to compete for desired resources (most notably job placements for newly minted PhDs doing culturally oriented research). Owing to strategic considerations outlined in their article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593113477889">Arnould and Thompson (2005)</xref> proposed that consumer culture theory (CCT) would provide a more efficacious academic “brand.” In a companion commentary, Arnould and Thompson (2007) concluded that the moniker consumer culture theoretics better reflected this research tradition’s conceptual, methodological, and philosophical diversity. In this article, we employ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593113477889">Bakhtin’s (1981)</xref> concept of heteroglossia to more thoroughly explicate the intersecting, overlapping, and, at times, conflicting polydiscursive constitution of CCT and in so doing, build upon a series of reflexive analyses addressing the current and future state of CCT research (Arnould and Thompson, 2007; Askegaard and Linnet, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593113477889">Cova et al., 2009</xref>; Moisander et al., 2009).</p><p>To begin with the concept of heteroglossia, Bakhtin (1981) argued, in the context of his broader formulation of dialogism, that the meaning of a verbal utterance or written statement is constructed within a complex historical matrix of sociolinguistic relations:<disp-quote><p>Thus, at any given moment of its historical existence, language is heteroglot from top to bottom: it represents the co-existence of socio-ideological contradictions between the present and the past, between different epochs of the past, between different socio-ideological groups in the present, between tendencies, schools, circles and so forth. These languages of heteroglossia intersect each other in a variety of ways, forming new socially typifying languages. Each of these languages of heteroglossia requires a methodology very different from the others; each is grounded in a different principle for marking differences and for establishing units. (Mikhail Bakhtin, <italic>The Dialogical Imagination</italic>, p. 291)</p></disp-quote>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1470593113477889">Holquist (1990)</xref> elaborates, heteroglossia implies that meaning is determined through the play of powerful but unstable and historically contingent social, institutional, and discursive forces. In regard to the latter condition, Bakhtin (1981) also held that meaning is dialogical in form; that is, it is not only a matter of encoding and signification but also encompasses the social responses that a statement invokes in particular audiences. And these dialogical responses can themselves draw from a broad range of intersecting discursive systems or language games (though the range of legitimate or credible response will be delimited by institutional forces). Thus, the meaning of a term, or of more complex statements, is constituted by (1) the institutional conditions that situate speakers and audiences; (2) the broader sociocultural system that contextualizes the institutional field; and (3), last but not least, the heteroglot mix of language games that have varying degrees of currency and/or legitimacy in the institutional field. When these background conditions change, so do the constituted meanings they situate.</p><p>To clarify this argument, the changes in institutional conditions, unless they are in some sense revolutionary, do not lead to radical breaches in the constitution of meaning. Rather, they generate nuanced but potentially consequential semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic differences that need to be recognized, parsed, and explicated. From this standpoint, then, the meanings of key rhetorical and methodological practices and paradigmatic defining terms or language games that CCT deployed during the paradigm debates of the 1980s differ from those invoked during the second wave of CCT research (circa mid-1990s to early 2000s) when norms of paradigmatic pluralism fundamentally reshaped marketing/consumer research debates over “alternative ways of knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593113477889">Brown, 1996</xref>) and shifted again after the third wave emerged in the wake of the CCT brand and its formalization in an annual international conference and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-1470593113477889">Sherry, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the reflexive analyses of CCT should address the terms of these heteroglossic differences, and the conditions that precipitated them, to effectively historicize its discursive practices and to better gauge its institutional consequences. Prior reflexive accounts have called attention to the latent risks and threats posed by the fairly rapid institutionalization of CCT as a recognized paradigmatic category within consumer research and marketing. Most notable among these envisioned risks are the imposition of constraining theoretical, methodological, and managerially skewed orthodoxies that would, in effect, straightjacket the conduct of cultural analysis, particularly that of a critical stripe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593113477889">Askegaard and Linnet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-1470593113477889">Tadajewski and Brownlie, 2008</xref>) and relatedly, the suppression of dissident and/or marginalized perspectives by a hegemonic system of epistemological, ontological, and axiological mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1470593113477889">Moisander et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We focus on a specific reflexive critique that is often implicated in these broader concerns that CCT's institutionalization could precipitate an intellectually stifling “new dogma” (Fuat Firat’s interview comment in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593113477889">Bradshaw and Dholakia, 2012</xref>). This critique, whether voiced by Moisander et al., Askegaard and Linnet, or Firat, holds that crystallized CCT axioms are now reproducing the hyperindividualizing, overly agentic, and ahistoric, sociologically impoverished theoretical orientation that has reigned in the broader consumer research/marketing fields. In this admonishing perspective, CCT is now, paradoxically, posing paradigmatic barriers to systematic investigations into the sociocultural shaping of consumption and the ideological production of consumer subject positions:<disp-quote><p>Much of the early and recent CCT work continues to view the <italic>individual </italic>as the primary unit of analysis. In the psychological tradition, researchers typically draw from intra-personal psychological constructs and processes such as extended self, self-identity, and personal values and meanings in making sense of consumption behaviors… It makes much sense that interpretive scholars continue to examine the individual as unit of analysis, as individualism is both a powerful agent and effect of marketization globally. Even so, in carrying out studies of the individual, it is difficult to see changes over time, such as the losses of tradition (Hefner, 1998) and the increasing emphasis on children (Cook, 2003). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1470593113477889">Moisander et al., 2009</xref>: 15–6)</p><p>We agree with Moisander and coauthors that for CCT research to progress beyond this one-sided attention to the self-realizing individual, new conceptualizations and models are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593113477889">Askegaard and Linnet, 2011</xref>: 386).</p><p>In the context of the structure–agency debate, then, our reflections here should not be taken as a dismissal of consumer agency, but rather as a word of warning against letting contemporary individualism, whether it expresses the ideologies of the Cold War period (Tadajewski, 2006a); humanist psychology and its influence on an American popular culture of self-actualization (Illouz, 2008); or contemporary neoliberalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1470593113477889">Shankar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr189-1470593113477889">Zwick et al., 2008</xref>) overshadow the notion that the human being is first and foremost a social and cultural animal.

More debatable, however, is the contention that these experientialist/emic analyses constitute a hegemonic discourse whose oppressive disciplinary power is impeding the production and publication of research investigating the sociocultural shaping of consumption and the ideological production of consumer subject positions. To counter these portentous assessments, we simply note that a cavalcade of CCT studies have extensively addressed the institutional, historical, ideological, and sociological shaping of consumption and the broader market and social systems, which situate consumers’ identity projects and consumption practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593113477889">Allen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593113477889">Arnould, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593113477889">Arsel and Bean, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593113477889">Arsel and Thompson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593113477889">Askegaard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593113477889">Bardhi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470593113477889">Bernthal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593113477889">Crockett and Wallendorf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593113477889">Firat and Venkatesh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470593113477889">Giesler, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470593113477889">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593113477889">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593113477889">Goulding et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470593113477889">Holt, 1995</xref>, 1997, 1988, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1470593113477889">Holt and Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1470593113477889">Humphreys, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1470593113477889">Jafari and Goulding, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1470593113477889">Kates, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1470593113477889">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1470593113477889">Karababa and Ger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1470593113477889">Kjeldgaard and Askegaard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1470593113477889">Kozinets, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1470593113477889">Luedicke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1470593113477889">Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1470593113477889">Peñaloza, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1470593113477889">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1470593113477889">Peñaloza and Barnhart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1470593113477889">Peñaloza and Gilly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1470593113477889">Press and Arnould, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1470593113477889">Ringberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1470593113477889">Sandikci and Ger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1470593113477889">Scaraboto and Fischer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-1470593113477889">Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1470593113477889">Thompson and Arsel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1470593113477889">Thompson and Coskuner-Balli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1470593113477889">Thompson and Tambyah, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-1470593113477889">Thompson and Tian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-1470593113477889">Tumbat and Belk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-1470593113477889">Ulver-Sneistrup et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr179-1470593113477889">Üstüner and Holt, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-1470593113477889">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr181-1470593113477889">Üstüner and Thompson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr182-1470593113477889">Varman and Belk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-1470593113477889">Varman and Costa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr187-1470593113477889">Wong and King, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr188-1470593113477889">Zhao and Belk, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Moisander et al. (2009) and, even more so, Askegaard and Linett (2011) recognize that a considerable volume of CCT research has indeed investigated the historical, sociological, ideological, and institutional shaping of consumption and marketplace phenomenon. Yet, the authors of these reflexive calls to arms rhetorically cast these decidedly nonemic, treatments to the disciplinary margins. Instead, they suggest that existential–phenomenological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1470593113477889">Thompson et al., 1989</xref>) and naturalistic inquiries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1470593113477889">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>) remain dominant in the CCT heteroglossia, even though their respective disciplinary influences peaked in the early 1990s and their limitations have been well documented (Belk, 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1470593113477889">Holt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1470593113477889">Joy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1470593113477889">Joy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1470593113477889">Thompson et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>From our standpoint, these selective readings of the CCT heteroglossia indirectly point to epistemological and ontological ambiguities that have arisen from CCT’s complex institutional history. At minimum, a reflexive framework should be able to account for the coexistence of emic-oriented approaches and analyses that highlight sociocultural structures that has historically defined the CCT heteroglossia and relatedly, the relative (and shifting) positions of centrality that these emic and etic ontologies have held within CCT’s ever evolving matrix of rhetorical, theoretical, and methodological practices.</p><p>Toward the goal of clarifying these ambiguities and addressing these conditions of coexistence, our genealogical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470593113477889">Foucault, 1977</xref>) revisits the institutional context in which CCT began to emerge as a legitimate field of inquiry. We first consider why an emically focused humanistic/methodological discursive system was so integral to this paradigmatic realignment of the marketing and consumer research fields. Next, we discuss how consumer researchers employing this humanistic/experientialist discourse gradually reconfigured its original epistemological premises—which were largely adapted from logical empiricist practices of empirical verification—and sparked reverberations that contributed to the discursive diversification of the CCT heteroglossia and, as a consequence, that also fundamentally transformed the meaning of the emic and the agentic within CCT’s contemporary discursive representations.</p><p>Our analysis will build a case that the dilemmas highlighted by Moisander et al. (2009) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593113477889">Askegaard and Linnet (2011)</xref> manifest a more complex genealogical story than the hegemony of the agentic over the structural or the emic over the etic. Rather, we argue that they emanate from the institutional embeddedness of the CCT heteroglossia in the fields of academic marketing and mainstream (e.g. psychologically oriented) consumer research, where logical empiricist epistemological principles continue to hold sway. As a consequence, the practices of empirical verification—which ties interpretive validity to the emic realm—continue to live on as anachronistic rhetorical gestures that can impede the deployment of sociohistoric modes of CCT analysis, particularly through the institutional practice of journal reviewing.</p><p>Reviewers of this manuscript rightly pointed out that the marketing field is also embedded in the broader sphere of the social sciences and hence, any genealogy should cast a much broader institutional net than simply focusing on marketing. However, we retain a narrower focus, in part, because an attempt to encompass the manifold debates between structuralists and phenomenologists, postmodernists versus Marxists, deconstructionists versus formalists, Habermasians versus Foucauldians, behaviorists versus cognitivists, and so on, is clearly beyond the boundaries of a single journal article. More importantly, our analysis reflects that there is a fairly permeable boundary between marketing and consumer research—characterized by considerable overlap and cross-fertilization between journals and researchers—while the marketing field itself has been highly parochial (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593113477889">Brown, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593113477889">1998</xref> for further discussion). For example, marketing’s positivism versus relativism debates of the early 1980s—and the very specific set of external authorities they selectively referenced and lionized such as Kuhn, Popper, Laudan, Feyerabend, and Wittgenstein—played a more direct and salient role in the institutional emergence of alternative ways of knowing in consumer research than other epistemological and ontological debates waged in the social sciences (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113477889">Anderson, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593113477889">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1470593113477889">Hudson and Ozanne, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1470593113477889">Hunt, 1991</xref>).</p><p>In this regard, the parochial intellectual practices of the marketing discipline, circa 1980–1990, bear some similarity to the cultural orientations of Lower Cultural Capital (LCC) Turkish cultural elites studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-1470593113477889">Üstüner and Holt (2010)</xref>. As they discuss, LCC Turkish elites prefer goods, brands, and cultural productions, which they deem to be local in origin and only embrace more global/cosmopolitan options once they have been indigenized by Turkish taste makers, such as celebrities. In a parallel fashion, marketing and consumer research (which can be seen as the comparatively lower cultural capital/higher economic capital members of the broader social science community) amplified the importance of indigenized intellectual resources.

In these debates, proponents of the positivistic view based their idealizations of the scientific method on the natural sciences, whereas those endorsing relativistic positions tended to draw from sociology of knowledge accounts which contended that the presumed objectivity of the (natural) scientific method masks a gamut of social, political, careerist, and psychological influences that shape the production of knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593113477889">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593113477889">Buzzell, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1470593113477889">Olson and Peter, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Unquestionably, the emergence of CCT in consumer research drew intellectual energy and some degree of justification from the social sciences' interpretive turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-1470593113477889">Sherry, 1991</xref>), albeit well after this shift had taken hold in other fields.

Against the specter of McCarthyism, major philanthropic funding organizations (most particularly the Ford Foundation) and government research granting agencies (i.e. the National Science Foundation) became wary of associations with sociology and history owing to intellectual ties with critical theory (e.g. Marxist thought) and began channeling money toward fields that were seen as strengthening the US economy and its political system from the Soviet challenge.

This ontological formulation significantly diverged from the view of the consumer as a utility maximizing, information aggregator, which then held sway, and to a remarkable degree still does in the marketing and consumer behavior fields.

These proto-CCT researchers endorsed the goal of studying consumption for its own intrinsic value and generating basic knowledge about the meanings of consumption in everyday life. This axiological premise eschewed managerial relevance as a source of disciplinary importance and legitimacy and enabled CCT researchers to claim philosophical and intellectual kinship with the hallowed base disciplines of sociology and anthropology that had historically viewed the marketing profession with skepticism, distrust, and even intellectual disdain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593113477889">Belk, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1470593113477889">Holbrook, 1987</xref>).</p><p>In conjunction with their valorization of the autotelic, noninstrumental, esthetic, symbolic, and experiential aspects of consumption, humanistic/experientialist discourses also accepted the methodological individualist assumption that the consumer subject is the fundamental unit of analysis.

Humanistic/experientialist CCT embraced research approaches—most notably naturalistic inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593113477889">Belk et al., 1988</xref>) and existential-phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1470593113477889">Thompson et al., 1989</xref>)—that were designed to elicit and document the emic and experientially based perspectives of consumers. While diverging from many logical empiricist research practices, humanistic/experientialist-oriented CCT researchers were not challenging marketing’s dominant episteme so much as inverting its axiomatic belief that the research enterprise should ideally function as an undistorted “mirror of nature” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1470593113477889">Rorty, 1979</xref>). The logical empiricist episteme held that subjective perceptions imposed distorting biases on the research process that must be filtered out through assiduous application of quantifiable measures, controlled experiments, large, representative samples, and statistical validation. Humanistic/experientialist discourses countered that such objectifying research procedures were themselves barriers to attaining deep insights into the fundamentally subjective experiences of consumers. To adequately represent the fuller range of experiences and meanings that animated consumption, advocates of this subjectivist-privileging epistemology endorsed methodologies that were designed to closely document consumers’ experiences and perspectives and that recognized the researcher’s essential role as an empathetic, sense-making instrument.</p><p>Given the institutional setting and epistemological proclivities of the consumer research/marketing fields in the early 1980s, early proponents of the nascent CCT approach had strong, and indeed overwhelming, incentives to position their arguments within logical empiricist vernaculars that were palatable to institutional gatekeepers (journal editors, reviewers, conference chairs, etc.) and the broader membership of the Association for Consumer Research: a key constituency which early CCT proponents needed to recruit to their paradigm building case (see Belk, 1991). Although not necessarily stated as an overt methodological axiom, a symptom of this amalgam of status-quo epistemological values and pragmatic <italic>real politik</italic> was the so-called member check—consumers verifying that a researcher's interpretation provided an accurate portrayal of their experiences and worldviews—often construed as an absolute arbiter of validation: a logic that almost guaranteed that only meanings that stayed close to the emic were likely to meet this standard of trustworthiness.</p><p>As humanistic/experientialist articulations of CCT became more prevalent in consumer research, however, latent internal tensions in the broader and still emerging CCT heteroglossia began to exert transformative pressures on its discursive practices. As the quasi-positivistic procedural norms of naturalistic inquiry became gradually displaced, CCT researchers adopted more open ended, hermeneutic and poststructuralist epistemic principles. Rather than seeking a single correct interpretation undergirded by convergence among researchers (and auditors) or endorsement from consumer participants, CCT researchers supported their interpretive claims through rhetorical means—in a manner akin to the logic of judicial argumentation—by systematically explicating layers of cultural meaning, elucidating sociohistorically grounded connections between emic articulations and cultural and ideological frames, and demonstrating novel theoretical insights through comparisons to more orthodox or established theoretical frameworks (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593113477889">Arnold and Fischer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470593113477889">Holt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1470593113477889">Kozinets, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1470593113477889">Peñaloza, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1470593113477889">Thompson et al., 1998</xref>).

As a new generation of CCT researchers began to remap consumer research, they quickly developed social constructivist, poststructuralist, dialogical, critical theoretical, actor-network, systems theoretical, and feminist discursive threads in innovative ways, often treating the humanistic/experientialist frameworks of their CCT progenitors as a useful rhetorical foil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593113477889">Bristor and Fischer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593113477889">Brown, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593113477889">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593113477889">Firat and Venkatesh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470593113477889">Giesler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470593113477889">Holt, 1995</xref>, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1470593113477889">Murray and Ozanne, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1470593113477889">Thompson et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>With these heteroglossic considerations in mind, we turn to Askegaard and Linett’s closing thoughts on the current and future state of CCT:<disp-quote><p>It is a legitimate analytical strategy to represent consumers as being motivated by their ‘identity projects’; but if the analysis aims for an elucidation of ‘consumer culture’, it should acknowledge the cultural, historical and societal conditions that make this identity and the means of attaining it attractive and legitimate in the first place.

It is an attempt to carve out an epistemological space for an emerging field of CCT.

The variation that members bring to the CCT interpretive community both in terms of their theoretical orientations (sociological, anthropological, historical, critical, and social psychological) and levels of expertise is now an integral characteristic of CCT’s institutional position and the variegated ways its research is understood and used within the fields of marketing, consumer research, and beyond.</p><p>Second, for members of the CCT community who have more expertise and whose professional identities are located more in its paradigmatic center (which should correspond to a more extensive and routine engagement with the ever expanding CCT literature), matters of agency, and emic meaning are <italic>not </italic>likely to be understood through a romanticizing interpretive lens that excises the role of culture and social structure. Rather, a researcher immersed in the CCT heteroglossia will be well versed in the critiques of the humanistic/experientialist legacy and its many blind spots toward power, social stratification, gender hierarchies, ideological interpellations, and other structuring forces (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593113477889">Bristor and Fischer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470593113477889">Holt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1470593113477889">Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1470593113477889">Shankar et al., 2006</xref>).

However, in the contemporary CCT heteroglossia, it is now axiomatic that personal understandings draw from complex cultural systems and are articulated within specific sociocultural fields, and, hence, inflected through the prism of social structures, power relations, and, last but not least, embeddedness in marketplace structures (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593113477889">Arsel and Bean, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593113477889">Giesler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1470593113477889">Holt and Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1470593113477889">Kozinets, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1470593113477889">Press and Arnould, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-1470593113477889">Thompson and Tian, 2008</xref>).</p><p>When an interpretive community operates from a shared foundation of background knowledge, however, its core axiomatic principles become tacit. Accordingly, a contemporary CCT study that does not interrogate the sociohistorical conditions of possibility that frame consumers’ emic accounts should not necessarily be interpreted as a regression to the ahistoricism of CCT’s formative humanistic/experientialist stage of development.</p><p>To illustrate this point, let us consider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1470593113477889">Marcoux’s (2009)</xref> ethnographic study of the home moving rituals among a sample of working class consumers living in Montreal. Marcoux adopted an emically oriented analytic approach to challenge a number of assumptions about the gift economy, which had become orthodox within the CCT literature. Drawing inspiration from the French antiutilitarian school, Marcoux showed that consumers often flee the gift economy to avoid its reciprocal obligations. Instead, these consumers turned to commercial moving services, which they experienced as affording greater personal autonomy and obviating interpersonal indebtedness, imposition, and power inequities that would otherwise accrue from gift economy exchanges. Marcoux’s ethnographic account, however, did not explicitly consider many key sociohistoric influences that likely structured these moving rituals and their meanings, such as the history of Montreal’s urbanization and suburbanization (and its influence on consumers’ apartment relocation patterns); the ideological construction of renters and owners in French Canadian society; power relationships between the working class and bourgeois property owners; the historical construction and evolution of gender roles and family structures in French Canadian society; and so on (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470593113477889">Fournier 1998</xref> for another theoretically and culturally sophisticated exemplar of an emic-oriented analysis).</p><p>Yet, Marcoux (2009) did not treat his participants’ narratives as ahistoric, asocial expressions of inner essences, timeless emotional experiences, or sources of epistemological validation. His theoretical approach followed the tradition of material culture studies that investigate “how cultural phenomena become significant through the use of material objects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1470593113477889">Marcoux, 2009</xref>: 675). Furthermore, Marcoux (2009: 675) sought “to go beyond the individual level of analysis” by focusing on the question of how consumption meanings are constituted within social (and material) networks. His conceptualization of the emic was, therefore, highly social and closely aligned with the underlying precepts of practice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr186-1470593113477889">Warde, 2005</xref>), and culminated in a theoretical perspective on the relationship between the gift economy and the market that highlighted social dynamics operating within gift economy exchanges previously overlooked in consumer research. While not delving into the complex sociohistorical background that situates these market-mediated escapes from the gift economy, Marcoux’s (2009) treatment of the emic is quite distinct from any kind of solipsistic individualism.</p><p>Turning to the interpretive practices of less well versed, novice, and/or peripheral members of the CCT community, the CCT heteroglossia still encompasses the discursive legacy of its formative humanistic/experientialist genesis (and corresponding verificationist epistemology). Importantly, these anachronistic discourses exhibit considerable institutional resonance in an academic marketing field whose dominant ontology privileges microeconomic assumptions and psychological process explanations and whose dominant epistemology remains wedded to a logical empiricist idealization of the scientific research enterprise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1470593113477889">Tadajewski, 2008</xref>). Owing to these institutional conditions, CCT’s humanistic/experientialist discursive legacy remains a readily accessible and intellectually comfortable interpretive resource for more peripheral, conventionally trained (e.g. a social psychologist undertaking a CCT-positioned study), or novice members of the CCT heteroglossia.</p><p>We suggest that the enduring institutional resonance of the humanistic/experientialist discourse is a major contributor to dilemmas outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593113477889">Askegaard and Linnet (2011)</xref>. Furthermore, the exigencies of the review process can further compound these regressive tendencies. For example, an editor may turn to a “CCT reviewer” whose scholarly praxis crystallized in the field’s formative years, and who therefore interprets the research through the lens of the humanistic/experientialist (and verificationist) discourse, or he/she may in light of the substantive topic under study, assign a “CCT friendly” reviewer whose primary training and research is in social psychology. In most cases, however, this designated “friendliness” merely indicates that the reviewer is not dogmatically dismissive of studies that diverge from positivistic standards of research legitimacy. However, neither situation assures that he/she will bring an informed, contemporary philosophy of science, or cultural perspective to the task at hand.</p><p>From our standpoint, emic–agentic accounts of consumption that are oblivious to structuring influences exerted by historical and sociocultural influences are points of anachronistic slippage in the CCT heteroglossia. Whether expressed in the production of research (i.e. a descriptive, phenomenological study presented at a conference) or by reviewers who demand empirical fidelity to consumer quotes (in ways that would make historical or actor-network arguments impossible since neither historical factors nor objects can speak for themselves), these anachronistic rhetorical gestures are the products of institutional factors such as the dominant intellectual tendencies of the marketing field at-large and the relatively few PhD granting institutions where students can gain extensive training in the CCT heteroglossia and its manifold theoretical traditions.</p><p>The CCT community has rallied to redress these institutional problems. CCT.org and the CCT Facebook page have become active forums discussing issues, sharing knowledge, and providing collective resources to those who are relatively new to the field. For over a decade, faculty and students have regularly gathered at symposia and workshops on theories and research methods integral to the conduct and understanding of CCT research. These events constitute an intensive sharing of knowledge and experience among graduate students, newly minted assistant professors looking to enrich their understanding of the CCT heteroglossia and experienced faculty mentors. Similarly, the presentations, invited addresses, discussions, debates, and other intellectual interactions afforded by the annual CCT conference—now heading into its eighth year—immerse its participants in the fuller complexity of the CCT heteroglossia and, thereby, has a calibrating effect upon those whose understanding has been limited to it humanistic/experientialist legacy.</p><p>Building on this latter point, let us offer a <italic>mis-en-scène</italic> from the most recent CCT conference. In a fairly well-attended session, a younger and less experienced CCT researcher presented a set of findings that were largely descriptive and very much grounded in consumers’ emic narratives. In the ensuing Q&amp;A session, a more experienced CCT researcher noted that the findings were, in some key ways, inconsistent with a significant body of historical and cross-cultural research on the topic. To wit, the younger researcher responded with a humanistic/experientialist rationale of “well, I can only report what was in my data.”</p><p>Our interpretation of this interaction—again understood as a fairly recurrent social performance that plays out across numerous CCT-themed conference sessions—is that it manifests a dichotomous, rather than a dialogical, script. And the key dichotomy is that between structure and agency. In such interactions, those who can knowledgeably appeal to broader social structuring influences (or studies about) are invoking a more robust and developed understanding of the CCT heteroglossia and, thereby, speaking from a position of authority. A less experienced researcher whose fluency in the CCT heteroglossia does not extend far beyond the humanistic/experiential discourse is placed in a defensive position, armed only with epistemologically suspect “grounded theory” arguments about letting the data speak for itself and not going beyond what it “says.”</p><p>While such encounters also undoubtedly betray differences in status position, these power relations hinge on tendencies to interpret agentic accounts as inherently unsatisfactory or structural explanations as untrustworthy impositions upon consumer narratives. If structured as a dialogue, rather than a dualistic, and generally one-sided debate, such conference encounters could lead to discussions of how and why a particular set of emic accounts might seem to diverge from expectations based on sociocultural and historic patterns. Rather than presenting a challenge, the invocation of historical and cross-cultural differences would function as an invitation to reflect upon the specific context under study and to assess what other sociocultural factors might account for these differences between emic patterns and expected structural relations. Another ever-present possibility is that a researcher may not have interpreted his/her emic data with a sufficient understanding of relevant sociohistorical influences. In such a case, however, the ensuing dialogue would again enjoin the researcher and audience in a process of identifying key intersections between the agentic and the structural that could further illuminate the consumer phenomenon under study.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1470593113477889"><title>From colonization anxieties to postcolonial disruptions in the CCT heteroglossia</title><p>To this juncture, we have argued that the CCT heteroglossia no longer privileges agentic accounts over structural explanations, as had been the case during its formative, first wave articulations that primarily invoked humanistic/experientialist discourses. This complex discursive system now encompasses a broad range of dialectical and dialogical theorizations that focus upon recursive relations between structure and agency playing out in varied consumption or marketplace contexts. However, CCT’s embeddedness in the marketing discipline creates institutional conditions in which humanistic/experientialist dualities can exert an anachronistic influence upon the conduct of a CCT study, a conference interaction, a journal review process, and other everyday interactions among members of CCT’s heteroglossic interpretive community. While these institutional points of slippage are problems that need to be recognized and redressed, they are not evidence that the CCT heteroglossia remains paradigmatically vested in the study of consumer identity projects, at the expense of historical and sociological considerations.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593113477889">Bourdieu (1988)</xref> has shown that academic debates often outlive their respective moments of intellectual vitality because their polarities are exceedingly useful devices for organizing courses, lectures, and, last but not least, generating symbolic distinctions among those in the academic field (which can then be marshaled into status competitions via promotion, publication, etc.). In this vein, the structure-agency debate is a chestnut philosophical dichotomy that can readily spark passionate discussions when used to reframe the ontological complexities of the CCT heteroglossia. The incitement potential of this formulation is further heightened by a posited institutional (and intellectual) dichotomy between North American and European business schools (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593113477889">Cova and Cova, 2002</xref>).

As one other example from the revelatory ephemerality of conference interactions, the de facto global rollout of the CCT brand at the 2005 European Association for Consumer Research conference (Gothenburg, Sweden) sparked a fair degree of controversy, as more than a few in the audience expressed concerns that the CCT initiative was seeking to colonize a vibrant European marketing community already engaged in sociocultural and critically oriented marketing research; in other words, would CCT be a new form of Kotlerization (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593113477889">Brown, 1995</xref>) that imposes a disciplining (and stultifying) North American model of marketing scholarship upon the sociologically attuned and critically oriented factions of the European Marketing and CB communities?</p><p>These concerns of academic colonization by the CCT brand reflect, in part, that the production implementation of classification schemes are very potent expressions of institutional power.

Also, school rankings, and government funding allocations are now more closely tied to audits of academic staff publication performance.

Accordingly, we could close our genealogical account with suggestions for how CCT’s discursive practices could be reformulated in ways that are more inclusive and less prone to totalizing rhetorical gestures (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1470593113477889">Joy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1470593113477889">Joy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1470593113477889">Thompson et al., 1998</xref>). Instead, we wish to amplify the postcolonial sensibility that undergirds these aforementioned concerns over the colonizing power exerted by the CCT academic brand (as supported by the broader institutional relation of powers between North American and European marketing factions). Postcolonial theory—yet another nebulous classification rife with diverse meanings and points of contestation—is commonly associated with a perspective that seeks to analyze how the enduring legacies of colonial and imperial modes of domination play out in particular sociocultural contexts and the complex play of political struggles, social stratifications, localized forms of power and resistance, asymmetrical dependencies, hybrid cultures, and ideological ambivalences that they engender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470593113477889">Hall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1470593113477889">Kraidy, 2005</xref>).</p><p>As a practical matter, our deconstruction of this postcolonial subtext is, in effect, merely casting a rhetorical spotlight on a stream of CCT research that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593113477889">Arnould and Thompson (2005)</xref> collapsed under the subdomain of the sociohistoric patterning of consumption.

Bernardo Figueiredo’s resonant post to the CCT Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/groups/213134458706536/, August 21, 2012) also called attention to the desirability of extending CCT work to South American contexts. This post then sparked responses elaborating upon conferences, workshops (located in the both southern and northern hemispheres), and pedagogical and research collaborations seeking to bridge north–south institutionalized chasms. Other posters noted CCT’s ubiquitous errors of (co-)omission toward influential southern hemisphere cultural theorists, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593113477889">Canclini (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593113477889">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593113477889">2009</xref>) and the late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470593113477889">Hau’ofa (2008)</xref>, whose research and theorization have received minimal recognition at best.</p><p>In the broader interdisciplinary scheme, the CCT heteroglossia may serve as one activating node in a reverberating network of critical, postcolonial theorists seeking to diversify the range of legitimate cultural voices and theoretical perspectives and to create a heteroglossic canon that transcends historically and sociopolitically outmoded center–periphery, producer–consumer, researcher–researched, and north–south hegemonies. This postcolonial strand of the CCT heteroglossia would also enable consumers to better interrogate the historical conditions that underlie their own socioeconomic privileges and the sources of marginalization and disempowerment that affect such a large percentage of the world’s population. In so doing, postcolonial CCT would begin to disentangle the material and discursive webs that both sustain and potentially destabilize these global networks of political, cultural, and socioeconomic distinctions and hierarchies. Of course, like previous efforts at institutional change, this diversified and decentralized project of social science reformation will likely continue to be a slow and arduous struggle against myriad forces of sociocultural inertia and deeply entrenched orthodoxies. By confronting and redressing these institutionalized “metropole” rhetorical conventions, the CCT community can gain a more immediate and revitalizing benefit: an expanded horizon for theoretical and practical innovation.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1470593113477889"><label>1.</label><p>In tracing out the institutional history of CCT, we suggest that the early 1980s were a pivotal historical moment in its paradigmatic formulation and leading researchers (Belk, Hirschman, Holbrook, O’Guinn, Sherry, Wallendorf, and other key participants in the consumer behavior odyssey); journals (particularly the <italic>Journal of Consumer Research</italic>); and conferences (Association for Consumer Research Annual Conference and the American Marketing Association’s Winter Education Conference) affiliated with North American institutions were the pivotal forces in the legitimation of CCT in the consumer research field.
