<p>This book is a collection of several previously published pieces on global history by Samir Amin. The breadth and depth of this study is considerable, and is testimony to the author’s status as an internationally leading progressive scholar of the left. In only 190 pages of text, Amin covers global history from about 500 BC to the present day, including the various parts of the world and how they have been related to each other in different ways over time. The book highlights the author’s independent contribution to Marxist historical sociology, and presents a stinging attack on Eurocentric accounts of history.</p>
<p>Samir Amin is regularly mentioned alongside three other progressive, left academic intellectuals: Immanuel Wallerstein, Andre Gunder Frank, and Giovanni Arrighi. Indeed, he collaborated closely with them, especially in the 1970s, when they were known in academia as the ‘Gang of Four’. Nevertheless, this book makes clear that Samir Amin has adopted independent positions on a number of key issues, which differentiate him from the others. I will focus on three key differences here. First, he highlights the significance of the Industrial Revolution in England, identified as the advanced form of capitalism since 1800. While Immanuel Wallerstein dates capitalism back to the long 16th century, beginning in around 1450 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309816813489943">Wallerstein 1974</xref>: 399), and Giovanni Arrighi downplays the Industrial Revolution completely in Britain’s rise to international dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">Arrighi 1994</xref>: 209-10), Samir Amin captures its systemic importance. ‘The capitalist system only reached its advanced form with the establishment of the mechanised factory in the 19th century (modern industry), a base which was essential to the deployment of the law of value specific to the capitalist mode of production’ (p. 71). Second, Amin’s definition of capitalism is equally different from Wallerstein’s and Arrighi’s market-based definitions. For Amin, ‘the development of historical capitalism is based on the private appropriation of agrarian land, the submission of agricultural production to the requirements of the “market” and, on this basis, the continuing and accelerating expulsion of the peasant population for the benefit of a small number of capitalist farmers’ (pp. 172-3). In other words, when assessing the transition to capitalism in Europe, there is an emphasis on enclosures in England and the constitution of private property, i.e. the way the production process is organised. Third, in his broad historical sweep, Amin identifies several parallel tributary systems from 500 BC to about 1500 AD, based on direct, politically enforced surplus extraction from peasant activity, and dominated by ideological authority and the existence of a universal ideology. He highlights India, China and the Islamic Orient as the three major core tributary systems plus several less significant tributary systems in the periphery including, for example, Europe (85). Nevertheless, in contrast to Andre Gunder Frank (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309816813489943">Frank and Gills 1993</xref>), who thinks in terms of an integrated world system reaching back up to 5,000 years, Amin does not conclude that the trading links between these different tributary systems implied that they were part of one and the same overall system. In this sense, ‘the capitalist mode of production represents a qualitative rupture with systems that preceded it’ (p. 123).</p>
<p>Moreover, this book is significant in its criticism of Eurocentrism (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309816813489943">Hobson 2012</xref>). Amin employs the concept of the ‘tributary system’ as a tool for a non-European interpretation of universal history (p. 137). In his analysis of the period between 500 BC and 1500 AD, he suggests that Europe was little more than a barbarous and backward periphery lagging behind major tributary systems such as India, China and the Islamic Orient and their scientific, intellectual and general civilisational achievements. ‘Eurocentrism is thus in effect an ideology that enables its defenders to conclude that “modernity” (or/and capitalism) could only have been born in Europe, which subsequently offered it to other peoples (“the civilising mission”)’ (p. 154). However, a modern bureaucracy, the recruitment to which was based on competitive examinations, and the establishment of a secular society, in which it was understood that it was human beings, not God, who made history – both key ingredients of capitalist modernity for Amin – had already been present within China long before similar developments in Europe. Ultimately, this implies that China too could have led the transition to capitalism.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, however, there are also tensions in this work. On one hand, as already indicated above, Samir Amin defines capitalism as a system based on private property. ‘This path, started by England in the 18th century (with the Enclosures) and gradually extended to the rest of Europe in the 19th century, constituted the essence of the historical path of capitalist development’ (p. 173). This in many respects reflects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309816813489943">Robert Brenner’s (1985)</xref> definition of capitalism as a specific set of social property relations. When discussing the mercantilist transition in Europe from 1500 onwards – the onset of capitalism in Europe for Amin – his definition of capitalism, however, resembles rather closely the market-based definitions of Wallerstein and Arrighi. He identifies an increasing production of agricultural goods to be exchanged as commodities, and the extension of free wage labour and modern forms of private property; but ‘the economy of these societies was more mercantile (dominated by trade and exchange) than capitalist by virtue of the fact that the development of the forces of production had not yet imposed the factory as the principal form of production’ (p. 17). Why, then, date capitalism back to the 1500s and medieval Italian city-states in the first place? Furthermore, Amin’s explanation of why capitalism eventually emerged in Europe and not elsewhere leaves several questions open. First, Amin points to productive mercantilism as paving the way for the Industrial Revolution (pp. 96-7). Then, he identifies the flexibility resulting from Europe’s peripheral character. ‘The peripheral character of the European tributary formation reveals a flexibility that may be contrasted with the relative rigidity of the advanced central tributary forms’ (p. 141). Nevertheless, he does not specify in which ways precisely these two developments caused capitalism to emerge in Europe rather than elsewhere. Finally, he refers to the conquest of the Americas as crucial: ‘The crisis of the feudal system was surmounted by the emergence of the absolutist state which, by means of the conquest of America, created a mercantilist world economy in whose service it placed itself’ (p. 141). Nevertheless, does this not again refer back to Wallerstein’s and Arrighi’s market-based definitions of capitalism? And yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309816813489943">Sam Ashman (2010</xref>: 194) correctly points out, ‘as the feudal monarchies of Spain and Portugal were to discover, the wealth plundered during the mercantile period did not fuel an industrial revolution on the Iberian Peninsula precisely because social relations were not transformed’. Amin, oscillating in his own definition of capitalism between a focus on the social relations of production and a market-based explanation, overlooks Spain’s and Portugal’s inability to move towards more dynamic, capitalist economies despite their dominance over the Americas in the 16th century.</p>
<p>Beyond the themes already discussed, <italic>Global History: A View from the South</italic> also examines current developments in the global economy, and in particular the relationship between globalisation and the international state-system. Similar to other Marxists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">Arrighi 1994</xref>), Amin identifies two distinctive logics of competition at work. ‘The world is thus structured as much by interstate relations as by the play of private commercial competition’ (p. 105). In other words, there is a territorial and a capitalist logic at work here. This is ultimately problematic, since it implies a state-centric view of the global economy and a focus on a rivalry between different national classes. The emergence of transnational class fractions and class struggle at the international level beyond states is, however, overlooked. (For a critical discussion of Marxist state-centrism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309816813489943">Bieler and Morton 2003</xref>.)</p>
<p>Overall, however, despite these tensions within Amin’s work and the points of criticism raised, this volume constitutes scholarship of the highest quality. Its fresh, non-Eurocentric view of global history provides an exciting alternative of how to understand the emergence of capitalism and, in turn, helps to identify ways of how to move beyond it. I strongly recommend this book.</p>
