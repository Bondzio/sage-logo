            <p>A consistent supply of competent and confident faculty is essential to meeting the growing demand for nurses. One way to ensure continuity among nurse educators is through faculty mentorship. There is very little literature about nurse educator mentorship models and no research was found that tested mentoring frameworks or strategies with nurse educators. The matriculation and retention of nursing faculty requires diligence in the areas of practice, teaching, and scholarship. The authors of this article discuss current nursing mentorship models and propose a new one for consideration.</p>

      <p>Developing the role of nurse educators cannot be overstated in this turbulent time of healthcare system uncertainty and nursing shortage. The need for competent and well-prepared nurse educators continues to be a dynamic and challenging issue and a number of national and state programs are encouraging nurses to move into nurse educator positions. Nursing programs must make sure that as nurses take on the educator role that they are equipped with the confidence, experience, and problem-solving skills to meet the demands for practice, teaching, scholarship, and service.</p>
      <p>Mentoring and mentorship programs have been utilized formally in other disciplines and within the corporate world serving as a vehicle for career development, yet nursing has not made mentoring a consistent practice within academia. Preceptor programs are a type of mentoring that has been developed to support clinical experiences for nursing students, and has been utilized extensively within hospitals as part of graduate nurse and new employee orientations.</p>
      <p>There is a gap in the literature demonstrating the use of mentorship models both in nursing and other disciplines. Anecdotes reveal that mentoring relationships benefit both the mentor and mentee where both grow as the result of the interaction. Evaluation and testing of mentorship models can facilitate mentoring programs for nursing that can benefit new faculty, especially those who are new to teaching.</p>
      <p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447565">National League for Nursing (2006)</xref> identified mentoring as an integral process for developing nurse faculty. Mentoring is relevant across the entire career continuum of an educator, and encompasses orientation to the faculty role; socialization to the academic community; development of teaching, research, and service skills; and facilitation of the growth of future leaders in nursing and nursing education. (p. 1)</p>
      <p>There are many compelling reasons to incorporate formal mentorship models to facilitate the nurse educator role including awareness of the shortage of qualified nursing educators, loss of faculty due to retirement, and the desire to retain novice faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447565">Blauvelt &amp; Spath, 2008</xref>).</p>

         <title>Mentoring: Essential and Developmental</title>
         <p>Mentoring is developmental in its essence. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447565">Dunham-Taylor, Lynn, Moore, McDaniel, and Walker (2008)</xref>, “mentoring is a developmental process designed to support and navigate the novice nurse educator through the tasks and experiences of nursing education” (p. 337). Cultivating junior faculty to become senior faculty and leaders is a win-win situation, and is crucial to academic institutions regarding productivity, job satisfaction, improved quality of nursing education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447565">Smith &amp; Zsohar, 2007</xref>), retention, promotion, and tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447565">Green, Rivers, &amp; Arekere, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447565">Smith &amp; Zsohar, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447565">Carroll (2004)</xref>, experienced faculty members contribute to the mentorship process through “patterns of engagement” where novices are encouraged to incorporate “standards of excellence and scholarship” (p. 319). Additionally, Carroll proposed that as the result of mentor-mentee pairings experienced nurse educators connect with novice colleagues who then benefit from the interaction through role development and collegial engagement within the community of professional nurses aligned with the scientific discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447565">Carroll, 2004</xref>).</p>

Few articles demonstrate mentorship frameworks or outcomes research utilized in nursing. Additionally, there is an absence of articles with a focus on testing mentorship models. A clear need exists for mentor program outcomes testing to identify what works and does not work in formal mentoring programs for faculty.</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447565">Yoder (1990)</xref> created a concept analysis model based upon the interaction of environment, people, and events. Additional core concepts in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447565">Yoder’s (1990)</xref> framework included: sponsorship, coaching, role modeling, friendship, acceptance, and confirmation. Yoder further proposed identifying concepts and models for nurse educator mentorship, defining mentorship models consistently, and conducting empirical testing of models to facilitate model implementation.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447565">Vance (2002)</xref> was instrumental in introducing the concept of mentorship into nursing education. She described mentoring as a “professional obligation and a privilege” as well as a “work and educational environment necessity” (p. 4). Vance, an early pioneer in the mentoring literature, proposed that mentor characteristics include: generosity of spirit, self-confidence and liking one’s self, competence, and openness to mutuality. Characteristics of the mentee include career commitment, respectful of self, initiative, and openness to mutuality.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447565">Ehrich and colleagues (2004)</xref> conducted an extensive literature review of formal mentoring programs in a number of professions and found “mentoring had far-reaching benefits for mentors and mentees” (p. 531). They reported that mentoring improved knowledge, skills, competencies, and performance in mentees and promoted professional and personal development in mentors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447565">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447565">Thorpe and Kalischuk (2003)</xref> developed the Collegial Mentoring Model (CMM) where “mentoring is defined as a friendship-based, collegial relationship affording honest and open communication occurring over an extended period and resulting in a positive outcome for both individuals” (p. 7). This model was comprised of a macro realm (the context) and a micro realm (time for togetherness, creating ambience, and promoting beingness). The authors described the model as operationalized through the process of caring, connecting, and communicating. The intended outcome for this model is personal and professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447565">Thorpe &amp; Kalischuk, 2003</xref>).</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447565">Hawkey (1997)</xref> explored the roles, responsibilities, and relationships in mentoring through a literature review and agenda for research. The review identified roles regarding, responsibilities and relationships found between mentor and mentee. According to Hawkey, “research on the division of roles, stages in student teacher development and mentoring relationships, and typologies of mentoring styles has resulted in frameworks for a better understanding of mentoring” (p. 332). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447565">Dunham-Taylor and colleagues (2008)</xref> also explored mentoring for improving faculty retention through more effective mentoring. These researchers purported that mentoring as a developmental process supports and assists the novice nurse educator with tasks and experiences in nursing education.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447565">Olson and Connelly (1995)</xref> conducted a qualitative study on pre-doctoral fellowships and how mentoring enhanced productivity. They identified six themes: a) productivity, b) work organization, c) mutual learning, d) problems encountered, e) beneficial research application skills, and f) innovative communication. Findings supported that mentoring facilitated critical thinking, socialization, performance, and overall success of the mentee. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447565">Green and colleagues (2006)</xref> also studied mentoring in the context of a framework for developing health disparities researchers. The researchers proposed four primary dimensions of mentoring: training, retaining, research agenda, and publication. Additionally, they viewed the roles of the mentors to support, advise, make formal and informal recommendations, and assist the mentee with professional development opportunities.</p>
         <p>New educators benefit greatly from a mentor, but mentors learn from mentees as well through development of new insights into their teaching styles. The new relationship that evolves can renew enthusiasm and commitment to the mentor’s craft and career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447565">Hargreaves &amp; Fullan, 2000</xref>). The majority of mentoring research has focused on defining mentoring, mentoring characteristics, mentorship relationships, and the emergence of faculty orientation programs non-specific to nursing mentorship programs. Henceforth, empirical inquiry into testing individual models or pieces of mentorship frameworks is scarce. For the purpose of advancing the state of the science of nursing, it is necessary for researchers to test mentorship models based on current and emerging theories to develop a body of evidence for implementing effective mentoring strategies and programs.</p>

         <title>Benefits of Mentor and Mentee Collaboration</title>
         <p>The benefits of mentor and mentee collaboration are many as has been documented in the literature. Mentors and mentees experience collective gains as a result of their interactions. Junior faculty mentees share new ideas and strategies acquired while in their educational programs while mentors share experiences, skill sets, research, and insight. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447565">Carroll (2004)</xref> described mentoring as a “process of being with another and coming to know rather than focusing on a preordained outcome” (p. 319). Therefore, benefits of the mentor-mentee process are creative and free-flowing when fostered in an environment of engagement. The mentor-mentee relationship is evolving and far-reaching. It holds magnificent potential for fostering excellence in practice, teaching, and scholarship.</p>

         <title>Barriers to Effective Mentor and Mentee Relationships</title>
         <p>In addition to the positive aspects of mentorship experiences, there are also barriers. A significant barrier, revealed in the literature, is confusion regarding the concept of mentorship and the role of the mentor. Many models discuss activities, stages in the process and the relationship between mentor and mentee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447565">Andrews &amp; Wallis, 1999</xref>). “No one model is seen as more appropriate than another and the choice usually depends upon the mentor’s familiarity with a particular framework” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447565">Andrews &amp; Wallis, 1999</xref>, p. 201). Another barrier to successful mentorship is scheduling and time constraints for the mentor and the mentee. Organization is essential to support the entire process. Additionally, imbalances between expectations of the mentor and mentee can emerge. A solution is to establish timelines and check points to assess progress for collaborative efforts and to make sure mentee performance outcomes are successfully achieved. Lastly, a barrier that can tip the balance of the entire interaction is when the mentee has not sought out an appropriate mentor for the proposed purpose and outcomes. For example, a mentee would not seek out a mentor with expertise in curriculum development when the proposed focus is on staff education or client outcomes.</p>

         <title>Nurse Educator Mentorship Models</title>
         <p>New faculty orientation programs within academic settings lack discipline-specific mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447565">Hand, 2008</xref>). In addition, there has been limited inquiry into strategies for new-faculty orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447565">Hand, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447565">Morin and Ashton (2004)</xref> identified that:</p>
         <p>Faculty new to teaching or the institution indicated that the first few years were stressful, that establishing collegial relationships was helpful with their transition to the institution, that considerable time was spent meeting their teaching requirements to the detriment of their scholarship, and that lack of support, either from their colleagues or from those in positions to provide tangible support, influenced their ability to be productive citizens of the academy. (p. 245)</p>
         <p>Nurse scholars can support the emergence of new paradigms with the development of mentorship models and frameworks to guide faculty charged with various developmental tasks. With the development of guidelines for mentorship programs from tested frameworks and models, there will be support for nurse educators to provide quality education for students.</p>
         <p>One example is the transformational-transcendence mentorship model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894318412447565">Figure 1</xref>). As with any model or framework, the concepts are identified and defined along with the roles of mentor and mentee. The definitions of mentor and mentee posed for this model are as follows. The <italic>mentor</italic> is a guide who through the process of transformational and transcending interaction influences the mentee by being a visionary and problem-solver. The <italic>mentee</italic>, as learner, interacts by way of the transformational and transcending exchange and as the result takes initiative, integrates knowledge, information, and skills imparted by the mentor. These interactions afford the mentee more decision-making opportunities for the purpose of meeting performance objectives.</p>

         <title>The Transformational and Transcending Process</title>
         <p>The mentorship model described here is built on the premise that the mentorship process is a transformational and transcending process. It is fluid and flowing and both mentor and mentee influence and are mutually influenced. The mentor and mentee experience change in constant motion as the result of the interaction. Both are transformed due to interaction resulting in transcendence demonstrated through change and growth in each that would not have been initiated without the mentor-mentee relationship. The process of critical thinking occurs and knowledge is acquired by mentor and mentee in the motion of the transformational-transcendence evolving process. Both the mentor and mentee actualize attributes that are integral to the model.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section7-0894318412447565">
         <title>Congruency: A Foundational Concept</title>
         <p>Consistent with the flow, is the moving back and forth through key areas of the transformational-transcendence mentorship model for career development in areas of teaching, scholarship, and practice. Congruency is a foundational concept that occurs initially and throughout the mentorship process. The mentor and mentee demonstrate congruency when the mentor holds the experience, knowledge, and skills that the mentee needs, desires, and aspires to master. Truthful self-awareness and assessment helps the mentee to identify what is needed from a mentor, what kinds of skill sets are sought, and what guidance is needed in practice, teaching, and scholarship. Congruency at its most primal level is the ability for the mentor and mentee to mesh personas by identifying complementary knowledge and skill sets. If the mentor and mentee are not a good fit, then interaction will have constraints and growth will be restricted. The motion, form, and fluidity of the transformational and transcending mentor-mentee interactions must be free to grow and move in and out of core areas naturally. The mentor-mentee relationship is contingent upon congruency and fit.</p>

         <title>Mentorship: An Interactional Process</title>
         <p>The roles of the mentor and mentee are critical to the transformational-transcendence mentorship model and are the foundation for the interactional process. The mentor shares knowledge and makes assessments as to the needs of the mentee through being open, an essential attribute. The mentor serves as guide that may encompass multiple descriptors, such as teacher, supporter, coach, and others. In this model, the term, guide characterizes the leadership and teaching role, where the role is fluid and assertive, but at the same time open to receive and transform through change caused by the interaction between mentor and mentee. Transferability of knowledge and information occurs in motion between the mentor and mentee. By way of transferability, the mentor ensures that the mentee is able to achieve personal objectives and meet performance expectations. This transfer of knowledge, information, and skill, referred to as transferability in this mentorship model, is demonstrated by the mentor description provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447565">Ondek and Gingerich (1994)</xref>, “that mentors possess the knowingness to know when to intervene and know when to sit back” (p. 6). The mentor and mentee inherently have essential attributes that further define their respective roles. The mentee manifests essential attributes, such as being open to receive and take initiative, and demonstrates the ability to take risks through decision-making. Additionally, the mentee exhibits interdependence in the transformational-transcendence mentorship model, not yet ready to be independent without the mentor, but ready to take initiative, make choices through informed decision-making and integrate the learning experiences that have been fostered by the mentor.</p>
         <p>Within the transformational-transcendence mentorship model interaction, knowledge is exchanged, growth occurs, and critical thinking emerges where both the mentor and mentee experience change as the result of the interaction. Change is an important concept, since it is the impetus that propels courses of action and undergirds the transformational process. Critical thinking and the acquisition of knowledge and skills evolves into transcendence, which is the point where change is demonstrated through choices and decision-making. A growing confidence is exuded from the mentee with each new awakening and tested action. The mentor also experiences transformation as the result of the interaction with the mentee.</p>

         <title>Unique Roles of Mentor and Mentee</title>
         <p>The roles of the mentor and mentee are not equivalent, but unique in nature and may overlap at times. The mentor guides, problem-solves, and is visionary. The mentee is learner, integrator, and decision-maker. In addition to the mentee roles of learner, integrator, and decision-maker, junior faculty may not be proficient in teaching, scholarship, and practice in the academic environment. The mentor and mentee may vary their focus on teaching, scholarship, and practice areas depending on personal readiness and aspirations and institutional needs and requirements. Publishing, grant writing, and conducting research add to teaching responsibilities for junior faculty who may feel overwhelmed.</p>

         <title>Mentors and Mentees</title>
         <p>Junior faculty may lack confidence, experience, and problem-solving skills in relationship to meeting the expectations and demands for practice, teaching, and scholarship. It is the role of the mentor to envision and assess the needs of the faculty member. It is the responsibility of the mentor to perform this function with insight, not only being able to guide faculty with new experiences, but also to fulfill obligations to the client for safe care. The mentor’s abilities include different skill sets and knowledge levels. Creating learning opportunities is another function of the mentor role, sometimes enlisting the assistance of senior faculty. The role of guide often called teacher, supporter, or coach in other models is a transformational-transcendence role, and the junior faculty’s experience and growth is dependent on this process. The junior faculty as a mentee is the learner and has the task of integrating the knowledge and skills of critical thinking and decision-making in teaching, scholarship, and practice imparted by the mentor.</p>
         <p>The focus among core areas of practice, teaching, and scholarship shift according to the weight assigned, requirements, and faculty maturation. For junior faculty, practice may be the primary focus with teaching followed by scholarship. For the mentor, scholarship may be of primary import, with teaching and practice closely following. These three core areas may rotate according to assigned tasks and responsibilities. The mentor demonstrates for the mentee how to add balance to the mix, so that the mentee sees that each area is integral and can be achieved when set in motion appropriately.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Mentor and mentee relationships promote faculty retention, career development, and quality education. Knowledge, skills, and expertise shared through mentorship experiences are foundational and vital for new and junior faculty. While universities and other institutions have recognized the value of mentor-mentee relationships and mentorship programs, further exploration and emphasis is needed. Release time, workload support, and even financial resources may be required initially to foster development and growth of the mentor-mentee relationship. To determine the value of resource use, it is critical that nurse researchers develop and test models to add to the empirical body of knowledge and explore the impact of mentor-mentee relationships. Successful mentor-mentee relationships and programs help junior faculty to meet the evolving demands of practice, teaching, and scholarship.</p>
