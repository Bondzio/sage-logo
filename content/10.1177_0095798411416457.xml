<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how multiracial people of African descent experience racism in schools and to understand how their parents or guardians prepare them to cope with incidents of racism in school. Through qualitative in-depth interviews with multiracial and transracially adopted adults of African descent, this study seeks to raise awareness regarding the complexity of family racial dynamics and how family racial socialization processes affect students’ ability to navigate racism. Findings suggested that racial socialization processes varied by the racial composition of the family, that is, families in which there was at least one Black parent or guardian present tended to more openly address issues of race and racism in comparison with families in which there was no Black parent or guardian present. Findings from this study hold theoretical implications for how racial socialization is conceptualized and practical implications for programs and policies designed to support families raising children of African descent.</p>

<p>Encountering racism is a normal, everyday occurrence in the lives of people of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411416457">Bell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411416457">Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 2001</xref>), particularly for people of African descent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095798411416457">1</xref></sup> Schools are an especially ripe context for encounters with racism.

At the individual level, personally mediated racism can be seen in discrimination among and between students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095798411416457">Rosenbloom &amp; Way, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095798411416457">Tatum, 1997</xref>) and in teacher-student interactions, practices, and expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095798411416457">Ferguson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0095798411416457">Weinstein, Gregory, &amp; Strambler, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the face of racism may have changed over the decades from a more overt form to a more complex, covert or “colorblind” form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798411416457">Bonilla-Silva, 2006</xref>; Dovidio, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095798411416457">Pierce, 1974</xref>), the effects of racism are very real, including various negative mental health concerns such as low self-esteem, depression, psychological distress, and poor academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411416457">Carroll, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095798411416457">Pierce, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095798411416457">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0095798411416457">Williams, Neighbors, &amp; Jackson, 2003</xref>). To combat the potentially negative effects of racism, scholars have argued that people of color need to be racially socialized—taught about race and racism—in order to develop a positive sense of self-identity and strategies to cope with racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095798411416457">García Coll et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095798411416457">Pierce, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095798411416457">Spencer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095798411416457">Stevenson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095798411416457">Thornton, Chatters, Taylor, &amp; Allen, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Often the responsibility of racial socialization is assumed to fall on the family, and this family is assumed to be the same race as the child. However, for multiracial people of African descent the racial socialization process is complicated by racial and ethnic differences between parents and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095798411416457">Perry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095798411416457">Raible, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095798411416457">Samuels, 2009</xref>). Such complexities bring into question how people of African descent raised with parents or guardians of different racial and ethnic backgrounds—a phenomenon I term <italic>Cross-Racially Raised</italic>—learn to navigate and address racism, particularly the subtle everyday racism people of color often experience.</p>

<title>Coping With Racism</title>
<p>Although it is generally accepted that race is a social construct, racism still holds significant implications for those who are ascribed to racial categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798411416457">Bonilla-Silva, 2006</xref>). In this study, racism is defined as individual behavior and structural relationships, policies, ideologies, and institutional practices that privilege Whiteness and differentially allocate resources based on an individual’s presumed racial affiliation in order to maintain racial hegemony. The relationship between the structural and institutional aspects and individual behavior is cyclical—the structural components influence one’s ideology and behavior, which in turn influence structures and so on. This definition articulates the interconnected role of individual and institutional aspects of racism.</p>
<p>Racism has the potential to negatively affect the mental health and academic performance of Black people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411416457">Carroll, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798411416457">Carter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095798411416457">Clark, Anderson, Clark, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095798411416457">Pierce, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095798411416457">Smith, Yosso, &amp; Solórzano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095798411416457">Spencer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095798411416457">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0095798411416457">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). One of the factors that influences how such experiences and encounters affect individuals are the coping mechanisms one employs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798411416457">Carter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095798411416457">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095798411416457">Spencer, Dupree, &amp; Hartman, 1997</xref>). Adaptive coping strategies such as seeking social support and having a positive racial identity tend to lead to more positive outcomes, whereas maladaptive strategies such as internalizing negative stereotypes or withdrawing are hypothesized to lead to negative outcomes such as poor heath and deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095798411416457">Spencer, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Racial Socialization</title>
<p>Racial socialization is one means through which parents can provide social support and help their children develop adaptive strategies to cope with racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095798411416457">Stevenson, 1994</xref>). Racial socialization is broadly defined as the transmission of information, norms, and values about race and ethnicity to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095798411416457">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>). Scholars have noted that family is one of the most important, and often initial, social contexts to play a formative role in how Black individuals make sense of the significance and meaning of race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798411416457">Bowman &amp; Howard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411416457">Boykin &amp; Toms, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095798411416457">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have confirmed that a majority of Black parents exhibit practices that are intended to socialize their children to race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095798411416457">Peters, 1985/2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0095798411416457">Thomas &amp; Speight, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095798411416457">Thornton et al., 1990</xref>).

The messages most commonly employed by parents include cultural socialization, preparation for bias, and egalitarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095798411416457">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Current research on racial socialization has focused on understanding the outcomes of racial socialization approaches. Generally, racial socialization has been found to positively influence one’s racial identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411416457">Demo &amp; Hughes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095798411416457">Marshall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095798411416457">Sanders Thompson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095798411416457">Stevenson, 1995</xref>), self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095798411416457">Constantine &amp; Blackmon, 2002</xref>), academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798411416457">Bowman &amp; Howard, 1985</xref>), psychosocial functioning such as managing anger and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095798411416457">Stevenson et al., 1997</xref>), and ability to cope with racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798411416457">D. Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798411416457">Edwards &amp; Polite, 1992</xref>. Most studies have found cultural socialization to be associated with positive outcomes, including more positive group attitudes and less behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411416457">Caughy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411416457">Demo &amp; Hughes, 1990</xref>), but messages and attitudes of racial mistrust have been found to predict deviant behavior and less positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798411416457">Biafora, Warheit, Zimmerman, &amp; Gil, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095798411416457">McKown &amp; Strambler, 2009</xref>). There are mixed results regarding the effects of preparation for bias messages on youth outcomes because such messages are often confounded by messages of mistrust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095798411416457">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the literature on racial socialization in Black families has progressed over the last decades, limitations still exist. Perhaps the most significant limitation is that most studies take a monocentric, essentialist view of race. This is a severe limitation because it makes certain assumptions about who is Black or African American and that all “Black” children are raised by Black parents or guardians.</p>

<title>Cross-Racial Families</title>
<p>Developing a terminology to describe the experiences of Black people who were raised by parents of a different racial background, either by birth or adoption, is a difficult task. First, there are many circumstances that could have lead to this situation—being adopted by White parents, being multiracial and raised by a White single birthmother, or being adopted by an interracial couple. Additionally, being of multiracial background complicates how same race and transracial families are defined. Traditionally, transracial families are thought to occur when parents (two White or one single White) adopt a child of a different race (e.g., Black), but what does it mean when this monoracial White or Black couple adopts a multiracial “part-White” child? Is that still “transracial”? Similarly, who is the “same race” parent in an interracial couple that raised (by birth or adoption) a multiracial child? Or what about someone who was “passed” off by the adoption agency as White only to find out as an adult that they were also “part Black” after finding their birth parent(s)? These perplexing questions have led me to employ the term <italic>Cross-Racially Raised</italic> to describe the multidimensionality of such experiences and circumstances. I used the term <italic>Cross-Racially Raised</italic> to describe individuals who grew up in contexts that “contradict monocentric race and kinship norms—that all family members and individuals embody a single racial-ethnic identity and cultural heritage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095798411416457">Samuels, 2009</xref>, p. 82).</p>
<p>It is often assumed that multiracial individuals raised in their birth families experience life differently than those adopted into White families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798411416457">U. M. Brown, 1995</xref>). However, the stigma associated with being a person of color in a society where racism toward Black people and other minorities continues to reside cuts across both populations. The question is, “How do their parents or guardians prepare them to deal with such racism?” Few studies document the extent to which the parents of cross-racially raised individuals engage in teaching their children of color coping skills to deal effectively with racism and discrimination. Past studies have found that transracial adoptive parents varied a great deal in the ways in which they handled racial issues; some parents downplayed racist comments, others made derogatory comments about racists, and in fewer cases, some took a more active role in the community to promote social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798411416457">Andujo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411416457">Friedlander et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095798411416457">Johnson, Shireman, &amp; Watson, 1987</xref>). Although little research has been conducted to understand the outcomes of various parental racial socialization strategies in cross-racial families, researchers have suggested that transracial adoptees exposed to messages that emphasize cultural assimilation are more likely to internalize mainstream cultural worldviews and identify more strongly with the majority culture than with minority cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095798411416457">McRoy &amp; Zurcher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411416457">DeBerry, 1996</xref>). Conversely, studies have found that transracial adoptees were more likely to show racial pride when adoptive parents emphasized cultural socialization messages and actions, embraced the children’s racial backgrounds, and lived in racially integrated communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095798411416457">Feigelman &amp; Silverman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095798411416457">Huh &amp; Reid, 2000</xref>). Regarding multiracial individuals who were not adopted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095798411416457">Rollins (2009)</xref> found that multiracial adolescents, whose mothers emphasized mainstream and egalitarian (colorblind) messages, were less inclined to report that race was a salient part of their life and that multiracial adolescents with White mothers, who were more likely to employ egalitarian and colorblind approaches to socializing their children to race, reported lower racial identity exploration and identification with Black culture. Additionally, narratives of and about transracially adopted individuals and multiracial individuals often emphasize the need for family support and socialization methods, which teach them how to cope with racism and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095798411416457">McKinley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095798411416457">Patton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095798411416457">Samuels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095798411416457">Senna,1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095798411416457">Simon &amp; Roorda, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095798411416457">Trenka, Oparah, &amp; Shin, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Using in-depth interviews to explore experiences with racism and perceptions of parent or guardians’ racial socialization strategies, this article presents the preliminary findings from a qualitative study of 10 multiracial Black adults. Qualitative methods, which focus on understanding people’s lived experiences, are particularly well suited for this study as they focus on the meanings people place on events and interactions and connecting these meanings to the broader social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095798411416457">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Although surveys based in positivist perspectives are useful in gathering actors’ general thoughts about a subject, such tools are limited in their ability to illuminate the ways people explain, rationalize, or interpret their socialization to race and racism. Most research on racial socialization has been conducted from a positivist perspective using survey instruments and other quantitative measures to investigate racial socialization by categorizing parent messages and child perceptions and then correlating these measures with racial identity scales or academic metrics. Although quantitative data have been useful in illuminating the types and frequencies in which parents or children report certain aspects or approaches to racial socialization, understandings of the dynamic nature of socialization, the meanings one makes about their experiences, and the impacts of such experiences are yet to be fully understood.</p>
<p>This study used the extended case method (ECM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798411416457">Burawoy, 1998</xref>) and critical race theory to investigate the racial socialization experiences of multiracial Black people. The extended case method, which is similar to a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095798411416457">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>), draws from social constructivist and critical traditions and seeks to expand and complicate existing theoretical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798411416457">Burawoy, 1998</xref>). In addition to ECM, critical race theory, which starts from the premise that race and racism are central, endemic, and a fundamental part of defining and explaining how U.S. society functions, provides a strong methodological justification for the use of in-depth interviews in studying racism and racial socialization. The use of voice or “naming one’s own reality” is central to critical race theory in that it contributes to the “psychic preservation” of marginalized groups (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Thus, narratives not only provide in-depth understanding into the perspectives and experiences of an individual but also allow people to name their own reality and make sense of or cope with their experiences, in turn mutually benefiting the researcher, the interviewee, and potentially the community.</p>
<p>This analysis produced four broad conceptual themes in experiences with racism in school or educational settings (individual racism, institutional racism, exclusion from the Black community, and racism within the family) and two categories in adults’ perceptions of parent/guardian racial socialization strategies (those who openly addressed race and racism and those who denied or downplayed race and racism). These findings illuminate implications of parents not talking about race and racism and how such actions serve to racially socialize children. Additionally, although much of the research on racial socialization has focused on Black families raising Black children, this research expands conceptions of who is raising Black children and challenges long-held monoracial assumptions of family contexts.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Interviews with adults allow for access to the full longitudinal and reflective perspectives regarding experiences with racism and racial socialization messages. Understanding racial socialization at the adult level also provides insights into how individuals have processed the messages they received about race and racism, from parents and society in general, and the impact such messages have had on their development.</p>
<p>Purposive criterion procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095798411416457">Patton, 1990</xref>) and snowball sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0095798411416457">Weiss, 1994</xref>) were used to obtain a sample of five multiracial Black adults who were raised with at least one Black parent or guardian (by birth or adoption) and five multiracial Black adults who were raised by only White parents or guardians (by birth or adoption). Recruitment efforts included outreach to Black/African American college student groups, multiracial and transracial adoptee associations, professionals and scholars in the field of education and social welfare, and word of mouth.</p>
<p>Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 multiracial participants of African descent. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 43 years, and all the interviewees were female. Of the 10 interviewees, five were raised in a situation where there was no Black parent or guardian present and five were raised with at least one Black parent or guardian. Nine out of 10 interviewees grew up in middle- to upper-class families. Of the five interviewees who were raised with only White parents or guardians, all of them grew up primarily in predominantly White neighborhoods and attended predominantly White schools. Of the five interviewees who were raised with at least one Black parent or guardian, four of them grew up in racially mixed neighborhoods and attended racially mixed schools, while one grew up in a predominantly White neighborhood and attended a predominantly White school.</p>

<sec id="section8-0095798411416457">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Interviewees were asked questions about their family background, experiences with racism, their parent or guardian’s approach to dealing with racism, and their perceptions of their ability to address and navigate racism. Each interview began in the same way by asking the interviewee to discuss their family and the circumstances under which they were raised. From there, interviewees were asked about their most salient memories of racially charged incidents in school and how their parent/guardian responded to that incident. As the interviews were semistructured, questions were adapted to respond to shifts in interviewee responses. Interviews took place at a time and location that was convenient for the interviewees and lasted for about two hours. Prior to the interview, signed consent forms and authorization to audio record were obtained. Seven of the 10 interviews took place in-person and were audio-recorded and transcribed. Three of the interviews were conducted over the phone and were not audio-recorded. For those interviews that were not audio-recorded, detailed handwritten or typed notes were taken. The institution’s internal review board approved all procedures for this study.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To ensure the research was conducted and analyzed in a rigorous way, analysis followed a multiphase interpretive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0095798411416457">Tolman &amp; Brydon-Miller, 2001</xref>). The first phase involved open coding two to three initial interviews to help refine interview questions, articulate early impressions of themes, and identify potential follow-up questions. The next phase consisted of a reflexive interpretive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095798411416457">Schatzman, 1991</xref>) to identify exceptions in the data and early conceptual themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798411416457">Crabtree &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>). As this is an ongoing study, follow-up interviews are planned with a select group of participants whose experiences challenge or add complexity to the initial conceptual findings.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The following section provides a space for the voices of multiracial and transracially adopted individuals to share their experiences with racism in school and how their families approached issues of race and racism. I first discuss the major themes that arose regarding interviewees’ most salient experiences with racism, including experiences with individual and institutional racism in schools, experiences with the Black community, and experiences with racism in their extended families. I then discuss how their parents approached the process of racial socialization by juxtaposing families who were open to talking about race with those who denied or downplayed race and the existence of racism.</p>
<sec id="section11-0095798411416457">
<title>Experiences With Racism in School</title>
<p>In talking about their experiences with racism in school or education settings, interviewees discussed both subtle and overt forms of racism. Although about half of individuals had very vivid, blatant incidents of racism that colored how they viewed the world later in life, all 10 discussed the more subtle or institutional markers of race and racism in their lives, such as peers not wanting to associate with them or feeling treated differently by teachers. The sections that follow illustrate the major themes that arose regarding experiences and incidents of racism discussed by interviewees.</p>
<sec id="section12-0095798411416457">
<title>Racism at the individual level</title>
<p>Each of the interviewees I spoke with discussed salient memories that included instances of subtle or covert racism and questioning whether their peers’ or teachers’ actions were racially motivated. Sydney,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095798411416457">2</xref></sup> a 31-year-old biracial woman who was adopted at birth by a White couple on the East Coast summarizes her early memories:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There were lots of things that happened that are not clearly racial; kids not wanting to play with me or whatever, I feel there are lots of things that happen to me that were probably racial, but it wasn’t like overt racism.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of the participants’ most salient or initial memories of racially charged incidents occurred early in elementary school (second or third grade) and continued through high school. Such instances of subtle racism prompted many individuals’ initial awareness of race and racial difference. Although they may not yet have developed their personal racial identity or understanding of how race affected them directly, they were beginning to see that race was a “thing” and that people were treated differently because of it.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the interviewees’ initial memories of overt racialized experiences occurred during a time in school when race, and specifically Blackness, was central topic of discussion. Such instances included Martin Luther King, Jr. day events or learning about slavery in history lessons. For example, Sydney recalled one of her White classmates calling her a “negro” in class during a discussion about slavery. Although Sydney did not directly attribute what this classmate said to be racist, she did note that it was clear to her that being a “negro” was a bad thing and such comments carried negative connotations about her race.</p>
<p>Many of the interviewees note experiencing racism from peers and counselors toward the end of their high school career as they were preparing for college. For example, when Jennifer, a 23-year-old biracial woman who was adopted by a White family, learned she was accepted to college, she commented “everyone said the only reason I got in was because I was Black.” Like Jennifer, many other interviewees also added that it was the norm for other students, and in some cases guidance counselors, to say the only reason they received scholarships or got accepted to college was because they were Black.</p>
<p>Building on the initial racial awareness processes prompted by subtle incidents of racism, the more overt incidents brought about not only an awareness of race in general but also an awareness of how people saw them racially, what it meant to be seen as a Black person, and the negative connotations associated with being ascribed to that racial group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0095798411416457">
<title>Institutional racism</title>
<p>In recalling instances of institutional racism, a third of the interviewees discussed the salience of the segregation of Black students into lower performing classes. When asked about her first memories of racism in school, Julie, a 28-year-old biracial woman who was raised by her White birth mother and Black birth father, stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I haven’t really had any overt things happen; no one ever called me the n-word, I’ve never had someone say a racial joke to me or about me, so I haven’t had that obvious, clear experience with racism . . . but in high school I remember there were no teachers that looked like me and I remember this zero tolerance sweep where half of the Black students had been sent to the continuation school within that day. I remember telling my parents that all my friends were gone and I didn’t know what happened.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Julie’s experience echoes many other interviewees’ comments regarding the segregation of Black students they noticed as they progressed through school. Interestingly, many of the individuals I spoke with, such as Julie, were high-achieving students who were often placed in advanced classes with the White and Asian students. As young students, they may not have been sure why many other Black students were being placed in lower level classes, nor did they experience this segregation themselves; however, they did notice the race-based tracking system that was in place at many of their schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0095798411416457">
<title>Feeling excluded from the Black community</title>
<p>Close to half of the individuals I spoke with discussed times in their lives when they felt excluded by Black communities because they were either biracial or because they grew up in predominantly White spaces with White parents. Maggie, a 30-year-old multiracial woman who was adopted by a White family, describes her middle school experience with the Black Student Union:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The things that happened were really like the opposite of what I would think of as racism. . . . I’d be in school and there were things I’d try to participate in, like the Black student association and stuff, and there would be members of those groups that would tell me I couldn’t participate and since I couldn’t verify my pedigree of who my birth parents were, it [the Black community] was like the one place I was starting to feel comfortable and then I couldn’t participate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While Maggie’s light skin tone made her experience unique because she could have passed for White and she did not yet know her birth parents, her story is very characteristic of what other individuals discussed regarding their initial experiences with other Black students and communities. Although these experiences grew more positive over time, and almost all the interviewees discuss feeling accepted and comfortable in Black communities as adults, these initial experiences shaped their understanding of intraracial relations and eventually pushed them to be more proactive about immersing themselves in Black communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0095798411416457">
<title>Racism within the family</title>
<p>When I asked interviewees about their first or most salient experiences of racism in school, half of the interviewees articulated that their most salient memories of racism when they were younger occurred within their extended and immediate family, emphasizing that the school incidents paled in comparison with racism in the family. This was true for both transracially adopted individuals as well as those who were raised in interracial families.</p>
<p>Katrina, a 25-year-old biracial woman who was raised by her White birth mother and Black birth father, discussed an incident that occurred with her maternal grandmother who did not approve of her mother’s relationship with a Black man.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I was four, my mom’s mom, well, I always felt like she didn’t like me because I was Black, I don’t know why, but I felt that. It was very clear in my head that she didn’t like me, I’m Black. When I was born I was named after her, my middle name, and then they changed it because she didn’t want me named after her. . . . When she was close to passing away my mom and I would go visit her and later I learned that she didn’t approve of dad because he was Black, and “you can’t marry a Black guy.” And I don’t remember who told me this but there was one time that she said, after dad left, that “it took me like a week to get the nigger smell out of the shower.” So she was <italic>super</italic> racist!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maggie also discussed an experience regarding racism in her adoptive family. When Maggie, who is of Afro Caribbean and Eastern European descent, was put up for adoption, she was marketed as a “Latina” with no mention of any African descent from her birth father’s side. Maggie’s light skin tone and European features made it easy for both the adoption agency and her parents to overlook her African heritage. However, it became evident to Maggie that she was not fully accepted by her family because, although she looked very light, she was still not White.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They [my family] didn’t know for a long time that the Black part was there, but even knowing that my parents had chosen not to adopt a child who was White caused a lot of tension in my family. It took my parents a while to adopt, and later I found letters that my mom was clearly looking for a White baby, but I guess it was so hard to adopt a White baby and my mom was so desperate to have a baby, that that changed. I feel like the family would have wanted my parents to wait longer and adopt a White baby. But because I was light-skinned enough, it sorta worked for a while until I started to get older and was obviously not White looking.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Katrina and Maggie’s experiences are characteristic of the comments and incidents that occurred both within adoptive and birth families. As these two incidents illustrate, such experiences are painful and often shape one’s sense of belonging and views of race within a family as well as in the larger society.</p>

<title>Family Approaches to Addressing Race and Racism</title>
<p>Although it is clear that their children were experiencing racialized incidents within educational institutions and larger social contexts, not all parents and families were necessarily prepared or willing to address such incidents or help their children navigate their experiences. Throughout the interviews, it became clear that there was a divide between families who talked about race and racism with their children and those who did not. Interviewees who were raised in interracial birth families and the two biracial women who were adopted and raised by Black families discussed the many ways in which their parents addressed the reality of race and racism. Some families talked overtly about race, what it meant to be a Black person in society, and the reality of racism, while others took a more covert approach to putting their children in contexts in which race was the topic of discussion or ensuring that they grew up in diverse situations and were exposed to other Black people.</p>
<p>In contrast to those parents and families who recognized and discussed issues of race and racism were the families who denied, downplayed, and overlooked the significance of race and racism in their children’s lives. The individuals who were raised in White families in which there were no Black parents or guardians present noted that their parents did not discuss race or racism and sometimes even went through great strides to deny that their child was also Black. As a result of their parent’s resistance to talking about issue of race, these individuals often noted internalizing their feelings and experiences.</p>
<sec id="section17-0095798411416457">
<title>Who’s talking about race and racism?</title>
<p>Parents and guardians who openly acknowledged the reality of racism and the impact it could have on their child focused on preparing their children for bias, strengthening the child’s sense of self, and passing on cultural traditions and values. Along with the recognition of the reality of racism, three of the five interviewees who grew up with at least one Black parent or guardian noted that their parents often took proactive, open, and direct measures to address and protect them from the potential effects of racism. As Julie stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was a student that really excelled in school. When my dad noticed my teachers were trying to hold me back at the all White school, he basically said that he didn’t know why they were trying to hold me back, but it might be a possibility that you are one of the only Black kids. So they took me out of that school and put me in another school.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I also asked Julie what her parents told her about race and her racial background. She recalls the following incident with her mother:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I was in middle school, there was this random time in the car with my mom and she said you are going to be what society perceives you to be; you are what society says you are. And I was like OK cool. I knew what that meant because I always looked Black. I think it would be different for people who look more mixed. I could never pass for White.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Julie’s comments about how her parents approached the topic of race and racism echo the experiences of other biracial individuals raised in families in which there were Black people present. These individuals often spoke of how their parents, even the ones who were White, had a conscious recognition of what it meant to walk around this earth as a Black person either because they were Black or they made a conscious choice to be in a relationship with someone who was.</p>
<p>All the interviewees who grew up with at least one Black parent or guardian noted their families used indirect approaches and taught them about race and racism through modeling approaches such as taking pride in Black culture and history or openly talking about the existence and impact of racism with their friends. Amy, a 43-year-old biracial woman who was adopted by a Black family, discussed how her family created an environment that supported Black heritage and openly talked about issues of race and racism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I remember the art in our house had lots of Black images. And my dad had this Black power thing with the fists; there were several representations of that in our house. The images, the artwork, the music, my dad listening to what was essentially Black protest music in the 70s, all that was present. Then their friends that were around, being present for these conversations that the men were having in the living room talking about how they were navigating being in that [predominantly White] environment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hearing her father’s conversations about racism shaped Amy’s awareness of racism and served as a subtle method of racial socialization. Although Amy grew up in a family with two Black parents, her stories are characteristic of what the individuals who grew up in interracial families discussed with regard to their racial socialization. These stories illustrate the significant role that parents’ norms and actions play in bringing about an awareness of racial issues and shaping racial identity. Such experiences support social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095798411416457">Bandura, 1977</xref>), which asserts that children learn from the behaviors their parent’s model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0095798411416457">
<title>Who’s not talking about race and racism?</title>
<p>In contrast to those families who used direct or modeling techniques to teach their children about racism were families who emphasized colorblind or egalitarian approaches, avoided conversations about race and racism, and sometimes denied their child was also Black. All the interviewees who grew up with only White parents or guardians noted their parents employed one or more of these approaches. Sydney talked about how her parents’ avoidance of racial issues affected her sense of self:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My parents really didn’t deal with it [racism] at all so I just internalized all of it. I didn’t share with them what happened to me. They were like “race doesn’t matter, everyone’s the same, and there’s no problem.” I thought there was something wrong with me cause I thought there <italic>was</italic> a problem. And I didn’t feel like I could talk to them about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result of her parents’ reluctance to talk about race issues and her internalization of the negative attention she was getting, Sydney threw herself into her academic work and strove to be a perfectionist to avoid such experiences. She thought if she was perfect and did well in school she would not stand out as much and the attention would be directed away from her. However, this was not the case because, as Sydney began to realize, much of the attention she got was due to her being the only Black person in her school, something she could not escape no matter how well she did in school.</p>
<p>Sydney’s experience is characteristic of what many of the transracial adoptees who were raised by White parents discussed. These individuals often noted that when they told their parents about the racism that they were encountering, their parents either denied it was happening and attributed it to something else or just told them to ignore it. As a result, many of the interviewees said they stopped telling their parents about their experiences with racism or asking questions about race because they felt their parents did not know how to handle such issues.</p>
<p>In addition to not addressing race and racism, all interviewees who grew up with only White parents discussed how, at some point during their lives, their parents were in denial that their child was a person of African descent. For many of those who were adopted, efforts to downplay their Blackness were initiated by the adoption agency in an effort to make them more marketable to White families (e.g., a Black/Chinese child would be marketed with an emphasis on his or her Asian background). This racial construction allowed both the adoption agency and the parents to deny their child was Black, even partially. Although this denial was initiated by the adoption agency in an effort to market these children, it was perpetuated by the families for a significant portion of the adoptees’ lives.</p>
<p>Those parents who did recognize their children were also Black often downplayed their Blackness. For example, Sydney’s parents told her she was “tan.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My parents told me I wasn’t Black or White, I was this other thing that was mixed; they told me I was tan. Which is like “you aren’t Black you aren’t White you are both.” They raised me to be both, but in being both I was neither one; I was some other thing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to downplaying their children’s Black heritage, some families were resistant to their children associating with other Black kids. Maggie recalls a memory of how her parents reacted when she started befriending Black kids in high school:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My parents they didn’t understand why their friends wouldn’t necessarily be my friends; because like they hung out with their White friends and wanted me to hang out with their kids and date their sons and stuff. And the kids I wanted to hang out with were not the people they would be friends with. . . . I’d rather hang out with my Black girlfriend at her house. It was never said that it was about race but there was a lot of tension about “well why do you always want to hang out there and not here” and “why do you want to listen to that music and bring that home and that irritates me.” And it wasn’t like overt racism in badmouthing them [my Black friends] but just not being supportive and not including them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For many of the adoptees in the group, another theme became salient—the intersectionality of race, adoption, and abandonment. In addition to their adoption stories, some of the adoptees shared their fears of talking with their parents about race, particularly when their parents were not forthcoming about the issues of race and racism. I end with Maria’s quote, which illustrates the complicated nature of trying to affirm a racial identity that has been denied. Maria, a 38-year-old multiracial Black woman who was adopted by White parents, closed her interview by saying:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is a risk involved in resisting the denial that your parents have put on you for so many years; the risk is that if I come out as this person of color, if I come out as a Black person and acknowledge that I’m Black there’s a possibility that you aren’t gonna love me anymore because your whole lives you’ve been telling me that Blackness is wrong. So how do I maintain my status as a Black person in this family if I acknowledge my whole self and if I do it at what cost do I do it? . . . And I see this now in the kids I work with. Even if their parents are liberal and like “I know you’re Black” . . . there’s something still going on there about being able to be a whole Black person.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how multiracial people of African descent experience racism in schools and to understand how their parents or guardians racially socialized and prepared them to address and cope with incidents of racism in school. Each of the interviewees I spoke with shared accounts of racism and discrimination they experienced in many areas of their lives. Some of the experiences echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095798411416457">Pierce’s (1970)</xref> conception of racial microaggressions and prompted interviewees to question how much of their experiences were based on race. Others noted quite painful and blatant racial encounters both in school and in their families. Although many of the accounts shared above focus on experiences these individuals had as children or youth, individuals also shared accounts of racism they recently encountered as adults, either in college or on the job. Given such experiences, it is clear to see that racism and discrimination are still very salient aspects in the lives of people of color, and thus it is important for families to provide space and resources for their children to cope with such experiences.</p>
<p>As the narratives show, family approaches to addressing issues of race and racism vary greatly. Perhaps the most important finding regarding the ways in which families did or did not address the incidents of racism their children encountered was that racial socialization processes varied by the racial composition of the family. Participants who were raised in a situation where there was at least one Black parent noted their families spoke with them about race, overtly or covertly socialized them to be aware of the racism that existed, and sometimes took protective measures to counter the impact of racism. Conversely, individuals who were raised by White parents or guardians, where there were no Black parents or guardians present, had the opposite experience. These differing experiences led to two different comfort levels of talking with their parents about race. The participants who noted their parents were open to conversations about race and racism more often told their parents when racial incidents occurred, while those whose parents did not talk with them about race internalized their experience, leaving them feeling unprepared to deal with racially charged incidents during their youth and uncomfortable talking with their parents about such incidents.</p>
<p>Although this study did not seek to address <italic>why</italic> some families were more open to addressing race and racism than others, previous literature and theory on racial identity development and cross-racial dialogues may offer some insights on this issue. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095798411416457">Stevenson (1994)</xref> notes, fear is a central factor in why people do not talk about race; fear that talking about racism will make their child angry or bitter, the fear that children are not able to understand, and the fear that such discussions will inhibit children from fulfilling their potential are but a few reasons scholars have noted Black parents choose not to talk to their children about race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095798411416457">Stevenson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095798411416457">Thornton et al., 1990</xref>). For White people, these fears are augmented by the fear of seeming racist and having to acknowledge their privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095798411416457">Frankenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411416457">Helms, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095798411416457">McIntosh, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095798411416457">Tatum, 1997</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798411416457">Bonilla-Silva’s (2006)</xref> notion of “colorblind racism,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095798411416457">Apfelbaum, Sommers, and Norton (2008)</xref> note that “strategic colorblindness” is one way that Whites try to appear unbiased by avoiding discussions about race and racism. However, this avoidance of the reality of race, and the implications it holds, actually perpetuates racism and its negative impact on people of color by maintaining the racial status quo. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095798411416457">Stevenson (1994)</xref> notes, “The fear of dialogue paralyzes our ability to move beyond racial tension” (p. 191). Not talking about race allows one to circumvent having to challenge the current racial structure, their position in the racial structure, and assumptions that uphold those structures.</p>
<p>As social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095798411416457">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1985</xref>) points out, individuals will seek out others like themselves to improve self-esteem. Often, for people of color, this is found in the family. As these stories illuminate, if one does not have a family that resembles them, it may be difficult to find such solace and may even exacerbate feelings of exclusion. Individuals’ ability to develop a positive sense of themselves as a person of color and cope with racism that affects their lives can be negatively affected if parents deny their child’s race, perpetuate negative attitudes toward Black people—either subtle or overt—or let fear of discussing race and racism inhibit them from addressing the racism their children will face.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>The findings of this research build on other studies regarding the presence of racism in school settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095798411416457">Coutinho &amp; Oswald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798411416457">Delpit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095798411416457">Irvine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095798411416457">Neblett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095798411416457">Noguera, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095798411416457">Oakes, 1985</xref>) and reiterate previous findings regarding the racialized experiences of multiracial and transracially adopted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095798411416457">McKinley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095798411416457">Patton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095798411416457">Root, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095798411416457">Samuels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095798411416457">Senna, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095798411416457">Simon &amp; Roorda, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095798411416457">Trenka et al., 2006</xref>). This study expands the discourse on racial socialization by illuminating differences in how parents racially socialize their children based on family racial composition. Because this research has revealed both positive and negative socialization experiences, it is clear that there are many implications for how parents racially socialize their children, prepare and protect them from racism, and help foster a positive sense of self-identity.</p>
<p>Many individuals, both those raised in adoptive homes and those raised in birth families, often stated they felt their parents did the best they could given the resources they had. It is important to remember that the individuals I interviewed are all adults and some of these experiences happened many years ago. However, some of the adults who currently work with children and youth often note seeing similar dynamics of family racial socialization occurring today, particularly the focus on colorblind racial socialization for transracial adoptees.</p>
<p>While growing up as a multiracial Black person in a family without the presence of Black parents or relatives presents challenges for all involved, all hope is not lost. Research on transracial adoptive families increasingly supports cultural competence among transracially adoptive parents and suggests that some White adoptive families believe addressing issues of race and racism are a reality of parenting children of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798411416457">Carstens &amp; Julia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095798411416457">Feigelman &amp; Silverman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411416457">Friedlander et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095798411416457">Huh &amp; Reid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095798411416457">Steinberg &amp; Hall, 2000</xref>). A better understanding of families such as these can help create a model for racial socialization in transracially adoptive families and help shape currently existing and future training programs for families. While training of biological families is not as feasible as training for adoptive parents, a number of support programs for parents and guardians of monoracial and multiracial children of color do exist; this research can help inform the many social and educational programs and policies designed to support families raising children of color in general.</p>
<p>Education professionals can also play a role in helping children address and combat racism through ensuring that their curriculum is not only multicultural but that their classrooms create a space where people from all backgrounds feel safe when race-salient topics arise, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. or slavery discussions. Additionally, many of the interviewees I spoke with noted that the school did nothing to stop the racism that was occurring. Educational professionals at all levels need to take a proactive role in talking about racism and discrimination before it occurs and openly addressing it when it occurs, no matter how subtle it may be. Finally, recalling Jennifer’s story of how her career counselor questioned her ability to perform on college entrance exams and insinuating that the only reason she was accepted to college was because she was Black, professionals at all levels of the education system should strive to become more culturally competent individuals who do not perpetuate the racism that students receive from peers or the larger society.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with all research, there are a few limitations to note in this study. First, this study focused solely on the adult child’s perspective and did not inquire about the parents’ perspective. This study focused on the adult child’s perspective because the parents’ perspective is often overemphasized in the literature. The goal of this study was to center the voices and experiences of those who were raised in such circumstances and to illuminate the impact of racial socialization strategies long term, from the perspective of those who must use these skills in their daily life. A second limitation is that all the participants in this study were highly educated (bachelors degree or higher) and many came from middle- and upper-income families, which influences the neighborhoods where they grew up and the schools they attended. This middle- to high-income sample may have been due to the nature of the organizations from which I recruited, in that many multiracial and transracial adoptee organizations tend to attract more highly educated individuals because they are based on college campuses or are professionally linked. Finally, all the individuals who volunteered to participate in this study were women, and while many of them who had male siblings discussed how their brothers’ experiences were similar or different from their own, there was not enough data to draw conclusions about differences based on gender at this time. As this is an ongoing study, future efforts at recruitment will include more outreach to those who come from different socioeconomic and educational levels as well as male participants.</p>
