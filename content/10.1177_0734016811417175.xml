<p>In her book, <italic>Animal Programs in Prison: A Comprehensive Assessment</italic>, Gennifer Furst explains the varied types of animal programs that exist in prison settings, their frequency, and the theories and qualitative evidence which suggest that prison-based animal programs (PAPs) positively impact several populations. Furst argues that PAPs serve to increase the self-esteem and rehabilitation of inmates, improve the humane treatment and training of the animals in the programs, and positively serve the larger community in the free world. A major part of the author’s philosophical argument to support PAPs lies in the concept of human–animal relationship building, and the development of dependency and trust between the inmate trainers and handlers, and the animals in their care.</p>
<p>The overarching research question is found in the first sentence of the introduction: What happens when human and nonhuman animals interact? (p. 1). Little scientific data exist in the subject area of PAPs. The study depends largely upon three sources for supporting documentation: First, information borrowed from the theory of disciplines other than criminal justice and from studies accomplished in other settings; and second, from a national survey of correctional programs taken by the author. Finally, the author presents in-depth case studies of PAPs practiced in two prison settings, one for men and another for women. Since correctional programs tend not to collect data with research in mind, most of the data and argument presented in support of PAPs from the sources above is allegorical in nature.</p>
<p>Furst does provide an innovative argument for how human–animal interactions serve to rehabilitate the inmates in PAPs. Her argument certainly has face validity; and many who read this book will want to embrace the efficacy of PAPs for rehabilitating both inmate trainers and their animal charges. However, there appears to exist little evidence of how, and to what degrees, inmates have been rehabilitated through their prison work with animals. Conversely, the animals (such as rescue dogs and wild horses gentled for adoption) and animal programs themselves are well received by the larger community outside the correctional settings.</p>
<p>Gennifer Furst makes it abundantly clear that she is strongly opposed to the killing of animals for meat to be eaten in prison settings. Philosophically, she also objects the historic use of animals as beasts of burden in farming prisons. These animals were abused along with the inmates, who in <italic>Ruffin v. Commonwealth</italic> (1871) were said to be slaves of the state, possessing no constitutional rights. While some readers may question the author’s bias in this regard, the outcome indeed is fortunate: Furst so carefully and narrowly defines PAPs, that future research will be greatly aided by this unambiguous definition of PAPs. Strong, precise, measurable definitions provide the foundations for all meaningful scientific endeavor.</p>
<p>PAPs are a prison variation on animal-assisted therapy (AAT). Most AAT has been conducted in settings other than prison. The psychosocial benefits (for human participants) of AAT have been categorized into four types: Benefits (a) relating to loneliness and depression, (b) those relating to attention and calming, (c) those which socialize, and (d) those which motivate. PAPs differ from AAT programs in several ways: In PAPs, the animals are not present specifically for the benefit of the program participants—in this case the inmates; prison programs do not have a counseling or clinical element; and finally, inmate participants train or work with the animals, in addition to interacting with the animals as in AAT programs.</p>
<p>PAPs differ from other animal programs in prisons largely through the fact that they are founded upon altruistic activity. PAPs are usually considered volunteer activity, and are not provided by prisons as part of their rehabilitative services, thus those inmates who are involved are self-selected. The author suggests that when inmates are assigned to the initial training of service animals, or to rehabilitate and train rescued animals to help them become adoptable, positive good reaches many: The animals are helped, the community is served, those needing service dogs are served, and the inmates develop self-esteem and hope for the future. What this means is that inmates provide their own therapy through helping the animals and serving the community.</p>
<p>One of the best conditions attaching to PAPs is that they are so cost efficient. Within the fiscal year of 2010, almost one half of states have had their corrections budgets cut, and most of these states are attempting to cut costs through programming reductions. However, reductions in programming can increase other corrections costs through lower numbers of inmates earning early release, heightened community corrections costs, and greater recidivism rates. The author reasons that low-cost animal programs provide us best opportunity to prepare inmates for reentry into the community. In most community service programs, the animal rescue organizations involved will pay the costs of maintaining the animals, so this cost is not passed on to departments of corrections; in other cases, state or federal funding is available for the needs of the service animal socialization programs.</p>
<p>Gennifer Furst concludes that three questions may be answered by PAPs: First, what can benefit prison inmates both during and after their time spent incarcerated (p. 155)? Second, what can benefit society? And third, what can benefit animals? If all can possibly be answered by PAPs, then serious consideration must be given to expanding PAPs and to develop research projects which will give guidance into their increased establishment and improvement.</p>
<p>The book, <italic>Animal Programs in Prison: A Comprehensive Assessment</italic>, by Gennifer Furst, could serve as the major text book in a special topic in corrections undergraduate course. It also would be useful as a companion text in other corrections courses at either the undergraduate or graduate levels in one of two applications: (a) The book may serve as the basis for critical thinking response essays on the varied chapter themes or (b) the book might be assigned as the subject of book reviews to be discussed in class. It should prove of great value to encourage students and scholars to continue to develop the rehabilitative and altruistic themes of this volume.</p>
