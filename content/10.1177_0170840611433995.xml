<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The notion of ‘collective knowledge’ has become a building block of many knowledge-based studies on the organization. Explanatory accounts of numerous organizational phenomena and practices such as organizational memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433995">Rowlinson, Booth, Clark, Delahaye &amp; Procter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611433995">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>), organizational learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611433995">Dodgson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611433995">Easterby-Smith &amp; Lyles, 2003</xref>), knowledge management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611433995">Argote, McEvily &amp; Reagans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611433995">Spender &amp; Scherer, 2007</xref>), innovation management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433995">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611433995">Nonaka, Von Krogh &amp; Voelpel, 2006</xref>), organizational culture (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611433995">Schein, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0170840611433995">van den Steen, 2010</xref>), communities of practice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611433995">Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611433995">Wenger, 1998</xref>), routines and capabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611433995">Becker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611433995">Dosi, Faillo &amp; Marengo, 2008</xref>)—among many others—draw on this notion in one way or another. Additionally, studies from ostensibly less related fields have increasingly become knowledge-based. Recently, the discussion of the architecture of firms and industries has been linked to the discussion of knowledge integration, emphasizing the deep relationship between the division of labor and the division of knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611433995">Brusoni, Jacobides &amp; Prencipe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611433995">Brusoni, Prencipe &amp; Pavitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611433995">Granstrand, Patel &amp; Pavitt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611433995">Ravasi &amp; Gianmario, 2001</xref>). Accordingly, explanations of change and the evolution of firm and industry structure (as represented by outsourcing, offshoring, re-integration, modularization, the emergence of platforms, etc.) have been grounded in processes of collective knowledge exploration and exploitation. Perhaps even more fundamentally, knowledge-based views of the organization have declared fostering and exploitation of collective knowledge no less than the organization’s very essence and raison d’etre (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611433995">Kogut &amp; Zander, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611433995">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611433995">Spender, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611433995">Tsoukas, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the explanatory burden charged to the notion of collective knowledge, it is somewhat surprising how little clarity and shared understanding of the precise meaning of the term prevails. Many contributions relying on the concept of collective knowledge make do without providing any clear definition. They follow a ‘pragmatic’ approach and ‘accept or side-step the inherent problems of defining the concept, but go on and use it anyway … The logic seems to be as follows “we don’t know what knowledge is but it seems to solve problems in a functional way, so let’s use it anyway”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611433995">Alvesson &amp; Kärreman, 2001</xref>, p. 999). Where authors do not evade this exercise, they usually stipulate collective knowledge as a kind of umbrella term under which they accumulate quite a number of aspects and facets. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Collective knowledge refers to the ways in which knowledge is distributed and shared among members of the organization. It is the accumulated knowledge of the organization stored in its rules, procedures, routines and shared norms which guide the problem-solving activities and patterns of interaction among its members. Collective knowledge resembles the ‘memory’ or ‘collective mind’ of the organization … It can either be a ‘stock’ of knowledge stored as hard data; or represent knowledge in a state of ‘flow’ emerging from interaction. Collective knowledge exists between rather than within individuals. It can be more, or less, than the sum of the individuals’ knowledge, depending on the mechanisms that translate individual into collective knowledge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611433995">Lam, 2000</xref>, p. 491)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although such cumulative descriptions gather many important ideas relevant to the concept of collective knowledge, they are problematic for at least two reasons. First, they are quite broad and all-encompassing, and by covering too many diverse phenomena they are either tension-ridden and hardly usable in a coherent way or they tend to be trivial and empty. ‘The irony, or the problem in these cases, is that if knowledge means that much, the usage of the word informs us less and less’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611433995">Alvesson &amp; Kärreman, 2001</xref>, p. 999; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840611433995">Schreyögg &amp; Geiger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611433995">Tsoukas &amp; Vladimirou, 2001</xref>). Second, by just collecting a number of facets and features of collective knowledge without specifying their precise relationships, such attempts remain vague and leave essential questions open: Is collective knowledge shared or distributed among the members of a collective? In which way? What exactly is the relationship of collective memory and mind, organizational rules, procedure, routines, etc. to collective knowledge? What essentially is the interrelationship of collective knowledge, individual knowledge, and the individual knowledge holder?</p>
<p>This latter question in particular seems to be in need of some further analytical clarification to advance our understanding of many of the organizational phenomena and practices mentioned at the outset. As according to numerous authors it is ultimately individuals who create, possess and use knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611433995">Foss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433995">Grant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433995">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611433995">Polanyi, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611433995">Simon, 1991</xref>), it is not quite clear what it means for knowledge to be collective (or organizational). Several proponents of notions of collective knowledge content themselves with invoking analogies from the individual to the collective level. As individual knowledge manifests itself in individual skills, so does collective knowledge in organization-level capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611433995">Richardson, 1972</xref>), routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611433995">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>), higher-order organizing principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611433995">Kogut &amp; Zander, 1992</xref>) or similar supra-individual structures. The crucial problem with such analogies is that they lack a robust foundation and refrain from providing an explanatory link to the individual as a basic locus of knowledge and action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611433995">Abell, Felin &amp; Foss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611433995">Felin &amp; Foss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611433995">Felin &amp; Hesterly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611433995">Foss, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611433995">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611433995">Simon, 1991</xref>). ‘Thus, a “collectivist” approach obscures important micro-mechanisms. In the present context, what is obscured is the issue of how knowledge that ultimately resides on the level of the individuals is somehow integrated through organizational means into organization-level capability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611433995">Foss, 2007</xref>, p. 33).</p>
<p>Quite contrary to this individualistic perspective, other authors argue—by drawing for instance on the thought of Wittgenstein, on social constructionism, or on discourse theory—that knowledge is irreducibly embedded in a collective practice that underlies even individual knowledge and action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840611433995">Schreyögg &amp; Geiger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611433995">Spender, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611433995">Tsoukas &amp; Vladimirou, 2001</xref>). They therefore arrive at the conclusion ‘that all knowledge is, in a fundamental way, collective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611433995">Tsoukas &amp; Vladimirou, 2001</xref>, p. 973). Yet this stance is no less obscure about the distinction between individual and collective knowledge. If knowledge per se is collective, how then are we to make sense of the notion of individual knowledge as well as of the underlying distinction between individual and collective forms of knowledge, both of which are very much upheld by advocates of both lines of reasoning? Obviously,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>personal and common knowledge are mutually constituted, but this does not imply that they are the same: assuming that one individual, because her personal knowledge has been constructed from that of her social environment, holds in her knowledge all the knowledge of her society would assume potentially unlimited absorptive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840611433995">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>) and would dismiss the notion that common knowledge is distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611433995">Tsoukas, 1996</xref>). Conversely, assuming that an individual’s knowledge only consists of the knowledge of his social environment would lead to negate his identity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840611433995">Tywoniak, 2007</xref>, p. 63)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The upshot is that these considerations identify a gap in our understanding of the notion of collective knowledge and its relationship to individuals and the individual’s knowledge, one that threatens to affect our understanding of many knowledge-based organizational phenomena and practices, not to mention the explanatory power of knowledge-based theories of the organization in general. This paper aims toward closing this gap by investigating the question of what it can mean for knowledge to be collective (beyond the blunt claim that knowledge per se is collective). Its basic thrust in answering this question is that different types of collective knowledge must be distinguished that differ significantly in their conceptualization, locus, relationship to individual knowledge, origination and means of exploitation. As all of these types find sufficient support in theoretical considerations as well as in empirical evidence, it seems sensible to integrate them on an equal footing into a kind of pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge.</p>
<p>Pluralistic approaches to epistemology in organization studies have been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611433995">Spender (1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611433995">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611433995">1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611433995">Lam (2000)</xref>, among others. In contrast to most of the philosophical takes on these issues, which largely follow a reductionist (or essentialist) strategy by reducing all forms and variations of knowledge to a common core concept, a pluralistic epistemology strives to elaborate on the concept of knowledge rather by explicating substantial differences within this very concept and by engaging the resulting various types of knowledge within an integrated framework. Integrating the different types of collective knowledge within an overarching framework means not only to sort them into a kind of taxonomy on the basis of a set of common criteria, but to elaborate on their relationships and interaction processes within the collective or organization.</p>
<p>To this end, this paper moves on to draw on transactive memory system (TMS) theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611433995">Argote et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840611433995">Ren, Carley &amp; Argote, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611433995">Wegner, 1986</xref>) as a theoretical framework and conceptual starting point for analyzing the interdependencies among the identified types of collective knowledge. TMS theory is a well-established social psychological theory dealing with how collectives organize the storage, retrieval and use of knowledge. Focusing on knowledge-related behavior and cognitive processes within groups (from the small-scale working group to the large and complex organization), TMS theory helps to ground and anchor the epistemological perspective taken in this paper to the context of the organization. Applying and refining its instruments with respect to collective knowledge thus facilitates the identification of important interaction processes and effects between the types of such knowledge distinguished here.</p>
<p>Finally, I outline some implications of the epistemological framework for our understanding of two of the issues mentioned at the outset. By analyzing the architecture of firms and industries as well as higher-order knowledge-related constructs (such as routines and capabilities) through the lens of the proposed epistemology, I not only foreshadow its application to important topics of organizational study and management but at the same time point to promising avenues of further development.</p>

<title>What is Collective Knowledge? Three Conceptualizations</title>
<p>The approach taken in this section is to draw on relevant literature as well as on casual evidence to distill three types of collective knowledge, distinguished by their conceptualization and a number of further criteria. These types reflect different meanings ascribed to the term ‘collective knowledge’ by different authors and in different contexts. In a second step it is argued that these distinct types do not compete in answering the question of what it means for knowledge to be collective, but rather complement each other in explicating the notion. They should therefore be communally integrated into a pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge.</p>
<sec id="section3-0170840611433995">
<title>Collective knowledge as shared knowledge</title>
<p>A common view of collective knowledge simply boils down to taking collective knowledge as knowledge shared by a group of individuals. It is thus constituted by the intersection of individual knowledge sets, where the intersection can comprise a smaller or larger part of these knowledge sets and may include all conceivable types of knowledge (i.e., tacit or explicit, etc.). Collective knowledge according to this conceptualization usually originates from two sources, common experiences and knowledge-sharing activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611433995">Chatman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611433995">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611433995">Reagans, Argote &amp; Brooks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0170840611433995">Van den Steen, 2010</xref>). The former may be gained within or outside the collective (e.g., a common cultural background or common work experience). Knowledge-sharing activities, on the other hand, usually take place at different levels within the collective, where one can roughly distinguish formal sharing activities (e.g., corporate education and training, staff communication) from informal sharing activities within the web of social relations at work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433995">Davenport &amp; Prusak, 1998</xref>) or ‘communities of practice’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611433995">Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611433995">Wenger, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Such an understanding informs, for instance, the concept of collective knowledge proffered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611433995">Collins (2007)</xref>. To take up one of his examples, while bike-riding of itself requires only individual knowledge (e.g., knowledge of how to balance the bike),</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>negotiating traffic is a problem that is different in kind to balancing a bike, because it includes understanding social conventions of traffic management. For example, it involves knowing how to make eye contact with drivers at busy junctions in just the way necessary to assure a safe passage and not to invite an unwanted response. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611433995">Collins, 2007</xref>, p. 259, emphasis omitted)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is precisely in such shared knowledge of social rules and conventions that Collins locates the essence of collective (tacit) knowledge. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611433995">Tsoukas and Vladimirou (2001)</xref> argue that knowledge becomes collective (or, as they put it, organizational) when it draws on a shared set of categories and distinctions that is abstracted from concrete situations yet specific to the organizational context.</p>
<p>As the previous examples elucidate, collective knowledge in terms of shared knowledge plays an important role in enabling a group of individuals to coordinate their activities without centralized decision-making or explicit mutual communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611433995">Hecker, 2011</xref>). Be it the result of a common history of shared experiences or deliberate sharing processes, such a stock of knowledge produces stable patterns of behavior that allow the prediction of other individuals’ actions and the adaptation of one’s own activities accordingly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611433995">Camerer &amp; Knez, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611433995">Nooteboom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611433995">Schein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840611433995">Weber &amp; Camerer, 2003</xref>). In an even broader sense, the concept of culture per se could be interpreted as a shared stock of background knowledge enabling people in a society (or employees in a firm) to mesh together in appropriate ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611433995">Crémer, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433995">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611433995">Hecker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611433995">Hermalin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611433995">Kreps, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611433995">Schein, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>A case in point is provided by the much-trumpeted service culture encountered in various firms. They furnish employees with the common understanding that client-related tasks have priority over all other activities. This shared knowledge ensures coordination, particularly when complementary actions are required to actually complete the task. Crémer cites an example from AT&amp;T. In the case of a reported malfunction, a service worker could interrupt her work stream (or work overtime) to troubleshoot the new problem. To succeed, however, her effort would usually require the support of coworkers, who themselves faced a similar choice. At AT&amp;T this typical coordination problem was solved by means of shared knowledge making up its service culture:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The famous ‘Ma Bell’ [i.e. AT&amp;T] culture stressed the fact that service was paramount. In case of breakdown an employee could commit his own effort to reestablish a portion of the line, in full knowledge that work on the rest of the connections was not interrupted because overtime was too costly or the weekend was approaching. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433995">Crémer, 1993</xref>, p. 366)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A further, ubiquitous example is communication. Here, coordination in the sense of mutual understanding is brought about by a shared stock of knowledge, where the latter takes the form of a common language. In this sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611433995">Weick (1979)</xref> has argued that a locally shared language acts as an organizational memory, i.e., a collective form of knowledge.</p>
<p>By the same token, but with different effect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433995">Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995)</xref> consider collective knowledge as shared knowledge. As the result of knowledge conversion from the personal and tacit to the collective and explicit level, such externalization and sharing, they argue, is the central prerequisite for knowledge recombination, which again represents the mainspring of knowledge creation and innovation. But how exactly does this knowledge creation by knowledge sharing and recombination work? Precisely this question leads to an alternative interpretation of what it can reasonably mean for knowledge to be collective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0170840611433995">
<title>Collective knowledge as complementary knowledge</title>
<p>Contrary to the preceding conceptualization, this alternative interpretation understands collective knowledge as knowledge distributed among individuals interacting in a complementary way. Individuals therefore hold specialized knowledge (at the extreme, without overlap), but in coordinated social practice these disjunctive knowledge sets complement each other in such a way that they ‘add up’ to more than their sum. A collective group therefore ‘knows’ more than its individuals independently summed together and this ‘surplus’—which cannot be traced back to any single individual—forms its collective knowledge. To give a stylized example of such arithmetic, consider two individuals where one individual knows {A} and her colleague has knowledge of the general principle {A ⇒ B}. Hence, while the individual knowledge sets ‘add up’ to {A, A ⇒ B}, the collective has knowledge of {A, A ⇒ B, B}.</p>
<p>A more concrete case in point is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611433995">Wegner (1986)</xref> when he analyzes a team as a distributed memory system (later I provide a more detailed account of his transactive memory approach). He discusses the case of two aircraft mechanics assessing a plane’s safety, where one had knowledge about an unexplained bit of oil on the runway and the other remembered a hydraulic indicator light not functioning. Integrating both pieces of knowledge yielded new insights about the plane’s maintenance condition not held by any one of the mechanics before but nonetheless implicated by the team’s distributed knowledge base. Knowledge complementarity thus proves to be the mechanism underlying the generation of new knowledge by integration of specialized individual knowledge sets and it has been studied, for instance, in the interaction and exchange of members in product development teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611433995">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611433995">D’Adderio, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433995">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611433995">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611433995">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611433995">Carlile &amp; Rebentisch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840611433995">Von Hippel, 1994</xref>) or the cooperation within interdisciplinary staffed project teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Usually the exploitation of knowledge complementarity does not presuppose the complete exchange and integration of the distributed knowledge such that it comes to be held by a single individual. Such integration would not only theoretically blur the distinction from individual knowledge or collective knowledge as shared knowledge, but <italic>in praxis</italic> is commonly prohibited by restrictions on individual rationality, memory, communication capacity, etc., or simply by considerations of economic efficiency as it would undermine any kind of cognitive specialization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611433995">Demsetz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611433995">Hayek, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433995">Simon, 1976</xref>). Rather, knowledge complementarities unfold of their own in the course of coordinated collaboration of specialist individuals. Such collaboration can take the form of ‘heedful interrelations of actions in a social system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840611433995">Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993</xref>, p. 357) or of classic team production, where individual knowledge-based inputs of the team production function interrelate in a superadditive way such that the team output is more than the sum of individual contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611433995">Alchian &amp; Demsetz, 1972</xref>). Alternatively, it relies on the division of knowledge and labor coordinated by direction as a highly condensed and extracted form of knowledge transfer. An important point made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611433995">Demsetz (1988)</xref> and further elaborated by, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840611433995">Casson (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433995">Conner and Prahalad (1996)</xref> holds that direction is indeed a highly efficient way of exploiting knowledge complementarities as it allows the integration of decentralized knowledge sets without sacrificing gains from specialization by completely exchanging the relevant knowledge. These authors actually consider this point to be a central raison d’etre of organizations to begin with. Explicit coordination by direction is obviously quite different from implicit forms considered in the context of collective knowledge as shared knowledge (see previous section). Nevertheless, giving and receiving directions crucially relies on a shared basis of background knowledge (e.g., a common code). This already hints at (meta-)complementarities between the different types of collective knowledge (which are discussed in more detail later).</p>
<p>In an even broader sense, knowledge complementarity works as a principle underlying the emergence of collective characteristics or capabilities unlike those of constituent individuals. It therefore opens the door to systemic phenomena such as ‘collective minds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840611433995">Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993</xref>) and ‘system level knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611433995">Spender, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611433995">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611433995">1998</xref>). Clearly, these phenomena are not autonomous, existing independently of the individual members of the organization. They are nevertheless essentially emergent in the sense that they are not contained in or directly traceable to the system’s individual components, i.e., to the knowledge residing in individuals and artifacts. On precisely that score, collective knowledge as complementary knowledge differs from its individual counterpart.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0170840611433995">
<title>Collective knowledge as knowledge embedded in collective artifacts</title>
<p>A third and perhaps more profane view takes collective knowledge as knowledge incorporated in organizational artifacts rather than individual mindsets or actions. According to this view, collective knowledge resides in collectively owned, tangible representations such as documents and databases, but it is also more implicitly embedded in artifacts such as, for instance, manufacturing technology, prototypes, products, as well as formalized operating rules and organizing principles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611433995">Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611433995">Cohen &amp; Bacdayan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611433995">Demsetz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611433995">Hackbarth &amp; Grover, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611433995">Kogut &amp; Zander, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611433995">Nevo &amp; Wand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611433995">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>). Such knowledge is non-individual in that it is externalized from individual knowledge sets and therefore independent of individual memory and skills. It has an important function in economizing on individual cognitive capacity by substituting external for individual memory while at the same time facilitating knowledge sharing and communication.</p>
<p>Externalization is, however, not in and of itself a sufficient condition for constituting and maintaining this type of collective knowledge. Artifactual knowledge is in an essential sense not self-contained and detached from the collective as it requires complex processes of collective sense-making to reinterpret, re-contextualize and re-appropriate its content and meaning. While knowledge-embedding artifacts have for a long time been thought of as a kind of bin where knowledge stored by one individual can be unambiguously retrieved by any other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611433995">Hackbarth &amp; Grover, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611433995">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>), numerous in-depth studies have shown the use of such artifacts—in particular across the boundaries of departments, communities of practices or occupations—to require social practices of negotiation and transformation to create a collective understanding and to bridge local and situated epistemic contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611433995">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611433995">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611433995">2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori (2008)</xref>, for instance, found that a knowledge-bearing artifact as simple as an Excel workbook played an important role in a project-based organization for preserving and recycling knowledge across projects, but at the same time required and structured intense processes of communication and collaboration between its users to effectively access and appropriate the stored knowledge. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611433995">D’Adderio (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433995">2003)</xref> showed that the use of software-based artifacts (such as CAD sketches, digital product models, or virtual prototypes) to store and exchange knowledge during the product development process crucially depended on the ongoing translation and conversion between local (e.g., functional or occupational) languages, assumptions, viewpoints, practices, cultures and requirements and a global (i.e., more decontextualized) form of knowledge-incorporated in artifacts. Certainly, in these case studies knowledge-embedding artifacts worked not only as memory devices but also as boundary objects mediating the interaction across departments, professional groups, communities of practice of an organization and even across organizations. But as Wittgenstein argued in his famous <italic>Philosophical Investigations</italic>, even the exclusive use of a knowledge artifact by just a single individual (such as a private diary) for the mere purpose of storing knowledge crucially depends on social practice to continuously reconstitute sense and reapply meaning to the knowledge stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0170840611433995">Wittgenstein, 1953</xref>). Knowledge embedded in artifacts is thus constituted and maintained by ongoing processes of collective action and interaction and accordingly represents a further type of collective knowledge in its own right.</p>

<title>Towards a pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge</title>
<p>So far I have analytically distinguished three types of collective knowledge and elaborated on their nature. These types differ significantly in their conceptualization, locus, relationship to individual knowledge, origination and means of exploitation as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611433995">Table 1</xref>. As these types are not reducible to each other, do not exclude or compete with each other and at the same time find sufficient support in theoretical considerations as well as in empirical evidence, it seems sensible to integrate them on an equal footing into a kind of pluralistic epistemology. A pluralistic epistemology strives to elaborate on the concept of collective knowledge by explicating substantial differences residing within the very concept. As such, these differences are represented by and condensed into the varying types of collective knowledge, i.e., shared knowledge, complementary knowledge and knowledge embedded in collective artifacts. Together they provide a non-reductive explication of the notion of collective knowledge.</p>

<p>To integrate these distinguished knowledge types into an overarching epistemology, however, it is not sufficient to merely analyze their nature in isolation. Rather, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611433995">Spender (1998</xref>, p. 237) points out, ‘it is necessary not only to assert and justify the existence of different types of human knowledge … but also to show the relationship and interactions between the knowledge types’. Integrating these various types of collective knowledge therefore means elaborating their interdependencies by analyzing their interplay within the collective or organization. This will be done next, using TMS theory as a frame of reference.</p>

<title>Collective Knowledge within the Organization</title>
<sec id="section8-0170840611433995">
<title>The organization as a transactive memory system</title>
<p>Transactive memory system (TMS) theory analyzes how collectives organize the storage, retrieval and use of knowledge from a social psychological stance. It therefore investigates the knowledge-related behavior and cognitive processes of and within groups (but of course not the nature of knowledge itself, the subject of this attempt). To analyze relationships and interactions among different types of collective knowledge, TMS theory provides an apt conceptual point of departure for at least three reasons. First, its focus on knowledge-related behavior and cognitive processes complements the epistemological perspective taken so far and helps to ground it in the context of the organization. Second, it has developed a theoretically sound and elaborated frame of reference to analyze how knowledge is stored and applied within a collective. Third, its basic assumptions and results have received broad empirical support in laboratory experiments as well as in field studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611433995">Austin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611433995">Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611433995">Lewis, Lange &amp; Gillis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611433995">Moreland &amp; Argote, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>According to this theory, a working group or organization can be understood as a TMS for encoding, storing, retrieving, applying and communicating knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611433995">Argote et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840611433995">Ren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611433995">Wegner, 1986</xref>). In contrast to a disconnected collection of individuals, such a system exhibits a high degree of organization in terms of the division of knowledge and cognitive labor as well as of the coordination of knowledge-related activities. To overcome individual boundaries in rationality, members of a group or organization specialize in processing and storing knowledge. While they process and store some knowledge internally, they rely heavily on artifacts (such as books, reports, computer systems, etc.) as well as on their colleagues as external memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611433995">Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611433995">Wegner, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Collective performance depends on coordinating the distributed knowledge and activities of the collective’s members. This is facilitated in the TMS by a kind of meta-memory about the knowledge or skills available in the collective and about the locations (i.e., people or knowledge-embedding artifacts) where particular knowledge is stored (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611433995">Nevo &amp; Wand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611433995">Wegner, 1986</xref>). By knowing who knows what and who attends to which knowledge domain, organization members can, in a targeted way, pass new knowledge to the apt expert or, vice versa, tap extant knowledge resources. Knowledge is thus encoded, stored and retrieved from the collective memory system through communication and various transactions between and among individuals, guided by their meta-memories. The assignment of tasks and responsibilities is likewise informed by these meta-memories and follows the differentiated expertise structures of the team or organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433995">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings of both field and laboratory research show that the TMS facilitates group performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611433995">Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611433995">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611433995">Moreland &amp; Argote, 2003</xref>). By enhancing individual memory capacity and reducing cognitive loads, the TMS helps to overcome individual bounds of rationality and to reap economies from specialization. A TMS therefore enables a group or organization to better utilize extant knowledge and more efficiently learn or generate new knowledge and thus to reach higher levels of performance than a loose collection of individuals not embedded in such a system. It therefore can be seen as an essential part of any organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0170840611433995">
<title>Collective knowledge within the transactive memory system</title>
<p>Analyzing a TMS through the lens of the afore-developed typology of collective knowledge reveals that all of its three types constitute building blocks of any transactive memory system, as follows.</p>
<p>Complementary knowledge and cognitive interdependence are at the heart of the TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433995">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611433995">Hollingshead, 2001</xref>). Enabling the division of complementary knowledge within a collective without sacrificing the exploitation of its complementarities is the primary reason a TMS comes about. The decisions and actions of one member of the TMS are therefore not only informed by her own knowledge, but also by the knowledge of other members. The content and quality of the others’ knowledge consequently has a significant impact on the meaning and impact of her own knowledge. Such knowledge complementarity regularly co-occurs with task complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433995">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611433995">Hollingshead, 2001</xref>). Specialization and the division of cognitive labor usually entail interdependencies (sequential, reciprocal or pooled) between tasks assigned to different members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611433995">Thompson, 1967</xref>), which again imply complementarities among the knowledge sets requisite to task execution. Beyond such super-additivity in the application of extant knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611433995">Alchian &amp; Demsetz, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611433995">Milgrom &amp; Roberts, 1990</xref>), knowledge complementarities play an important role in creating completely new knowledge. In fact it is the discovery and exploitation of so-far hidden complementarities and links among different knowledge particulars that yields new insights via their integration into more complex concepts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611433995">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611433995">Nonaka et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Shared knowledge in terms of a shared conceptualization of ‘who knows what’ and ‘where to look for what specific knowledge’, as well as a common frame of reference to facilitate collective sense-making and understanding, is important for the integration of dispersed knowledge. An essential component of this shared knowledge is a common mental model of the TMS itself (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433995">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611433995">Hollingshead, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611433995">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1999</xref>). Such mental models include not only meta-memories about the distribution and content of knowledge within the TMS but also a shared understanding of how particular bodies of knowledge relate to specific tasks and interrelate with each other. Although the degree of overlap and sharedness between individual representations of the TMS may vary, ‘the strength of transactive memory evolves from the development of shared mental models’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433995">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>, p. 638). Such shared mental models inform the coordinated storage, retrieval and application of knowledge. They furthermore prevent organizational forgetting and neglect, as well as the redundant duplication of knowledge resources, by helping to pass new information and knowledge particulars to precisely those TMS members presiding over the respective knowledge domain (or, vice versa, to retrieve required knowledge from them). Furthermore, shared mental models guide the efficient allocation of tasks to individuals possessing the adequate knowledge for their execution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611433995">Reagans et al., 2005</xref>). They also enable the informed coordination of interactions among TMS members to systematically exploit links and complementarities among their distinct knowledge sets. Finally, together with the whole background of shared experiences and common understandings, they help to bridge local and situated epistemic contexts, and they therefore lay the foundations for any form of knowledge sharing and exchange.</p>
<p>Knowledge-embedding artifacts such as documents and databases have been recognized by the TMS literature as external memory resources, supplementing the memory capacity provided by the organization’s members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611433995">Faraj &amp; Sproull, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611433995">Wegner, 1986</xref>). This understanding resonates well with the traditional view on such artifacts, which understands them as a kind of bin where knowledge stored at one time can be unambiguously retrieved later on. On the basis of the previous discussion of collective knowledge as knowledge embedded in collective artifacts, however, we can advance this understanding and derive two further important purposes that knowledge-embedding artifacts serve in the TMS. First, taken as boundary-spanning objects, they facilitate the social mediation of complementary bodies of knowledge distributed among the members of the TMS. They provide vehicles for the transfer, translation and transformation of knowledge across boundaries of departments, communities of practice or occupations and therefore serve as ‘points of connection within a widely distributed memory system, spanning the project, the individuals taking part in them, the organization and the professional communities involved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>, p. 1592). Furthermore, knowledge-embedding artifacts such as manuals, internal directories, employee newsletters, blackboards, intranet applications, etc. facilitate formal and informal knowledge sharing among the members of the TMS. In this respect, they are instrumental in the synchronization of meta-memories within the TMS.</p>

<title>Interdependencies between collective knowledge types</title>
<p>This rough survey of collective knowledge within the TMS reveals that in efficiently working teams and organizations the various types of collective knowledge go hand in hand. Such fact only underpins the relevance of a pluralistic epistemological approach to collective knowledge, embracing different types simultaneously instead of treating them as mutually exclusive theoretical positions. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of an integrative epistemological approach, as a closer look makes clear that these types of collective knowledge not only co-occur in organizations, but they also exhibit significant interaction effects and processes. These are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840611433995">Figure 1</xref> and discussed in greater detail below.</p>

</fig>
<p><italic>Integration</italic> describes the interaction effect and interactive process between complementary knowledge and shared knowledge. Basically, cognitive specialization and the distribution of complementary task knowledge within the collective must be supplemented by shared knowledge at the meta-level (e.g., in terms of a shared mental model of the TMS, a shared frame of reference, etc.), as shared knowledge forms the basis for the heedful coordination of interactions between specialized TMS members. It is thus prerequisite to integrating distributed cognitions and actions into collective cognition and action. The degree of this integration depends on the ‘quality’ of shared knowledge at the meta-level, which can be described along various dimensions and measured according to different criteria (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433995">Brandon &amp; Hollingshead, 2004</xref>). Here, the precision, accuracy and convergence of such shared knowledge are of particular relevance. <italic>Precision</italic> refers to the richness and detailedness of the shared representation (or mental model) held by members of the organization. The more precise the shared knowledge at the meta-level, the better individuals understand to whom to refer or where to look for specific knowledge, not to mention how to relate particular bodies of knowledge to specific tasks or other knowledge sets toward optimally exploiting knowledge complementarities. <italic>Accuracy</italic> describes the congruence between the shared representation of the TMS and the TMS itself, and thus the validity and reliability of the knowledge shared. The most precise mental model of the TMS is worthless without sufficient accuracy. Accuracy can become particularly problematic in dynamic contexts when the updating of meta-memories cannot keep pace with TMS changes. <italic>Convergence</italic>, finally, refers to the degree of overlap and consistency among individual representations of the TMS. Although shared knowledge by definition constitutes an overlap in individual knowledge sets, this overlap can differ between different members within the organization. Perfect convergence of shared knowledge within the organization therefore requires the conformity of knowledge shared by each possible subset of its members, and it thus remains a theoretical ideal. In summary, integration means the coordinated use and exploitation of complementary knowledge distributed across the work team, the organization and even a TMS spanning organizations (e.g., firm networks), informed by shared knowledge. The more precise, accurate and convergent collective knowledge as shared knowledge about its TMS becomes, the more efficient use the organization will make of its collective knowledge as complementary knowledge.</p>
<p><italic>Mediation</italic> describes the interaction effect and interactive process between complementary knowledge and knowledge embedded in artifacts. Although even small-scale and collocated work groups use knowledge-embedding artifacts to structure knowledge exchange and collaboration (such as navigation charts and records on the navigation deck of ocean-going vessels, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840611433995">Hutchins, 1995</xref>), large and decentralized organizations in particular depend on artifacts to channel knowledge flows and coordinate social interaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611433995">D’Adderio, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433995">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>). Construction plans, models, prototypes or intermediate products, for instance, act as boundary objects mediating between local and situated contexts, languages, assumptions, viewpoints, practices and cultures across departments, professional groups, communities of practice and even between organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611433995">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611433995">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611433995">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611433995">D’Adderio, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433995">2003</xref>). More abstract artifacts, such as formalized operating rules and organizing principles, likewise incorporate a form of shared knowledge, which guides the action and coordinates interaction within a collective of specialized individuals, and they therefore facilitate the unfolding of knowledge complementarities. In upshot, mediation means the combination and consolidation of complementary knowledge distributed across individuals in time and space by the use of knowledge artifacts. The more complementary knowledge is dispersed amongst the members of an organization (i.e., the higher the degree of cognitive specialization and of functional, occupational, and locational differentiation), the higher is the dependency of the organization on transacting and mediating knowledge between and among individuals for collective cognition and action to unfold; and the more important, too, is the infrastructure underlying such transactions in terms of collective knowledge embedded in artifacts.</p>
<p><italic>Synchronization</italic> describes the interaction effect and interactive process between knowledge embedded in artifacts and shared knowledge. While the TMS literature emphasizes the importance of common work experience, direct observation, conversations, group discussions and group training for a shared understanding of the TMS to develop (e.g., Morland &amp; Argote, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840611433995">Liang, Moreland &amp; Argote, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611433995">Reagans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611433995">Rulke &amp; Rau, 2000</xref>), such avenues for the sharing of knowledge at the meta-level are confined to settings where a small number of individuals are co-present and involved in frequent face-to-face interaction. The larger and more geographically dispersed the organization, the less its members can rely on personal interaction for the exchange of knowledge. Here knowledge-embedding artifacts (e.g., in the form of organizational charts, internal directories, intranet resources, groupware solutions, bulletins, newsletters, etc.) step in to synchronize meta-memories so as to extend, validate and align shared representations of the TMS as well as a shared frame of reference (i.e., shared categories, concepts and language). Synchronization therefore describes the process of building a base of shared knowledge and aligning cognition and behavior by use of knowledge artifacts. Accordingly, with an increasing size and complexity of the organization, the precision, accuracy and convergence of its shared knowledge increasingly depends on the effective design of its knowledge-embedding artifacts.</p>

<title>Implications for Organizational Study and Management</title>
<p>To place the somewhat abstract discussion of collective knowledge above into context, I will now return to two issues raised at the start. By threshing out implications of the proposed framework for explaining the architecture of firms and industries, as well as for the understanding of higher-order knowledge-related constructs (such as routines and capabilities), I foreshadow the epistemology’s use in analyzing important topics of organizational study and management. At the same time, these preliminary considerations suggest promising avenues of further development and application.</p>
<sec id="section12-0170840611433995">
<title>Knowledge integration and the architecture of firms and industries</title>
<p>Current changes in the architecture of firms and entire industries represent an important topic central to much debate in organization study and management (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611433995">Brusoni et al., 2009</xref> for a current survey). As both firms and industries converge and transform, disintegrate and reintegrate, the search for the driving forces and underlying determinants has gained particular relevance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611433995">Hobday, Davies &amp; Prencipe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611433995">Jacobides, Knudsen &amp; Augier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611433995">Jacobides &amp; Winter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611433995">Pisano &amp; Teece, 2007</xref>). Recently, the discussion of organizational architecture has been linked to the discussion of knowledge integration, emphasizing the deep relationship between the division of labor and the division of knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611433995">Brusoni et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611433995">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611433995">Granstrand et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611433995">Ravasi &amp; Gianmario, 2001</xref>). Empirical studies have shown that specific organizational settings and contexts such as vertically integrated firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840611433995">Kogut &amp; Zander, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611433995">Macher, 2006</xref>) or collocated product teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611433995">Van den Bulte &amp; Moenart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840611433995">Von Hippel, 1994</xref>) foster the effective use and integration of dispersed knowledge as reflected, for instance, by superior innovation performance. The need for knowledge integration thus represents an important determinant in efficient organizational design. Our understanding of the micro-mechanisms underlying this relationship between knowledge integration and organizational architecture, however, is still in its infancy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611433995">Brusoni et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The epistemological framework developed in this paper may provide a theoretical building block elucidating important organizational mechanisms that facilitate and shape knowledge integration. In particular, unpacking different types of collective knowledge along with the different interactive processes between them allows a fine-grained analysis of how these types and processes are influenced by organizational context. Such analysis, again, facilitates an assessment of various contexts’ relative performance in knowledge integration. The discussion in section 3 has already suggested, for instance, that a collocated work team provides a particularly conducive context for the integration, mediation and synchronization of collective knowledge as compared to geographically dispersed employees. These processes therefore help to explain an integrated product team’s superior performance in the exploitation of complementary knowledge.</p>
<p>Similarly, comparing collaboration among individuals within a firm to collaboration across firm boundaries reveals that firms usually provide a more favorable context for nurturing and exploiting the different types of collective knowledge than do arms-length cooperations through markets. In particular, organizations provide a more tightly coupled social system of heedful interrelations and have access to more capable knowledge-embedding artifacts to foster the integration and mediation of complementary knowledge. By referring to a common corporate culture and a common history of work experience, and by providing a multitude of possibilities for formal and informal knowledge exchange, they furthermore facilitate the synchronization of shared knowledge. The employees’ shared representation of the TMS constituted by their own company should accordingly be far more precise, accurate and convergent than that of the TMS made, for instance, by the boundary-spanning network of the employees’ firm and its suppliers (even if it will not reach the precision, accuracy and convergence of the shared representation of the TMS constituted by their work team or department). As a result, employees have a far better understanding of the content, distribution and interrelation of different bodies of complementary knowledge within their company which, again, benefits the integration of these knowledge bases. The greater the complementarity between specific bodies of knowledge and the more relevant such complementarities are for the application and further development of these bodies, the more important such comparative efficiency differences in knowledge integration become, and the stronger is their effect in shaping the efficient division of knowledge and labor within and across firms.</p>
<p>Not only does the epistemological framework make static patterns of firm and industry architecture susceptible to further analysis, but it may also prove helpful in explaining some of the dynamics we can observe. For instance, in recent developments in information technology we have seen a dramatic increase in the capacity and capability of knowledge-embedding artifacts such as electronic data exchange platforms, groupware solutions, data warehouses, expert systems, etc. These developments have significantly increased possibilities for the mediation and integration of complementary knowledge and for the synchronization of shared knowledge across spatial distance as well as across firm boundaries. Technological advance has thus somewhat leveled out the comparative advantage of integrated forms of organization as context for the exploration and exploitation of collective knowledge and facilitated disintegration. This line of reasoning accordingly provides an explanatory link between the contemporaneous developments of the increasing adoption of modern information technology and the strong trend towards outsourcing and offshoring witnessed in several industries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611433995">Baumol, Blinder &amp; Wolff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611433995">Willcocks &amp; Lacity, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In other cases, such as the British building industry, external developments including shifts in customer demand (i.e., increasing preferences for ‘one-stop-shop’ solutions, encompassing conception, design, financing, construction, maintenance, and facility management) as well as changes in the regulatory environment (e.g., the emergence of the Private Finance Initiative or PFI as a highly integrated form of procuring public buildings) have led to significantly increased complementarities in the bodies of knowledge involved:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Unlike traditional, sequential procurement, PFI projects provide strong incentives to reduce costs or improve quality by exploiting synergies between design, construction and maintenance, typically by designing buildings that can be built and maintained more easily. Identifying and exploiting the opportunities for cost reductions or quality improvements requires collaboration between designers, cost consultants, contractors and facilities managers. However, in traditional procurement, these actors worked sequentially and with very little interaction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>, p. 1595)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to the epistemology presented above, integrating such complementary bodies of (architectural, technical, financial, fiscal, legal, etc.) knowledge crucially depends on the knowledge shared by all collaborators involved, as represented by a common understanding of how these bodies of knowledge relate to specific tasks (e.g., designing a floor plan, calculating costs, preparing a bid, drawing up a contract) and to each other (e.g., synergies between design, construction and maintenance), not to mention a common frame of reference (e.g., a common nomenclature) for knowledge exchange and combination. This basis of shared knowledge requires the synchronization of individual mental models, which is facilitated by the regular circulation of knowledge objects such as sketches, drawings, manuals, guidelines and checklists. Some knowledge objects play an important role at the same time in mediating complementary knowledge, especially by providing boundary objects bridging different epistemic contexts of varying professions and departments and by accommodating and consolidating different perspectives and knowledge structures (as exemplified by the Excel workbook used for cost calculation across the life cycle of a building, described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>, and expanded on below).</p>
<p>As these interactive processes of integration, synchronization and mediation are favored within the boundaries of a single firm, an exogenously induced increase in the complementarity of supporting bodies of knowledge should have triggered processes of vertical integration. Exactly these processes were observed for the British building industry, leading to the emergence of all-in-one solution providers covering large chunks of the value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611433995">Cacciatori &amp; Jacobides, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840611433995">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clearly, these considerations are only preliminary and somewhat tentative, as their main objective is to give a flavor of the kind of analysis to illuminate micro-level processes of knowledge integration using the epistemological framework developed here. A more differentiated analysis would certainly have to consider a greater variety of contexts (such as communities of practice, firm networks, districts, etc.) as well as their specific impacts on the different types of collective knowledge and on the interaction processes among these types.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0170840611433995">
<title>Higher-order knowledge-related constructs</title>
<p>In reconsidering the claim by several authors that collective knowledge resides in constructs such as organizational capabilities, routines or competencies, described earlier, we find a further area of application for the framework suggested here. Although organizational capabilities, routines and competencies constitute commonly used concepts, they are still much in need of clear definition and differentiation. Most authors nevertheless converge to a definitional core, roughly stipulating them as a persistent capacity to execute a collective pattern of coordinated action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611433995">Becker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840611433995">Cohen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611433995">Dosi et. al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611433995">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on the epistemology outlined above, we are able to decompose the types of collective knowledge involved in such higher-order knowledge-related constructs and thus to shed light on some of their constituent mechanisms. To ground this analysis in a concrete example, let us stick to the case of the building industry and consider the capability of bid preparation for a complex PFI project. This capability refers to the firm’s ability to answer a public invitation to tender by drawing up a competitive bid with a high probability of award, on short notice and while minimizing upfront cost. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611433995">Davies and Brady (2000</xref>, p. 31), this capability includes the following activities:</p>
<list id="list1-0170840611433995" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>requirements gathering (extracted from customer documents) after receiving an invitation to tender from a customer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conceptual design specifying components in the proposed system;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>estimation of costs, taking into account many factors (e.g., the quality, reliability and cost of components supplied internally or from different suppliers; project management methodology; productivity etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>defining levels of service;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>risk management;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>scheduling of project activities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>selection of subcontractors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>preparing the bid document (including contractual agreements) by integrating information determined in the previous steps.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As mentioned before, bidding for PFI projects requires specialized knowledge from, among others, architects, design engineers, cost consultants, tax consultants, lawyers, facility managers and project managers. To integrate such complementary sets of specialized knowledge, an understanding common to all participants regarding the basic categories and building blocks of the bid (e.g., specifications of the projected buildings, scope of services rendered, level of detail of description) as well as regarding the generic process of bid preparation (e.g., standard operating procedures and “who needs to meet with whom to discuss what and at what stage” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>, p. 1595) is paramount. As a coordinated form of collective action that proceeds in a routinized way, the capability of bid preparation thus draws on shared knowledge to produce stable patterns of behavior and interaction. (Even residual demand for explicit coordination through communication hinges on a common nomenclature shared by all participants). These stable patterns of behavior and interaction efficiently align individual action (and thus the specialized knowledge and skills informing such action) towards a common goal, i.e. the preparation of a successful bid. This suggests that this capability (and capabilities in general) derives its efficiency in performance from synergistically leveraging distributed sets of complementary knowledge, which are integrated by a high degree of coordination on the basis of shared knowledge.</p>
<p>One source of such shared knowledge is common experience by the members of the bidding team, as for instance gained through former bid preparation activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611433995">Brady &amp; Davies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611433995">Davies &amp; Brady, 2000</xref>). As capabilities however represent persistent patterns of collective action that are largely independent of specific employees and which are unaffected by incidental turnover, they rely heavily on means of synchronizing (in particular new) participants’ disparate knowledge sets. This function is primarily served by knowledge artifacts. Building-type manuals, design guidelines, process manuals, model contracts, standard forms and checklists, etc. do not only serve the purpose of accumulating experience and carrying knowledge from one capability execution to another (i.e., from bidding project to bidding project); they also play an important role in socializing new participants in the collective practice represented by the capability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611433995">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond synchronizing shared knowledge amongst project team members, knowledge artifacts serve the further purpose of mediating the distributed sets of complementary knowledge by structuring the interaction of specialized participants and by predetermining the paths through which individual expertise is contributed. As mentioned above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori (2008)</xref> describes an Excel workbook used for cost calculation across the life cycle of a building as performing exactly this function in the course of bid preparation. This tool not only offers structured opportunities for project team members of each profession (engineers, cost consultants, facility managers, etc.) to record their cost-relevant information, but through iterated and reciprocal manipulation it facilitates the translation of the divergent categorical systems cherished by different professional groups (such as calculating costs per square meter vs. calculating them per ‘building element’). In the same way, it facilitates identification of optimal solutions in light of participants’ idiosyncratic knowledge (as exemplified by balancing the intricate trade-off between capital costs incurred at the construction stage vs. occupancy costs due to maintenance and facility management). In the context of capability execution more generally, such knowledge-embedding artifacts serve as boundary objects between professions and departments by accumulating and consolidating participants’ expertise and idiosyncratic experience. They thus catalyze the mediation of the complementary bodies of knowledge underlying these groups.</p>
<p>In summary, even a cursory examination of one such capability through the lens of the pluralistic epistemology offered above sketches a fairly fine-grained picture of important micro-mechanisms constituting higher-order knowledge-related constructs. Instead of asserting that such constructs store (an unspecified form of) collective knowledge by merely drawing analogies to individual skills, this analysis reveals that the capability examined here (and arguably such constructs in general) exploits quite distinct types of collective knowledge. The discussion additionally illustrates that it is particularly the intricate interplay of these different types (in terms of integration, synchronization and mediation) which brings about the persistent patterns of coordinated collective action that make up the core of any capability, routine or competency.</p>
<p>These tentative considerations certainly deserve more thorough elaboration. Nonetheless, they underscore even at this stage that the different types of collective knowledge are not solitary concepts and that their interdependency and interplay constitute more complex knowledge-related phenomena and higher-order constructs. Clearly, this points to an interesting avenue of further research.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>By virtue of its multifariousness, collective knowledge is a complex and difficult notion. Rather than evading a clear conceptualization, and instead of trivializing the notion as an umbrella for a wide array of knowledge-related phenomena, the previous sections sought to live up to the multifaceted nature of collective knowledge by analytically dissecting a plurality of reasonable conceptualizations and condensing them into a pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge. As these various types of collective knowledge proved to exhibit significant interdependencies, integrating them in an overarching framework required the systematic elaboration of their interactive processes and effects. This was accomplished by drawing on (and advancing) transactive memory systems theory as a complementary perspective, focusing on knowledge-related behavior and cognition within the collective.</p>
<p>Overall, the derived epistemological framework provides a non-reductive answer to the question of what it means for knowledge to be collective. It thus gives analytical underpinning to numerous studies drawing on collective knowledge as an explanatory device and investigating knowledge-related phenomena more generally. This was demonstrated in analyzing the relationship between knowledge integration and the architecture of firms and industries as well as by illuminating micro-mechanisms underlying higher-order knowledge-related constructs (e.g., capabilities, routines).</p>
<p>In addition to these important areas of further development and application, I conclude by highlighting two other topics deserving greater scrutiny in future research. The first point relates to the further extension of the pluralistic epistemology outlined above by incorporating other important distinctions made in the field of knowledge. Take, for example, the famous SECI model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433995">Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995)</xref>. At first sight, their epistemological model seems quite different from my framework: Nonaka and Takeuchi focus on the differentiation between implicit (or tacit) and explicit forms of knowledge, whereas the sole focus of this effort was to elaborate its ‘collective dimension’. These authors elaborate on processes of knowledge conversion (i.e., on socialization, externalization, internalization, combination), which mean transition or translation between knowledge types. I investigate processes of knowledge interaction (i.e., of integration, synchronization, mediation), which refer rather to their reciprocal influence and interdependence while nonetheless remaining quite distinct types. Nevertheless, both frameworks share some common ground and offer complementary perspectives on knowledge and its bearing on organizations. Processes of knowledge conversion and interaction thus seem intertwined. Synchronizing shared knowledge, for instance, frequently rests on processes of knowledge externalization and internalization (and in collocated teams, also on socialization) whereas externalization and combination constitute common mechanisms for the mediation of complementary knowledge. Moreover, the two dimensions of implicit vs. explicit and individual vs. collective forms of knowledge overlap and complement one another. It thus seems promising to further separate implicit and explicit forms of collective knowledge types (at least of shared and complementary knowledge, whereas artifactual knowledge largely represents an explicit form of knowledge) and to investigate processes of interaction and conversion between these subdivided types. Although beyond the scope of this paper, the systematic consolidation of both epistemological frameworks would yield an even richer picture of knowledge and knowledge-related processes in the organization and provide practitioners with an even more detailed map for their steering and management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0170840611433995">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This last aspect relates to another area of further research which is located rather at the pragmatic level, but which is of no less relevance for a practically oriented science. From the perspective of management, the proposed framework begs the question of the extent to which the different types and interactive processes of collective knowledge are configurable by conscious managerial action. The previous discussion reveals that the question demands a rather differentiated answer, as these types and processes unfold at the intersection of purposeful organizational design and of spontaneous social self-organization. This ambiguity has probably become most obvious for collective knowledge embedded in artifacts. Knowledge-embedding artifacts have been thought for a long time (and are still thought by some academics and managers) to be perfectly manipulable and controllable. Driven by recent developments in information technology, managers focus on the conception and implementation of sophisticated IT systems to provide the infrastructure for increasingly capable knowledge-embedding artifacts. Although these developments may suggest a comprehensive manageability of this type of collective knowledge, the previous discussion—in line with several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611433995">Bechky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433995">Cacciatori, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611433995">Carlile, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611433995">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611433995">D’Adderio, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433995">2003</xref>)—suggests that the actual effect of knowledge-embedding artifacts depends no less on the complex social processes of sense-making and sense-giving across the individuals using them. These processes are not only determined to a large part by local contexts and situated practice, but they also unfold more or less spontaneously in daily collective action and interaction. Consequently, managerial design activities in shaping collective knowledge embedded in artifacts are significantly mediated by autonomous social processes beyond discretionary managerial control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0170840611433995">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since similar considerations hold for the other types of collective knowledge, as well as for the processes revolving around them, the question of what form managerial efforts might take toward purposefully weaving and tailoring the detailed web of knowledge-based relationships and processes within the organization remains important. As has become increasingly clear in recent research in related fields such as organizational cognition and policy making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840611433995">Cabrera &amp; Cabrera, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611433995">Foss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840611433995">Gupta &amp; Govindarajan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611433995">Kaplan, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611433995">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611433995">Orlikowski, 2000</xref>), managers must go beyond merely shaping the technical and organizational landscape (i.e., designing knowledge-embedding artifacts and assigning them to individuals who are themselves assigned to specified knowledge domains and task areas) to successfully manage collective knowledge. Rather, they must actively intervene at the level of individual and social cognition formation (e.g., by aligning processes of framing and interpretation) as well as campaign in the political arena (e.g., by aligning interests and incentives). It is this multiplicity of perspectives tied to the management of collective knowledge that renders its study potentially even more complex and multifarious than researching the notion of collective knowledge from an epistemological perspective alone. Without a sound epistemological understanding of collective knowledge, however, any attempt at explaining the management of such knowledge or any other related organizational phenomena remains on shaky ground.</p>

<p>Note that this explanation is different from (but complementary to) that given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611433995">Cacciatori and Jacobides (2005)</xref>, which relates the vertical division of labor to the trajectory of capability development such that shifts in customer demand and/or changes in the regulatory environment calling for new capabilities lead to adaptations in the industry architecture.</p>

<p>A first take on jointly analyzing individual vs. collective and implicit vs. explicit forms of knowledge was given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611433995">Spender (1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611433995">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611433995">1998</xref>). His notion of collective knowledge, however, suffers from some of the ambiguities described above and lacks the degree of differentiation achieved in this paper. Elaborating on his approach by taking into account the pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge as proposed here accordingly represents a potential starting point for the elaboration of a more comprehensive epistemology.</p>

<p>This fact also seems to be borne out by the mixed results of numerous highly ambitious efforts to create an organizational landscape of knowledge-embedding artifacts on the drawing board (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433995">Damodaran &amp; Olphert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611433995">McKinlay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840611433995">Wing &amp; Chua, 2005</xref>).</p>
