<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To describe the oral health of psychiatric patients on psychotropic medication, and compare this to Queensland and national data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213486308">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We interviewed and examined 50 patients on medication at two outpatient clinics in South-east Queensland, in 2010. These areas had unfluoridated water till 2009.</p>

<sec id="section3-1039856213486308">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>One-third of the sample had not visited a dentist in the previous 2 years. One-half reported brushing their teeth once a day; 11% stated they never brushed. The mean of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) was 17.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 16.9 – 18.5), significantly higher than the state (13.1) and national (12.8) averages. Almost one-half of dental decay was untreated, compared to the state and national average of one-quarter.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The oral health of this subgroup within the community is substantially worse than the general population and there are substantially greater treatment needs. Achieving equity in oral health care for these individuals has substantial resource and management implications.</p>

<body>
<p>People with severe mental illness are generally at greater risk of oral diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486308">1</xref></sup> Possible reasons include a lack of motivation, poor oral hygiene, fear or specific dental phobia, cost or difficulty in accessing health care; and the side effects of psychiatric drugs, such as dry mouth (xerostomia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486308">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486308"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486308"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486308"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486308"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486308"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486308"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486308">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two main diseases that affect oral health are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gum disease).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486308">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486308">11</xref></sup> Dental caries occur through the demineralisation and subsequent proteolysis of hard tooth structures (enamel and dentine) by acids and enzymes derived from microbial biofilm, commonly called dental plaque. Acid production results from the metabolism of readily fermentable carbohydrates, especially sugars, from food. The major cariogenic organisms in dental plaque are mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. If dental plaque is not managed by reasonable oral hygiene, irreversible cavity formation can occur, requiring restoration or extraction of the tooth, especially if bacteria have reached the pulp and caused inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486308">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gum diseases, both gingivitis and the more serious destructive periodontitis, are also associated with biofilms, and so they also have a relationship to poor oral hygiene. The pathogens for periodontal diseases are more anaerobic, and the host immune/inflammatory response is critical to patient susceptibility. Signs of periodontal diseases include inflamed, bleeding or puffy (oedematous) gums, bad breath, and receding gums where the soft tissue attachment to the teeth has been destroyed, resulting in a periodontal pocket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486308">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Untreated dental diseases such as these can result in tooth loss. The loss of all teeth is called edentulousness. Aside from the medical consequences of poor oral health, pain and loss of function, there are psychosocial consequences such as embarrassment, poor self-image and social isolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486308">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis shows that people with severe mental illness have 3.4 times the odds of having lost all their teeth, than the general community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486308">1</xref></sup> They also have significantly higher levels of dental caries. It is therefore apparent that psychiatric patients have not shared in the improving oral health of the general population of most industrialised countries. Studies came from a wide range of countries, including two from Australia (New South Wales (NSW)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486308">12</xref></sup> and Victoria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486308">13</xref></sup>). Fluoridated water reduces the gap in oral health between psychiatric patients and the general population:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486308">1</xref></sup> both Australian studies were conducted where reticulated water was fluoridated.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to describe the oral health of patients with mental disorders whom are on psychotropic medication, in Southeast (SE) Queensland, and to compare this to state and national data. Unlike NSW and Victoria, the water supply in SE Queensland was not fluoridated until 2009.</p>

<title>Setting and subjects</title>
<p>This study was conducted in Ipswich: To the East is the city of Brisbane, to the West the rural and agricultural areas of the Brisbane, Lockyer and Fassifern Valleys. Ipswich extends about 1000 km<sup>2</sup> and has a population of approximately 150,000.</p>
<p>Subjects came from two community mental health clinics: Ipswich Mental Health Unit and nearby Goodna. All patients over age 18 were invited by nursing staff to participate in the study. The work was performed in 2010, so residents would not yet have benefited from recent fluoridation of the public water supply.</p>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Griffith University and Queensland Health human research ethics committees.</p>

<sec id="section7-1039856213486308">
<title>Oral health outcomes</title>
<p>Humans have 32 permanent teeth, of which 28 generally erupt between 6 and 12 years of age: the third molars usually do so in the late teens. These teeth are evenly distributed across four quadrants: each has a central incisor, lateral incisor, cuspid (canine), two premolars and three molars.</p>
<p>A number of oral health outcomes were investigated, including the prevalence of edentulousness, and measures of dental caries, of periodontal diseases and of oral hygiene.</p>
<p>Edentulousness is usually expressed as a dichotomous variable. Caries is commonly assessed by counting the number of decayed, missing, filled teeth in a person’s mouth (DMFT index).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486308">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Community Periodontal Index (CPI) is an epidemiological tool developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the evaluation of periodontal disease in population surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486308">15</xref></sup> It is a 5-point scale, as follows: no signs of periodontal disease (0); gingival bleeding after gentle probing (1); supragingival or subgingival calculus (2); pathologic pockets 4 – 5 mm deep (3); pathologic pockets &gt; 5 mm deep (4).</p>
<p>The Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486308">16</xref></sup> is composed of the combined Debris Index and Calculus Index. In this study, the Debris Index was assessed on six index teeth, with scores ranging from 0 (no debris) to 3 (debris on more than two-thirds of the exposed tooth surface).</p>
<p>Data were collected in interview rooms by questionnaires and clinical examinations of the head, neck and mouth by qualified dentists. The examinations were performed according to WHO criteria, under artificial light (using head torches), with disposable dental mirrors and the WHO CPI periodontal probe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486308">14</xref></sup> The two clinical examiners were calibrated prior to the study. The following data were also collected: gender, age, ethnicity, occupation, location, detailed medical and drug history (from the patient’s medical file), past dental visits in terms of frequency and reason, oral hygiene habits, and tobacco and alcohol consumption. Salivary flow was assessed visually and by participant report of any symptoms of dry mouth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486308">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856213486308">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Processing and analyses of data were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)-PC Version 20.0. The means (+ 95% CI) of the DMFT and its components were calculated and then compared to state and national findings. The frequency distribution of the CPI and OHI-S were calculated for the teeth recorded.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We interviewed and examined 50 patients: 80% were males of mean age 41 years (range 20 – 83); more than one-half (54%) were under 40 years old; 92% earned &lt; A$700 per week, which essentially comprised a government disability grant. Mental disorders were: schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses (76%), schizoaffective disorder (18%) and bipolar affective disorder (2%). There were 35 patients (70%) on more than one medication: The commonest was risperidone or paliperidone depot (n = 30), risperidone or paliperidone (<italic>n</italic> = 30), followed by clozapine (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Nineteen patients were on conventional antipsychotics, including zuclopenthixol, fluphenazine, thiothixene and haloperidol. Five were on oral quetiapine. Of the other psychotropic medications, nine were on antidepressants and six on mood stabilisers. Within our sample, 28% never smoked tobacco and almost one-half were current daily smokers; 26% reported they never consumed alcohol.</p>
<p>About one-third (32%) of the sample had not visited a dentist in the previous 2 years. Of those who had, 56% had one visit in this period. One-third visited the dentist within the last 6 months: most attended for extractions (33%), prosthetics (20%), pain relief (13%) and soft tissue problems (13%).</p>
<p>More than one-half (52%) reported brushing their teeth once a day, 24% twice a day. Most reported using fluoridated toothpaste, but flossing was uncommon. Two-thirds reported dry mouth, with 44% reporting sensitivity of teeth, 28% bleeding gums, 12% toothache, 16% trauma to their teeth and 34% halitosis. Of these, 86% showed evidence of saliva pooling in the mouth: a measure of adequate lubrication.</p>
<p>The mean DMFT score was 17.7 (95% CI = 16.9 – 18.5), with a range from 3 to 32. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213486308">Table 1</xref> shows the comparison DMFT and its component scores by a selection of variables. Older adults (&gt; 40 years) had statistically-significant, higher scores for the overall DMFT score, especially missing and filled teeth. Patients with lower levels of education had more missing teeth, but fewer decayed and filled teeth. Those with more than one dental visit in the last 2 years had almost three more teeth missing, compared to those with no such visit. Almost one-half of coronal decay was untreated. Of the sample, 8% was edentulous and one-third (34%) had &lt; 21 teeth.</p>

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first Australian study to measure the oral health of psychiatric patients using a range of instruments such as the DMFT score, the CPI and the OHI-S. It is also the first assessment of psychiatric patients in an area of the country without fluoridated water.</p>
<p>One-half of our study sample currently smoked on a daily basis, compared to the national prevalence of ~20%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486308">18</xref></sup> which is important because smokers suffer from higher levels of periodontal disease, oral infections, tooth loss and oral cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486308">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486308"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213486308">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mean DMFT score of 17.7 was significantly higher than the state (13.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486308">22</xref></sup> and national (12.8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486308">23</xref></sup> averages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1039856213486308">Table 2</xref>). The percentage of untreated coronal decay (almost 50%) was also significantly higher that the state and national average, by about one quarter. The percentage of the study sample with fewer than 21 teeth (34%) was significantly higher than the 11% reported as the state and national average.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486308">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>One-third of the sample had not visited a dentist in the previous 2 years: those who did, usually had a single visit. National data suggest that 60 – 70% of Australian people visit a dentist annually, many making two visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213486308">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486308">25</xref></sup> Our sample suffered significant oral health burden, yet had visited the dentist less often than most.</p>
<p>Almost 90% of participants reported brushing their teeth regularly, although more than two-thirds of index teeth had debris deposits. This suggests over-reporting of oral hygiene behaviours.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, scores for decayed or missing teeth were similar to those from Melbourne, where water fluoridation has been in place for decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486308">13</xref></sup> Some of our patients may have moved to SE Queensland after having lived for some time in a fluoridated area, but we do not have such information. In others, the effectiveness of water fluoridation may have been limited by the overwhelming presence of other risk factors.</p>
<p>All of the soft tissue lesions detected required medical management. These were found in 17 of 50 subjects, representing a large unmet need. No data are available for the general population of Australia, for comparison: the international literature reveals a wide range for prevalence of oral mucosal lesions, depending on inclusion/exclusion criteria and the nature of the population studied. A reasonable comparator is the German study that found an overall prevalence of 11%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213486308">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations included the small sample size and that the information on patients’ practices of oral hygiene or dental visits were self-reported. The small sample size meant that it was not possible to assess the relationships between different medications and oral health status. Future research is indicated, to compare psychotropic medications with different side-effects, e.g. hyper- and hypo-salivation, and the prevalence of oral diseases.</p>
<p>For mental health clinicians, consideration of oral health should be part of comprehensive assessment of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486308">1</xref></sup> Most patients report that mental health staff have never asked them about dental problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213486308">27</xref></sup> Nursing care plans for inpatients should include a basic assessment of oral hygiene, and the supply of toothbrushes or denture baths, as well as instructions in their use. Case management should include attention to oral hygiene and oral health, including advice on diet, smoking and brushing technique. A study performed in the US, in Missouri, demonstrates the efficacy of such programmes, at least in terms of short-term improvements in oral hygiene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213486308">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Policy-makers should consider providing free, accessible dental care for people with severe mental illness. Examples include the ‘Dental as Anything’ programme in Melbourne, which offers a collaborative outreach dental service to people with severe mental illness;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486308">13</xref></sup> and elsewhere in Australia, Queensland’s strategy to improve the physical health of people with severe mental illness, ‘Activate: Mind &amp; Body’, promotes oral hygiene and regular care from a dentist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856213486308">29</xref></sup></p>
