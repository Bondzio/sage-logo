<abstract>
<p>This study investigated whether women’s perimenopausal/menopausal symptoms had negative effects on marital or long-term relationships, an aspect underrepresented in the literature. A questionnaire distributed to 110 convenience-sampled women, ages 45-60 years and prescreened for inclusion by private practitioners or the author’s colleagues, yielded a 60% return. Symptoms correlated positively with participants’ feelings about the relationship and sexual intimacy with their partner (.353–.783, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, and 272–.371, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05, respectively). Divorced women did not experience the same loss of sexual desire or feel anger or resentment toward their partners as did married women. Clinicians should ask women about perimenopausal/menopausal symptoms, loss of libido, and the marital relationship during annual visits. Education related to this period of life may provide a better understanding to women and the partner may be included in education, as many men do not understand the changes associated with perimenopause and menopause.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111410659" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW), a definition and classification of reproductive phase, perimenopause, and menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111410659">Soules et al., 2001</xref>), perimenopause is a transition period to menopause, which itself has early and late phases. The 5 years preceding the last menstrual cycle is referred to as early menopause. The phase of the 5 years following the last menstrual cycle until death is referred to as late menopause. A woman’s reproductive stages are assigned numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111410659">Soules et al., 2001</xref>) and surgical menopause is not addressed. The last naturally occurring menstrual period is the event against which other stages are defined. STRAW addressed many of the important aspects of reproduction aging, including information on the physical, emotional, and social changes that occur during this time of life. Research conducted to date has offered limited insights into the impact of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms on the marital or long-term partner relationships of women experiencing those symptoms. This study was intended to contribute to filling that particular gap.</p>
<p>On average, women usually feel the first effects of menopause between 45 and 60 years of age. The aging baby-boomer generation has reached midlife and beyond, meaning an unprecedented number of women are now postmenopausal. An estimated 6,000 women in the United States reach menopause every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111410659">Kagan and Goldstein, 2007</xref>). A study done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111410659">Papini et al. (2002)</xref> examined the relationship and perception of menopause from the women’s perspective and from the husband’s perspective and that found women had more positive feelings toward menopause than did their husbands, who were not aware of the symptoms experienced by their wives.</p>
<p>Research on the medical and physiological aspects of menopause, controversy regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) spurred by the women’s health initiative, osteoporosis, and quality-of-life issues surrounding menopause are popular topics in the media, professional and lay journals, and conversations among women. Although considerable information about the physical aspects of perimenopause and menopause are available, insights into the psychosocial aspects of these reproductive phases of women’s lives and their effect on women’s relationships may not have reached the intended audience of the women and men affected by menopause.</p>
<p>Despite television shows airing casual conversions between talk-show hostesses and their favourite medical doctors on the subject of menopause specialists, many women are uncomfortable discussing their personal concerns with their health care providers. Women wonder whether their symptoms are unique to them, a sign of a serious medical condition, or simply imaginings. Perhaps the problem is not so much about the women and the topic of menopause as the health care practitioners who are caring for them.</p>
<p>Women presenting with severe symptoms of perimenopause and menopause which are affecting their quality of life may be referred to health care providers who specialise in issues of menopause. Nurse practitioners treat patients in a holistic manner, as they are concerned about the physical, emotional, and spiritual factors, and any other factors that may affect the patient. Menopause practitioners are certified by the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and have received advanced knowledge in caring for perimenopausal and menopausal women, and many nurse practitioners hold this certification. There are 580 nurse practitioners who are certified as Menopause Clinicians out of the 150,000 nurse practitioners in the United States. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.nams.org">www.nams.org</ext-link> 2010) ‘Providing health care and implementing preventative health strategies for these women enables clinicians to make significant impact on public health and women’s quality of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111410659">NAMS, 2005</xref>, p. 5). Of 150,000 nurse practitioners registered in the Uni States, approximately 580 have been certified by NAMS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.nams.org">www.nams.org</ext-link> 2010). Menopause practitioners can help women approaching this important transition in their reproductive lives to better understand what changes to expect, why these changes occur, when to expect them to start and end, and what options are available to facilitate this interval in their lives.</p>
<p>In a longitudinal population-based study of 438 women of ages 45–55 years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111410659">Dennerstein et al. (2000)</xref> found that vasomotor symptoms were specifically related to the hormonal changes of menopause, and in a large cross-sectional study conducted a few years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111410659">Dennerstein et al. (2007)</xref> found symptoms of hot flashes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1744987111410659">*</xref>, night sweats, poor memory, difficulty sleeping, head and shoulder aches, vaginal dryness, and difficulty with sexual arousal were symptoms common to this period of life. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111410659">Arias (2005)</xref>, 85% of women experience hot flashes during the menopausal transition. Although the general consensus is that symptoms associated with the gradual decrease in oestrogen include hot flashes, night sweats, psychosomatic symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, forgetfulness, and headache, these symptoms seem to occur more frequently during the perimenopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111410659">Oldenhave et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Considerable research has been conducted on the hormonal influence of oestrogen on cognitive function. It has been strongly suggested that decreasing levels of oestrogen result in self-reported memory changes, altered concentration, and high levels of forgetfulness that perimenopausal women experience. Cognitive symptoms include difficulty concentrating, loss of motivation, fatigue, and listlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111410659">Walter, 2000</xref>). A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111410659">Kok et al. (2006)</xref> reported only a weak effect on memory searching, speed, or recalling an event or word.</p>
<p>Women in the transition to menopause are vulnerable to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111410659">Warga, 1999</xref>). Symptoms of depression have been found to be significantly more common in women who experience vasomotor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111410659">Miller and Daniels-Brady, 2005</xref>). A study of 243 women found that depression is caused by negative life stressors, history of depression, sexual abuse, or a history of postpartum blues (Woods and colleagues, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987111410659">Moriyama et al., 2008</xref>). Early studies linked depression to menopause, but psychosocial factors appear more predicative of depression in menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111410659">Stanton et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has been conducted to provide insight to some of the aspects of interest in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111410659">Rosseau (1998)</xref> posited that hot flashes were the cause of sleep problems, and frequent awakening at night contributed to the problems of inability to concentrate, and anxiety and depression. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111410659">Conboy et al. (2001)</xref> on menopausal symptoms found that 76% of menopausal women were depressed, 76% were anxious, 70% wanted to be left alone, 63% had hot flashes, and 45% experienced vaginal dryness. These studies did not address the impact of these symptoms on the marital relationship.</p>
<p>The perimenopausal transition is a time for an increased risk for more minor, but also potentially impairing, depressive symptoms due to hormonal flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111410659">Miller and Daniels-Brady, 2005</xref>) The 24 months surrounding the final menstrual period (perimenopause) carries a 14-fold risk of the onset of a minor depressive period.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111410659">Miller and Daniels-Brady, 2005</xref>). There are oestrogen receptors throughout the brain and oestrogen has an effect on several brain transmitters, a fact that can better explain the correlation between perimenopause and depression as estrogen levels decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111410659">Clayton and Guico-Pabia, 2008</xref>). In clinical practice, the initiation of HRT can result in women reporting feelings of improved physical well-being and thinking more clearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111410659">Fugate, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A large, community-based survey conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111410659">Kravitz et al. (2003)</xref> found that difficulty in sleeping was reported by 45.4% of perimenopausal women. Sexual problems were identified through administration of the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111410659">McCoy, 2000</xref>), the developer of which cited the Melbourne Women’s Midlife Health project, which reported a significant negative effect on sexual responsivity, frequency of sexual activity, libido, and vaginal dyspareunia in menopausal women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111410659">Basson (2004)</xref> cited several cross-sectional, longitudinal studies, all of which showed a strong correlation between sexual health and a woman’s feelings for her partner. Health of the emotional relationship during sexual activity can be an important predictor of the presence or absence of sexual problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111410659">Krychman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111410659">Avis et al. (2005)</xref>, 75% of middle-aged women believed that sex was moderately to extremely important in their lives. The same study found perimenopausal women reported greater pain with intercourse than had been experienced in the premenopausal years. The variables that affect the sexual relationship are the importance of sex to the woman, attitude toward aging, and vaginal dryness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111410659">Avis et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Quality-of-life studies have been widely published. Depression and anxiety surrounding decreased quality of life during the menopausal period in women’s lives remains controversial in the reviews of the literature, and critical reviews of the literature have challenged the belief that depression is strongly related to menopause, although oestrogen affects the central nervous system and plays a primary role in mood regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111410659">Walter, 2000</xref>). A study of physical exercise found that menopausal women had improved health-related quality of life and fewer hot flashes and menopausal symptoms if they exercised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111410659">Papini et al., 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111410659">Daly et al. (1993)</xref>, quality of life may be severely compromised in women with menopausal symptoms, and perceived improvement is found in those using HRT. These may be factors contributing to a woman’s quality of life. The Western view of menopause is largely biomedical and a wide range of symptoms are reported to be related to changes in hormones, whereas Asian countries have reported very low incidence of vasomotor symptoms. The Japanese reported symptoms such as stiff shoulders, low back pain and chilliness, which they associated with aging and not changes in hormones. Japanese women do not define menopause by the same markers as do women in Western cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111410659">Avis and Crawford, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111410659"><title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms and the marital or long-term relationship. A study conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.aarp.org">www.aarp.org</ext-link> May 2004) found that of the 1,200 divorces granted to married couples in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, 66% were initiated by women. A neuropsychiatrist suggested that the change in feelings that lead to unhappiness and result in the end of a marriage may be related to the hormonal changes of menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111410659">Brizendine, as cited in Diamond, 2008</xref>). Many marriages end in divorce for reasons unrelated to hormones. The incidence of late life (ages 55–60) divorce is increasing due to living longer lives and the reasons are falling out of love, relationship boredom, or personal change. This trend is increasing with the baby-boomer generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111410659">Wu and Schimmele, 2007</xref>). Approximately 64% divorced after 10 years of marriage and 32% after 20 or more years of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111410659">Montegro, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This author, in her practice as a women’s health nurse practitioner caring for a large number of patients of perimenopause or menopause age, found that frequent complaints were vasomotor symptoms, physical and emotional changes, and feelings of being overwhelmed. Many of her patients spoke of feelings about their long-term relationships with spouses or partners, and their desired preference to be alone as a way to decrease their personal responsibilities, and some even spoke of abandoning the relationship. The author hypothesised there might be a correlation between perimenopausal or menopausal symptoms and the marital relationship, perhaps even a partial explanation for the higher divorce rates during this period of life. This study was designed to identify whether symptoms of the menopause transition lead to marital discord and if perhaps more marriages end during this period of life than in others.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111410659" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>This was an original, exploratory, descriptive design study. Although existing instruments (e.g. the Menopause-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire) were available, the author elected to develop a new questionnaire, namely the menopause and perimenopause questionnaire (MPQ), to extract additional information regarding demographics and relationships with significant others (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111410659">Table 1</xref>). Another possible instrument that might have suited the purpose was the Utian Quality of Life Scale developed to determine how a woman perceives her quality of life through and beyond the menopausal years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111410659">Utian et al., 2002</xref>), but the researcher sought specific information relative to the marital relationship. The MPQ included seven demographic questions and 14 questions about symptoms, feelings, and relationship issues, which participants answered using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>frequently</italic>; 5 = <italic>not applicable</italic>). A self-report questionnaire was chosen as the design for this study because participants tend to be more honest when answering an anonymous survey. It also provides greater uniformity than interviews, and the results are easily processed, clear, and unambiguous. The methodology was chosen to support the an exploration of a connection between menopausal symptomatology and the marital or long-term relationship.

<sec id="sec4-1744987111410659"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>The MPQ was the primary instrument for data collection and analysis. The research was an exploratory interpretive study that interpreted and analysed the results obtained from the study’s participants. The original instrument was reviewed by a seven-person panel of experts of which one was an MD, one had an EdD, three were PhDs and two were post master’s college professors. All were experienced researchers. Based on their comments regarding the content and presentation of the original instrument, changes were made. For example, the original questionnaire posed questions in the present tense (e.g. ‘Do you experience insomnia?’) and the revised questionnaire presented the questions in a format that allowed the answers to be quantified (e.g. ‘How often do you experience.?’).</p>
<p>The revised questionnaire was tested for internal consistency for reliability using the Cronbach’s alpha test. The coefficient obtained was .6582 and a standardized alpha was .6776, values indicative of fair reliability (a value of .80 is indicative of good reliability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111410659">Carmines and Zeller, 1979</xref>). Because in most situations, Cronbach’s alpha test provides only a conservative estimate of a measure’s reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111410659">Carmines and Zeller, 1979</xref>), a test-retest was chosen to further test the tool’s reliability. The tool was distributed to the sample population and 1 month later, the same tool was redistributed to the same sample population. The sample population was perimenopausal or menopausal aged women referred to me by colleagues who had previously approached the women and obtained their consent to be part of the sample population. Each of the tools were numbered to assure both sets of completed questionnaires were received. Results of the test-retest method proved the tool reliable, as when comparing test 1 to test 2 the answers to each of the questions were almost identical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111410659"><title>Sample population</title>
<p>The convenience-sample population consisted of women, ages 45–60 years, who resided in New York State, USA and whose names and addresses had been obtained from several of the author’s nurse practitioner colleagues and menopausal practitioner colleagues, as well as private practitioners whose patients’ characteristics satisfied the inclusion criteria. The author relied on the medical knowledge of colleagues and private practitioners to determine whether the patients whose contact information had been provided to the author were, in fact, perimenopausal or menopausal.</p>
<p>The research was approved by the dissertation committee at Columbia Commonwealth University. Ethically, since there was no harm to the respondents and the choice to complete the questionnaire was voluntary and consent of a participant would be implied by the returning of the questionnaire. A letter was included explaining this as well as contact information for the researcher. Inclusion criteria included English spoken as primary language, being between the ages of 45 and 60 years, and being either perimenopausal or menopausal (i.e. being of an age at which perimenopause or menopause is commonly diagnosed and having variations in menses not attributable to any other medical condition).</p>
<p>A population size of 110 was chosen because it was the available population for the study and acceptable for social research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111410659"><title>Study location</title>
<p>Long Island, NY, USA was chosen as the study locale. This particular location was chosen because the researcher maintains a professional practice in this locale and has professional colleagues in this locale who were willing to prescreen their patients and provide contact information for them, thereby facilitating the data collection process. The demographic composition of approximately 233,640 women between the ages of 45 and 60 years was believed to improve the likelihood of securing a sample population of reasonable size to yield sufficient data.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1744987111410659"><title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>Once validity and reliability were assured, the MPQs were mailed to the 110-woman convenience sample in packages containing clear instructions and information about the research being conducted, informed consent forms, the questionnaire itself, and a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of the completed informed consent and questionnaire. The covering letter included in the MPQ package requested the recipient’s assistance in a study for the purpose of research. Anonymity and objectivity was assured and the methods by which these requirements would be provided was explained. The author did not code the questionnaires in any way, thereby further assuring anonymity. One hundred and ten questionnaires were mailed, 5 were returned to the sender/author as undeliverable, and 63 were returned completed. The high rate of return (60%) may have been due to women being given an opportunity to discuss their menopausal symptoms and their relationship issues.</p>
<p>Having been prescreened by the author’s colleagues and private practitioners as being either menopausal or perimenopausal, the study participants were asked questions to confirm their understanding of whether they were, in fact, menopausal or perimenopausal and gather quantitative information about their medical conditions. The number of the questions was 14 and demographic questions were 7. The 14 (Likert-type) questions were not excessive and met the criteria for the study; it was felt that women would be more likely to answer a questionnaire that was not too long. In <italic>Survey Questions Handcrafting the Standardized Questionnaire</italic> by JM Converse and S Presser S, it is cited ‘The counsel to keep questions short has been qualified by research and experience of research years’.</p>
<p>SPSS version 14 was utilized for the data analysis. Data from the demographic questions and Likert-type questions were entered into SPSS (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111410659">Table 1</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were generated to identify correlations between the variables.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1744987111410659" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The average age of the 63 study participants was found to be 52.37 years (12.7% were 49 years old, 12.7% were 52 years old, 9.5% were 53 years old, and 9.5% were 47 years old), which confirmed the participants were within the typical range of women in perimenopause or menopause. Self-reports indicated 81% of the study population were married and had been married an average of 20.62 years, 17.5% were divorced, and 1.5% were in a long-term relationship (greater than 8 years). Of the respondents, 29.23% reported being on HRT. The level of education level was reported as follows: 9.5% had earned a PhD, 7.9% had credits beyond a master’s degree, 23.8% had a master’s degree, 28.6% had attended college, 27% were high school graduates, 1.6% went to business school, and 1.6% had a GED (general education development test).</p>
<p>Frequency of sexual intimacy varied greatly among study participants: 25.4% reported not being sexually intimate in the past month, 23.8% were intimate once to three times, 23% were intimate four to five times, 11.2% were intimate six to 15 times, and 18% were intimate 10 to 18 times. Although having been prescreened by their health care professionals as being either perimenopausal or menopausal (and therefore, by definition, having variable menses or no menses), 30% self-reported as having regular menses.</p>
<p>The symptom of insomnia was reported primarily as occasionally to often (70%). Psychological symptoms were reported in terms of anxiety (67% experienced anxiety occasionally to frequently) and depression (54.5% were depressed occasionally to frequently).</p>
<p>Distribution, mean, and standard deviations of the results of the Likert-type questions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111410659">Table 1</xref>. The symptom of insomnia was found to correlate positively with anxiety (.444), depression (.393), and loss of sexual desire (.313). Longer term marriages correlated positively to a greater loss of sexual desire (.272), hot flashes (.313), vaginal dryness (.496), and depression (.310), and negatively affected the quality of life (.252). Longer term marriages also correlated positively to women answering the question that they desired to live alone (.562) and also had thoughts of leaving their partner (.663). Pearson’s correlation coefficient method was utilised to determine correlation between variables. Significance levels of .05 and .01 were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987111410659" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the study’s original design was to include women of ages 45–60 years, it is possible that the MPQ recipients believed they were past menopause and the questions posed did not reflect the symptoms experienced at their stage of life. These women might not have completed and returned the questionnaire. Some of the results were paradoxical. For example, despite having reported a desire to live alone (.562) or having had thoughts of leaving their partner, women also reported still feeling passionate love for their partner (.414) and regarded their partner as a companion and a friend (.757). The number of times the women were sexually intimate with their partner in the past month showed a high correlation with positive feelings toward their partner (.410). This correlation may explain why those who were married the longest may have had more negative feelings as a result of decreased sexual activity between them. For those who had positive feelings about their partner and increased sexual intimacy, it cannot be determined which came first—the positive feelings or the sexual intimacy.</p>
<p>Married women in the study had a loss of sexual desire, felt anger and resentment toward their partner, and had occasional thoughts of living alone, while divorced women did not experience anger and resentment toward their partners or have a decrease in sexual desire. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111410659">Avis et al. (2005)</xref>, new relationships are related to greater emotional satisfaction, arousal, and frequency of intercourse and desire. Perhaps the relative newness of these relationships, as compared lengthy marriages, explains why women in these relationships reported less loss of sexual desire, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and depression than their married counterparts.</p>
<p>Although those participants who were married had a loss of sexual desire, felt anger and resentment, and had occasionally desire to live alone, their overall feelings were of passionate love for their partners, whom they regarded as companions and friends. No correlation was found between women who were married the longest showing any significant effect on their marriages, even though they had admitted having negative feelings. Perhaps women in lengthy marriages are simply content to be together.</p>
<p>The symptoms of hot flashes and vaginal dryness reported by the study population were also found in most other studies on menopausal symptoms. The study population’s frequency of hot flashes (occasionally to frequently 55% of the time) was lower than that reported in some other studies. This study also showed women experienced vaginal dryness occasionally to frequently 54% of the time, and to 45% of women reported to experience difficulty with intercourse related to vaginal dryness sometimes. There was significant correlation between insomnia, hot flashes, anxiety, depression, and memory loss. The vasomotor symptoms are repeatedly reported in literature on menopause, but it is unclear whether their interference with sleep causes depression, anxiety, or memory loss, or whether these symptoms are all part of menopause without any particular attributable primary cause.</p>
<p>The finding that marriage, not menopausal symptoms, was the variable triggering negative feelings was unexpected. Even with the negative feelings, married women regarded their spouses as their companions or friends 90% of the time and 85% were satisfied with their partner as a lover. Although 50% of women had thoughts of living alone, only 11% frequently had thoughts of leaving their partner. Perhaps these are normal feelings experienced by many couples who have been married for any length of time and have little to do with menopause.</p>
<p>Clinicians who treat women presenting with multiple menopausal symptoms must understand and examine both the physical and possible psychiatric reasons. Each relationship is different and it may be difficult to distinguish whether menopausal symptoms influence the relationship or the relationship influences the menopausal symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111410659">Avis et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, women who experienced more frequent sexual intimacy had stronger feelings of passionate love and friendship for the partner. The divorce rate for this study population was only 17.5%, but determination of cause or time of divorce was not gathered, thereby limiting any connection between menopause and divorce.</p>
<p>Perimenopausal and menopausal women experience a range of symptoms that may be related to declining ovarian function, but hormonal fluctuations are not the only changes that could be associated with changes in personal and social relationships. Psychosocial issues (e.g. empty nest syndrome, health problems, fear of getting older, change in career or retirement status, or marital dissolution) might explain depression. The correlations generated from the study data demonstrated that symptoms related to perimenopause and menopause, including hot flashes, insomnia, depression, anxiety, memory loss, and loss of sexual desire are indeed interrelated. The findings of this study support many other studies conducted on menopausal symptoms but the cause of these symptoms remains a topic of debate.</p>
<p>Based on her experience with perimenopausal and menopausal patients in the clinical setting, the author hypothesised that there might be a correlation between perimenopausal or menopausal symptoms and the marital relationship, which perhaps could offer a partial explanation for the higher divorce rate during this period of life. The study did not support this hypothesis. Woods (2005) explained that where we sit can influence what we see as clinicians. In the community, women may see a few friends experiencing mild menopausal symptoms with a degree of equanimity, but in clinical practice, we may see very symptomatic women desperate for relief. This may explain why the author in her practice found women who complained about their symptoms and marital issues.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111410659"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study was limited in that it did not consider the impact that family responsibilities and work may contribute to some of the symptoms described and possibly affect the quality of life. At menopause, nulliparous women were reported to be more than three times as likely to be dissatisfied with their childbearing choices, but were less likely to report hot flashes or vaginal dryness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111410659">Hess et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The study is acknowledged to have had several limitations. It is possible that this study population did not honestly report their symptoms or feelings for fear of embarrassment, or did not have the opportunity to have these conversations with their health care practitioner during an office visit. Measurement of the psychological symptoms according to responses to questions on anxiety and depression assumed these symptoms were due to menopause; it was not determined whether those who responded to the questionnaire had a history of anxiety or depression or were undergoing treatment for any psychosocial issues known to contribute to anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Finances, family dynamics, and medical or social problems are factors that may contribute to marital tension, anxiety, and depression, but they were not included in this study. Including a question to capture information about occupation might have yielded insight into perceptions of higher quality of life for those with a career or profession because these characteristics may support a positive self-image. People who perceive their roles in life to be important have higher levels of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111410659">Deeks, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987111410659"><title>Recommendations</title>
<p>All health care providers, not just nurse practitioners, should ask questions regarding symptoms experienced, sexual activity, and the state of the marital relationship. Husbands and partners should be included in patient–practitioner conversations regarding perimenopause and menopause as they are part of the team and, as previously discussed, lack knowledge of menopause. Future research with a control group of married young women that could be followed to perimenopause or menopause and surveyed periodically might yield different and insightful results. It would be worthwhile to compare the results of a ‘perceptions’ questionnaire completed by spouses or partners of symptomatic perimenopausal or menopausal women with the women themselves.</p>
<p>Clearly, the perimenopause and menopause cause women to experience a vast range of physical and emotional symptoms. Little mention is made in the literature about support groups and resources to assist women and their spouses or partners as they travel this path. Nurse practitioners are ideally positioned to offer assistance by initiating support groups with an educational component to help empower women to make informed health care decisions. The author is currently conducting a study on a research support programme for perimenopause- and menopause-aged women to address the issues raised by this study.</p>
