<abstract>
<p>Recently, various micro air vehicles have drawn significant attention in numerous areas including surveillance and reconnaissance. The manual control of micro air vehicles is very difficult due to their smaller profile; therefore, a stability and controllability augmentation system is a minimum requirement for stable and efficient flight. However, it is not easy to obtain an accurate numerical model for the flight dynamics of micro air vehicles in the design of the stability and controllability augmentation system. An alternative approach for the stability and controllability augmentation systems is to incorporate reinforcement learning in order to address the numerical complexity. However, in order to train micro air vehicles to learn how to fly, they must first be airborne. This article presents a new method that provides an effective environment where a micro air vehicle can learn to fly in a similar manner to an infant learning to walk. The test setup was constructed to enable the magnetic levitation of a micro air vehicle that has a permanently embedded magnet. This apparatus allows for flexible experimentation: the position and attitude of the micro air vehicle, the constraint forces, and the resulting moments are adjustable and fixable. This “<italic>Pseudo Flight Environment</italic>” was demonstrated using a fixed-wing micro air vehicle model. Furthermore, in order for the model to maintain a constant altitude, a height hold control system was devised and implemented.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, the autonomous flight of air vehicles has been studied intensively in order to improve operation efficiencies. For example, in long-distance airliners, the autopilot function is used for most of the flight time except during takeoff and landing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X13478270">Edwards, 1977</xref>). As a result of their higher mobility and lower operation cost, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), including micro air vehicles (MAVs), have become more viable in various applications such as forest fire detection, weather observation, and military reconnaissance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X13478270">Causey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X13478270">Merino et al., 2006</xref>). However, the manual control of MAVs remains very difficult because their small sizes make it difficult to detect their attitude with naked eyes, and even small aerodynamic disturbances can affect their stability; therefore, a stability and controllability augmented system (SCAS) is required for stable and efficient flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X13478270">Shim et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The flight dynamics of MAVs must be well understood prior to the design of the SCAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X13478270">Nelson, 1998</xref>). Through the integration of the system dynamics of the constituting components, the entire flight dynamics of the MAV are generally constructed. Typically, aerodynamic models are established through aerodynamic simulations or wind tunnel tests under various operating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X13478270">Gatto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X13478270">Ramamurti et al., 2000</xref>). However, for MAVs, accurate aerodynamic simulation or precise measurement of the aerodynamic forces and moments is challenging due to their small size and low flight speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X13478270">Calise and Rysdyk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X13478270">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). The flight dynamics of MAVs may also be identified using free flight test data rather than through the integration of system dynamics of each component, thereby reducing costs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X13478270">Niño et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045389X13478270">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). The performance of SCASs can also be validated through free flight tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X13478270">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>). However, these tests are significantly affected by weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X13478270">How et al., 2008</xref>), and many flight tests are required in order to ascertain accurate results under various operating conditions. Moreover, flight tests themselves are difficult for some air vehicles with unstable flight dynamics, which create high-level risks and increase the likelihood of MAV breakage. This article attempts to mitigate these difficulties by introducing a new method for the design and implementation of SCASs for MAVs.</p>

<title>Teaching babies to walk, teaching MAVs to fly</title>
<p>How do parents teach babies how to walk? When this question is considered, many may think about a baby walker. It is reported that 50%–90% of parents use baby walkers in order to keep their babies safe when babies are learning to walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X13478270">Illingworth et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, holding the baby’s hand to prevent injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X13478270">Baran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045389X13478270">Wu, 2008</xref>) while simultaneously encouraging him or her to take steps is another effective method to teach babies to walk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X13478270">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The baby eventually learns how to move his or her legs in order to move forward. As the baby’s walking ability improves, the guiding hand or harness may gradually loosen until the baby is ready to walk alone. If a MAV can be likewise trained using similar methods as those used to teach a baby to walk, the design and implementation of the SCAS will be a significantly more straightforward process. For this purpose, the airflow around the MAV can be generated using a wind tunnel in order to simulate flight. But how can the parents’ hands be simulated for a MAV? One method could be to use a robotic arm to mechanically support the MAV, but this generates significant interference by creating and disrupting airflows that are not found in free flight. Therefore, a new method without mechanical support is required to buttress the MAV in order to teach it how to fly in a similar manner to teaching babies how to walk.</p>

<title>Magnetic suspension and balance system</title>
<sec id="section4-1045389X13478270">
<title>Brief overview</title>
<p>A magnetic suspension and balance system (MSBS) is a device that can levitate an experimental model using magnetic forces and moments generated by its electromagnets. The experimental model is magnetized or has magnets inside the device. The test object can be located at the center of the test section during the wind tunnel test without mechanical support, which eliminates interferences that can arise from mechanical supports during testing. Furthermore, the MSBS can also simultaneously measure the external forces and moments acting on the model from the current intensities of the electromagnets, which are proportional to the magnetic forces and moments employed to maintain the position and attitude of the test object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X13478270">Covert, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X13478270">Laurenceau and Tournier (1957)</xref> first proposed the foundational concept of the MSBS for wind tunnel testing. Since the world’s first practical use of the MSBS for wind tunnel testing by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X13478270">Vlajinac and Covert (1972)</xref>, there have been several reports on the use of the MSBS for the experimental aerodynamic measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X13478270">Dress, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X13478270">Higuchi et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X13478270">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X13478270">Owen and Owen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X13478270">Sawada and Suda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X13478270">Vlajinac and Covert, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>While most studies on MSBSs have been focused on typical experimental aerodynamics with an emphasis on the elimination of support interferences, MSBSs also have other advantages, including that they can easily change the position and attitude angles of the test object. Thus, dynamic experiments can become simpler with MSBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X13478270">Eskins, 1988</xref>). This study makes full use of the advantages of MSBSs as contactless actuators and balances.</p>

<title>MSBS configuration</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X13478270">Figure 2</xref>, the MSBS employed in this study has a 33 × 40-cm test section. It has two large permanent magnets made from samarium–cobalt and eight electromagnets. One of the large permanent magnets is located at the bottom center of the test section and the other is located at the top center. The inner and outer diameters are 50 and 150 mm, respectively, with a thickness of 25 mm.</p>

</fig>
<p>The inner and outer diameters of the electromagnet are 140 and 180 mm, respectively. The electromagnet thickness is 20 mm, and the number of turns is 255. The test objects that will be levitated inside the MSBS should have small permanent magnets inside the devices, so that the magnetic forces and moments can be employed to levitate the model in the testing area inside the MSBS. The magnetic forces between the large permanent magnets of the MSBS and the small permanent magnets of the model counterbalance most of the model’s weight. In addition, the electromagnets generate controlled magnetic forces and moments to maintain a stable position and attitude of the test object through the feedback controls. The magnetic force and moment acting on the model are a superposition of the magnetic forces and moments generated by the eight electromagnets. The magnitudes of the magnetic forces and moments are proportional to the input currents for each electromagnet. The directions of the resulting magnetic forces and moments are controllable through combinations of the polarities of the eight electromagnets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X13478270">Figure 3</xref> presents the combinations of the pole directions of the electromagnets required to appropriately control each degree of freedom (DOF) of the MAV model.</p>

</fig>
<p>Several optical sensors located within the MSBS measure the position and attitude of the test object, and the DS1103 of dSPACE<sup>™</sup> generates signals for the electromagnets based on the control algorithms. The root-mean-square (RMS) values of the output signals of these sensors were measured to check any possible degradation caused by electromagnetic fields. There are no drift problems, and the overall noise levels were sufficiently small. The control algorithms for the six DOFs of the test object were composed of six independent controllers; the magnetic forces and moments for each DOF of the model are proportional to the signals from each controller. Therefore, the test object’s DOFs can be adjusted arbitrarily and individually for each DOF of the model. This characteristic of the MSBS is used to design a SCAS for the MAV in this study.</p>

<title>Pseudo flight environment</title>
<p>The <italic>pseudo flight environment</italic> (PFE) is a test environment that emulates free flight tests for air vehicles based on wind tunnel tests using an MSBS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X13478270">Figure 4</xref> presents the typical configuration of a PFE. The MSBS of the PFE levitates the MAV in the test section of the wind tunnel without mechanical support using magnetic forces and moments, and it eliminates airflow interferences. In addition, the magnetic forces and moments can be individually reduced or removed for each DOF. This characteristic enables separate analysis of the longitudinal or lateral flight characteristics of the MAV. When all magnetic forces and moments are removed, the MAV is instantaneously exposed to an emulated free flight environment. If the MAV states become unstable during the tests, the MSBS may provide support again to the MAV using the magnetic forces and moments in order to ensure the safety of the MAV.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is generally believed that the application of a learning algorithm in the design and implementation of a SCAS for a UAV is very difficult because it must be airborne in order to train the control system. However, this is simplified with the PFE because the safety of the MAV is guaranteed without support interferences. Under the PFE, the SCAS of the MAV can be tested for performance verification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X13478270">Figure 5</xref> presents one simple example of a design process for the SCAS under a PFE. While the magnetic forces and moments for the MAV levitation are being gradually reduced, the SCAS attempts to create stable states for the MAV. If the SCAS does not adapt sufficiently to maintain steady flight causing the MAV to become unstable, the MSBS of the PFE secures the vehicle and the same procedure will be repeated with a redesigned SCAS. Thus, a learning algorithm, which has been thought to be an essential characteristic of living things, can be applied in the redesign of the SCAS, so that the MAV can learn how to fly in a safe environment after the iterative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X13478270">Oh et al., 1988</xref>). This testing methodology is akin to the parental guidance when babies learn to walk.</p>

<title>Demonstration of a PFE with a fixed-wing MAV model</title>
<sec id="section8-1045389X13478270">
<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>The PFE was constructed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X13478270">Figure 6</xref>, and its usefulness was demonstrated with a fixed-wing MAV experimental model. The specifications of the MAV model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X13478270">Table 1</xref>. The wingspan of the model is 210 mm, and its length is 13 mm. The airfoil of the main wing is NACA0015, and the chord length is 100 mm. The outer shape of the fuselage is a modified LA5055 airfoil, which was enlarged by 20% in thickness in order to hold the essential electronics inside. The control surface is an elevator and is controlled through a 2.4-GHz wireless communication module (Zigbee, serial communication) that can be used to manipulate the height of the MAV model. It is verified through many tests that the Zigbee communications are not influenced by the magnetic fields in PFE. More detailed studies on the technical approaches to ensure the security and reliability of communication are needed. In this study, the MAV model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X13478270">Figure 7</xref>) was trying to maintain a constant altitude under the PFE. The altitude of the MAV model was measured using an external optical sensor, and the appropriate control command for the control surface was generated by a proportional–differential controller that was also implemented outside the MAV model. The calculated control command was transmitted via a wireless communication module, so that the MAV model could control its altitude without external constraint forces. Note that the model used in this work is not directly scalable to a flight model. However, we can prepare an experimental model for PFE that helps us to understand and control flight dynamics of a MAV.</p>

<title>Height hold control of the MAV model</title>
<p>Some important benefits of the PFE (i.e. the DOF adjustment and safety-guaranteed flight test) were demonstrated through the height hold experiment of the MAV model. A proportional–differential control scheme was applied to the height hold controller of the model, and the controller was designed and implemented in advance with classical control theory based on the system matrix of the model. While the wind tunnel was turned on, the MAV model was levitated at the center of the test section of the PFE. The height hold controller was activated to hold the altitude of the MAV model. The heights and elevator deflection angles were monitored simultaneously. Afterward, the magnetic constraint force for the height direction was gradually relaxed while the other magnetic constraint forces and moments were maintained and the MAV model attempted to hold the altitude by itself.</p>
<p>The gain values of the height hold controller were tuned several times for higher performance, and the magnetic constraint force for the height direction was activated when the height of the model diverged. After this iterative process, the design of the height hold controller was completed and the MAV model could hold its altitude without magnetic constraint force. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X13478270">Figure 8</xref> shows the height and elevator control command of the MAV model during the height hold experiment. In Phase A, the height of the MAV model was fixed by the magnetic constraint force. The MAV model started to hold its altitude independently in Phase B, and the magnetic constraint force for the height direction was removed in Phase C. A doublet test was performed, and the MAV model followed the input command well even though there was an observed offset that is thought to originate from the arbitrarily chosen reference pitch angle.</p>

<p>The disturbance rejection ability of the MAV model was also demonstrated. The magnetic force for the height direction, which was supposed to be used to hold the altitude of the MAV model, was used to excite the model in the height direction and the excitation force for the height direction was 0.23 sin (2π · 3 · <italic>t</italic>) N. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X13478270">Figure 9</xref> shows the height and elevator control command during the disturbance rejection test.

The RMS value of the vibration level was reduced from 0.83 to 0.27 mm, and this result is shown clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X13478270">Figure 10</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite the increasing demand for MAVs, the use of MAVs remains limited due to their difficult controllability during flight. Furthermore, their small size usually makes MAVs sensitive to small disturbances. In order to make better use of MAVs, proper SCASs should be designed and implemented for their application. In this study, an effective environment for designing SCASs for MAVs is proposed. The proposed PFE is a flight test environment that emulates free flight tests for MAVs inside a wind tunnel with an MSBS. By making full use of the advantages of the MSBS as a contactless balance and actuator, the DOFs of a MAV can be individually adjusted or removed. Therefore, the longitudinal and lateral flight characteristics can be decoupled and analyzed separately. Many important dynamic characteristics under free flight tests can be obtained from the tests under PFEs. Because the safety of the MAV is guaranteed under the PFE, a learning algorithm can be applied to design, implementation, and evaluation of the SCASs for MAVs. The proposed idea of the PFE was implemented, and the performance of the height hold controller of an MAV model was verified under the PFE while the magnetic force in the vertical direction was released. The controller successfully maintained the height of the MAV model without other constraint forces and rejected external disturbances. In this study, the height hold controller was designed previously and the gain values of the controller were manually tuned through an iterative process under the PFE. In the next study, this manual process will be replaced by a learning algorithm, so that the MAV can learn how to fly as babies learn how to walk.</p>
