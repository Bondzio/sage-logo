<p>At this critical juncture in national debates over wealth and inequality in the United States, <italic>Shortchanged</italic> brings a focus on women and wealth as a welcome addition to our sociological analysis. Mariko Lin Chang poses the question of why we should study gender differences in wealth, when so many publicly assume that women and men privately share wealth equally within family and marriage structures. She answers by unpacking these assumptions with a mixed methods analysis and the goal of providing clear pathways for policy changes. The discipline has long ignored the role of women and wealth <italic>per se</italic>—except to remark upon its glaring absence for vulnerable populations of poor women. Unlike the past focus on male wealth and power, she connects gendered structures of wealth-building and wealth outcomes against the backdrop of extreme wealth inequality in the United States.</p>
<p>Chang first constructs wealth ratios in contrast to standard income ratios using a national sample of women and men, illustrating her theoretical and empirical arguments for moving beyond income inequality analyses. Using data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances collected by the National Opinion Research Center gives her the advantage of oversampling high income households. Wealth ratios better demarcate the safety net that wealth brings; and she links these to indicators of improved stability for men against job loss, health crises, and the financial consequences of divorce. While computing and analyzing the gender gap in wealth ratios, she also provides provocative discussions of our public markers of wealth such as the <italic>Forbes</italic> list of top wealth holders that genders the annual listing by marital status.</p>
<p>Her mix of quantitative analyses in each chapter is accessible to a wide range of readers and effectively identifies what we gain from this new knowledge of wealth gaps. Chang distinguishes different types of wealth held by women and men and how these differences place women on a “financial fault line” (p. 35). She concludes that policy reliance on the ongoing income gap misrepresents women’s actual economic situation and has “painted a much rosier picture of how women are faring financially” (p. 34).</p>
<p>Chang weaves in-depth interview materials with women and men across the wealth and poverty landscape to identify what it means everyday to be “wealth poor.” In separate chapters, she assesses how the wealth poverty of single women creates additional vulnerability for themselves and their children beyond the low incomes they earn or inadequate government subsidies they garner. Deftly she identifies how this wealth poverty also reduces their ability to take risks in business or education investments in comparison to single men.</p>
<p>Her wealth model generates a framework for two of Chang’s key concepts: the wealth escalator and the debt anchor. While not new, the conceptual image of an economic escalator maps how male advantages in wealth accumulation are connected to the types of jobs and industries in which men work, and the fringe benefits derived. The wealth escalator rides on the backs of gendered employee benefit packages, tax codes that privilege male-dominated forms of wealth over others, and government benefits that create a bottom tier of “needs tested” resources that disproportionately target women.</p>
<p>Chang details how benefit packages are tilted toward rewards for full-time employees in management and professional sectors and away from part-time employees and those in service and retail sales, where women and minority workers are disproportionately concentrated. Defined benefit plans (retirement, flexible health spending plans, etc.) are accessed and calculated on the basis of uninterrupted job sequences, seniority and full-time employment. These preferred public and private business policies generate the processes by which men’s earnings translate into wealth more effectively, and create distinctive barriers that exacerbate the income penalties we find associated with motherhood.</p>
<p>The debt anchor is the “counterforce” to wealth, especially when situated outside the more constructive forms of mortgage debt and school loans. Chang details the types of debt women most often hold (credit card and installment debt), especially as single women/mothers. Notable to current housing policies, she distinguishes the quantitative gender gap in sub-prime loans. These loans are unequally distributed by race/ethnicity and gender, reinforcing vulnerability for African American women and Latinas who are 256 percent and 177 percent more likely to have sub-prime loans than white men (p.53). Even among borrowers with the highest incomes, women are 50 percent more likely to receive subprime loans than men.</p>
<p>Chang develops an important segment on family and wealth to challenge current analyses of gender inequality, marriage, and the reinforcement of economic dependency. Her emphasis on wealth provides new ways of understanding single parenthood and the drag anchor of debt. She extends our understanding of the motherhood wage penalty to identify processes by which mothers are “thrown off” the wealth escalator systematically by policy and labor market structures. It is here that she most effectively uses her in-depth interviews to understand the balancing of family and wealth-earning roles in upper-income and lower-income families. She pinpoints how women in their household roles first assist men in riding the wealth escalator. Chang then illustrates the caregiving tasks within the family that throw women off the wealth escalator and generate lifelong debt anchors. Not quite as effectively, Chang reminds us that racial wealth gaps are magnified for women from most racial/ethnic minority groups, not only within families, but also within labor markets. These reminders are scattered among her systematic analyses and provide important launching points for further research in the field.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Chang argues that we should focus on “what can be done about it.” Her analyses illustrate clear blueprints for those working with the Occupy America movements seeking legislative or employment changes: which tax codes, employment benefits, and family laws to address first when considering gendered and racialized wealth inequalities. This monograph provides an excellent supplement for upper division courses or graduate seminars on sex and gender stratification, and will generate new opportunities for meaningful research into structured inequalities.</p>
