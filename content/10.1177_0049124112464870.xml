Interactions among variables imply clusters of cases within which statistical effects differ.

We explicate a four-step procedure that discovers interaction effects based on clusters of cases in the data matrix, hence aiding in inductive model specification. We illustrate with two examples. One is a reanalysis of data from a published study of the effect of social welfare policy extensiveness on poverty rates across 15 countries. The second uses General Social Survey data to predict four different dimensions of ego-network homophily. We find support for our contention that clusters of the rows of a data matrix may be exploited to discover statistical interactions among variables that improve model fit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>duality</kwd><kwd>interaction identification</kwd><kwd>profile similarity</kwd><kwd>statistical interactions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0049124112464870"><title>Introduction</title><p>We contend that clusters of cases co-constitute statistical interactions among variables. Conventional quantitative analysis in sociology presumes that the rows of a data matrix are related to an outcome by a series of estimated coefficients. Beyond this boilerplate of modeling, we argue that the relations among the cases co-constitute the relations among the variables, creating a duality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049124112464870">Breiger 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049124112464870">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0049124112464870">Martin 2006</xref>) between clusters of cases and statistical interactions among variables. Interactions among variables may be productively understood as clusters of cases such that each cluster exhibits distinctive statistical effects.</p><p>We demonstrate the duality of clusters and interactions by a four-step inductive process to discover and describe statistical interactions. First, we perform a cluster analysis on the rows (cases) of a data matrix. Second, after we identify a parsimonious cluster-analytic solution, we adjoin cluster identification, as a series of dummy variables, to a regression model that includes the original covariates. Third, provided that cluster identification is significant, we identify the relevant interaction effect, or other nonlinearity, by means of a novel technique for examining each cluster’s contribution to the estimated regression coefficients. Finally, we include any interaction effects discovered by the above process by adding corresponding terms in the regression model. If cluster identification is significant, net of the original covariates, then there is a nonlinearity in the data since the clusters are based on the original covariates and their effects are controlled as linear additive effects in the model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0049124112464870">1</xref></sup> To the extent that the nonlinearity is a statistical interaction, then the clusters of cases and the statistical interactions are detecting the same pattern in the data.</p><p>To illustrate how clusters of cases and statistical interactions create a duality, we work through two examples in some detail. The first comes from a series of published regression models on the relationship between post-tax poverty rates and various country-level covariates for 15 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049124112464870">Kenworthy 1999</xref>).

In an influential publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049124112464870">Kenworthy (1999</xref>) uses data from 15 countries to study poverty rates in absolute terms (<italic>absolute</italic> referring to the proportion of people in a nation with incomes below a specified level that is held constant across countries). The predictor variables are social welfare policy extensiveness, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and each country’s poverty rate prior to the application of taxation and income-transfer policies. Kenworthy uses three indicators of social welfare policy extensiveness (government transfers, decommodification, and the social wage)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0049124112464870">7</xref></sup> in three different OLS regression models. We use these same three regression models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049124112464870">Kenworthy 1999</xref>:1131, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0049124112464870">table 4</xref>) as our first set of examples to illustrate the duality of clusters and statistical interactions.</p><p>We computed the SVD of each of the three matrices of independent variables (one for each of the three regression models Kenworthy estimated).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0049124112464870">Figure 1</xref>, a four-cluster solution appears to yield a reasonable trade-off between model fit (i.e., smaller sums of squares) and parsimony (fewer clusters). In fact, a four-cluster solution was discovered for each of the first two matrices and a three-cluster solution was discovered for the third. Next, we included cluster identification in Kenworthy’s original regression models in a step-wise approach including one dummy variable at a time. This procedure compares each cluster to all of the others and uses fewer degrees of freedom than including all but one dummy variable.

Notice that these values sum to the estimated standardized regression coefficient (−.182) that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049124112464870">Kenworthy (1999</xref>) reports.

Specifically, notice that in cluster 1 the effects of pretax poverty and government transfers are largely differentiated. Then in clusters 2 and 3, they become similar in their effects on posttax poverty rates. Finally, in cluster 4, the effects become differentiated again.

For each of up to five alters, respondents were asked several questions about these alters. They were asked about the age, education, race, and sex of their discussion partners, among other things. Based on this information, we generated four homophily variables that measure how homophilous the respondents’ ego networks are on age, education, race, and sex. Homophily refers to the principle that a “contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0049124112464870">McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001</xref>:416). The race and sex homophily variables represent the proportion of the respondent’s ego-network that is of the same race and sex as the respondent. The education of alters was measured on a five category ordinal scale. We coded the respondent and his or her alters as being homophilous if the respondent’s educational attainment, in years, was in the alter’s category or in one of the adjacent categories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0049124112464870">10</xref></sup> The final variable is a continuous measure of ego-network age homophily. The ages of alters were measured continuously. For each respondent/alter pair, we coded them as a “1” if they were the same age or separated by only one year. If they were separated by more than one year, then we inverted the absolute distance between them so that as they became more separated on age (i.e., less homophilous), the value assigned to them approached zero. To be consistent with our other measures of homophily, we scaled this variable to have a range from zero to one. In this way, we illustrate the relevance for improved model fit of our method for discovering interactions on the basis of the clustering of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0049124112464870">11</xref></sup></p><p>As described above, we have one matrix of independent variables with 596 cases exhibiting no missing data and four dependent variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0049124112464870">12</xref></sup> This enables us to illustrate our procedure on four different models, except that here, unlike with the Kenworthy data, the independent variable matrix is the same across our models. The first step in our procedure is to cluster on the cases. We computed the SVD of the <bold>X</bold> matrix, plus a constant term, and clustered on the corresponding orthogonalized row-space matrix, <bold>U</bold>. We computed nine cluster analyses corresponding to 2 through 10 clusters, computed the sums of squared errors, and plotted the sums of squares by the number of clusters. Once again, a four-cluster solution yielded a reasonable trade-off between parsimony and model fit. We included cluster identification as a series of three dummy variables with the original nine covariates. The results of these regression models are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0049124112464870">Table 4</xref>. The results of the regressions suggest that cluster membership is highly significant for age and race and that one of the contrasts in the sex homophily model is significant. There is no cluster effect for the education homophily model.</p><p>Our next step is to identify the relevant nonlinearity. We computed each cluster’s contribution to the estimated regression coefficients as above. The results for the race homophily model are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0049124112464870">Table 5</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0049124112464870">13</xref></sup> Notice again that each regression coefficient is a sum across clusters. Aside from the constant term, most of the variability in the clusters’ contributions to the coefficients occurs with race and sex. As it happens, the <italic>k</italic>-means clustering procedure produced a cluster of all women (cluster 2) and a cluster of all men (cluster 3). Because there is no variability on sex in these clusters, the actual effects only play out in the constant term. The effects of race do vary by cluster in a meaningful way, however. The next largest coefficient for this model is for income, and the effects of income vary by cluster. All of the other variables have relatively small effects that are stable across the clusters. Based on this information, we conclude that the relevant nonlinearity is a race by income interaction effect.</p><table-wrap id="table4-0049124112464870" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Summary of Regression Models Predicting Four Dimensions of Homophily.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table4-0049124112464870" xlink:href="10.1177_0049124112464870-table4.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th>Age</th><th>Education</th><th>Race</th><th>Sex</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cluster #1 </td><td>.27<sup>*</sup> (.13)</td><td>−.11 (.19)</td><td>.32<sup>*</sup> (.14)</td><td>.20 (.15)</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster #2 </td><td>.33<sup>**</sup> (.11)</td><td>−.03 (.16)</td><td>.25<sup>*</sup> (.12)</td><td>.22 (.12)</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster #3 </td><td>.28<sup>*</sup> (.11)</td><td>.06 (.17)</td><td>.35<sup>**</sup> (.12)</td><td>.32<sup>*</sup> (.15)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant </td><td>.20 (.13)</td><td>.52<sup>**</sup> (.19)</td><td>.64<sup>***</sup> (.14)</td><td>.34<sup>*</sup> (.15)</td></tr><tr><td>Age </td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.01 (.01)</td></tr><tr><td>Age<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0049124112464870">2</xref></sup></td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.00 (.00)</td></tr><tr><td>White = 1 </td><td>−.28<sup>**</sup> (.10)</td><td>−.01 (.15)</td><td>−.22 (.11)</td><td>−.31<sup>**</sup> (.12)</td></tr><tr><td>Education </td><td>.01<sup>***</sup> (.00)</td><td>.03<sup>***</sup> (.01)</td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.01 (.01)</td></tr><tr><td>Male = 1 </td><td>.03 (.05)</td><td>−.11 (.07)</td><td>−.08 (.05)</td><td>−.13<sup>*</sup> (.05)</td></tr><tr><td>Income </td><td>.00 (.01)</td><td>−.01 (.01)</td><td>.02 (.01)</td><td>.01 (.01)</td></tr><tr><td>Size of place </td><td>.00 (.00)</td><td>.00 (.01)</td><td>−.01 (.01)</td><td>.01 (.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Married = 1 </td><td>.05 (.02)</td><td>.00 (.03)</td><td>.00 (.02)</td><td>−.11<sup>***</sup> (.02)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of children </td><td>−.01 (.01)</td><td>.00 (.01)</td><td>.00 (.01)</td><td>.01 (.01)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>R</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0049124112464870">2</xref></sup></td><td>.11</td><td>.04</td><td>.04</td><td>.06</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn7-0049124112464870"><p><italic>Note: </italic>Coefficients and (standard errors) reported.</p></fn><fn id="table-fn8-0049124112464870"><p>All models have 596 cases.</p></fn><fn id="table-fn9-0049124112464870"><p>*<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. **<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table5-0049124112464870" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Each Cluster’s Contribution to the Estimated Coefficients for the Race Homophily Model.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table5-0049124112464870" xlink:href="10.1177_0049124112464870-table5.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th>Cluster 1 </th><th>Cluster 2 </th><th>Cluster 3 </th><th>Cluster 4 </th><th>Estimated βs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Constant </td><td>.58</td><td>−.31</td><td>−.32</td><td>.79</td><td>.740</td></tr><tr><td>Age </td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>−.01</td><td>.01</td><td>.000</td></tr><tr><td>Age<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0049124112464870">2</xref></sup> </td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>.000</td></tr><tr><td>White = 1 </td><td>−.76</td><td>.52</td><td>.27</td><td>.02</td><td>.047</td></tr><tr><td>Education </td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>.002</td></tr><tr><td>Male = 1 </td><td>−.01</td><td>−.76</td><td>.78</td><td>.00</td><td>.002</td></tr><tr><td>Income </td><td>.02</td><td>.05</td><td>.02</td><td>−.09</td><td>.008</td></tr><tr><td>Size </td><td>.00</td><td>.00</td><td>−.01</td><td>.00</td><td>−.005</td></tr><tr><td>Married = 1 </td><td>−.03</td><td>.03</td><td>−.01</td><td>.02</td><td>.007</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>.01</td><td>−.01</td><td>.00</td><td>−.01</td><td>−.005</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn10-0049124112464870"><p><italic>Note</italic>: In the table above, we are decomposing each coefficient by cluster.

As demonstrated through the two examples above, this approach allows for the identification of interaction effects that may not otherwise be indicated by theory or extant substantive knowledge. Among the most direct benefits of this approach is its potential application to data sets that might lack the statistical power necessary for other methods of inductive model specification, such as stepwise deletion procedures. Leveraging the duality outlined in this article might allow analysts to unearth meaningful interactions, particularly in instances where data are limited or available samples are small.</p><p>What is more, if interactions between more than two variables are anticipated or desired, then we suggest using our procedure to identify a two-way interaction effect, and then reestimating the procedure including the interaction term with the original covariates. If the effect of the interaction varies with another variable in the model, as indicated by step 3 of our procedure, then this is suggestive of a three-way interaction effect. There is no reason to believe that higher order interactions could not be discerned in a similar manner using our procedure.</p><p>A related point has to do with computing multiple tests of significance. When several statistical tests are estimated, best practice suggests that a correction is required to obtain appropriate <italic>p</italic> values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049124112464870">Neter et al. 1996</xref>:725-38). Step-wise interaction detection procedures, for example, might estimate every two-way interaction effect, and each one increases the likelihood of making a Type I error. Our procedure, on the other hand, eliminates the need to estimate several interaction effects, which thereby reduces the likelihood of a Type I error in a principled way. This is because the clusters are based on the row space of the <bold>X</bold> matrix, not the <bold>X</bold> matrix <italic>with respect to </italic><bold>y </bold>(as in a step-wise procedure).</p><p>While the examples used to illustrate our technique draw on areas of study that enjoy well-established bases of cumulative theoretical and substantive knowledge, there are many areas of interest to both social scientists and policy makers that have not been subject to such extensive development. These areas range from the short-term effects of new domestic policies to insurgencies or rare events such as the housing market crash and the global recession. Particularly for those areas that require new theoretical and substantive development, the ability to improve the efficiency of inductive model specification could in many cases be quite important.</p><p>Looking at the other side of this coin, the approach introduced here allows for more rigorous theory testing through an efficient interrogation of scope conditions, or conditions that must hold for the theory to be applicable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0049124112464870">Walker and Cohen 1985</xref>). Analysts may erroneously conclude that the empirical evidence supports a social theory when in reality the relationship is only present in some of the cases. This is particularly relevant in light of the relative ease with which social scientists can obtain large databases that yield small standard errors. If net effects are found to vary by cluster, as in our second example, the theoretical inference is not as strong as when one only considers a single main effect term. Usual research practice is (in effect) to consider the entire data set comprising of a single cluster. This practice results in model misspecification whenever clustering of cases implies additional interactions among variables. The ideas developed in this article can be extended to more complex models, and we have considered them in the context of logistic regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0049124112464870">Melamed et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>Related to the above issue of identifying scope conditions, examining the aggregate effects of regression coefficients within clusters of cases is a desirable practice for evaluating the robustness of theoretical claims. If net effects of predictors on an outcome variable are consistent across the identified clusters, then that is a more rigorous validation of a theory than merely showing that a single main effect is significant for the full data file. That is, our procedure can help answer the following question: Is the proposed theoretical process robust across all of the points in the sample space? This question is different than the traditional quantitative approach of identifying an average effect that applies to the entirety of the sample space.</p><p>Coupled with the ability to more rigorously test theory and identify scope conditions, our clustering procedure allows us to examine the combinatorial effects of causal factors. Approaches to configurational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0049124112464870">Rihoux and Ragin 2008</xref>)—as exemplified by Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049124112464870">Byrne and Ragin 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0049124112464870">Ragin 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0049124112464870">Schaefer 2010</xref> for the case of homophily studies)—demonstrate how multiple conjunctions of causal conditions can lead to a given outcome. One of the great benefits of QCA is the presumption of multifinality, which is the idea that a single factor might have different effects depending on what it is combined with. Conceptually, this is very similar to the idea of an interaction term. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049124112464870">Grofman and Schneider (2009</xref>) note that, while drawing comparisons between the causal configurations produced by QCA and statistical interactions may seem appropriate, a fundamental difference between the two lies in the fact that configurational analysis aims to find the best fit for the greatest number of cases, whereas interactions are calculated using net effects. We assert that the approach outlined in this article helps bridge the gap between these two approaches, evaluating the presence of interactions by retaining the comparative element across clusters (which in turn retains the goal of finding the best fit for a subset of cases) while simultaneously allowing for the improvement of the net effects model.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated how clusters of cases co-constitute statistical interactions by outlining a method wherein clusters derived from the row space matrix of the SVD of a data matrix are used to reveal the presence of interactions within a linear regression model. We provided the theoretical and methodological background to the approach and subsequently applied it in two examples. In each case, the clusters indicate significant interactions. This, we argue, supports the claim of co-constitution and, in turn, the duality of clusters and statistical interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Elisa Bienenstock, Patrick Doreian, Scott Eliason, Lane Kenworthy, James Moody, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn14-0049124112464870"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn15-0049124112464870"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Defense Threat Reduction Agency basic research award HDTRA1-10-1-0017 to the University of Arizona (Ronald L.
