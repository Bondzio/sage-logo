<sec id="section1-0004867412470010">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The relapse rate after a first episode of schizophrenia is high, often due to non-adherence with medication. Long-acting injections of antipsychotics (LAI) are used to promote adherence to medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0004867412470010">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To review the literature on the use of LAIs in first-episode and early schizophrenia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0004867412470010">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>A systematic electronic search of all original data containing peer-reviewed studies published in English using EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane and PsychINFO from the onset of records. Reference lists from retrieved articles were examined for further relevant studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0004867412470010">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Ten studies were identified: two cohort studies; three randomised controlled trials; and five open studies. These studies, although limited, demonstrated the effectiveness of LAI in early schizophrenia. Seven of the 10 studies had risperidone long-acting injection as the only LAI.</p>

<sec id="section5-0004867412470010">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>LAIs may be useful in the treatment of early schizophrenia in terms of symptom control and relapse reduction, particularly if chosen by the patient or when medication adherence is a priority. There is a need for a large-scale, randomised controlled trial comparing oral and LAI antipsychotics to assess long-term outcomes.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Long-acting injections (LAIs) of antipsychotics, also known as depots, are specifically designed to improve adherence to medication in people who can acknowledge that they are forgetful or who do not accept the need for ongoing treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004867412470010">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004867412470010">Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004867412470010">Keith et al., 2004</xref>). Recent guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004867412470010">Kane and Garcia-Ribera, 2009</xref>; National Institute of Clinical Excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004867412470010">NICE), 2009</xref>) advocate the use of LAIs as maintenance treatment when adherence to oral antipsychotics has been problematic. Adherence has been defined as the extent to which a patients’ behaviour (including taking medications, following a diet, modifying habits and attending follow-ups) coincides with the medical and health advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004867412470010">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004867412470010">Mackay et al., 2011</xref>). Studies have shown non-adherence rates to oral medication in schizophrenia to be as high as 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004867412470010">Glazer, 2007</xref>) but LAIs are only prescribed in a small proportion of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004867412470010">Kane and Garcia-Ribera, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Use of LAIs in the early stages of schizophrenia is controversial. There is evidence to show that non-adherence and partial adherence are most problematic during the earliest stages of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004867412470010">Coldham et al., 2002</xref>), culminating in high relapse rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004867412470010">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>), self-harm and incomplete or unsustainable remission of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004867412470010">Andreasen et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, suicide occurs in 5% of individuals with schizophrenia, with young age and positive symptoms being identified as specific risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004867412470010">Hor and Taylor, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412470010">Birchwood et al. (1998)</xref> proposed the ‘critical period’ hypothesis, which considers the early phase of psychosis to be the period in which both the long-term outcome is affected and the biological and psychosocial influences show maximum plasticity.</p>
<p>LAIs are known to be safe and efficacious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004867412470010">Haddad et al., 2009</xref>) and LAI or depot formulations have been associated with a 50–65% reduced rehospitalisation rate compared to the identical medication in oral form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004867412470010">Tiihonen et al., 2011</xref>). Presumably, concerns regarding individual autonomy, perceived coercion, and patient choice limit the use of LAIs in first-episode schizophrenia, although there is a credible scientific rationale for early LAI use in terms of secondary prevention, avoiding relapse and sustaining remission, as well as arguably reducing suicide. Here we debate the use of LAIs in early schizophrenia after systematically reviewing their safety and efficacy in this population.</p>

<sec id="section8-0004867412470010">
<title>Search strategy and eligible studies</title>
<p>A comprehensive electronic search of published peer-reviewed articles was performed using databases including EMBASE, Cochrane, PsychINFO and MEDLINE to identify relevant studies, from the onset of records. The subject headings consisted of:</p>
<p>(a) “long acting injection” or “depot” or “long acting antipsychotic”, and</p>
<p>(b) “psychosis” or “schizophrenia” or “schizoaffective”, and</p>
<p>(c) “first episode” or “early” or “acute”.</p>
<p>The abstracts of the articles found in the search were reviewed and studies were shortlisted if they: were published in English; were case–control, cohort or follow-up studies; had a patient diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychosis or schizoaffective disorder; had subjects who were first episode or were in the early stages of their disease; were being treated with an LAI form of antipsychotics.</p>
<p>Retrieved article reference lists were examined for further relevant studies.</p>

<title>Data extraction</title>
<p>A total of 400 published peer-reviewed articles were identified by the search strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004867412470010">Figure 1</xref>). However, 379 papers did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 21 papers were retrieved for further detailed assessment. Studies were not included if they did not address the objectives of this study, or did not include any outcome measures assessing the safety or efficacy of LAIs. A total of 10 articles were identified for more detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004867412470010">Table 1</xref>). Data relating to the efficacy and safety of the LAIs in early and acute schizophrenia were reviewed and summarised.</p>

<p>In the open-label study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al. (2008)</xref>, there was an improvement from the baseline to the end point on the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative and general psychopathology subscales. Of the 50 patients who completed the study taking risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI), 46 of the patients (92%) achieved ≥ 20% reduction in the PANSS total scores and 42 (84%) achieved ≥ 50% reduction in PANSS scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>). In another open-label study for RLAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004867412470010">Lasser et al., 2007</xref>), mean PANSS scores improved significantly from baseline, with 64% of patients showing clinical improvement (≥ 20% reduction in the PANSS score) at end point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412470010">Parellada et al.

<p>The early study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004867412470010">Kane et al.

Perphenazine, the only LAI included in this study, was associated with the lowest rate of rehospitalisation (0.32; 95% CI, 0.22–0.49).</p>
<p>A separate cohort study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004867412470010">Tiihonen et al.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>LAIs were developed in the 1960s to specifically address the problem of poor adherence in the maintenance treatment of psychosis. Poor adherence remains one if not the major challenge in chronic disease management. The main advantages of LAIs over their oral counterparts are the ability to provide assured medication delivery; the beneficial dose-averaging effect, which obviates any toxic diurnal peaks and troughs; and, importantly, their built-in therapeutic contact with health service staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004867412470010">Hogarty et al., 1979</xref>). Usually, the use of LAIs has been reserved for patients suspected to be poorly adherent, uncooperative, or those with refractory illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004867412470010">Kane and Garcia-Ribera, 2009</xref>). It is also worth observing that there are varying international patterns of LAI usage, with some government funded healthcare systems such as the UK and Scandinavia employing LAIs in ~30% of those with chronic schizophrenia, whereas differently funded systems such as the US appear to have a lower LAI usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004867412470010">Patel et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals in the early stages of their disease may be ideal candidates for treatment with an antipsychotic LAI. In psychosis, the initial treatment period represents a critical window which might determine the disease trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412470010">Birchwood et al., 1998</xref>). These individuals are sensitive to medication side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412470010">Weiden et al., 2009</xref>) and often have limited insight or acceptance of their illness, which in turn contributes to the poor adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004867412470010">Coldham et al., 2002</xref>), high treatment discontinuation rates and relapse rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004867412470010">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>). Also, many individuals in the early stages of the disease pathway do not accept the gravity of their illness, and there can be a false sense of treatment being unnecessary or an unwanted imposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004867412470010">Kane and Garcia-Ribera, 2009</xref>). Balanced against this, is the recognition that 20% of individuals who suffer a psychotic episode will never relapse. Additionally, many clinicians may have the preconceived view that patients are unwilling to accept injections in the early stages of their disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004867412470010">Heres et al., 2011</xref>). This presumption of rejection could be viewed as physician prejudice, in an era when fully informed patient choice is advocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004867412470010">Samele et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In our literature search, we identified over 400 articles and yielded only 10 that satisfied our study question: researching the outcome of LAIs in early stages of schizophrenia. Not all studies identified were RCTs. Therefore, it was appropriate to perform a systematic review and not a meta-analysis. We reviewed five studies that included first-episode schizophrenic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004867412470010">Bartzokis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004867412470010">Kane et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004867412470010">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412470010">Weiden et al., 2009</xref>), three studies that included patients with early schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004867412470010">Lasser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412470010">Napryeyenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412470010">Parellada et al., 2005</xref>), and two studies that included patients hospitalised for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004867412470010">Tiihonen et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004867412470010">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of RLAI improved symptom reduction in five initiation studies for first-episode cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004867412470010">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004867412470010">Lasser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412470010">Napryeyenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412470010">Weiden et al., 2009</xref>), perhaps unsurprisingly. In patients receiving a treatment switch to RLAI in the early stages of schizophrenia, 40% of patients had at least a 20% reduction in their PANSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412470010">Parellada et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al.’s (2008)</xref> preliminary study examining the efficacy and safety of directly initiated RLAI in 50 patients with first-episode psychosis, showed that remission was achieved in almost two-thirds of the patients and relapse rates were low, which is comparable with the results achieved in the RLAI treatment of subjects with chronic schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004867412470010">Parellada, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004867412470010">Kim et al.’s (2008)</xref> RCT showed that adherence to medication was higher and relapse rates lower in patients treated with RLAI compared to oral RisO. The improvement in symptom profile supports the efficacy of RLAI in early schizophrenia, and the results are comparable with those obtained in a study of over 1800 patients with schizophrenia or other psychoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004867412470010">Moller et al., 2005</xref>). However, studies of RLAI in non-first-episode (i.e. chronic unstable) cases have not suggested a superiority of RLAI over oral antipsychotic medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004867412470010">Keks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004867412470010">Rosenheck et al., 2011</xref>), and there is retrospective data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004867412470010">Shajahan et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that RLAI may not be as effective as another LAI, zuclopenthixol decanoate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004867412470010">Bartzokis et al.’s (2011)</xref> study showed that there was a significant differential in WM volumes in patients treated with LAI and RisO. Frontal lobe WM volume, which was estimated using inversion recovery MRI images, deceased significantly in the RisO treatment group. They also showed that increased WM volumes were associated with faster reaction times in tasks involving frontal functioning. It is possible that RLAI favours the promotion and stabilisation of WM tracts in the frontal lobe. However, this study involved small sample sizes followed up for a short period. In addition, treatment before the study was not standardised and analysis was only performed at two time points.</p>
<p>Cohort studies in patients hospitalised for the first time with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder revealed that the LAI form of antipsychotics had one of the lowest rates for discontinuation and lowers the risk of rehospitalisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004867412470010">Tiihonen et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004867412470010">2011</xref>). Adherence with LAIs was shown to be significantly better than patients staying on oral medication (89% vs 59%) in one prospective RCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412470010">Weiden et al., 2009</xref>). These data support the feasibility and acceptability of introducing LAIs in early schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Tolerability of antipsychotics is a particular concern in first-episode cases. Movement disorders as an adverse effect were assessed in five studies we reviewed, using the ESRS. The mean maximum change in the ESRS was 1.4 in medication-naïve patients treated with RLAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>). In patients with early psychosis who were not treatment naïve, ESRS scores decreased from baseline to end point when treated with RLAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004867412470010">Lasser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412470010">Napryeyenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412470010">Parellada et al., 2005</xref>). Weight gain and resultant increases in BMI were, however, significant adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412470010">Napryeyenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412470010">Parellada et al., 2005</xref>). Considerable hyperprolactinaemia was also observed in first-episode cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>) and in cases diagnosed for less than 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412470010">Napryeyenko et al., 2010</xref>). Usually, medication-naïve individuals are acutely sensitive to antipsychotics in terms of responsiveness as well as side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004867412470010">Chatterjee et al., 1995</xref>) and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004867412470010">Strassnig et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is generally thought that LAIs have a more acceptable side-effect profile in comparison with their oral counterparts due to their differences in pharmacokinetics, and any concerns over debilitating side effects may be due to dosing errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004867412470010">Taylor, 2009</xref>). Peaks and troughs in drug concentrations can be minimised via the dose averaging of LAIs, reducing the risk of some adverse effects of these medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004867412470010">Taylor, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Public heath principles promote early prevention of morbidity and mortality. If LAIs are effective and feasible in early psychosis, many clinical advantages may ensue before a patient can ‘prove’ themselves to be non-adherent. Results from the limited number of studies available suggest that the use of LAI in early phases of the disease could result in effective delivery of antipsychotic medications, helping patients to achieve remission. However, the studies reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412470010">Emsley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004867412470010">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004867412470010">Lasser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412470010">Napryeyenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412470010">Parellada et al., 2005</xref>) have limitations including their open-label nature, the absence of a control group for comparison and the small sample sizes. The heterogeneous definitions of relapse and remission pose difficulties when comparing results of studies. These limitations prompt caution in interpreting the data on efficacy and safety. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412470010">Weiden et al.’s (2009)</xref> RCT showed that patients were more adherent to RLAI compared to oral antipsychotics, the study was small and the treatment given by clinicians was not blinded. In addition, outcomes were evaluated 12 weeks after RLAI treatment so long-term attitudes and behaviours on adherence cannot be deduced from this study. Of the 10 studies reviewed, seven investigated the effects of RLAI; therefore, conclusions drawn from this review cannot be generalised to reflect the safety and efficacy of all LAIs. There is a need for a long-term RCT comparing the effectiveness of oral and LAI antipsychotics in early psychosis and first-episode schizophrenia whilst also examining the safety and tolerability of these agents, once a consensus on the definition of early psychosis is established.</p>
<p>The use of LAIs is not without problems. LAIs require the burden of frequent travel to outpatient clinics or home visits by community nurses for their administration. LAIs are not ideal for people who dislike injections, and overt non-adherence to LAIs can occur, indicating the importance of shared decision-making when prescribing such medications. On surveying psychiatrists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004867412470010">Heres et al. (2011)</xref> found that the three main factors influencing their choice not to prescribe a LAI for first-episode psychosis were: (a) limited availability of different second-generation antipsychotic depot drugs; (b) the frequent rejection of the depot offer by patients; and (c) the patient’s skepticism based on an inexperience of relapse, demonstrating the importance a patient-centred approach when discussing LAI as a treatment option. The prescription of a LAI should also involve a collaborative psychosocial approach concentrating on the individual’s needs and involving the multidisciplinary team in order to optimise outcomes. This approach would be consistent with first-episode or early intervention services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004867412470010">Weiden et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
