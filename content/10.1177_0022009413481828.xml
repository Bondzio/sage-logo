<abstract>
<p>The Working People’s Cultural Palace (WPCP), formerly the Imperial Ancestral Temple, is a celebrated public park near Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing. A closer look at the park, which was created by the government in 1950 to provide recreational activities for the local residents, reveals that it was not primarily used as a conventional urban amenity but rather as an arena for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to launch political campaigns and stage propaganda exhibitions. The park, therefore, under the guise of a recreation area, was used to promote labor policies, international diplomacy and Party politics, thus extending the CCP’s control of people’s lives. Based on recently available archival sources and by comparing the CCP’s use of urban parks to how they were used in the former Soviet Union and in the United States, this article argues that the WPCP reflects the conflict between the state and society, resulting in the domination of the former over the latter and rapid loss of citizens’ private space in China.</p>

<p>The Working People’s Cultural Palace (Laodong renmin wenhuagong; hereafter, WPCP) is a celebrated city park – a ‘people’s park’ (<italic>renmin gongyuan</italic>), as it was commonly called in China<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009413481828">1</xref></sup> – as well as a major political landmark in China’s capital, Beijing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022009413481828">Figure 1</xref>). Located immediately east of Tiananmen Gate, the WPCP’s front wall is marked with a plaque that reads, ‘A key protected national cultural relic: The Imperial Ancestral Temple,’ as well as a sign proclaiming, ‘Beijing’s First-Rank Municipal Park.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009413481828">2</xref></sup> The fusion of the historic WPCP and a modern urban park in a single space, in May 1950, only months after the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949, typifies the political strategy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to turn a popular urban recreational space into a convenient site for political rallies and for promoting the state’s labor policies and international diplomacy. Using the evolution of the Working People’s Cultural Palace as a political park in the 1950s and 1960s, this article examines the Chinese Communist Party’s increasing use of urban parks – originally designated as cultural and entertainment centers for civilians’ enrichment – to advance its political goals. This appropriation of urban spaces created a conflict between the government’s use of parks for political purposes and the city dwellers’ private recreational needs. China was a tightly-controlled nation and the CCP exercised monopolistic control over people’s private space.

</p>
<p>The study of China’s public parks is an emerging field of scholarly inquiry. But scholarly works thus far have largely focused on pre-PRC parks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009413481828">3</xref></sup> Few have investigated the parks in the post-1949 era,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009413481828">4</xref></sup> and even fewer have examined their political nature and their role in the CCP’s overall political strategy. Based on newly available archival sources as well as a comparison of the CCP’s use of parks with the use of parks in the former Soviet Union and in the United States, in this article I argue that the WPCP, from the beginning, was created primarily to serve the Party’s specific interests. Chinese Communist leaders generally were suspicious of large, open spaces, especially popular recreational parks located in the capital, because they could be readily used by unauthorized groups who were critical of the authoritarian state to assemble in protest. Officials believed that such areas needed careful monitoring and control. At the same time, these were ideal locations for holding large-scale official functions. Very often therefore cultural and recreational activities in the parks were pushed aside in favor of government uses. At other times activities there were appropriated by the government in a way that blurred, and eventually erased, the line between the political world and private lives.</p>
<p>The Imperial Ancestral Temple (Taimiao) was built in 1420 in the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644) as a shrine where emperors offered sacrifices to their ancestors on special occasions. During the Ming and the ensuing Qing dynasty (1644–1911), for example, emperors performed sacrificial rituals to their forebears on New Year’s Eve and on the occasion of the Qingming Festival.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009413481828">5</xref></sup> A rectangular-shaped building complex occupying an area of 197,000 square meters, the temple is surrounded by ancient cypresses and comprises three grand halls. The front hall, which is the main hall (known as Xiangdian), is the largest of the three and is where grand sacrifices took place; the middle hall (Qindian) held the memorial tablets of the immediate ancestors; and the rear hall (Tiaodian) housed distant ancestors’ tablets. During the sacrifices, considered one of the most sacred of all imperial rituals, the ancestral tablets from the middle and rear halls would be assembled in the main hall. They would be restored to their original locations at the conclusion of the ceremony.</p>
<p>In 1950, soon after the founding of the PRC, the central government renamed the Imperial Ancestral Temple the ‘Working People’s Cultural Palace’, and placed it under the supervision of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions (Beijingshi zonggonghui; hereafter, BFTU). The renaming, according to the government, was to enhance the ‘cultural and recreational activities of Beijing’s workers.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009413481828">6</xref></sup> Chairman Mao Zedong (1893–1976) honored the re-christened building with his calligraphy. The name change was significant in that it symbolized the end of what the Communists called the lengthy feudal era ruled by despotic emperors and oppressive lords, and it also brought to the fore the role of the ‘working people’ in new socialist China. The act reaffirmed the government’s pronouncement, in the Common Program in 1949 and in the subsequent First Constitution of 1954, that the new PRC was a socialist state led by ‘the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009413481828">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the occasion of the rededication ceremony, held appropriately on the Labor Day in 1950, labor leaders assembled to announce a new chapter in the history of Chinese workers. As reported in the official <italic>Enlightenment Daily</italic> (<italic>Guangming ribao</italic>): ‘With red flags fluttering and giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin hanging on two sides of the front hall, this was a special day of jubilation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009413481828">8</xref></sup> The vice chairman of the BFTU Xiao Ming (1896–1959) proudly declared:<disp-quote>
<p>This centuries-old temple, originally built by workers’ blood and sweat, was always forcibly occupied by reactionary rulers. Not until the liberation of Beijing and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao was the temple finally returned to the laboring people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009413481828">9</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>From the beginning the WPCP was hailed by the official press as a ‘paradise of the working people in the capital.’ It represented an ideal location for the recreational activities of the common folk and fulfilled a promise that socialism would bring abundance to the people, including a richer cultural life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009413481828">10</xref></sup> But who were the ‘working people’? In the early People’s Republic, the term ‘working people’ had three somewhat different but interrelated meanings. First, it referred specifically to the traditional Marxist designation of ‘the proletariat.’ In public discourse it seemed natural for the Chinese Communists to accord the leading role of the revolution to the proletariat, for this agreed with conventional Marxist ideology. Second, the term embraced both industrial workers and peasants, in keeping with the spirit of the 1949 Common Program and the 1954 Constitution. And finally, in an even broader sense, ‘working people’ meant anyone who performed manual labor. The last definition is the one that officials often meant when they spoke of the WPCP as a place for Beijing’s working people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009413481828">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>To give the WPCP a new look, the BFTU staff converted the temple’s main hall into a grand auditorium, fully remodeled for holding major gatherings. The rear hall was turned into a library, containing popular books and magazines that catered to the general public. Adjacent halls in the compound were refashioned into newspaper reading rooms, entertainment rooms, a drama theater and music rooms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009413481828">12</xref></sup> Special chambers were also created to hold classes for workers, teaching technical skills such as electrician training classes, promoting ‘advanced production experience.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009413481828">13</xref></sup> A socialist worker was supposed to know the rules governing Chinese workplaces, and also be technically competent and informed about domestic issues and international affairs. Occasionally, science exhibitions were also featured in the main hall. A film division was created in 1953 to promote this favorite pastime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009413481828">14</xref></sup> In the same year an outdoor dance floor, said to be ‘the biggest in the city’ by the official <italic>People’s Daily</italic>, was constructed inside the compound.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009413481828">15</xref></sup> The WPCP, according to the BFTU officials, was geared ‘to the needs of grass-roots units and the masses.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009413481828">16</xref></sup> Various leisure activities for common people were promoted through classes: reading, dancing, playing music and vocational skills training. The popular Mid-Autumn Festival was also celebrated here, with citizens gathering to enjoy moon cakes and delicious fruit as well as engage in moon-gazing. ‘These festive activities had never occurred [in a place like this] before the Liberation,’ one parkgoer gleefully said.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009413481828">17</xref></sup> In a very short time the former Imperial Ancestral Temple had seemingly been completely transformed into a place truly belonging to the people. The new park provided a relaxed setting where people could interact with one another in an open and pleasant atmosphere away from their generally noisy, crowded urban environment.</p>
<p>Of course, the WPCP was not the only cultural palace in Beijing. By the early 1960s the capital witnessed more than 1300 cultural palaces and workers’ clubs, both large and small.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009413481828">18</xref></sup> The idea spread to other parts of China, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Chongqing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009413481828">19</xref></sup> Among the new facilities was Shanghai’s Working People’s Cultural Palace, a vast complex of more than 10,000 square meters in the eastern part of the city, where major industries were concentrated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009413481828">20</xref></sup> Other workers’ clubs were set up in different parts of Shanghai, for example, in the old Jing’an district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009413481828">21</xref></sup> Chongqing, in Sichuan province, was especially known for its multiple facilities, including a library, a football field, and a skating rink.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009413481828">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>But were the WPCP and similar sites truly geared ‘to the needs of grass-roots units and the masses,’ as the government claimed? A closer look reveals a more complicated story. In fact, the WPCP was never simply a recreational area but was actually more of a political park designed by the Party to conduct diverse state activities for the advancement of socialist policies. Its location at the heart of the capital made it even more subject to political uses than other similar parks in China. The complexity and real nature of the WPCP can be discerned through a number of channels: the Soviet influence, state funerals, the championing of labor policies, political campaigns, and the contrast between the WPCP and the nature of public parks in the West.</p>
<p>What inspired the Chinese Communists to create public parks? Surely the concept of the garden (<italic>yuanlin</italic>) dates back to the Western Han dynasty (206 BC–8 AD) in China, if not earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009413481828">23</xref></sup> But Chinese gardens were primarily private spaces reserved for the personal entertainment of officials and gentry. A notable example is Suzhou’s Humble Administrator's Garden (Zhuozheng yuan), famous since Ming and Qing times. In the modern era, however, a new kind of public recreational park began to emerge in treaty ports to meet the needs of the growing urban population. A major influence here were Western parks such as Hyde Park in England and Central Park in the United States. In Shanghai, parks managed by foreigners appeared in the Bund in the nineteenth century. Gradually private parks owned by rich merchants also opened their doors to the public. Perhaps the best-known of these is Zhang Garden (Zhang yuan), owned by a rich merchant named Zhang Shuhe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009413481828">24</xref></sup> In 1914, in fact, during the early Republican era, the name ‘Central Park’ was given to a new public park that had once been Beijing’s Altar of Earth and Grain (Shejitan), to the immediate west of Tiananmen Gate, where emperors had offered sacrifices to the God of Earth and prayed for good harvests. In 1928 the park was redesignated Zhongshan Garden, in memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, China’s most prominent revolutionary leader in the modern era.</p>
<p>However, public recreational parks in China, especially the WPCP, were more influenced by the Soviets than the West. Perhaps this was to be expected, as Mao Zedong and senior Party leaders had taken an unequivocal pro-Soviet stance in the early phase of the PRC. Internationally isolated and threatened by hostile foreign powers such as the United States, Mao’s decision was understandable as he sought a socialist ally’s help to buttress the new regime. The influence of the Soviets on the WPCP became evident in the name and political nature of the park. First, the Chinese name <italic>wenhuagong</italic> was clearly a direct translation of the Russian term <italic>dvorets kultury</italic>. The Bolshevik Party, after the October Revolution and under the drive to develop a proletarian culture (<italic>Proletkult</italic>) and transform the masses along socialist lines, founded a large number of workers’ clubs. These clubs had their origins in the nineteenth-century Russian philanthropic ‘people’s house’ (<italic>narodnye doma</italic>), which provided a communal space for workers and their families to socialize and relax.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009413481828">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The modern-day workers’ clubs – or in their more grandiloquent designation as ‘palaces of culture’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009413481828">26</xref></sup> – appeared in profusion in the 1920s and 1930s. Touted by the Soviet authorities as an ideal location for the workers to enjoy leisure time, they testified to the growing prosperity and improved quality of life in Soviet society. The clubs were established mostly in areas where workers were concentrated. For instance, the Palace of Culture, designed by the architects Leonid, Victor and Alexander Vesnin, three brothers, rose up in the Proletarian District (until April 1929, the Rogozhsko-Simonovskii District), home to the Sickle and Hammer (SiM; <italic>Serp i molot</italic>) metallurgical factory, one of Moscow’s flagship enterprises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009413481828">27</xref></sup> Among these clubs, the Constructivist architect Konstantin Melnikov’s Rusakov Club was perhaps the most well known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009413481828">28</xref></sup> The workers’ clubs later spread to other East European countries and included the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Second, and more important, the notion of the WPCP as a public park was inspired by the Soviet ‘parks of culture and rest’ movement in the 1920s. Historically Russian parks were a product of the West. Tsar Peter the Great was impressed by European parks during his European tour, and so he enlisted leading gardeners from Germany and France to create magnificent gardens in Russia such as the park at Peterhof. Catherine the Great followed suit, creating great parks resembling those in Europe (for example, the garden at Tsarskoe selo).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009413481828">29</xref></sup> In the Soviet era, however, a different kind of urban park emerged. In a move similar to the establishment of the workers’ clubs, Stalin in the 1920s created ‘parks of culture and rest’ (<italic>park kultury i otdykha</italic>) in line with Marx’s notion that rest and leisure are important elements of a worker’s life. Although Marx did not produce a systematic analysis of leisure, he wrote about it intermittently and gave it great importance. In <italic>The Grundrisse</italic>, for example, Marx associated leisure with enjoyment. He argued that ‘free time – which includes leisure time as well as time for higher activities – naturally transforms anyone who enjoys it into a different person, and it is this different person who then enters the direct process of production.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009413481828">30</xref></sup> Marx’s ‘higher activities’ include education ‘in the arts, sciences, etc.’ that people do in their free time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009413481828">31</xref></sup> This, according to Marx, is important to ensure workers’ personal development and ultimately enhance their productivity.</p>
<p>The model for Stalin’s ‘parks of culture and rest’ was Moscow’s Gorky Park (formally known as Gorky Park of Culture and Rest). Built in 1928, the park extends along the banks of the Moscow River and contains many popular attractions, including outdoor fairs, a Ferris wheel, bowling alleys, dance floors and newspaper reading rooms. Like other similar parks built at the time, however, Gorky Park was never simply an entertainment site but was also meant to be a political arena to propagate official doctrines. In a 1932 Soviet official poster, public parks were labeled as a ‘proletarian park of culture and rest.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009413481828">32</xref></sup> At one time in 1935 Stalin’s famous slogan, ‘Life has become better, life has become more cheerful,’ was hung across the gates. In the 1930s posters calling for the elimination of kulaks were everywhere in the parks, and loudspeakers broadcast Soviet leaders’ speeches and Radio Moscow’s official programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009413481828">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gorky Park became a favorite place for Chinese delegates to visit during official trips to the Soviet capital. When the famed Chinese novelist Mao Dun (Shen Yanbing [1896–1981]) visited the park in December 1946 to see the Exhibition of the Red Army’s War Trophies, he lavishly praised the large number of captured German tanks and cannons in the show, commenting that:<disp-quote>
<p>the defeat of the German Army showed the greatness of the Soviet military industry. But the most important reason for the Soviet victory lay not in its weaponry but in the superiority of the Soviet political, economic, and social systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009413481828">34</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In the early 1950s the Russian term <italic>kultury i otdykha</italic> was directly translated into Chinese as ‘<italic>wenhua yu xiuxi</italic>’ (culture and rest) and widely used in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009413481828">35</xref></sup> Because of its inexperience in running large parks, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks (BMBP) invited Soviet experts to come to Beijing and offer their advice. ‘Their suggestions made a significant impact on our work,’ acknowledged the bureau officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009413481828">36</xref></sup> Indeed, China’s parks in general, and Beijing’s WPCP in particular, resembled their Soviet counterparts in that they were both recreational centers and propaganda platforms. But the WPCP was unique; as a workers’ cultural palace and a park of culture and rest, it combined the two Soviet institutions and was thus more forceful and versatile than its Soviet counterparts in serving the state’s interest.</p>
<p>The first sign that the WPCP would become a servant of the state’s political purposes came in October 1950, when the CCP turned this newly rechristened public park into a funeral home for the burial of the deceased leader Ren Bishi (1904–50), a clear indication that the state’s political agenda had begun to take over the social functions of public, urban space. Ren, a member of the powerful CCP’s Central Secretariat and one of Chairman Mao Zedong’s closest comrades since the Yan’an era (1936–47), died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 27 October 1950, at the age of 46, after a long ailment. The CCP central leadership immediately formed a commission, headed by Mao, to organize Ren’s funeral. It was decided that a state funeral for Ren would be held in the WPCP, returning the newly converted cultural palace to its former role as a memorial hall for commemorating the dead.</p>
<p>Ren’s death was announced in a black-bordered statement in the press by the CCP’s Central Committee and the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth Corps, the latter of which Ren served as honorary chairman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009413481828">37</xref></sup> On the morning of October 28 a deeply saddened Mao, together with the three remaining members of the Central Secretariat – Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and Zhu De – visited Ren’s residence in Beijing to see Ren’s body in a coffin draped with a Party flag.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009413481828">38</xref></sup> The casket was then moved to the WPCP, where Ren’s body lay in state for public viewing.</p>
<p>In front of the main hall a long black-and-white banner was hung, inscribed with the words ‘The Mourning Hall of Comrade Ren Bishi.’ Ren’s casket was placed in the center of the hall, where in bygone days the emperors performed sacred sacrifices to their forbearers. A large photograph of Ren was placed behind the casket, which was guarded by four soldiers and four members of the China’s New Democratic Youth Corps. A huge PRC flag on the central wall gave the room a solemn air, as thousands of mourners filed past the casket to view the deceased leader.</p>
<p>A memorial service was held on 30 October in an open court in front of the main hall. Chaired by Peng Zhen, Beijing’s mayor and a member of the Politburo, and in the presence of senior Party leaders including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and Chen Yun, the service was attended by 40,000 silent mourners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009413481828">39</xref></sup> After the service, Ren’s body was laid to rest in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in western Beijing, a burial ground reserved for distinguished Communists who had made important contributions to the socialist revolution.</p>
<p>In her study of the death rituals in the early Soviet period, Catherine Merridale describes Bolshevik revolutionaries’ interments as a ‘red funeral,’ because the burials followed a routine of pomp and practices including the announcement of the deaths with black-bordered statements in the press, giant wreaths and honor guards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009413481828">40</xref></sup> Ren’s funeral adhered closely to this pattern. But Ren’s funeral was distinct not because of its rituals and the massive assembly of mourners but rather because of where it was held. It is difficult to know why the CCP chose the WPCP, but the choice clearly showed that the Party never regarded the park as a mere recreational venue for citizens; it was to serve an even more important purpose as a platform where the Party could advance its cause.</p>
<p>But mourning and recreation were emotionally incompatible and socially contradictory activities. If the Party’s original intention to convert the ancestral temple into a public park was to exorcise the ghosts of the feudal past, then holding a funeral here – reenacting a ritual long detested and condemned by the Communists as archaic – contradicted its initial objectives. However, the new Communist leaders may have thought that the commemoration of a deceased leader in the former ancestral temple would, symbolically, place Ren in the pantheon of the new nation’s founding fathers. Ren’s elevated status would transform the WPCP from a workers’ park to a secular ancestral temple in the service of the CCP. Over the years the WPCP has also been the venue for memorial services for many senior Party leaders, including, in January 1976, for Premier Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>That the Working People’s Cultural Palace was placed under the management of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions indicates that, at least nominally, the site was specifically to serve the workers’ interest. Chinese official records reveal that, in 1950, the capital had a total of 390,605 workers (the total population of the Beijing municipality numbered 4.1 million), 186,158 (47.6 per cent) of whom had union affiliations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009413481828">41</xref></sup> The BFTU was determined to give the workers distinguished status, as shown in a 1955 internal memo, where the federation spelled out the role of the worker for the WPCP: ‘The primary functions of the cultural palace were to disseminate, through lively formats, the policies of the Party and the people’s government as well as those of the trade unions.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009413481828">42</xref></sup> The BMBP added its voice: ‘Socialist parks (<italic>shehuizhuyi gongyuan</italic>) must be different from the private gardens of the past,’ for they were designed to ‘serve the politics of the proletariat as well as the mass of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009413481828">43</xref></sup> These parks, the officials emphasized, were ‘one of the key places for disseminating political propaganda and offering cultural education to the masses.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009413481828">44</xref></sup> Clearly, in these government pronouncements, the earlier declaration that public parks were created for the private recreational needs of city dwellers was ignored.</p>
<p>The BFTU was only a front organization that oversaw the activities of the WPCP. Archival sources reveal that the agenda for the public work was actually set by the Beijing Municipal Party, which in turn was directed by even higher Party leadership. Activities in the parks, as municipal party officials repeatedly stressed, must be ‘centrally arranged’ (<italic>tongyi anpai</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009413481828">45</xref></sup> The supporting agencies, including the BFTU and the BMBP, implemented the decision made by the municipal party. Clearly the CCP’s tight network of organizational control was in full force.</p>
<p>One of the BFTU’s major propaganda tactics was the promotion of ‘model workers’ (<italic>laodong mofan</italic>). Here again the Soviet influence was apparent. The Stakhanovite movement – named after Aleksei Stakhanov, a miner who produced 14 times the government’s prescribed quota of coal – was promoted by Stalin during the Second Five-Year Plan, in 1935, as a model of high productivity and total devotion to the Soviet leadership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009413481828">46</xref></sup> Stakhanov was idolized by the Chinese Communists during the Yan’an era,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009413481828">47</xref></sup> but the CCP held up its own model workers at meetings in order to make the propaganda work effectively and to promote its own heroes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009413481828">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>This model-worker tradition continued after the founding of the PRC, but the authorities interpreted the term ‘model workers’ more broadly than did their Soviet counterparts. True, ‘model workers’ referred to worker and peasant heroes, but the term was also occasionally used to mean ‘advanced producers’ (<italic>xianjin shengchanzhe</italic>), which encompassed a variety of professions including, for example, technicians, mailmen, dancers and even university professors, as seen in a 1956 list of ‘model workers’ issued by the BFTU.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009413481828">49</xref></sup> Uniting these two groups was that they both seemed to be engaged in different kinds of production, broadly defined, that advanced the cause of socialism in China.</p>
<p>The WPCP was an ideal place to promote labor heroes and showcase their achievements. This was done mainly through exhibitions, display windows, public reports, lecture series and radio broadcasts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009413481828">50</xref></sup> Upon entering the front gate of the WPCP, one immediately sees a long display window titled ‘Honor Roll’ (<italic>guangrong bang</italic>), listing the names and photographs of a number of model workers and a brief account of their contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022009413481828">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009413481828">51</xref></sup> From 1953 to 1954 a total of 64 labor heroes were introduced in the window displays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009413481828">52</xref></sup> In a January 1955 municipal government meeting it was decided that, in addition to model workers selected by the Propaganda Section of the BFTU, also on display would be the names of valiant soldiers recommended by the General Political Department of the People’s Liberation Army, the department responsible for political indoctrination in the army.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009413481828">53</xref></sup>

<p>Worker and peasant heroes, not ‘advanced producers,’ took center stage. Their remarkable achievements were retold in grand fashion at the meetings of labor heroes. These meetings were planned, according to BFTU officials, to ‘carry forward the cooperative spirit of communism’ and ‘to protect state property, bear the burden of work willingly, and serve the people wholeheartedly.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009413481828">54</xref></sup> The federation frequently invited model workers to the WPCP to share their experiences. Two distinguished workers were Zhao Guoyou of the Shenyang machinery factory and Zhao Guilan of the Dalian chemical factory. During their trip to participate in the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference in June 1950, they were asked to meet their admirers. ‘When these model workers entered the cultural palace on the night of 18 June, the audience broke out into thunderous applause,’ reported the <italic>People’s Daily</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009413481828">55</xref></sup> The two heroes declared that without ‘the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people’s government, the proletariat would never be able to genuinely stand up [on their own].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009413481828">56</xref></sup> Zhao Guoyou, who had just returned from the Soviet Union as a member of China’s delegation of workers, gave a glowing report on ‘the advanced production methods in the Soviet factories and the happy lives of workers there.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009413481828">57</xref></sup> On another occasion, labor hero Liu Yingyuan, director of the Shijingshan Power Plant in western Beijing, clearly echoed the aim of the model-worker movement when he spoke about how to create new production records.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009413481828">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the beginning, therefore, the WPCP became a socialist showroom, an advertising tool for the Party to report regularly on advances in the railway system, the electrical industry, and iron and steel productions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009413481828">59</xref></sup> To be sure, government declarations stressed that workers’ happiness extended beyond productive factory work to include culturally enriching activities. The WPCP, for example, periodically exhibited workers’ paintings, emphasizing that the creative talents of the proletariat could only be properly recognized and nourished under a new socialist regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009413481828">60</xref></sup> Officials, however, pointed to these activities as evidence that workers were enthusiastically devoted to socialist goals, more so than to recreational leisure. Without question, state pronouncements regarding collectivism took precedence over citizens’ private interests. By the end of 1954 the WPCP had hosted 67 exhibitions on various kinds of labor activity, drawing 7.07 million visitors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009413481828">61</xref></sup> Through these exhibitions, the <italic>People’s Daily</italic> reported, ‘working people in the capital acquired different kinds of invaluable knowledge.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009413481828">62</xref></sup> The workers were then encouraged to apply this knowledge to advance the socialist cause. Similarly, in 1964, the BFTU instructed the WPCP to assume yet another educational role by serving as a school for youngsters during summer vacations. The goal, the BFTU emphatically declared, was to ‘nurture the successors to socialism and communism.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009413481828">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Marxist revolutionaries, the Chinese Communists were committed to the proletarian revolution worldwide. Theoretically, at least, they thought class, not national interest, as foundation of a global socialist movement. Thus the WPCP was also a site where the government could promote international socialism and an international labor movement. To that end, the BFTU set up an International Department to coordinate the activities.</p>
<p>A golden opportunity came every year during May Day celebrations. In the 1950s, as a way to celebrate the achievements of the PRC, annual May Day parades were organized by the municipal government, with thousands of people forming spectacular processions along Chang’an Avenue in the capital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009413481828">64</xref></sup> This was a perfect occasion to instill a sense of pride among the workers and, most important, to demonstrate solidarity among the proletariat worldwide.</p>
<p>On May Day the International Department played the role of a gracious host, by inviting foreign labor leaders to China, largely from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Albania, North Korea, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. To enhance China’s international prestige, labor representatives were also invited from non-socialist nations including Pakistan, India, Spain, Venezuela and Columbia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009413481828">65</xref></sup> When the foreign dignitaries arrived, the WPCP was high on their itinerary, and, as expected, their Chinese hosts accompanied them for a guided tour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009413481828">66</xref></sup> On May Day every year, the WPCP’s main hall was converted into a concert hall, with symphonies and choruses performing favorite pieces such as ‘The Workers Are Empowered’ and other songs praising the unity of the socialist camp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009413481828">67</xref></sup> The cultural palace was transformed into a global stage and diplomatic platform for forging new international comradeship and new deals, as well as reaffirming old commitments. To further promote friendship, soccer matches between China and the visiting foreign countries were also staged in the Workers’ Stadium in eastern Beijing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009413481828">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted, 67 exhibitions were mounted in the WPCP by the end of 1954; of these, 25 were devoted to industrial construction and daily life in the ‘brotherly countries.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009413481828">69</xref></sup> In the 1950s, when Beijing and Moscow were on good terms, exhibitions of Soviet achievements were a recurrent scene. With May Day approaching in 1950, a photo exhibition of the Soviet Union showed the country’s economic and social accomplishments, including collective farms, industrial plants and educational systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009413481828">70</xref></sup> The Red Army’s defeat of the Nazis was another popular event staged in the WPCP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009413481828">71</xref></sup> In the 1950s, Soviet films also became a perennial attraction to entertain workers and their families in the palace compound. These films were mostly sponsored by the Sino–Soviet Friendship Association, an organization founded in 1949 to enhance cooperation between the two countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009413481828">72</xref></sup> Anti-imperialism exhibitions, not surprisingly, were equally prominent in the WPCP, as demonstrated by the 1951 exhibition on ‘The Struggle of Vietnam’ against French colonialism. Reportedly these exhibitions captivated large audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009413481828">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beijing’s WPCP was not the only cultural palace in the nation to host foreign dignitaries; the Shanghai Workers’ Cultural Palace (Shanghai gongren wenhuagong) often did the same.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009413481828">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the unsettling nation-building years of the PRC’s first decade, the WPCP’s primary tasks dealt less with external affairs and more with urgent domestic issues, including promoting the Party’s political campaigns. This was spelled out clearly by the BFTU’s Propaganda Department in a document stating that the WPCP was ‘to coordinate (<italic>peihe</italic>) its activities with various kinds of political movements.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009413481828">75</xref></sup> In the ‘Three-antis’ and ‘Five-antis’ campaigns from 1951 to 1952, during which the Communist Party denounced bureaucratism and the capitalists, respectively, the BFTU was the faithful enforcer of Party policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009413481828">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>The WPCP played an even more active role in two of the ‘three greatest mass movements’ in the early 1950s: the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries and the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign (the third was the Land Reform Campaign). To consolidate its power the CCP, in the early 1950s, mounted a relentless campaign to suppress counterrevolutionaries, who, in the words of Mao, included ‘bandit chiefs, professional brigands, local despots, spies, and leaders of reactionary secret societies and sects.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009413481828">77</xref></sup> These groups were deemed politically subversive and socially destructive, and hence had to be eliminated by any means. In 1950 the Beijing Municipal Party announced that the security forces uncovered in the capital 177 major spy cases and incarcerated a total of 3913 reactionaries. The Municipal Party report noted that ‘the original organized enemy networks and the activities of the professional brigands were basically uprooted.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009413481828">78</xref></sup> At the conclusion of the campaign in 1953, it is estimated more than 700,000 people were executed and over 1.2 million imprisoned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009413481828">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this violent campaign the WPCP became a convenient location to announce the Party’s policies, as was evident in a series of well-publicized exhibitions held in its compound. In mid-1950 the Beijing Security Bureau staged an exhibition there titled ‘Exposing the Spy System of the Chiang Kai-shek Cliques.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009413481828">80</xref></sup> The following year an even larger show titled ‘The Criminal Evidence of the America-Chiang Spy System’ was enacted, focusing not only on the history of Guomindang espionage and the American intelligence network in China before 1949 but also on the ‘major antirevolutionary cases’ uncovered in 1950.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009413481828">81</xref></sup> These exhibitions were an integral part of the larger Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Korean War, in June 1950, the WPCP was transformed yet again into another propaganda platform, this time to support the government-initiated Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign. The propaganda effort shifted to attack the United States in four different areas: the history of American imperialist aggression in China, the American rearming of Japan, U.S. military aid to Taiwan and the bravery of the Korean people in resisting foreign aggression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009413481828">82</xref></sup> The BFTU accused the United States of ‘undermining peace’ in Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009413481828">83</xref></sup> As in the past, the Propaganda Department of the BFTU used a number of popular means, including films, radio broadcasts, photos and posters, to denounce American involvement in the Korean War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009413481828">84</xref></sup> The Cultural and Educational Department, another section of the BFTU, designed anti-American pamphlets and used other well-liked devices such as cartoons, <italic>xiangsheng</italic> (comic dialogues) and <italic>kuaiban</italic> (storytelling with a clapper) to disseminate similar anti-American messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009413481828">85</xref></sup> Anti-America exhibitions were held mostly in the large open courtyard in front of the WPCP’s main hall, drawing 5000–10,000 viewers each time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009413481828">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Model workers also were called to action. In a speech delivered in the southern city of Guangzhou, Mayor Ye Jianying (1897–1986) encouraged labor heroes to assume a leading role in these political campaigns. ‘A model worker should not only be an active participant in production,’ Ye said, ‘he should also be on constant alert, preventing antirevolutionaries from wreaking havoc in different [government] branches.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009413481828">87</xref></sup> Urged by the government, model workers and distinguished soldiers joined hands nationwide to sign an open letter, published in the official <italic>People’s Daily</italic> in late December 1950 to support the anti-American war effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0022009413481828">88</xref></sup> The Chinese Democratic Youth Groups used the WPCP to stage basketball games, donating the proceeds to ‘pay for fighter planes and canons’ to aid the North Koreans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0022009413481828">89</xref></sup> This was part of the government-sponsored ‘Donating Airplanes and Canons Movement,’ which, in the early 1950s, was developed into a nationwide anti-America campaign. The WPCP also staged other political exhibitions, including the ‘liberation of Taiwan,’ denouncing both Chiang Kai-shek and the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0022009413481828">90</xref></sup> and a cartoon show to condemn the literary critic Hu Feng (1902–84) as a counterrevolutionary for promoting bourgeois liberalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0022009413481828">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>This politization of public parks was equally evident in other parts of China as well. When Shanghai celebrated its Spring Festival in 1955, the municipal government instructed administrators of the city’s Zhongshan Park, for example, to integrate its activities closely with ‘current political missions’ targeted primarily at the American military aggression in Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0022009413481828">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like many other government organizations, the WPCP was inevitably drawn into the even more tumultuous political upheavals of the 1960s. The ideological war pitted radicals (led by Mao) against moderates (led by Liu Shaoqi) and surfaced in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It would soon erupt, a few years later, into a full-blown Cultural Revolution, the WPCP serving as the battleground on which the two political factions fought. In 1964 the BFTU, which now fell under the radicals’ control, criticized the WPCP staff for putting on artistic programs devoid of the notion of ‘class struggle.’ BFTU officials accused the WPCP of pursuing a bourgeois path by hanging a large number of actors’ photos on the palace walls, a sign of debauched capitalist taste.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009413481828">93</xref></sup> They also criticized the performance of ‘symphonies there that were incomprehensible even to our cadres,’ including pieces by Tchaikovsky and Beethoven. This was tantamount to pursuing pure ‘artistry’ (<italic>yishuxing</italic>) and forsaking political goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009413481828">94</xref></sup> ‘We must repel the furious onslaught of bourgeois thought,’ the Municipal Bureau of Parks reminded its staff in a strongly worded statement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009413481828">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the ensuing Cultural Revolution, which shook the nation from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the WPCP came under the full control of the radicals, led by the so-called Gang of Four (among them Jiang Qing, Mao’s wife). Again the cultural palace was a favorite site for staging political demonstrations in support of the Maoist line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0022009413481828">96</xref></sup> For instance, on May Day, in 1968, the WPCP and other public parks in Beijing were turned into venues for buoyant garden parties to ‘highlight the politics of the proletariat and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought,’ according to the newly created, radical-controlled Revolutionary Committee of the BFTU.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009413481828">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>The state’s domination of public spaces in China, as in its control of the WPCP and other large urban parks, is best demonstrated by comparing Chinese and Western parks.</p>
<p>Recreational parks date back to early European history, and such parks are only one of the many types of parks in the West (the other major kinds are national parks and heritage parks).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009413481828">98</xref></sup> London’s Hyde Park, which opened to the public in the 1630s, is a notable example<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009413481828">99</xref></sup> However, the creation of modern-day publicly funded civic parks for leisure is predominantly a Victorian idea,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0022009413481828">100</xref></sup> a result of the Industrial Revolution which demanded a public recreational landscape to improve the physical conditions of workers trapped in noisy, overcrowded cities. Many countries, including the USA, followed suit. The best-known example may be New York’s Central Park.</p>
<p>When the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, with the help of his partner Calvert Vaux, designed Central Park, he had a distinct notion of what an urban park should look like: a communal place for people with diverse backgrounds to congregate and socialize. It is well known that Olmsted’s ideas of building a park were inspired by what he saw during two visits to Birkenhead Park near Liverpool, in 1850 and 1859. Indeed, he was genuinely impressed by the British parks – what he called ‘people’s gardens’ – with their winding paths, open meadows, and woodland belts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0022009413481828">101</xref></sup> But in designing Central Park, Olmsted went beyond conceiving it as an idealized countryside landscape. He wanted a park with a unified composition, a blending of scenery and social values; he especially believed that a park should not be a mere imitation of nature but must have a ‘human presence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0022009413481828">102</xref></sup> It should be a place for ‘gregarious recreation,’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0022009413481828">103</xref></sup> a communal institution open to citizens of all classes, where people enjoyed ‘this social, neighborly, unexertive form of recreation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0022009413481828">104</xref></sup> In line with this aim, Olmsted stressed the social and psychological effect of the landscape on visitors to the park. Here citizens from diverse backgrounds assembled to converse, interact and socialize in a relaxed, ‘beautiful open green space.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0022009413481828">105</xref></sup> In a congested urban setting, public parks thus become a vibrant, mosaic social space for the uninhibited dialogue of weary city dwellers. Herein lies the fundamental notion of what Olmsted called ‘openness.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0022009413481828">106</xref></sup> Central Park is a typical Western recreational park that belongs to the common people, subjected not to the control of interest groups or political parties. Hence it belongs to everyone, which means that it belongs to no one in particular. A recreational park is thus democratic, in that it promotes cultural diversity, accommodates dissonant voices, encourages community participation and unrestricted ideas, and promote a sense of inclusion for all the citizens. In the words of Setha Low and her colleagues, ‘Olmsted believed that a complex web of volunteer and recreational social activity, and the communication such activity fostered, was the crucial underpinning of a democratic society.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0022009413481828">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>Obviously Beijing’s WPCP differed markedly from its Western counterparts, as it was subject to a totally controlling blueprint issued by the government. In a 1953 report by the officials of the BMBP, the government announced that the parks were set up to ‘strengthen the cultural activities as well as to enhance the political atmosphere.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0022009413481828">108</xref></sup> However, as it turned out, political considerations had won out over public entertainment and cultural enhancements. The interest of the Party-state determined what the structure and contents of the WPCP and other major public parks should be. The municipal government and the BFTU coordinated the activities at the cultural palace and removed items deemed undesirable and unsuitable from the park.</p>
<p>During the Cultural Revolution the political nature of public parks became even more pronounced. The setting, including the arrangement of flora, had to be carefully planned and supervised. ‘Flowers must serve political purposes and be used for festive celebrations,’ and they must ‘represent the thriving of socialism,’ park officials insisted. And ‘displaying the quotations of Chairman Mao in the parks must strictly follow the orders that come from the central government.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0022009413481828">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, public parks did undergo some changes. The post-Mao reforms since the late 1970s saw a clear transformation of the boundary between state and society, with greater reliance on market forces and the rise of new social organizations in urban China which allowed individuals to pursue more personal interests and increase the free allocation of urban space. Since the mid-1980s, Deborah Davis observes, urban leaders had even:<disp-quote>
<p>encouraged city bureaus and private citizens to return temples, shrines, and churches to their pre-Communist functions. They also tolerated more diverse and spontaneous uses of parks and sidewalks, and public spaces again became available for a wide range of nonstate – even antistate – activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0022009413481828">110</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>But this retreat of the Party-state is not tantamount to a fundamental change of its political nature or its willingness to accept open criticism and even less, challenge to its authority. The pervasiveness of the Party is still too apparent and its behavior unpredictable.</p>
<p>Did the WPCP operate in the interests of the working people, as the government officially claimed? How did urbanites actually view this popular park? A woodcut by Gu Yuan (1919–96), titled <italic>Beijing’s Working People’s Cultural Palace</italic>, helps to answer these questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0022009413481828">111</xref></sup> Occupying center stage in this famous 1951 woodcut are ordinary people happily playing chess. Nearby, men and women are peacefully reading newspapers and magazines, while two youngsters sit on the ground enjoying their storybooks. At the back, citizens are gaily dancing in a circle in front of the main hall of the WPCP. Still others quietly watch and contemplate the myriad activities around them. The scene relates a simple story: the WPCP is a place where common folk gather for relaxation and recreation. This seemed to fulfill the government’s original promise, mentioned earlier, that the WPCP was a ‘paradise of the working people in the capital,’ where common people came and congregated for amusement. But this promise was often unfulfilled, since the park was frequently used for frantic, often boisterous political activities orchestrated by the government. In renaming the Imperial Ancestral Temple ‘The Working People’s Cultural Palace’ in 1950, the new Chinese Communist regime redefined the nature of China’s pubic recreational parks. One may argue that from the beginning, the WPCP, because of its important location in Tiananmen Square, was never really set up to promote social and entertainment activities for the city residents. That its name cites it as belonging to ‘the working people’ created a conflict between official state agencies and their goals for the space and the public life of city residents. For the government, such a conflict seemed to be easily resolved by limiting people’s leisure activities and turning the park’s social functions into political activities. Viewed through the prism of the dictatorial CCP, the WPCP was not intended to have recreational functions separate from political purposes. The WPCP and other major parks in China reflected the Communist regime’s primary concern about controlling public space to ensure social stability and political harmony. The large public spaces were actually used in an Orwellian way by the government to watch closely and eliminate any threats to the Party’s grip on power.</p>
<p>Contrary to official pronouncements testifying to the highly efficient and superior management of public parks, these recreational areas were plagued by a number of problems. Archival sources and internal memos reveal that waste, corruption and theft were common in the parks, and that the staff was often incompetent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0022009413481828">112</xref></sup> ‘Their educational levels were low,’ park officials confessed. These troubles seem minor, however, compared to the political intrusions by various government agencies, including the BFTU. In the PRC’s ceaseless political campaigns, the park administrators were directed to stay in line and constantly be wary of potential opposition against Communist rule.</p>
<p>Under the pragmatic leadership of Deng Xiaoping, China’s urban parks in the 1980s did, in fact, allow people to enjoy greater recreational freedom, but only if the activities posed no threat to the regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0022009413481828">113</xref></sup> Large, open spaces continue to be considered potentially dangerous, since crowds can assemble in them and unchecked gatherings of the masses can easily spin out of control. Indeed, two recent incidents made the Party-state particularly nervous about undesirable gatherings, ‘undesirable’ at least according to the Party. In the 1980s large urban parks, including the WPCP, became favorite places for master teachers to instruct a mass audience in <italic>qigong</italic> – a traditional breathing exercise that teaches self-cultivation and personal balance, believed to be beneficial to one’s health.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0022009413481828">114</xref></sup> Then, in April 1999, Communist leaders were taken by surprise when more than 10,000 members of Falun Gong, one of the most popular <italic>qigong</italic> groups, staged a demonstration outside Zhongnanhai, the senior leaders’ compound in Beijing, to protest the government’s criticism and negative portrayals of <italic>qigong</italic>. Feeling threatened, the Party took swift action to clamp down on the movement, arresting key Falun Gong leaders and banning all practice. Public parks were put under close watch.</p>
<p>The second incident occurred during the 2008 Beijing Olympics; the Chinese government, under the pressure of the International Olympic Committee, agreed to set up three parks – Purple Bamboo Park, Ritan Park and World Park – as protest zones to allow citizens to air grievances against the government. The application procedures, on the surface, were surprisingly simple: a citizen simply submitted an application form at a local police station. The government received a total of 77 applications from 149 people, and yet not a single demonstration actually took place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0022009413481828">115</xref></sup> Chinese officials explained that all the concerns had been ‘resolved’ through ‘dialogue and communication.’ ‘Chinese culture always emphasizes the concept of harmony,’ they added.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0022009413481828">116</xref></sup> This official script, however, hid the cruel reality of police harassment and the arrest of demonstrators. Many who dared to apply were either detained or sentenced to political re-education. According to human rights groups, two Chinese women, one of whom was 70 years old and nearly blind, did step forward to protest against local authorities for forcibly evicting them from their homes. As soon as they submitted their applications, they were interrogated by police for 10 hours; eventually they were ordered to serve a year of ‘re-education through labor.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0022009413481828">117</xref></sup> Clearly demonstrations against the government in a public park, if allowed, were interpreted as a public humiliation of the authorities. Worse, such demonstrations could lead to serious unpredictable political and social consequences and therefore had to be stopped.</p>
<p>Despite its recent economic success, China’s Party-state continues to show deep concern that recreational parks might be used by unfriendly forces to mount opposition against the government. The CCP never hesitates to impose total control over the public, by force if necessary. By doing so, the CCP obliterates the distinction between government policies and citizens’ everyday lives; more important, the line between public and private spheres is erased. In the end, the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party is ensured.</p>
