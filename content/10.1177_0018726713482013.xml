<abstract>
<p>We analyze business behavioral ethics in terms of bounded autonomy, namely the result of tensions between the countervailing motivations of reactance (tendencies that involve the freedom of behaving in certain ways as a right) versus deonance (tendencies that involve the appropriateness of behaving in certain ways as an obligation). We focus in particular on how the resolution of such tensions (i.e. establishment of a boundary between rights and duties—“free” behaviors versus “non-free” behaviors—in a state of dynamic equilibrium) can cause behavior to be seen as ethical by the person performing the behavior (the actor), but seen as unethical by impartial observers. That discrepancy comes from the actor’s assessment of the behavior in question as having either an inherent status (the type of behavior it <italic>is</italic>) or an instrumental status (what it <italic>does</italic>). This analysis leads us to a discussion of the following four types of situations involving unethical behavior: freedom expansion based on a behavior’s inherent status or on its instrumental status; and freedom contraction based on a behavior’s inherent status or on its instrumental status. We outline propositions consistent with those distinctions and conclude with theoretical implications.</p>

<body>
<p>What are employees’ duties toward organizations? What should an employee do when a duty toward his/her organization (e.g. loyalty, protection of confidentiality) conflicts with a duty toward society (e.g. report environmentally harmful organizational practices) or a right he or she is entitled to as a human being in a just society (e.g. freedom of speech limited by confidentiality agreements)? Are duties of corporate social responsibility fulfilled entirely by avoiding harmful activities (e.g. not damaging the environment), or do they also call for engaging in activities to provide the public with certain kinds of benefits to at least some degree (e.g. contributing to community development projects)? Questions such as these are more easily asked than answered, especially when an employee or an organization is faced with an actual situation that involves the opposition of rights and duties or the conflict between one duty and another. The correctness of an individual’s course of action in an ethical dilemma such as the ones outlined above can be debated on philosophical grounds. As behavioral ethicists, however, we focus on how individuals are likely to behave in such situations, rather than on the ethical correctness of their actions.</p>
<p>Specifically, we analyze perceptions of autonomy that shape individuals’ decisions and behaviors when their rights and duties collide or they face opposing duties. Rights and duties can be understood in the following sense: “To accept a set of <italic>rights</italic> is to approve a distribution of <italic>freedom</italic> and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what <italic>may, must</italic>, and <italic>must not</italic> be done” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713482013">Wenar, 2011</xref>: para. 2, emphasis added). Rights involve freedoms (what “may” be done), subject to duties (what “must” and “must not” be done). Moreover, a connection between justice and rights can be traced to Roman times, in the sense that justice means to acknowledge someone’s right to a fair outcome or process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713482013">Wenar, 2011</xref>). Corporate duties circumscribe rights as expressed in Milton Friedman’s famous statement that the sole responsibility of business is “to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726713482013">Friedman, 1962</xref>: 133). Managers <italic>may</italic> exercise <italic>rights</italic> that go with being “free” to conduct business in openly competitive ways, but these <italic>permitted</italic> behaviors are subject to responsibilities that are <italic>prescriptive</italic>—to “make as much money for their stockholders as possible” (p.133)—and <italic>proscriptive</italic> (not to practice “deception and fraud”).</p>
<p>Just as Friedman referred to behavior within the rules, we focus on boundaries between total discretion and behavior subject to moral norms—hence a tension like that described by another well-known management scholar:<disp-quote>
<p>The professional has to have autonomy … private in that his knowledge and his judgment have to be entrusted with the decision … autonomous and not subject to political or ideological control … But he is public in the sense that the welfare of his client sets limits to his deeds and words … [I]n order to be permitted to remain autonomous and private they have to impose on themselves the responsibility of the professional ethic … In this tension between the private functioning of the manager: the necessary autonomy of his institution and its accountability to its own mission and purpose, and the public character of the manager, lies the ethical problem. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726713482013">Drucker, 1974</xref>: 368−369, 375)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We analyze how this tension at the boundary of autonomy and accountability—of rights and duties—can affect ethical behavior. That analysis builds on concepts mentioned only briefly in the descriptions of two theories: reactance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm, 1966</xref>), a theory about perceptions of the freedom to behave in certain ways (rights); and deonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726713482013">Folger, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713482013">2012</xref>), a theory about perceptions of moral norms (duties). In the process, we extend the latter’s reach beyond the focus on justice to which it was first applied. Rather than pursue a particular way of linking duties and rights with justice, such as done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726713482013">Ross (1930)</xref> in identifying justice as one of several prima facie (intuitively acknowledged) duties, we address the connection between our analysis and the organizational justice literature in a concluding section on theoretical implications.</p>
<p><italic>Deonance</italic> is a term based on <italic>deon</italic>, Greek for duty and obligation. The related adjective, <italic>deontic</italic>, applies to auxiliary verbs such as “ought to” and to <italic>deontic logic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713482013">Beller, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726713482013">2010</xref>) about permission (e.g. <italic>may</italic>), prescription (e.g. <italic>must</italic>), and proscription (e.g. <italic>must not</italic>). Rights and duties, reactance and deonance, come together in the latter theory’s psychological construct of <italic>bounded autonomy</italic> as we develop for the first time an expanded perspective on it; that is, juxtaposing reactance theory with deonance theory puts that construct in a new light. Our analysis builds on how the original introduction of it made the following remark in passing: “The flip side of constraint [cf. must, must not] is <italic>autonomy</italic> (residual freedom and discretion) [cf. may]—a reason for pairing <italic>autonomy</italic> with <italic>bounded</italic>. Related pairings include freedom/responsibility, rights/obligations, and authority/accountability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713482013">Folger, 1998</xref>: 26). We pick up where that brief description left off. Because bounded autonomy refers to perceptions, namely an understanding or interpretation of the extent to which free behavior is circumscribed by moral norms, we explore broadened perspectives on reactance and deonance to address how individuals <italic>perceive</italic> the limits of their rights and duties, and how such perceptions influence their action or inaction in situations with ethical relevance. We begin with two concepts mentioned in the initial presentation of reactance theory and then subsequently ignored.</p>

<p><disp-quote>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The heart of reactance theory is that individuals tend to resist restrictions on their free behavior. Research supports this theory in predicting behavioral intentions across diverse disciplines and situations, including housewives’ ratings of the attractiveness of laundry detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726713482013">Mazis, 1975</xref>), responsiveness to psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726713482013">Tennen et al., 1981</xref>), participants’ choices in responding to a survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726713482013">Biner, 1988</xref>), jurors’ likelihood of following judicial instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726713482013">Shaw and Skolnick, 1995</xref>), and the failure of health-campaign initiatives based on perceptions of freedom-threatening language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726713482013">Quick et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, empirical research on reactance theory substantiates the theory’s claim that individuals withstand others’ attempts at limiting their freedom; and when individuals perceive a threat to their freedom, they become motivated to behave in ways to regain the lost freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726713482013">Jonas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726713482013">Miron and Brehm, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies demonstrate remarkable propensities for obedience to authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726713482013">Milgram, 1965</xref>) and conformity to norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726713482013">Asch, 1952</xref>), however, indicating that the motivation to exercise one’s own free will (rather than yielding to another’s) might not always be as strong as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm (1966)</xref> described. Clearly various contingency factors determine whether individuals conform to or resist the regulation of their behavior. Our analysis highlights deonance as one such contingency factor. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713482013">Folger’s (1998)</xref> notion of bounded autonomy, we analyze the resistance or conformity to organizational regulation of ethically relevant behavior. We begin by noting that the existing account of deonance “picks up where reactance theory leaves off” and has already referred to behaviors with ethical relevance “determined by the strength of one force (reactance) relative to another (deonance)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713482013">Folger, 2012</xref>: 127).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018726713482013">
<title>Bounded autonomy and perceived freedom to act</title>
<p>Conceptualizing deonance as a morally normative, countervailing force vis-a-vis reactance implies that bounded autonomy signifies the existence of a dynamic equilibrium of those forces in the sense of a Lewinian force-field analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726713482013">Lewin, 1951</xref>). Bounded autonomy, therefore, refers to individuals’ perceived free behavior curtailed by external criteria (e.g. including experience, custom, and agreement, as mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm, 1966</xref>) that demark the appropriateness of behavior for an individual who interacts in a well-ordered society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713482013">Folger, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The quasi-stationary boundary that distinguishes the free from non-free is perceptual and subject to shifts. A previously restricted behavior (e.g. divulging confidential information about organizational practices), for example, can be treated as a free behavior by an employee if breaking away from the restriction serves a moral purpose (e.g. informing government authorities of confidential organizational practices that harm the environment). Conversely, employees might voluntarily limit their free behavior on moral grounds (e.g. not smoke, to avoid discomfort to others). We argue that there are two psychological mechanisms that change perceptions of bounded autonomy (i.e. shift the perceptual boundary between free and non-free behaviors) based on deontic grounds. We next turn to these two psychological mechanisms.</p>

<sec id="section3-0018726713482013">
<title>Inherent (“legitimate”) and instrumental (“justified”) grounds for conduct</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm (1966)</xref> briefly illustrated two reactance-reducing mechanisms. His <italic>legitimacy</italic> example was a father who on a particular occasion denied someone the opportunity to have his daughter baby-sit (bounded the other person’s freedom by legitimate parental authority, with little or no reactance). A business parallel would be a supervisor, as someone in authority, deciding whether an employee could take time off to help a person in another department on a busy workday. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm’s (1966)</xref> <italic>justification</italic> example involved a mother in the hospital for an emergency operation as the reason why a daughter was not available to baby-sit for someone (who felt little or no reactance—given the importance of the daughter’s presence at the hospital, relative to the inconvenience of having to find another baby-sitter). An employee requesting a supervisor for a leave of absence for a family emergency would represent a similar type of situation. We re-conceptualize the mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm (1966)</xref> mentioned (legitimacy, justification) and hence we use new terms (inherent, instrumental) to emphasize how our characterizations differ from his, especially for the purpose of research on business behavioral ethics.</p>
<sec id="section4-0018726713482013">
<title>A behavior’s instrumental status as a basis for conduct</title>
<p>Referring to something as an <italic>instrumental</italic> basis for conduct means people perceive that how they should—or should not—conduct themselves depends on what they perceive happens as a function of doing or not doing something. Friedman’s statement about corporate responsibilities is a perfect example because it refers to making money for stockholders. Accordingly, how a company conducts its business is supposed to be based on contingencies regarding profits and losses as a function of different business practices. As the moral duty of a manager, making money for stockholders provides a specific criterion by which to judge what should and should not be done: Behave in ways that make money and don’t behave in ways that don’t make money; choose among courses of action based on how much the company stands to gain or lose. The behavioral contingencies of responsibility stem from projected risk−reward relationships. The bottom line influences the boundaries of autonomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0018726713482013">
<title>A behavior’s inherent status as a basis for conduct</title>
<p>Some things <italic>inherent</italic> to the nature of doing business can shape other guidelines regarding what managers perceive they should and should not do, however, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726713482013">Friedman (1962)</xref> also noted. By invoking the moral dictate of staying “within the rules of the game,” he was referring to business conducted within an economic system of market capitalism. Doing business in a communist regime <italic>inherently</italic> involves a different set of rules, as a function of the nature of the difference between capitalism and communism. Similarly, different cultures have different moral norms as regards Friedman’s dictate about conducting business “without deception and fraud.” The proscriptions against certain kinds of business practices seen as deceptive in one culture might be <italic>perceived</italic> in another culture as simply a part of the very nature of doing business (e.g. deliberately posting prices that are not “real” because of norms about haggling).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0018726713482013">
<title>Inherent and instrumental bases for ethical and unethical conduct in organizations</title>
<p>Organizational norms can be conceived of as informal behavioral control mechanisms that dictate the appropriateness of certain types of behavior in organizational settings. They involve “processes by which social processes, obligations, or actualities come to take on a rule-like status in social thought and action" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726713482013">Meyer and Rowan, 1977</xref>: 341). A critical function of these behavioral control systems is that they specify which behaviors are “free” for employees to engage in, and which behaviors are not. As such, the ethicality of employees’ behavior in organizations is at least partly dependent on the range of behaviors in which the organization or its agents allow employees to engage. For example, consider the following two situations:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726713482013" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>John, a production worker at a large manufacturing company, is aware of a number of environmentally questionable practices his company pursues in its production process, but he decides that he should not inform anyone of these practices because he perceives an <italic>inherent</italic> duty to keep information regarding the manufacturing processes confidential. For him, that is simply part of what it means to be a loyal employee.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sally, a junior accountant in a retail store, inflates some sales numbers to have a surplus on the books for the end of the quarter. She does that because of a perceived duty to the store’s employees, who might lose their jobs otherwise because of a threatened store closing. Many of them have piled up debts because of a downturned economy. She thinks that her reported numbers will save their jobs, and that better-than-expected sales in the next quarter will make up the difference. She perceives her action in <italic>instrumental</italic>-duty terms because it is determined by the exigencies of special circumstances. Her behavior is different on this occasion because she’s worried about what might happen to the employees’ families if she reported the correct numbers instead.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the first scenario, John is aware that the company is engaging in environmental practices that society views as being potentially harmful. Yet he feels that his freedom to inform external authorities about the company’s practices is <italic>restricted</italic> by his duty as an employee to maintain confidentiality. John’s conduct, therefore, is a result of perceiving a restriction on his free behavior to inform the environmental protection groups. Similar situations occur when people think that they have no business pointing out undesirable conduct because they believe it’s a bad thing to be a “snitch.” In the second scenario, Sally engages in a formerly restricted behavior—a behavior that is generally not allowed (i.e. distorting a financial report)—because she feels an obligation to take the special circumstances of the employees into account. Her action illustrates an <italic>expansion of</italic> perceived free behaviors.</p>
<p>These scenarios illustrate two distinct ethically sensitive situations in which employees’ behaviors are influenced by perceptions about the bounded autonomy of conduct. The crucial aspects of the first situation are that free behaviors are circumscribed (divided into ethically permissible or duty-bound) according to grounds for governing conduct perceived as <italic>inherent</italic> to the very types of behaviors themselves, such that John thinks of one option (alerting authorities) as out-of-bounds or <italic>restricted</italic>. The crucial aspects of the second situation are that the area of bounded autonomy has been <italic>expanded</italic> based on Sally’s perceptions about an <italic>instrumental</italic> basis for choices about how to govern her conduct. These distinctions allow us to consider four combinations in all—inherent or instrumental perceptions about ways that the range of free behaviors (unfettered autonomy) is restricted or expanded—in the following sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0018726713482013">
<title>Expansion involving a behavior’s inherent status</title>
<p>The expansion of individuals’ free behaviors is a novel area of study. We examine that perception of expansion first in regard to ethical behavior, then in regard to unethical behavior.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018726713482013">
<title>Expanded freedom and ethical conduct associated with inherent-status value</title>
<p>Consider whistle-blowing as ethical behavior. By definition, whistle-blowing is an anti-normative act because it involves going against the established system/hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726713482013">Warren, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the very act of whistle-blowing represents a situation of expanded freedom. Why do people whistle-blow? Although some people whistle-blow for instrumental reasons—that is, they only whistle-blow if the damages of not whistle-blowing are big or if the benefits of whistle-blowing outweigh the costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726713482013">Gundlach et al., 2003</xref>)—others do it because they feel it is simply the right thing to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726713482013">Brabeck, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713482013">Dozier and Miceli, 1985</xref>). Whistle-blowing in this second instance is an example of expanded freedom in ethical conduct with inherent-status value. Whistle-blowers who fall into this latter category are the people who feel that they have the freedom to challenge the authority when they perceive a violation of a moral principle. Whether whistle-blowing falls into the set of an expanded domain of free behaviors might also depend on perceptions about the inherent-status of a particular behavior as the right kind of response—such as reporting it to an ethics hotline or externally (e.g. to a professional association’s ethics board).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018726713482013">
<title>Expanded freedom and unethical conduct associated with inherent-status value</title>
<p>Now consider insider trading, commonly taken to be unethical. Our inherent-status example of expanded autonomy comes from arguments about some forms of it as both legal and moral, however, such as when an owner hires an executive and offers a contract written to allow trading on information about the owner’s company before it becomes public. In reference to “insider trading and property rights in new information” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713482013">Manne, 1985</xref>: 933), “property owners have the right to do whatever they want with their own property regardless of what others think”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726713482013">McGee, 2009</xref>). Insider trading as an inherent property right is a perception about “whether … we should give up the economic and human freedom involved” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713482013">Manne, 1985</xref>: 933).</p>
<p>Imagine an owner with a property-rights perspective on the inherent status of insider trading. This fits our expansion category because property rights as part of human freedom represent an extension of the bounds of autonomy to include a behavior otherwise considered unethical. Perhaps the owner sees the article on “Is Insider Trading Ethical?” and reads that “[a] wide spread in the quality and quantity of information held by different people is an accepted feature of almost every market. So, insider trading cannot be unethical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713482013">Lekkas, 1998</xref>: 195). Because “[a]ll that is needed for this mechanism to work is a clear labor contract stipulating that shareholders hand over the right to deal on inside information to corporate insiders and to nobody else” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726713482013">Engelen and Van Liedekerke, 2007</xref>: 499), the owner might see such a contract as the right thing to do.</p>

<title>Expansion involving a behavior’s instrumental status</title>
<p>Instrumental status can transform non-free behaviors into free behaviors if people make decisions based on potential results. Unethical behaviors can acquire instrumental status if individuals conclude that the potential positive outcomes outweigh the negative outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section11-0018726713482013">
<title>Expanded freedom and ethical conduct associated with instrumental-status value</title>
<p>Interestingly, management researchers have begun to study employees behaving counter-normatively for the sake of being ethical! Contrasted with destructive deviance “that violates significant organizational norms and in so doing threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482013">Robinson and Bennett, 1995</xref>: 556), constructive deviance violates norms but “in so doing contributes to the well-being of an organization, its members, or both” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726713482013">Galperin, 2002</xref>; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726713482013">Galperin and Burke, 2006</xref>: 333). These behaviors may include innovative role behaviors, noncompliance with dysfunctional directives, and criticizing incompetent superiors, to foster innovation and the competitive advantage of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726713482013">Galperin and Burke, 2006</xref>). For example, pro-social rule breaking (PSRB) is a form of constructive deviance characterized by volitional rule-breaking in the interest of the organization or its stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726713482013">Dahling et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482013">Morrison (2006)</xref> identified three types of PSRB: to perform one’s responsibilities more efficiently, to help a subordinate or colleague, and to provide good customer service.</p>
<p>Because the research on constructive deviance and PSRB is in its infancy, deonance theory holds promise as a relevant theoretical framework. We base the following proposition on the instrumental-status mechanism’s role in expanding autonomy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 2</italic>: Employees will tend to perceive ordinarily non-free behaviors (constructive deviance, pro-social rule breaking) as free behaviors (expanded) if they are convinced of the instrumental-status of those behaviors and their relationship with the beneficiary of the instrumental action (e.g. organization, colleagues, customers).</p>

<title>Expanded freedom and unethical conduct associated with instrumental-status value</title>
<p>The instrumental mechanism can also transform a non-free behavior into a free behavior, such that what was perceived as unethical comes to be perceived as ethical. The following two sections address how the instrumental status of behaviors can influence that process based on perceptions about avoiding losses or attaining gains (cf. prospect theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726713482013">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-0018726713482013">
<title>Avoiding losses</title>
<p>Loss or harm avoidance can provide an instrumental-status basis for behavioral expansion on ethical grounds that change the perception of behaviors from non-free to free. A corporate social responsibility in many Japanese companies, for example, has been to provide employees with lifetime employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726713482013">Gilson and Roe, 1999</xref>). Laying-off employees, therefore, has traditionally been considered a non-free behavior. Many big Japanese corporations, however, decided to lay off employees in the late 1990s to avoid bankruptcy and the resultant loss of a larger number of jobs. Letting go a few employees—initially a non-free behavior—thus became a free behavior based on the greater good of avoiding a bigger loss.</p>
<p>A behavior’s perceived instrumental status can also in part depend on the number of people affected by the behavior. When the negative consequences of not engaging in the non-free behaviors apply to a great number of people, the behavior’s instrumental status is more likely to rise and thereby decrease the decision-maker’s motivation to avoid the non-free behavior. In the above example, as the number of employees who would have been affected by a bankruptcy was bigger than the number of employees who would have been affected by a layoff, the instrumental status leading to behavioral expansion was stronger.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 3</italic>: The greater the magnitude of the negative effects of avoiding the non-free behavior, the stronger the instrumental status of the non-free behavior, and the more likely an individual will engage in the non-free behavior (on ethical grounds, for expanded autonomy).</p>
<p><italic>Proposition 4</italic>: The more people negatively affected by avoiding the non-free behavior, the stronger is the instrumental status of the non-free behavior, and the more likely an individual will engage in the non-free behavior (on ethical grounds for expanded autonomy).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0018726713482013">
<title>Attaining gains</title>
<p>The instrumental-status mechanism can also generate behavioral expansion by highlighting the gains such an expansion might create. For example, suppose a staff member at a non-profit organization is trying to obtain funds from a potential donor. That employee might overstate the significance of the organization, and perhaps even exaggerate the “greater good” that could be gained by way of the donation. Although misrepresentation of information is generally considered unethical (i.e. a non-free behavior), the employee might perceive expanded behavioral freedom in view of the donation he/she might be able to attract for a worthy cause (i.e. helping children with cancer). Based on the potential for future gain, therefore, the employee might find sufficient instrumental-status value for his/her behavior. Behaviors with instrumental status relating to gain attainment are expected to have more strength when there are increases in the magnitude of gain and the amount of people who would benefit.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 5</italic>: The greater the magnitude of the positive effects of engaging in the non-free behavior, the stronger is the instrumental status of the non-free behavior, and the more likely an individual will be to engage in the non-free behavior (on ethical grounds, for expanded autonomy).</p>
<p><italic>Proposition 6</italic>: The more people who benefit from the individual’s engagement in the non-free behavior, the stronger is the instrumental status of the non-free behavior, and the more likely an individual will be to engage in the non-free behavior (on ethical grounds for expanded autonomy).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A behavior with an instrumental status based on gain attainment can also be illustrated in another way. Suppose the owner of a company writes a contract for an executive who asks for extra income in a form outside ordinary compensation packages. Many of the same authors who have presented inherent-status arguments in favor of insider trading have made this kind of economic, instrumental case as well (or exclusively). In part the argument can be made on the basis of incentives and competitiveness:<disp-quote>
<p>[I]nequality among players and subsequent ‘abnormal returns’ is the major driving force of our capitalist system. If everyone is condemned to the same competitive position, everything will fall to mediocrity. Why would companies innovate or individuals work harder if they cannot take advantage of their superiority? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713482013">Lekkas, 1998</xref>: 195)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, “executives will have more incentives to put together deals, discover markets and invent products, because they will be able to be the first to use the relevant information to trade in the market and make personal profits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713482013">Lekkas, 1998</xref>: 193).</p>
<p>Related instrumental arguments appeal to efficiency:<disp-quote>
<p>Shares will be traded on real information and reflect the actual status of each company rather than hypothesis and rumors. Therefore the market will be more fair and efficient. Movements of the share-prices will be accelerated and so will resolution of wealth transfers. This will further boost market efficiency, to the benefit of both insiders and outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713482013">Lekkas, 1998</xref>: 193)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Note that, in this last instance, the argument appeals to the greater welfare of society as a whole.</p>
<p>Because insider trading can also be regarded as unethical and that attitude is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726713482013">Manne, 1966</xref>), our analysis applies in the case of the owner who might feel free to contract with an executive in allowing the latter to trade on information before it is made public. On the one hand, we have identified a behavior likely to be perceived by many disinterested observers as unethical. On the other hand, we have shown that a variety of authors have made arguments in favor of insider trading on grounds of both the inherent and the instrumental status of that behavior. Owners convinced by those arguments would perceive that they have the right to allow insider trading. They would feel that the boundaries of their autonomy were wide-stretched enough to give them the freedom to offer contract terms that gave executives the chance to profit by means of insider trading. In short, this example illustrates unethical behavior based on expanded freedom, elicited by associating that behavior with an instrumental status.</p>

<title>Constriction involving a behavior’s inherent status</title>
<p>Organizational behavior considered unethical can occur when employees’ freedoms contract on an inherent basis. Such situations can involve dilemmas when actors feel compelled to act in ways they otherwise would not. In an organization that has a culture of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726713482013">Morrison and Milliken, 2000</xref>), for example, an employee might feel that it is not in his/her scope of duties to voice concerns about an unethical act conducted by another. Although the society might perceive the inaction of the observer to be just as unethical as the unreported transgression, the observer might not perceive it as such because of the lack of freedom or the bounded autonomy he/she perceives as regards voicing a complaint.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 7</italic>: The inherent status of moral principles or social norms can constrict freedom.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A person of higher rank can restrict a behavior of a lower-rank employee by virtue of the inherent status that a high ranking person can associate with the behaviors. An example adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713482013">Perry (2011)</xref> illustrates this point. Robin, a vice-president in charge of three divisions of a large firm, learns from the company’s president that one of those divisions will be sold. The president insists that she not reveal that information, and she makes that promise. In particular she gives assurances that she will keep the information completely confidential from all employees. Meanwhile rumors about the possibility of a sale circulate anyway, and Robin knows that employees have begun to wonder whether they should worry about their job security, cut back on planned purchases, look for work elsewhere, and so on. No one actually ever asks Robin about this (in our adaptation), however, and she keeps her promise not to reveal what she knows.</p>
<p>Once more we merely stipulate that some hypothetical outside observers might consider this unethical, at least under some imaginable circumstances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713482013">Perry (2011)</xref>, in fact, embellishes the circumstances in that direction by describing a voicemail message left for Robin by a friend of 20 years who has heard the rumors and wants to know whether it is time to start sending out résumés. Behavior that is unethical by virtue of commission (lying) might occur under those circumstances, whereas we are illustrating how a promise to the president could lead to what might be considered an unethical act of omission. In other words, we describe this as a situation in which the perceived lack of freedom to reveal information: (a) fails to prevent consequences detrimental to others’ welfare (i.e. is ethically problematic); and (b) makes Robin feel compelled to act in accord with an inherent status granted to that constriction of bounded autonomy, namely the status of an obligation that trumps all others.</p>
<p><disp-quote>

<title>Constriction as a result of instrumental status</title>
<p>Employees can also conform to behavioral restrictions and transform free behaviors to non-free behaviors through the mechanism of instrumental status. As in the case of behavioral expansion, the two fundamental bases for behavioral restriction associated with instrumental status-value are: (a) avoiding losses, or (b) attaining gains.</p>
<sec id="section17-0018726713482013">
<title>Avoiding losses</title>
<p>The strength of an instrumental-status mechanism increases as the magnitude of negative effects that result from engaging in the free behavior increases. Loss or harm avoidance can provide an instrumental-status association for behavioral restrictions on ethical grounds. For example, a company might find sufficient justification not to provide basic benefits to employees when severely decreased dividends for shareholders are at stake. Instrumental-status strength also in part depends on the number of people affected. As the negative consequences of engaging in the free behavior apply to more people, that increases decision-makers’ ethical motivation to avoid the free behavior.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 9</italic>: The greater the magnitude of the negative effects of engaging in the free behavior, the stronger the instrumental status of restricting the free behavior, and the more likely an individual will conform to the behavioral restriction.</p>
<p><italic>Proposition 10</italic>: The greater the number of people who are negatively affected by engaging in the free behavior, the stronger the instrumental status of restricting the free behavior, and the more likely an individual will conform to the behavioral restriction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0018726713482013">
<title>Attaining gains</title>
<p>The strength of the instrumental-status mechanism on behavioral restrictions can also rise with the magnitude of the gains created. For example, a competent and conscientious employee who had recently made an error on a particularly bad day might ask a colleague not to report the error because of fear it might jeopardize his/her chances of getting a promotion he/she has been waiting to get. The colleague who knows his friend as a good employee and as deserving of the promotion might refrain from reporting the error because he knows the error will not reoccur, and it will be better for the department as a whole if his friend is promoted. Because of perceived future gains, the colleague might think it was ethical on instrumental grounds not to speak up about the error. Instrumentally-based ethical perceptions relating to gain attainment are expected to strengthen when there is an increase in the magnitude of gain and the amount of people who would benefit.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 11</italic>: The greater the magnitude of positive effects of restricting the free behavior, the stronger the instrumental value of restricting the free behavior, and the more likely an individual will be to conform to the behavioral restriction.</p>
<p><italic>Proposition 12</italic>: The greater the number of people who benefit from restricting the free behavior, the stronger the instrumental value of restricting the free behavior, and the more likely an individual will be to conform to the behavioral restriction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We can also illustrate the impact of the instrumental-status mechanism in another way. Our adapted version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713482013">Perry’s (2011)</xref> vignette did not include an element present in the original, which enhanced what was at stake from the company’s point of view. In particular, the president’s insistence on strict confidentiality was based on fears “that any potential deal might be compromised” if word got out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713482013">Perry, 2011</xref>: 393)—and the division in question potentially might net the company an estimated $1.9 million. This illustrates the instrumental status of behaviors based on a perceived connection between how one behaves and what might happen. If Robin perceives that a lot hangs in the balance based on what she does or does not do, then she might guide her actions accordingly. The scales might be tipped in favor of silence if, for example, she thinks in terms of the welfare of all the other employees in the other divisions (and the rest of the company), not to mention the benefit for shareholders if a profitable deal goes through. Any number of things can give behavior instrumental status in a business context, of course, because that is the essence of risk−return relationships and cost−benefit analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0018726713482013">
<title>Perceived instrumental status: Loss avoidance versus gain attainment</title>
<p>It must be noted that the instrumental status of a behavior is based on individuals’ <italic>perceived</italic> utility of the behavior and not the objective utility of the behavior. The perceived utility of a behavior can vary as a function of a number of different factors. Prospect theory, for example, suggests that individuals perceive more utility from avoiding a loss than from attaining a gain of similar value, even though the objective utility for the individual is the same in both cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726713482013">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>). Therefore, in addition to the magnitude of the outcomes and the number of people affected by the decision, the perceived instrumental status of a behavior can be influenced by a variety of cognitive biases, such as the one articulated in prospect theory.</p>
<p>The way in which cognitive biases affect perceptions of instrumental status is particularly relevant to understanding how people might behave when they are faced with a situation that involves the competing goals of gain attainment versus loss avoidance. Considering the propositions articulated in prospect theory, an individual would be more likely to conform to a behavioral restriction or an expansion to pursue a goal of loss avoidance over a goal of gain attainment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Proposition 13</italic>: Individuals will perceive greater instrumental value for behavioral expansion or constriction to pursue a goal for loss avoidance than for gain attainment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above proposition is an illustration of how instrumental status can be determined by non-objective facets. We do not imply that the perceived instrumental value of behavioral expansion and constriction is only influenced by the cognitive bias articulated in prospect theory. Similar biases that affect the instrumental status of constricting or expanding a behavior can arise from various aspects of a decision (e.g. counterfactuals instigated; how potential options and outcome are anchored), as well as the decision-maker (e.g. acceleration of commitment to a project; short- vs long-term orientation). Agency theory, for example, describes how organizational incentives encourage managers to adopt a short-term orientation that contradicts the long-term orientation of shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726713482013">Narayanan, 1985</xref>). As such, under the assumptions of agency theory, behavioral contractions or expansions that render short-term benefits might appear to have more instrumental status for a manager with a short-term orientation, relative to behaviors that render long-term benefits.</p>

<title>Theoretical implications</title>
<p>The theoretical advances from a bounded-autonomy analysis improve the interpretation of deonance. The introduction of deonance was associated with a particular type of finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726713482013">Turillo et al., 2002</xref>), namely conditions under which third-party observers: (a) were angry based on the conduct of someone’s behavior that was perceived as offensive and unjust, but had no effect on them personally; (b) were willing to make a financial sacrifice to punish that person; and (c) did so despite no tangible benefits. Subsequent investigations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726713482013">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>) focused on the aspect of reactions to perceived injustice; indeed, the term <italic>deontic justice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713482013">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>) became associated with a deonance perspective. We have instead analyzed bounded autonomy as an elaboration of deonance theory applicable to business behavioral ethics, particularly in terms of the inherent or instrumental status of behaviors.</p>
<p>This analysis involved re-casting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm’s (1966)</xref> <italic>legitimacy</italic> as the perception of a behavior’s <italic>inherent status</italic>, namely considering it free/restricted based on perceptions of built-in qualities that entail its permissibility/restriction and hence the right to exercise/not exercise it. The analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726713482013">Turillo et al.’s (2002)</xref> findings in terms of the inherent status of behaviors, therefore, does not need to invoke notions of justice. The self-sacrificing participants in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726713482013">Turillo et al. (2002)</xref> studies exercised the free behavior of punishing someone. In other words, they treated it as a morally permitted behavior, one they had a right to exercise even though it served no instrumental purpose. This analysis involved re-casting that response option as a free behavior in conformance with a perception that the punished person acted inappropriately.</p>
<p>As noted elsewhere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726713482013">Folger and Cropanzano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726713482013">Folger and Skarlicki, 2008</xref>), such reactions can often occur in a fashion that seems not to involve conscious rational processing; rather, they seem to be like the type of intuition-based, automatic reactions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713482013">Haidt (2008)</xref> has described in characterizing moral emotions. Our discussion of the instrumental mechanism referred to the effects of avoiding losses and attaining gains as highlighted by prospect theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726713482013">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>), which attributes them to a similar type of processing below the level of conscious awareness. The instrumental effects addressed in our analysis, therefore, need not occur on the basis of deliberative cognitive processing.</p>
<p>In fact, gain/loss effects are merely illustrative of a host of other cognitive factors that could be instrumental in nature—some in an automatic fashion and others in more purposeful manner, some on a more instantaneously emotional basis and some a function of calculative reasoning, and so on. When frame-of-reference effects occur, for example, the instrumental effects of a behavior can seem large in a way that makes a person inclined to perceive the behavior as one worth performing, or seem small (as a function of a different referent standard whose influence the person might not recognize) and less worth performing.</p>
<p>Inherent effects are no less subject to processing that can occur below the level of conscious awareness. Indeed, “It just seemed like the right [or wrong] thing to do” is an expression that reflects an inherent reaction of an intuitive, automatic, and perhaps emotion-laden nature. The inherent reaction regarding what a behavior “is,” by its very nature, can also result from the acceptance of a persuasive rationale—such as might be the case if someone becomes convinced (based on a set of arguments perceived as totally logical) that insider trading represents a property-rights issue. On the other hand, a behavior can seem morally repulsive by its very nature, in which case automatically triggered emotions might tend to have greater influence than carefully thought-out beliefs. We stress, therefore, that our analysis of bounded autonomy has been designed to cover a broader range of processing (across levels of awareness) than was the case with deontic-justice treatments of righteous indignation by third-party observers.</p>
<sec id="section21-0018726713482013">
<title>Relationship to other concepts and literatures</title>
<p>The concept of the inherent status of a behavior has other implications as well, including some that bear on the related concepts of sacred/protected values, moral mandates, taboo or tragic tradeoffs, and the like. To refer to an inherent characteristic simply means someone perceives the behavior as having certain qualities that make it the behavior it is (i.e. is perceived as being), just as a person might perceive that a painting has certain aesthetic qualities. Perceiving that a behavior has a sacred or protected value amounts to perceiving that it possesses certain qualities, such as the belief that abortion has the quality of involving issues related to certain kinds of rights (e.g. of the mother and of the fetus), that make it what it is (e.g. a woman’s right to choose; the right-to-life of the fetus). In the case of sacred/protected values, the perception of the behavior’s inherent qualities—of falling into a certain category, of being the kind of behavior it is—can be taken to indicate certain kinds of things about conduct as concomitant qualities (e.g. banning abortion clinics; guaranteeing insurance coverage for birth control). But the literature on sacred/protected values refers to believing in an inestimable, incommensurable value that does not equate with any level of compensation, whereas an inherent status can involve a behavior, one or more features of that behavior, the behavior in general or in a specific context, to some degree or fully, and so forth. Issues of business ethics are no different in that respect, which makes the deontic analysis in terms of bounded autonomy uniquely relevant and more widely applicable.</p>
<p>Identifying something of inherent or instrumental status associated with a behavior makes it clearer that even the reference to a behavior as having an inherent status does not mean that some quality resides forever within that behavior. In fact, our emphasis on an inherent or an instrumental status as matters of perception indicates that such perceptions can accommodate the phenomena of framing. As our illustrations of insider trading have indicated, for example, that type of activity can be treated like a free behavior (morally permissible as a right) on either an inherent or an instrumental basis. Stockholders who choose to vote a certain way rather than give their vote as a proxy to the board, for example, might do so because they feel proud exercising that privilege as a right, or because they hope their vote will have an impact on the outcome.</p>
<p>Two other implications from our analysis bring new meaning to the concept of deonance, both having to do with how it relates to duty or obligation. First, someone can do something out of a sense of duty or obligation based on perceiving a behavior in terms of its inherent status, its instrumental status, or both. When Friedman referred to a corporation’s fiduciary duty to its stockholders, for example, that meant on the one hand the company should engage in certain kinds of behaviors and not others because of responsibilities that are or are not appropriate for business (as Friedman perceived this issue). Certain types of responsibilities are inherent to the relationship of corporation and stockholder. On the other hand, those responsibilities clearly have an explicit, instrumental status as well: The company’s executives have a duty to strive to provide a good return on the stockholder’s investment.</p>
<p>Second, on a closely related note, our analysis sharpens terminology. Because deonance as behavioral ethics differs from deontology as normative philosophy, even though they share the same Greek root, a behavior’s instrumental status can relate it to the deontic terminology of <italic>may, must</italic>, and <italic>must not</italic>, just as readily as its inherent status might. Both refer to the limits that make up bounded autonomy—that is, grounds for holding people accountable because of inherent or instrumental responsibilities. By the same token, the instrumental status of a behavior can stem from someone’s perceptions of utilitarian responsibilities concerning the greater good.</p>
<p>Deonance as a behavioral ethics theory, therefore, does not assign higher priority either to perceived moral duties that might be derived on the basis of a deontological normative philosophy, or to perceived moral duties that might be derived on the basis of a consequentialist normative philosophy such as utilitarianism. Clearly the instrumental status of a behavior makes it eligible for a normative analysis from the perspective of a consequentialist ethical philosophy such as utilitarianism, and the inherent status of a behavior can lend itself to a deontological analysis. That type of relationship between empirical and normative approaches—although not an isomorphic, one-to-one equivalence—is a strength and advantage of deonance theory.</p>
<p>Making a comparison between a previous deonance analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713482013">Folger, 2012</xref>) and the present one can highlight this type of advantage. In that prior framework, the dimension now modified as the concept of a behavior’s inherent status was instead associated directly with the deontological outlook of normative ethics. The specific connection involved analyzing that dimension in terms of the Kantian distinction between perfect and imperfect duties. Difficulties abound, however, in pinning down what that distinction might entail: absolute duties versus non-absolute, degrees of discretion, negative versus positive duties, and dictates expressed in “thou shalt not” terms (e.g. do not harm) or “thou shalt” terms (e.g. do help). Because all those types of distinctions involve classifications about what type of action a behavior <italic>is</italic>, in its inherent nature, our analysis indicates a way to take an overarching approach, rather than having to focus only on one particular way of thinking about ethical behavior and organizational justice.</p>

<title>Business behavioral ethics in a fresh light</title>
<p>To emphasize parallels with moral duties, we have avoided examples of instrumental behaviors directed toward a self-serving interest. The CEO who believes in insider trading as a property right, for example, illustrates a response in terms of the inherent status of a behavior that might otherwise seem self-serving; and when we gave insider trading illustrations of its instrumental status, we cited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713482013">Lekkas (1998)</xref>, among others, as claiming that benefits such as market efficiency could accrue in ways that would benefit outsiders as well as insiders (i.e. improve societal welfare overall). The deonance theory use of bounded autonomy differentiates it from other behavioral ethics approaches in that respect. Typically, those other lines of research involve investigations of why people cheat, lie, or act unethically in other ways for the sake of self-benefit (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726713482013">Malhotra and Gino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726713482013">Shu et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, such studies often involve the creation of situations in which people would otherwise act ethically if not for features introduced to make that less likely (e.g. a monetary temptation and a chance to reap more than the deserved amount in an apparently undiscoverable manner). Finally, the overall thrust of such research has more to do with the lack of self-regulation known as moral disengagement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726713482013">Detert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482013">Moore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726713482013">White et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, we have illustrated how the inherent or instrumental status of a behavior can indicate how to meet moral obligations by deliberately exercising self-regulation, thereby involving its presence rather than its absence.</p>
<p>Applying the bounded autonomy concept to business behavioral ethics has demonstrated the value in recognizing how rights/duties tensions shape behaviors. Their interaction as potentially opposing forces provides an interpretation for the difference between the freedom-asserting tendencies seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482013">Brehm’s (1966)</xref> reactance studies and the apparent passivity seen in studies on obedience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726713482013">Milgram, 1965</xref>) and conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726713482013">Asch, 1952</xref>). We noted that the potential for obedience or conformity could occur in conjunction with psychological mechanisms capable of dampening freedom-assertion tendencies. Two such mechanisms, we argued, can act to affect perceptions of a behavior’s inherent status or its instrumental status. Thus Asch-like conformity and Milgram-like obedience can occur when the conforming or obedient behavior seems appropriate on either an inherent or instrumental basis—rather than having neither such status, in which case resistance to conformity or obedience becomes the more predominant motivation.</p>
<p>By extending that analysis to a conception of a behavior’s inherent or instrumental ethical status, however, we also showed how it could apply to the expansion of autonomy, as well as its constriction. When a behavior has seemed as if it were free to exercise because it was ethical on either basis, it can fall into a constricted category when an opposing inherent or instrumental perception is activated. Someone who would have felt free to talk about a subject (e.g. report a misdeed or reveal plans for the implementation of a new policy), for instance, might instead keep silent without trying to reassert that freedom if silence takes on enough of an inherent or instrumental status.</p>
<p>The same analysis, therefore, allowed us to bring a fresh perspective to bear on pro-social rule-breaking and related concepts. That perspective comes from noting that just as the inherent or instrumental status of a behavior can cause someone not to do something, the same two psychological mechanisms can operate to expand perceptions of what it is permissible to do. In other words, behaviors subject to restriction as a function of inherent or instrumental status might be susceptible to the opposite, non-restricted perception on the basis of an alternative perception of status. We indicated how that was true for insider trading in terms of literatures that give either inherent-status or instrumental-status rationales for its ethicality. Pro-social rule-breaking, we argued, fits into the same form of analysis when it is seen as actually instrumental for the benefit of the organization or one of its members. The difference is that the majority of outside observers would be (by definition of pro-social) likely to classify the latter form of activity as falling into the positive (ethical) category as well as the instrumental-status category, whereas someone with the conventional perception of insider trading might understand but not accept an instrumental rationale for it (i.e. have an aversion to it and remain convinced it belongs in a negative, unethical category).</p>
<p>In short, we have offered a broad framework that approaches business behavioral ethics from a new direction. That approach has also taken deonance theory in new directions by elaborating one of its foundational concepts (bounded autonomy) that has not previously received attention. Additional progress seems possible by conceptualizing behaviors as capable of possessing inherent or instrumental status. Overall, then, we admit not being able to answer the questions we posed at the outset, but we have tried to show that they point to promising opportunities for future theory and research.</p>
