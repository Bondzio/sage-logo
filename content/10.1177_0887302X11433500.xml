<abstract>
<p>This study examined consumers' responses to apparel companies' use of hang tags to emphasize their socially responsible (SR) business practices. Informed by the theory of reasoned action, this research explored the impact of environmentally-friendly production and fair labor messages upon consumers' evaluations of hang tags as well as their attitudes and purchase intentions toward an apparel brand. Messages varied in content (eco-fashion vs. fair labor), explicitness (low vs. high), and third-party SR logo (absence vs. presence). Data were collected through an online survey of 764 adults. Findings suggest that apparel companies may benefit from using hang tags featuring explicit messages and logos to convey their SR business practices. The use of explicit messages and logos produced favorable evaluations of hang tags and positive attitudes toward the apparel brand, which predicted purchase intentions. Findings provide a basis for the development of policy regarding the regulation of information presented on hang tags.

<body>
<p>Conventionally, apparel companies have used hang tags to convey brand name, build brand identity, educate consumers about product attributes, inform consumers about a company’s mission and ethos, and reinforce both product labeling and advertising, which, in turn, may guide consumers' merchandise selections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X11433500">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X11433500">Chowdhary, 2003</xref>). More recently, apparel companies have begun to use hang tags to emphasize their identities as socially responsible (SR) businesses, referencing their commitment to the environment, fair labor, education, and other social causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X11433500">Jana, 2007</xref>). In so doing, these companies demonstrate an orientation toward the environment and toward people that simultaneously balances ethics and profitability and that supports positive outcomes, which is consistent with academic conceptualizations of SR apparel business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X11433500">Dickson &amp; Eckman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X11433500">Joergens, 2006</xref>). To this end, companies have designed hang tags to include written text, symbolic imagery (e.g., a leaf or a drop of water to convey a commitment to the environment), and/or third-party certifications or logos in order to verify SR marketing claims. Within the trade literature, however, it has been suggested that consumers may be confused or overwhelmed by the inclusion of too much information on hang tags, such as the overuse of technical jargon and explicit illustrations or an overemphasis upon the “product story” presented in lieu of product benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X11433500">Baker, 2002</xref>). Similarly, a policy recommendation put forth by the University of Delaware’s Sustainable Apparel Initiative (UDSAI) has suggested that, within their marketing initiatives, apparel firms should aim to present information in a precise, clear, and factual manner (University of Delaware’s Sustainable Apparel Initiative [UDSAI], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X11433500">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the academic literature, there is limited research addressing the perceived usefulness of hang tags as an information source or the influence of information included on hang tags upon consumers' attitudes and behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow, McEachern, and Jeffrey (2005)</xref> found that only 11% of British consumers frequently look at the label of branded apparel prior to purchase, thus raising questions about the value of hang tags in the minds of consumers. Further, research exploring the influence of SR labeling upon consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions toward apparel brands has yielded inconsistent results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt &amp; Bernard, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X11433500">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow, McEachern, &amp; Jeffrey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X11433500">Prasad, Kimeldorf, Meyer, &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>). Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine consumers' responses to SR messages on apparel hang tags (i.e., point-of-purchase promotional communications). As such, this study explored the impact of varied messages upon consumers' evaluations of hang tags and their attitudes and patronage intentions toward brand name apparel. Messages varied in terms of content (ecofashion vs. fair labor), explicitness (low vs. high), and third-party SR logo (absence vs. presence).</p>

<title>Apparel Labels and Hang Tags</title>
<p>Apparel labels and hang tags are used in combination by apparel manufacturers to provide consumers with legally mandated information (e.g., fiber content, care instructions, country of origin) as well as information designed to educate consumers about product attributes and benefits such as brand name, specialized construction/production techniques, environmental benefits, labor standards, and high-performance technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X11433500">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887302X11433500">Thomas, 2008</xref>). The information provided on apparel labels and hang tags may be presented in the form of text and graphics (i.e., symbols), may vary in terms of explicitness, and may include third-party certifications or logos, all of which may shape consumers' responses to products and brands.</p>
<p>Several studies provide insight into the general usefulness of SR labels (e.g., eco and no sweat) for marketing apparel products, including the influence of such labels upon consumers' attitudes or purchase intentions. In their examination of ethical apparel purchase decisions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow and colleagues (2005)</xref> surveyed British consumers regarding their use of apparel labels to gain product information and found that 39% did not look at the label of branded apparel prior to purchase, 50% looked infrequently, and 11% looked frequently. In another survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson (2001)</xref> found that U.S. consumers who used “no sweat” labels to gain information about apparel production methods held more positive attitudes toward SR businesses than did those who did not use the labels. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson (2001)</xref> discovered that when purchasing apparel, women were more likely than were men to use and be influenced by “no sweat” labels. By comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt and Bernard (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X11433500">2010</xref>) found some inconsistent differences by gender in consumers' responses to the SR labeling of apparel products. Building upon this work, the first research question addresses the influence of gender upon consumers' perceptions of the general usefulness of hang tags:<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Message content</title>
<p>Work examining consumers' responses to information included in SR marketing claims for apparel products implies that the use of “eco” and “no sweat” labels may resonate with some consumers, whereas for others, such claims may be less salient when compared to other product attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X11433500">Prasad et al., 2004</xref>). In an experiment conducted in a department store, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X11433500">Prasad, Kimeldorf, Meyer, and Robinson (2004)</xref> found that, as the price difference increased between socks labeled (using in-store signage) as produced under “good working conditions” and identical socks that were not labeled as such, the percentage of consumers who purchased the labeled socks decreased. Recent findings, however, suggest that the influence of SR labels on consumers' apparel purchase decisions may be increasing. Based upon their experimental auction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt and Bernard (2008)</xref> concluded that consumers were willing to pay higher prices for socks labeled as “organic” (vs. not organic/conventional) and nongenetically modified (vs. genetically modified/conventional). In a later experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt and Bernard (2010)</xref> found that consumers with a predisposition toward SR and fair trade demonstrated a greater willingness to pay higher prices for t-shirts when labor-related information was provided on labels (vs. when no such information was provided). Similarly, with their in-store experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X11433500">Hiscox and Smyth (2007)</xref> found that consumers were willing to pay more for towels and candles that were labeled (using in-store signage) as being made under good labor standards, even when the prices for such items were raised by 10–20%.</p>

<title>Message explicitness</title>
<p>Research suggests message explicitness—the degree of precision and specificity provided in a communication—may influence consumers' responses to promotional communications as well as their attitudes and purchase intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X11433500">Ahearne, Gruen, &amp; Saxton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X11433500">Sawyer &amp; Howard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan, Hyllegard, &amp; Blaesi, 2010</xref>). Apparel brands often use implicit messages (sometimes, brand name only) to symbolically communicate meaning to consumers. When there is shared understanding of unstated information such as product function or brand image, as is often the case with apparel, implicit communication may be desirable because it is less distracting and more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X11433500">Feng &amp; Burleson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X11433500">Lorek &amp; Lucas, 2003</xref>). When shared understanding is limited, however, explicit communication may be preferable because consumers are less likely to misinterpret precise and specific messages. For instance, given the difficulty experienced by consumers when interpreting vague or complex SR marketing claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X11433500">Aspers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887302X11433500">Moisander, 2007</xref>), companies selling ecofashion or fair labor/trade products may benefit from the use of more explicit messages to provide better understanding and to encourage more positive reactions among consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X11433500">Cotton Incorporated, 2009</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X11433500">Aspers (2008)</xref> proposed that companies can influence consumers' willingness to pay higher prices to improve working conditions and the environment by providing labels that clearly convey the SR characteristics of the product. The argument for greater clarity also is supported by a recent survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan et al., 2010</xref>) revealing that participants who viewed an advertisement containing an explicit message about the ecofriendly characteristics of jeans reported more positive attitudes toward the brand than did those who viewed an advertisement containing an implicit message. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt and Bernard (2010)</xref> found that the presentation of ambiguous versus explicit labor-related information did not influence the amount of money that consumers bid for labeled t-shirts in an experimental auction.</p>

<sec id="section6-0887302X11433500">
<title>Third-party certification/logo</title>
<p>Although few researchers have explored the impact of the inclusion of a third-party certification or logo in promotional communications on consumers' attitudes and purchases intentions, it has been suggested that third-party environmental claims may improve consumers' evaluations of a product’s environmental performance or quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X11433500">Cason &amp; Gangadharan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X11433500">Scammon &amp; Mayer, 1995</xref>). This suggestion is supported by findings from an experiment conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887302X11433500">Rios, Martinez, Moreno, and Soriano (2006)</xref>, which revealed that the inclusion of a third-party environmental certification on product brochures strengthened Spanish women’s beliefs about the environmental performance of a brand of laundry detergent. Findings from a subsequent survey adopting a similar approach revealed that although the inclusion of third-party “guaranteed” environmental information or certification did not improve Spanish women’s attitudes toward brands of milk or laundry detergent, it did enhance consumers' confidence in the veracity of the environmental claims made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X11433500">Montoro-Rios, Luque-Martinez, &amp; Rodriguez-Molina, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The second research question extends prior work exploring how message content, message explicitness, and third-party SR logo may shape consumers' responses to promotional communications (e.g., advertisements, brochures, labels) by focusing specifically upon how such factors may influence consumers' evaluations of apparel hang tags:<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Clothing Involvement</title>
<p>Clothing involvement has been defined as an individual’s interest in, attention to, or attachment to fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X11433500">O’Cass, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887302X11433500">Sproles &amp; King, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X11433500">Tigert, Ring, &amp; King, 1976</xref>). Clothing involvement may influence consumers' product knowledge, confidence in making decisions about clothing, purchase behaviors, and responses to apparel advertisements and other promotional communications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X11433500">Kim, Damhorst, &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X11433500">O’Cass, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X11433500">Tigert et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). In a survey of consumers' responses to a print advertisement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X11433500">Kim, Damhorst, and Lee (2002)</xref> found that clothing involvement influenced beliefs about apparel product attributes. The researchers also found that beliefs about product attributes and attitudes toward the advertisement influenced consumers' attitudes toward the apparel product. Likewise, in their survey of consumers' responses to environmental advertising claims, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan and colleagues (2010)</xref> discovered that ecofashion involvement (an adapted measure of clothing involvement) influenced consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions toward an apparel brand. These studies demonstrate the importance of clothing involvement in the apparel purchase decision and suggest that this variable may, in part, explain consumers' purchases of ecofashion.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-0887302X11433500">
<title>SR Behaviors</title>
<p>One’s concern over or knowledge about SR business practices also may influence one’s decisions related to product purchase, product disposal, and store patronage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X11433500">Butler &amp; Francis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X11433500">Hawley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt &amp; Bernard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X11433500">Kozar &amp; Connell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X11433500">Ogle, Hyllegard, &amp; Dunbar, 2004</xref>). Further, although findings are somewhat mixed, there is evidence to suggest that concern over or knowledge about SR business practices may influence consumers' responses to SR marketing claims. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X11433500">Kim, Forney, and Arnold (1997)</xref> found that consumers with high environmental concerns responded more positively to apparel advertisements featuring environmentally friendly claims than they did to advertisements that did not contain such claims. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X11433500">Kim and Damhorst (1999)</xref> found no difference in consumers' responses to advertisements with or without environmental claims. Findings from Yan et al. (2010) that an individual's environmental commitment did not influence his/her attitude toward an apparel ad featuring an environmental claim, but did influence his/her attitude toward and intent to purchase an apparel brand. Further, in contrast to earlier findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X11433500">Dickson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X11433500">Kim &amp; Damhorst, 1998</xref>), both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow and colleagues (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X11433500">Kozar and Connell (2010)</xref> discovered that a considerable number of consumers possess knowledge about SR (or irresponsible) business practices in the apparel industry. For example, findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow and colleagues' (2005)</xref> survey of British adult consumers revealed that 96% of males and 88% of females claimed awareness of child labor in the apparel industry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X11433500">Kozar and Connell (2010)</xref> found that over 50% of college students reported knowledge of SR practices; however, only about 25% reported that they had engaged in SR apparel purchasing behaviors. This finding suggests that knowledge of industry practices may not be the best predictor of SR apparel purchasing behaviors and demonstrates the need for more research to determine the factors, including past purchasing behaviors, which may influence patronage intentions. The third research question builds upon this work to explore how personal characteristics may shape consumers' responses to promotional communications:<list list-type="bullet">

As such, this research was informed by the theory of reasoned action, which proposes that two factors—a person’s attitude toward a given behavior and his or her subjective norm (i.e., his or her perception of the desirability of the behavior to important others)—contribute to his/her behavioral intention. This relationship can be expressed as BI = (A<sub>B</sub>)w<sub>1</sub>+ (SN)w<sub>2</sub>, where BI denotes behavioral intention, A<sub>B</sub> denotes attitude toward the behavior, SN denotes subjective norm, and w<sub>1</sub> and w<sub>2</sub> denote the weights of the respective factors. Attitude toward the behavior is calculated as A<sub>B</sub> = ∑b<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>
</sub>e<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>,</sub> which represents the summed product of belief strength (b<sub>
<italic>i</italic>
</sub>) and belief evaluation (e<sub>
<italic>i</italic>
</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X11433500">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X11433500">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). Belief strength is the extent to which a person believes a behavior or its outcome to be true or probable, whereas belief evaluation is the importance of the belief. Subjective norm is the summed product of normative belief (NB<sub>
<italic>i</italic>
</sub>) and motivation to comply with others (MC<sub>i</sub>), and is expressed as SN = ∑NB<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>
</sub>MC<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>.</sub> A person’s perceptions about what others think or believe constitute his/her normative beliefs. One’s motivation to comply refers to the extent to which a person wants to do what others think that he/she should do. As such, behavioral intention can also be expressed algebraically as BI = ∑b<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>
</sub>e<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>
</sub> + ∑NB<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>
</sub>MC<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>.</sub>

<p>In the present work, the classic model based upon the theory of reasoned action was used to predict consumers' patronage intentions toward “GOOD CLOTHES,” a fictitious apparel brand. This model reflects the premise that hang tags may shape consumers' attitudes toward an apparel brand. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that may influence consumers' intentions, the classic model was extended to include variables external to the theory. The variables added to the model included personal characteristics such as gender, clothing involvement, and past SR apparel purchasing behaviors. The addition of variables not included in the original theory is in keeping with recommendations made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X11433500">Ajzen and Fishbein (1980)</xref> as well as prior work exploring the importance of “moral” or “ethical” influences in personal actions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X11433500">Manstead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X11433500">Sparks &amp; Shepherd, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing upon the literature reviewed as well as the theory of reasoned action, three additional research questions were developed to guide this study. The fourth research question stems from literature on the topic of SR marketing claims (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests that consumers' responses to hang tags may shape their attitudes toward products and brands. The final research questions explore the relationships among attitude, subjective norm, personal characteristics, and purchase intentions.<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Experimental Design and Survey</title>
<p>A 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design involving the manipulation of three variables—message content (ecofashion vs. fair labor), message explicitness (low vs. high), and third-party SR logo (absence vs. presence)—was conducted to address the research questions posed in this study. These manipulations resulted in eight hang tag stimuli (four examples are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X11433500">Figure 1</xref>
). Two additional hang tags were created for control purposes, one that included the apparel brand name GOOD CLOTHES only and a second hang tag that included the apparel brand name and a third-party SR logo. The third-party SR logo used in this study is the official logo of the organization, “Business for Social Responsibility” (BSR). This logo was selected to imply external credibility or “certification” for the SR messages provided on the apparel hang tag stimuli. BSR’s membership includes multiple, well-known U.S. apparel brands, and therefore, the logo may have meaning for consumers who are informed about SR apparel practices.</p>

<p>Data were collected through an online survey. Snowball sampling was used to generate a large, heterogeneous sample. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887302X11433500">Wells, Valacich, and Hess (2011)</xref>, the researchers identified a convenience sample of 50 undergraduates (i.e., seed participants), who, in turn, were asked to recruit apparel shoppers within their social networks (e.g., family members, friends, colleagues) to complete the online survey. The survey instrument contained demographic items as well as multi-item measures of consumers' hang tag use, perceptions of hang tag value, clothing involvement, past SR apparel purchasing behaviors, and evaluations of hang tags. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action, the instrument also included measures of attitude, subjective norm, and behavioral intention. Exploratory factor analyses with Varimax rotation were conducted to refine multi-item measures. Eigenvalues greater than one and scree plots were used to determine the number of factors for each scale. Results indicated that all items loaded on a single factor. Cronbach’s αs are reported to represent the reliability of all multi-item scales.</p>

<title>Instrument Measures</title>
<sec id="section15-0887302X11433500">
<title>Hang tag use</title>
<p>The measure of participants' use of the information provided on hang tags when shopping for clothing included three questions, which were assessed on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 7 = <italic>always</italic>). The first question was, “When shopping for clothing, how often do you read the information printed on hang tags?” The second question was, “When shopping for clothing, does the information printed on hang tags inform your purchase decision?” The third question, “When you read hang tags on clothing, what type of information do you look for?” required participants to assess the frequency with which they looked for information about six apparel attributes—brand name, care instructions, construction methods, country of origin, fiber content, and SR business practices—commonly featured on clothing hang tags.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0887302X11433500">
<title>Perceptions of hang tag value</title>
<p>Participants' perceptions of the value of apparel hang tags were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) using 5 items. Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with the statements that, “The information provided on clothing hang tags is….” (a) believable, (b) credible, (c) trustworthy, (d) reliable, and (e) accurate. This scale was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X11433500">Feltham (1994)</xref> with one change; to tap participants' perceptions of the veracity of the content included on the hang tags, the word “accurate” was substituted for the word “dependable” (Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .97).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0887302X11433500">
<title>Clothing involvement</title>
<p>Seven items, measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), were used to assess clothing involvement. The scale included 6 items from the consumer involvement profile (CIP) modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X11433500">Mittal (1995)</xref>, one of which was reverse scored. The additional item, “I have a strong interest in clothing,” was borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X11433500">Beatty and Talpade (1994</xref>; Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .95).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0887302X11433500">
<title>SR apparel purchasing behaviors</title>
<p>The scale used to measure participants' past SR apparel purchasing behaviors included 8 items adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X11433500">Kozar and Connell (2010)</xref> and one additional item that was added to tap into participants' concerns about child labor. These items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>; Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .95).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0887302X11433500">
<title>Evaluations of hang tags</title>
<p>For the evaluation of the hang tags, each participant viewed a single, randomly assigned hang tag stimulus. The number of participants who viewed each hang tag was distributed relatively evenly across the 10 stimuli, ranging from 64 to 93 participants per stimulus. Prior to evaluating the hang tag stimuli, participants were instructed to read a brief statement indicating that GOOD CLOTHES sells clothing for men and women at affordable prices. No information about environmentally friendly production practices, fair labor practices, or SR production practices was provided to participants in this statement so as not to bias their perceptions of GOOD CLOTHES and to approximate an actual shopping situation wherein consumers must rely upon their own knowledge base to interpret information provided on apparel hang tags. Participants evaluated the apparel hang tags on a 7-point semantic differential scale that included 15 items adapted from previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X11433500">Feltham, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X11433500">Holmes &amp; Crocker, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X11433500">Lastovicka, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887302X11433500">Olney, Holbrook, &amp; Batra, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887302X11433500">Sciglimpaglia, Belch, &amp; Cain, 1979</xref>). The items, or endpoints, were unappealing/appealing, inappropriate/appropriate, ineffective/effective, unethical/ethical, uninformative/informative, not emotion-evoking/emotion-evoking, not valuable/valuable, not important/important, disinteresting/interesting, untruthful/truthful, unconvincing/convincing, not useful/useful, not confusing/confusing, not credible/credible, and did not make an impression on me/did make an impression on me. Eight items were reverse scored. Items were summed and averaged to create composite scores for each hang tag (Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .94).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0887302X11433500">
<title>Attitude</title>
<p>Participants' beliefs (i.e., belief strength) about GOOD CLOTHES' engagement in environmentally friendly production practices, fair labor practices, and SR production practices were assessed on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>; Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .83). The same 7-point scale was used to measure perceived importance of beliefs (i.e., belief evaluation). Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with the statement that, “It is important for clothing companies to…” (a) engage in environmentally friendly production practices, (b) engage in fair labor practices, and (c) engage in SR production practices (Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .95). Consistent with the theory of reasoned action, attitude scores were created by summing the products of participants' responses to all belief-strength items and the related belief-evaluation items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X11433500">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0887302X11433500">
<title>Subjective norm</title>
<p>A 3 item, 7-point semantic differential scale was used to tap normative beliefs about apparel business practices. Participants were asked to report the degree to which they believed that other people who were important to them thought that they should be concerned about environmentally friendly production practices, fair labor practices, and SR production practices. Endpoints for the scale were “I should not” and “I should” (Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .93). To assess motivation to comply, participants were asked to respond to the single item, “In general, I want to do what other people who are important to me think I should do” on a semantic differential scale. Endpoints for the 7-point scale were “Not at all” and “Very much.” Based upon the theory of reasoned action, subjective norm scores were calculated by summing the products of participants' responses to all three normative belief items and the single motivation to comply item.</p>

<sec id="section22-0887302X11433500">
<title>Behavioral intention</title>
<p>Intent to patronize the apparel brand GOOD CLOTHES was measured using a 2 item, 7-point semantic differential scale with endpoints, “Definitely not” and “Definitely.” Participants were asked if, in the future, they intended to (a) purchase clothing from GOOD CLOTHES and/or (b) tell a friend about GOOD CLOTHES. Items were averaged to create an aggregate measure of intent to patronize GOOD CLOTHES (Cronbach’s α <italic>=</italic> .96).</p>

Over 46% of participants had earned college degrees, and 11% had earned graduate degrees. Reported annual household incomes by percentage of sample were less than or equal to $50,000 (46%), $50,001—$100,000 (24%), $100,001—$150,000 (15%), and over $150,000 (13%). The sample was more educated and more affluent as compared to the general U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887302X11433500">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>). Findings indicate that 23% of participants read hang tags very frequently when shopping for clothing, 38% read them frequently, 31% read them infrequently, and 8% never read them. Participants also reported that, when reading hang tags, they most frequently sought information about brand name (<italic>M</italic> = 4.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.84), care instructions (<italic>M</italic> = 4.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.04), and fiber content (<italic>M</italic> = 3.94, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.12).</p>

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to address the first research question, which considered the influence of gender upon consumers' use of hang tags as well as their perceptions of the value of hang tags.

<p>Manipulation checks confirmed that the manipulations of the three independent variables—message content (ecofashion vs. fair labor), message explicitness (low vs. high), and third-party SR logo (absence vs. presence)—were interpreted by participants as intended. The first manipulation check confirmed that participants who viewed hang tags with an ecofashion message perceived GOOD CLOTHES to be more engaged in environmentally friendly production practices than did those who viewed hang tags with a fair labor message, (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>(582)</sub> = −5.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Participants who viewed hang tags with a fair labor message perceived GOOD CLOTHES to be more engaged in fair labor practices than did those who viewed hang tags with an ecofashion message, (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>(584)</sub> = 10.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The second manipulation check revealed that participants who viewed hang tags with a message low in precision and specificity of information (i.e., low explicitness) perceived hang tags to be less informative than did those who viewed hang tags with a message high in precision and specificity, (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>(587)</sub> = −5.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The third manipulation check confirmed that participants who viewed hang tags with a third-party SR logo were more likely to view GOOD CLOTHES as engaged in SR production practices than were those in who viewed hang tags without a third-party SR logo, (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>(743)</sub> = −4.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to address the second research question, which considered whether message content, message explicitness, and third-party SR logo influenced consumers' evaluations of hang tags. Because gender differences were discovered in the previous analyses, gender was included as a covariate in this analysis, (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>(1, 667)</sub> = 18.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The overall model was significant, (<italic>F</italic>

Participants who viewed hang tags with high message explicitness evaluated the hang tags more positively than did those who viewed hang tags with low message explicitness, (<italic>M</italic>

<sub>no logo</sub> = 4.48, <italic>F</italic> 
<sub>(1, 667)</sub> = 20.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). ANOVA did not reveal any interactions among message content, message explicitness, and third-party SR logo. However, for hang tags that featured fair labor messages, only, multiple comparisons based on univariate analyses revealed that hang tags with high message explicitness (with or without a logo) were evaluated more positively (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>fair labor – high-logo</sub> = 5.20; <italic>M</italic>
<sub>fair labor – high-no logo</sub> = 5.20) than were hang tags with low message explicitness and no third-party SR logo (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>fair labor – low-no logo</sub> = 4.54), but not more positively than were hang tags with low message explicitness and an third-party SR logo (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>fair labor – low-logo</sub> = 5.04). Hang tags featuring the apparel brand name GOOD CLOTHES, only, or GOOD CLOTHES in conjunction with the third-party SR logo were perceived least positively (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>brand name only</sub> = 2.89, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>brand name with logo</sub> = 3.72, respectively).</p>
<p>Prior to conducting the regressions to examine the impact of GOOD CLOTHES’ SR labeling upon consumers' evaluations of hang tags, attitudes, and purchase intentions, responses from participants who viewed and evaluated hang tag stimuli with brand name, only or with brand name and third-party SR logo were removed from the data set. These responses were omitted because these participants were not exposed to hang tags that provided written information (i.e., manipulations of the message content and message explicitness) that constructed GOOD CLOTHES as a SR apparel brand. The resulting sample included 597 consumers (56% female and 44% male). Further, diagnostic statistics indicated no multicollinearity among constructs examined in the regression analyses. The variance inflation factor for relevant regression models ranged from 1.04 to 1.31, and the tolerance values ranged from 0.76 to 0.96 (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X11433500">Hair, Tatham, Anderson, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple regression was conducted to address Research Question 3, that is, to examine whether gender, clothing involvement, and past SR apparel purchasing behaviors predicted consumers' evaluations of hang tags.

<p>Regression analysis also was conducted to address Research Question 4, which considered whether consumers' evaluations of hang tags predicted their attitudes toward the GOOD CLOTHES apparel brand. The overall model was significant, (adj. <italic>R</italic>

<p>Two regression models—the classic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X11433500">Fishbein and Ajzen model (1975)</xref> and an extended model—were tested to address Research Questions 5a and 5b (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X11433500">Table 1</xref>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study contributes understanding about the role of apparel hang tags in shaping consumers' attitudes and behaviors relative to SR patronage decisions. Findings provide support for the use of point-of-purchase promotional communications, specifically hang tags, to inform consumers about apparel companies' engagement in SR business practices. Of particular significance is that findings lend insights about how the presentation of information on hang tags may influence consumers' responses to the hang tags themselves, which in turn, may influence attitudes and behaviors toward apparel brands. As such, given the potential role of hang tags in shaping consumer behavior, this work may provide support for on-going policy efforts within the apparel industry, the Fair Labor Association (FLA), and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding recommendations and regulations for the information that companies present on apparel hang tags.</p>
<p>Descriptive analyses indicated that the frequency with which consumers use labels or hang tags to gain information about apparel products may have increased in recent years. In comparison to prior work indicating that only 11% of British consumers regularly read apparel labels when making purchase decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow et al., 2005</xref>), the present findings indicate that approximately 60% of the sample read hang tags on a frequent or very frequent basis when shopping for clothing. This may be explained, in part, by a sampling bias in the present study; the education and income levels for the sample may have predisposed participants to be more interested in seeking information about SR consumption, as compared to the general U.S. (or U.K. [cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X11433500">Iwanow et al., 2005</xref>]) population. This bias limits the generalizability of the findings. However, the findings still provide insights into the behaviors of U.S. consumers who possess high levels of education and income.</p>
<p>Results also suggest gender differences in perceived usefulness of hang tags and the type of information consumers look for when reading apparel hang tags. Specifically, female consumers reported a greater likelihood than did male consumers to read the information printed on apparel hang tags and to use that information to guide their purchase decisions. This finding is consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X11433500">Dickson, 2001</xref>) and suggests that apparel companies, particularly those that target female consumers, may benefit from using hang tags that convey intrinsic and extrinsic product information as well as information about a company’s SR business practices.</p>
<p>As noted, this study contributes understanding about how the presentation of information on hang tags—including message content, message explicitness, and the use of a third-party SR logo—may influence consumers' responses to the hang tags themselves. Analyses revealed that hang tags featuring highly explicit messages and third-party SR logos produced more favorable evaluations than did hang tags featuring less explicit messages and no logos. Thus, apparel companies that wish to communicate their engagement in varied types of SR business practices (regardless of specific focus) should design hang tags that give particular attention to the explicitness of the SR information provided. This finding provides empirical support for a policy recommendation put forth by the UDSAI suggesting that, within their marketing initiatives, apparel firms should avoid the use of vague terms such as “eco-friendly” and “green” and instead present clear definitions of terms used, provide factual information, and/or state information in a manner that complies with regulated standards (UDSAI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X11433500">2009</xref>). Further, although prior work is inconclusive with regard to the value of including a third-party SR logo on point-of-purchase promotional communications for various product categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887302X11433500">Rios, Martinez, Moreno, &amp; Soriano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X11433500">Montoro-Rios et al., 2008</xref>), the present work supports the inclusion of third party logos or certifications of their SR business practices on apparel product hang tags. This finding also aligns with a UDSAI policy recommendation, which states that apparel companies should avoid the use of images in advertising and labels that deceptively imply a fictitious third-party endorsement and instead use only endorsements from official and regulated organizations (UDSAI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X11433500">2009</xref>). Although the policy recommendations put forth by the UDSAI represent a positive step toward encouraging apparel companies to develop and implement marketing strategies that accurately and fully convey their engagement in SR business practices, these recommendations rely upon voluntary efforts by individual apparel companies, perhaps limiting their potential for widespread adoption across the industry. Thus, broader adoption within the industry could be achieved if similar policies or regulations were to be established and enforced by the FLA or FTC.</p>
<p>One aim of this work was to explore the variables that predict consumers' assessments of hang tags for the apparel brand, GOOD CLOTHES, and their subsequent attitudes toward this apparel brand. Consumers' clothing involvement as well as their past SR apparel purchasing behaviors predicted their evaluations of apparel hang tags, which, in turn, positively predicted their attitudes toward GOOD CLOTHES. This supports earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X11433500">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that clothing involvement may influence consumers' responses to promotional communications, which, in turn, may shape their attitudes toward an apparel brand.</p>
<p>Another aim of this work was to provide support for the premise that attitudes predict behavioral intentions as well as the generalized notion that consumers' responses toward promotional communications may shape patronage intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X11433500">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X11433500">Mitchell &amp; Olson, 1981</xref>). In the classic model, both attitude and subjective norm predicted patronage intention toward GOOD CLOTHES. In the extended model, attitude, subjective norm, clothing involvement, and past SR apparel purchasing behaviors predicted patronage intention toward GOOD CLOTHES, which confirms previous findings suggesting that variables external to the classic model may explain SR apparel-related patronage behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X11433500">Ogle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X11433500">Summers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). Although prior work has suggested that women may be more inclined than are men to engage in SR apparel patronage behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt &amp; Bernard, 2008</xref>), of interest is that gender did not predict patronage intention in this model. Although this dissimilarity in findings may be attributed to the differing demographic profiles of the samples used in the respective studies (i.e., college students vs. adult consumers), it more likely reflects differences in the methods used to collect the data (i.e., experimental auction with bidding on apparel products vs. online survey with exposure to promotional stimuli). Further, findings from the present work are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X11433500">Yan and colleagues (2010)</xref>, who also surveyed consumers to explore responses to the inclusion of information about SR production practices in apparel promotions and who did not find a relationship between gender and purchase intention.</p>
<p>This work provides multiple opportunities for future research. First, researchers may wish to explore whether the relationships discovered in this study would hold constant if different methodologies were employed; for example, if the research were conducted in a “natural” setting (e.g., in-store experiment) and featured a well-known (vs. fictitious) apparel brand. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X11433500">Prasad et al. (2004)</xref> employed an in-store experimental approach and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X11433500">Hustvedt and Bernard (2010)</xref> used well-known apparel brands in their studies of SR labeling, simultaneously considering the influence of these conditions may provide new insights into the importance of SR business practices relative to brand name or other product attributes (e.g., price, fit, brand name, and technical features) in predicting patronage behaviors. Second, researchers may wish to further consider how consumers perceive and respond to the inclusion third-party certifications from recognized governmental or nongovernment organizations, such as the FLA or the FTC, on apparel labeling. Such work could provide useful implications for policy makers by offering insights into the potential of such certifications to build consumer confidence and trust (i.e., thereby alleviating confusion or uncertainty) in their purchase decisions. Third, in future studies employing the theory of reasoned action, it would be valuable to consider how consumers' attitudes and behaviors related to SR apparel labeling are influenced by specific referent groups (e.g., family members, friends, romantic partners) as well as other variables external to the theory, such as market mavenism (i.e., an inclination to gather and share information about the consumer goods and services) and commitment to ethical consumption.</p>
