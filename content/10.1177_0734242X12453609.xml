<abstract>
<p>Waste prevention is a policy priority in many countries. For example, European Union member states are currently required to prepare a national Waste Prevention Programme. This article reports on a major international review of the evidence base for business waste prevention to underpin such policy-making. A strict definition of waste prevention is used, including waste avoidance, waste reduction at source or in process, and product reuse—recycling is outside the scope of this article. The review was organised with two key dimensions. Eight types of policy intervention were identified: standards, labelling, procurement, commitments and voluntary agreements, communication, incentives, waste minimisation clubs and other business support. Six illustrative sectors were selected: construction and demolition, food and drink, hospitality, retail, automotive and office-based services. Four broad approaches to business waste prevention have been distinguished and used as part of the analytical framework, classified into a two by two matrix, using supply- and demand-side drivers as one axis, and incremental versus radical change as the other. A fundamental focus was on attitudes and behaviours. A conceptual framework is presented to navigate the various behavioural influences on businesses, and to discuss those motivations and barriers for which the evidence is relatively robust. The results suggest that the (financial) benefits to business of waste prevention are potentially huge, and that some progress is being made, but measurement is a challenge. A taster of some of the learnings on the effectiveness of the different policy interventions to promote waste prevention is also presented.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Waste prevention is at the top of the waste hierarchy. Many governments in the developed world have ambitions to move towards a zero waste economy. An important element of this will be to encourage and increase waste prevention. This article results from a major research project commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in England, which aimed to map and collate the available evidence on business waste prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12453609">Parker et al., 2012</xref>) in order to help inform future policy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X12453609">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). This complements earlier work on household waste prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12453609">Brook Lyndhurst, SMP and RRF, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, the two reviews cover all aspects of both business and household waste prevention.</p>
<p>The waste hierarchy has been given legal force in Europe under the revised European Union (EU) Waste Framework Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453609">European Commission, 2008</xref>), under which all member states are obliged to introduce national Waste Prevention Programmes by December 2013. The Directive defines ‘waste prevention’ as measures taken <italic>before</italic> a substance, material or product has become waste that reduce:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12453609" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the quantity of waste, including through the reuse of products or the extension of the life span of products;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the adverse impacts of the generated waste on the environment and human health;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the content of harmful substances in materials and products.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Recycling and its promotion were defined as firmly outside the scope of this evidence review. ‘Preparation for reuse’ was on the fringes of the scope, while so-called ‘waste exchange’ was largely outside the scope.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12453609">
<title>Searching for evidence</title>
<p>The search for evidence was very broad, covering both UK and international literature, academic and ‘grey’ (i.e. largely government, agency or business reports) literature, electronic and printed material, and English, French and German language sources dating back to at least to 1994. Almost 1000 relevant documents were identified, of which nearly 600 passed initial screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X12453609">Parker, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>The sources for the search included academic papers; meta-studies conducted by Defra and others; reports of programme achievements from publicly-funded agencies charged with assisting businesses or their government sponsors; investigations and cases studies from these bodies; books, journals and periodicals; reports and databases held by Defra and others; and publicly-available materials published by companies or by specialist media. These have been augmented by consultation with over 100 industry figures, academics, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other experts, both across the UK and internationally, who have recounted personal experience and insights, or pointed to other sources.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware that the available sources of evidence influence the nature of that evidence. In particular, the evidence found may, to some extent, have been self-selected owing to the emphasis placed by business assistance agencies on promoting positive outcomes; however, there are limited benefits to companies to report benefits of internal, voluntary initiatives.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12453609">
<title>Sorting and analysing the evidence</title>
<p>All of the screened documents were read in detail, sorted for relevance, summarised and categorised as inputs to the detailed analysis. The analysis followed the broad logic of waste prevention actions by business, starting from the basic drivers of compliance with legislation and competitiveness, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453609">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X12453609">Parker, 2012a</xref>). Priorities are set largely on a <italic>sector-by-sector</italic> basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X12453609">Parker, 2012c</xref>). Central to any analysis of the evidence is a detailed examination of the <italic>attitudes and behaviours</italic> of business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>). Another fundamental perspective used in sorting and assembling the evidence was the type of <italic>intervention</italic> used to encourage action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734242X12453609">Parker, 2012b</xref>)—eight were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12453609">Figure 2</xref>). A key analytical tool was to characterise the actions that a business can take to prevent waste into a number of <italic>approaches</italic> (King and Parker, 2010).</p>

<p>To give focus to the review, it was necessary to select a limited number of sectors. The six sectors chosen, and their relationship both to each other and to their supply chains, are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12453609">Figure 3</xref>. They cover a broad range of activities, products, materials, services and approaches within business. The construction and demolition sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0734242X12453609">Walsh, 2012c</xref>) is a major waste-generator, whose inclusion was mandated by Defra. The food and drink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012c</xref>), retail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0734242X12453609">Willis, 2012a</xref>) and hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012d</xref>) sectors were identified in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X12453609">Oakdene Hollins and Grant Thornton, 2007</xref>) as having major potential for resource efficiency savings. The automotive sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X12453609">Sengstschmid and Parker, 2012a</xref>) was selected for its known adoption of various waste-prevention techniques, which could provide comparison of what might be achieved by transfer of practices. Office-based services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12453609">Fandrich and Kivinen, 2012</xref>) contain a high proportion of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and is representative of the knowledge-based and other ‘back office’ functions prevalent in service economies.</p>

<title>Documenting and reviewing the outputs</title>
<p>The outputs of the review were organised in a format developed with Defra’s policy team to highlight key features of business waste prevention practice. A report index is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734242X12453609">Parker, 2012d</xref>), which shows the organisation of the 28 stand-alone modular reports that have been arranged into 4 levels. Level 1 comprises the executive level summary and overview reports. Level 2 presents the full findings, with separate reports for the six sectors and for the eight different types of intervention, as well as for attitudes and behaviours, hazard reduction and metrics. Level 3 focuses on several cross-cutting themes, including self-motivated activities, and reuse and material use efficiency. Level 4 comprises a number of annexes, including the full review database and documentation of the 25 case studies used across all the modules. Prior to completion, these reports underwent a critical review by seven individuals widely acknowledged to be experts in various aspects of the fields of waste, resources and business advice. This provided a broad test of balance, rigour, completeness and relevance.</p>

<title>Findings of the evidence review</title>
<p>Given the complexity of the review, the results are presented here primarily across two of the dimensions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453609">Figure 1</xref>; namely, the approaches taken to waste prevention, and business attitudes and behaviours. Examples from the six sectors and across the eight types of intervention are used for illustration. However, the evidence for the current scale of waste prevention and for its potential benefits, if more widely practised, is reported first.</p>
<sec id="section7-0734242X12453609">
<title>The scale and benefits of waste prevention</title>
<p>The first question for any review of the evidence on waste prevention is ‘How much of it is occurring?’ In this case, how much has business waste been reduced by explicit waste-prevention activities? Taking the UK or England as an example, the quality of the evidence is not sufficient to provide statistically defendable estimates, even in the six key commercial and industrial sectors covered. Examination of the correlation between changes in sales value in each sector and waste arisings shows high-level evidence of a decoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453609">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X12453609">Melnyk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X12453609">OECD, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X12453609">Walsh 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X12453609">Walsh and Willis, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This is indicative of a broad movement in the right direction. Isolating the factors that contribute most to this positive trend from the evidence was often frustrated by the absence of baseline data; loose use of terminology, with ‘waste prevention’ being used to refer to waste diversion from landfill and to recycling, as well as to waste prevention as defined within the revised Waste Framework Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453609">European Commission, 2008</xref>); and failure to report the behavioural drivers in organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>). Such frustrations are to be expected in a field of research in its infancy and where policy objectives are still being refined.</p>
<p>A second question is: ‘What are the potential benefits of waste prevention?’. Taking the UK as a case study, several studies have focused on the potential benefits to business of resource efficiency, with the savings categorised into energy, water and waste. The first study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X12453609">Oakdene Hollins and Grant Thornton (2007)</xref> quantified the potential cost savings, from implementing no- and low-cost resource efficiency measures with a payback within 1 year as £6.4 billion per annum, of which £2.7 billion was attributable to waste. A major report for the UK Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X12453609">WRAP, 2009</xref>) examined in very broad terms the potential contribution of resource efficiency to carbon savings. The results were then used to revisit earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453609">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) showing that, on a like-for-like basis, the potential waste savings had reduced by 28% to £1.9 billion, indicating that some progress has been made through initiatives led by WRAP and others, which have focused on the priority sectors previously identified: food and drink, retail and hospitality.</p>
<p>However, the work for WRAP on carbon-saving potential also identified a whole raft of new opportunities for no- and low-cost resource efficiency savings. This raised the total potential financial benefit to business from £6.4 billion per annum to £23 billion per annum, with the contribution from waste rising to £18 billion, of which £17 billion is a result of waste prevention, and the balance a result of recycling and landfill diversion. Further analysis shows that 70% of these shorter-term waste-prevention savings could be attributed to what the WRAP report terms ‘lean production’, which it describes rather narrowly as reduced material inputs into production processes through the design of lighter and leaner products, while 80% comes from just four industrial sectors—chemicals and non-metallic minerals, metal manufacturing, power and utilities, and construction. Longer-term savings increased the total savings to £55 billion per annum, of which £40 billion was a result of waste.</p>
<p>Several major reports on the global benefits of resource efficiency or a ‘circular economy’ have been published recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734242X12453609">Preston, 2012</xref>), with estimates of a global saving of $3 trillion or more by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12453609">McKinsey, 2011</xref>) and of savings across the EU of $600 billion per annum by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12453609">Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>These two questions have measured waste prevention in terms of tonnage reduction and cost savings. One focus of the evidence review was to explore the metrics used. The findings show that these are, indeed, the most common, but, in recent, years metrics have become more complex, typically also including carbon savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0734242X12453609">Willis, 2012b</xref>).</p>

<title>Approaches to business waste prevention</title>
<p>The evidence was analysed and each of the modular reports structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X12453609">Parker et al., 2012</xref>) in terms of the actions that a business can take to prevent waste and characterised into a number of approaches (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453609">Figure 1</xref>). Four broad approaches have been positioned within the matrix of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453609">Figure 4</xref>, aligned along the two dimensions of FOCUS and CHANGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12453609">King and Parker, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>The approaches described here can also be applied by businesses to tackle other ‘resource’ priorities that are not necessarily environmental. For example, a similar framework has been used to classify approaches to pollution control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0734242X12453609">Simons et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X12453609">Tukker and Tischner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence shows that ‘waste minimisation’ and ‘clean operations’ activities are more prevalent than ‘green products’ and ‘product–service innovation’. Waste minimisation is very similar to the lean production principles taught in universities during the 1980s. Its widespread uptake may reflect the fact that the current staff has an improved understanding of these principles and have been relatively receptive to supporting process-efficiency targets.</p>
<p>‘Clean operations’ and ‘green products’ approaches are less widespread than ‘waste minimisation’. Both have seen uptake in some of the sectors studied here, for example in retail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0734242X12453609">Willis, 2012a</xref>), and Food and Drink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012c</xref>), but these manifest themselves largely as lightweight and returnable packaging—auxiliaries to the main operations. Better examples might be seen outside of the sectors focused on in this project—the potential for wider application is significant. Both require engagement with supply chain partners and embedded sector practices can act as a barrier to innovation. The evidence suggests, therefore, that sector-based voluntary approaches are relevant to more widespread adoption of these two approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012b</xref>). Appropriately managed, they could offer the additional advantage of involving businesses that might otherwise be disadvantaged by an overt declaration of higher performance standards.</p>
<p>‘Green products’ and ‘product–service innovation’ often require more complex approaches and might be seen as aspirational in policy terms. In particular, product–service innovation is both a new business model and substantially more ambitious—it may not be amenable to the traditional direct business interventions used to good effect for waste minimisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12453609">Fandrich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X12453609">Sengstschmid, 2012</xref>) nor the sector-based voluntary approaches for clean operations and green products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012b</xref>). The evidence suggests, therefore, that product–service innovation approaches are likely to require educational interventions to inspire and inform the current, and next, generation of business staff.</p>
<p>Not all approaches are relevant to, or achievable by, particular sectors or the size of the firm. For example, those in the middle of supply chains, supplying processed materials or sub-components, perhaps under long-term contracts, may have their opportunities for altering products or services severely constrained; they may then be restricted to the process efficiency/effectiveness measures of waste minimisation or clean operations.</p>
<p>As a good proxy for waste, the study for WRAP on the contribution to carbon saving of various resource efficiency measures indicates that demand side measures, related, for example, to a shift from goods to services and to product life extension and repair, have greater potential than those on the supply side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X12453609">WRAP, 2009</xref>). This has already provided a generic endorsement for further attention to be paid to the direction of product–service innovation than more traditional waste minimisation activities.</p>

<p>Business waste prevention behaviour needs to be considered on three levels:</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X12453609" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Individual</italic>: The people that are part of the business, including staff, managers and owners. The influence of individuals’ attitudes and behaviours has an impact on how the business operates as an entity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Organisational</italic>: The business as a collection of individuals or an entity in itself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Institutional</italic>: Direct and indirect contacts such as customers, suppliers, peers and legislators, at national and international levels. These set the context within which a business operates and have an important influence on its behaviour.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The framework covers four types of factors across each of these three levels. For example, <italic>ethos</italic> refers to highly subjective psychological factors, such as attitudes, values, identity and norms, that influence individual behaviour—whether of individual staff members, managers or from wider society. <italic>Roles and responsibilities</italic> refers to the social structures within which business behaviours are formed and practised, which include habitual patterns of behaviour, management and governance structures, and relationships with suppliers, regulators and other external stakeholders. <italic>Resources</italic> can be both concrete (e.g. finance and equipment) and intangible (e.g. skills and knowledge). <italic>Contextual</italic> factors are those determined largely outside the orbit of the business: on an individual level, the workplace environment; on an organisational level, business size, location and sector; and on an institutional level, legislation and the state of the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The factors in this grid and their influence on business behaviour cannot be considered in isolation from each other. Some of the factors are inter-dependent; for example, the behaviour of a business will be influenced by the nature of customer demand, but its response will also be conditioned by the corporate culture and resources available. A change in one factor may not lead to changes in business behaviour if its effect is undermined by lack of complementary factors. For example, pressure on the financial resources of a business is unlikely, on its own, to drive waste prevention. Other factors will also need to be in place for change to occur, such as managers’ understanding of potential cost- savings and ways of reducing waste, and staff skills (to prevent waste) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12453609">Hawke et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In identifying the connections between different influencing factors, the conceptual framework could potentially be used in planning initiatives to consider the motivations that a particular type of initiative could capitalise upon and which barriers it is able to overcome, and to identify other motivations that could also be harnessed and other barriers which may require addressing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734242X12453609">
<title>Motivations and barriers</title>
<p>Research on business waste-prevention behaviour has been carried out in a rather fragmented manner. The literature on attitudes identified in the review focused largely on SMEs and much of that literature examined waste reduction or environmental management in a much broader sense than strict ‘waste prevention’.</p>
<p>Lack of ‘joined-up’ research, such as that sponsored by Defra on household waste behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12453609">Brook Lyndhurst, SMP and RRF, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734242X12453609">Tucker and Douglas, 2007</xref>), means that the evidence base lacks coherence: motivations for, and barriers to, business waste prevention are therefore not fully understood. No studies were found that had used a systematic or theory-based approach to examine the behavioural drivers of waste prevention in business, including the relative importance of different drivers. However, inferences can be made from the weight of evidence for different aspects. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12453609">Table 3</xref> shows those motivations and barriers for which the evidence was strong enough to allow a meaningful commentary to be provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>Opportunities for <italic>increased productivity, efficiency</italic> and <italic>cost-savings</italic> appear to be key drivers of waste prevention activity, as this is where the weight of the evidence lies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>). However, businesses may not always recognise the opportunities (SMEs in particular) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12453609">Calia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734242X12453609">van Berkel, 2007</xref>), while the language of ‘waste prevention’ tends to draw attention to ‘end of pipe’ solutions rather than improvements in resource efficiency and productivity. The cost of waste disposal may not be high enough to be motivating in many businesses (e.g. in some service sectors) and there are strong indications that the true cost of waste (e.g. raw material and labour costs embedded in off-specification products) is still not recognised or sufficiently appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12453609">Jacobsen and Kristoffersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734242X12453609">Phillips et al., 1999</xref>). To illustrate the difference, a study for WRAP has estimated cost savings in the UK food and drink supply chain of £500/tonne in manufacturing, £1088/tonne in distribution and £1676/ tonne in the retail sector compared with £70/tonne from landfill diversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12453609">Lee and Willis, 2010</xref>). The financial savings of packaging waste reduction are also large, with a reduction in the use of cardboard saving £800 per tonne compared with £80 of revenue generated from recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453609">Lee et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, <italic>lack of resources</italic>, such as finance, staff capacity (including management) and time, are highlighted repeatedly in the literature as key barriers to waste prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12453609">Ackroyd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12453609">Côte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12453609">Duggett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453609">Granek and Hassanali, 2006</xref>). The evidence suggests that, in some cases, financial barriers are less to do with the <italic>actual</italic> cost of waste prevention measures and more to do with <italic>lack of understanding</italic> of these costs and, in particular, the potential cost savings to be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12453609">Bleischwitz et al., 2009</xref>). This is a particular issue for SMEs.</p>
<p><italic>Compliance with legislation</italic> and reducing the risk of prosecution are highlighted as drivers of hazardous waste reduction, although it is not clear from the literature whether these drivers motivate businesses to take steps beyond mere compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X12453609">Sengstschmid and Parker, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also a reasonable amount of evidence that a <italic>positive corporate culture</italic> encourages waste prevention, especially in SMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453609">Granek and Hassanali, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X12453609">WRAP, 2010</xref>) as does <italic>leadership and high-level commitment</italic> to waste prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734242X12453609">Stone, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734242X12453609">2006b</xref>). There is some evidence that <italic>supply chain partnerships</italic> can be an effective driver of waste prevention where such relationships have been facilitated (e.g. through a business support scheme, such as Envirowise in the UK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X12453609">Sengstschmid, 2012</xref>).</p>

<list-item><p>with recycling for recovery and landfill diversion relatively widespread, there are suggestions in the literature that it can become a barrier to investigating and acting on waste prevention at source. This is strongly evidenced within the construction sector where, for example, crushing hard-core and using it as backfill or aggregate on-site leads to a significant reduction in waste generation but at the expense of more sustainable and profitable business practices, such as reducing wastage of unused construction materials and deconstruction followed by preparation of reclaimed materials for reuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0734242X12453609">Walsh, 2012c</xref>).</p></list-item>

Constraints on space mean that not all of the interventions can be discussed here; rather, just a few, selected learnings are provided as examples. Little reference is made, for example, to interventions involving labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734242X12453609">Walsh, 2012b</xref>), procurement and supply chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012a</xref>) or communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12453609">Fandrich and Cox, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There is support for the contribution of standards and environmental management systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X12453609">Walsh, 2012a</xref>). As a component of this, certain sectors have adopted lean manufacturing (‘lean’) practices. Lean can be harnessed successfully for waste prevention, but its focus is on overall business efficiency rather than just resource efficiency, and the evidence review has found instances, for example in the automotive sector, where lean savings have reduced labour costs, for example, but have resulted in <italic>increased</italic> waste generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X12453609">Sengstschmid and Parker, 2012a</xref>). This, in turn, highlights again the generic point that waste prevention is just one component of the overall resource efficiency message alongside, for example, water and energy savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453609">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X12453609">Oakdene Hollins and Grant Thornton, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most effective drivers for waste prevention is the leadership of some larger-scale businesses, particularly in suitably-structured sectors, such as food retailing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0734242X12453609">Willis, 2012a</xref>). Harnessing the resources of these leading organisations—where corporate culture has already changed so that other businesses are drawn in and engaged—represents a common theme arising from this research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12453609">Condon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12453609">Fandrich and Cox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734242X12453609">Ross and Associates Environmental Consulting Ltd, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A complementary aspect has been found in Japan’s ‘Top Runner’ programme, where standards for ‘best performing’ products to be specified in public purchasing have been set by the manufacturers themselves, with ever-rising targets to meet. This approach has proven effective in energy- and water-using products, but could potentially be transferred to other resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X12453609">METI, Tokyo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X12453609">Walsh and Willis, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The learning from the review of <italic>incentives</italic> provides only hints of what may be possible in waste prevention. The effect of landfill tax on waste volumes in the UK is well-evidenced, but this is not unambiguously attributable to waste-prevention measures as opposed to recycling or diversion. The correlation of research and development support for new technologies with projected waste-prevention benefits looks promising, but has not yet been proven in practice. Extended producer responsibility measures have certainly provoked recycling and packaging light-weighting initiatives, but their wider impact on waste prevention is not proven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12453609">Cahill et al., 2011</xref>). The measures examined may have, coincidentally, encouraged waste prevention, but improved evaluation of their contribution is a possible subject of further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X12453609">Walsh and Willis, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There is much evidence for the use of <italic>voluntary agreements</italic> to reduce waste, but few explicitly target waste prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012b</xref>). Generally, such commitments have focused on landfill diversion, with prevention often an incidental outcome—this despite signatory companies and government bodies emphasising the importance of the Waste Hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453609">European Commission, 2008</xref>). However, businesses appear generally favourable to voluntary agreements, although this may be less true for SMEs. Key motivators for businesses include corporate social responsibility and customer pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12453609">Kautto and Melanen, 2004</xref>); a desire to engage with national policy; the opportunity to make financial savings; and the implicit ‘threat’ of legislation should they refuse to participate. Few barriers to involvement were found except, perhaps, a lack of capability within individual companies to fulfil their commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12453609">Eatherley, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X12453609">Poonprasit et al., 2005</xref>). In terms of behavioural aspects, much of the evidence centred on enablers: key success factors included the engagement of sector leaders and relevant trade associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453609">Cox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734242X12453609">Qi et al., 2010</xref>). UK examples in this area include the Food &amp; Drink Federation’s ‘Five Fold Ambition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12453609">Food and Drink Federation, 2011</xref>), the Courtauld Commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X12453609">WRAP, 2010</xref>) and WRAP’s ‘Halving Waste to Landfill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0734242X12453609">WRAP, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A diverse range of government-funded <italic>business support</italic> schemes have provided the backbone of waste and resource initiatives in the UK since the early 1990s. In particular, the evidence suggests that the best run <italic>waste minimisation clubs</italic> can generate 10-fold returns on investment. Key success factors include recruitment based on engagement with true cost savings; access to appropriate supporting skills; and sufficient resources for training, communications and cross-learning between participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12453609">Ackroyd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12453609">Coskeran and Phillips, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12453609">Coskeran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12453609">Fandrich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12453609">Hyde et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X12453609">Mattsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734242X12453609">Phillips et al., 1999</xref>). These findings are complementary to those from other forms of business support, such as help lines, online guides and consultancy provision. Once again, a strong focus on costs, profitability and new opportunities leads to greater success, although the main target of activity has not generally been waste prevention in the sectors studied, but rather recycling, landfill diversion or wider resource-efficiency measures, with prevention as a secondary benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X12453609">Sengstschmid, 2012</xref>). For both types of support there is mixed evidence about whether they could sustain themselves free of public funding, although a strongly committed central ‘facilitator’ is one of the core elements of success.</p>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations for future evidence work</title>
<p>Waste prevention sits at the top of the waste hierarchy, but progress toward it has so far been relatively limited. This article reports on a comprehensive review of the evidence base on business waste prevention, which is intended to inform the development of future policy.</p>
<p>Cost is a key motivator for business, but companies often focus on avoided disposal costs rather than on the much larger savings in raw material and labour costs embedded in wasted products. Waste prevention is just one part of an overall resource efficiency message. On one hand, the evidence is indicative that waste prevention is reducing overall waste generation, but its quality is not sufficient to provide statistically-defendable estimates, even in the six key sectors covered. On the other hand, the potential savings from waste prevention and resource efficiency in business can be huge. For resource-efficiency in general, savings have been estimated at US$3 trillion or more globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12453609">McKinsey, 2011</xref>); US$600 billion per annum across the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12453609">Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2012</xref>); and around £55 (US$90) billion per annum in the UK. Of this latter figure, £17 (US$28) billion per annum is attributed to no- and low-cost savings from waste prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12453609">Lee et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Four broad approaches to waste prevention have been identified. Many of the traditional business support interventions, and thus much of the available evidence in the published literature, have focused on the supply side measures of waste minimisation and clean operations. There is generally less evidence available on the waste prevention opportunities of the demand side measures of green products and product/service innovation. However, the available evidence appears to suggest that the benefits of successfully implementing the demand side measures are potentially much greater, including the opportunity to design out waste in the first place. The most ambitious product/service innovation approaches often fall outside the boundaries of a single firm, or even the boundaries of a single sector or supply chain. If the potential for demand side measures is to be realised, an improved evidence base on behavioural issues in business, such as the food and drink, and construction sectors, would help to target resources less speculatively in the future. Encouragement of organisations to report on their failures, as well as their successes, would assist this effort significantly.</p>
<p>A conceptual framework for examining the various behavioural influences on businesses has been presented and used to map the available evidence on motivations and barriers to waste prevention. There is some evidence that awareness, and perceived importance, of waste prevention or resource efficiency increases with the size of business. Reducing the risk of prosecution or penalties is an important motivator for businesses to reduce the hazardousness of waste. Corporate culture can play a key role in facilitating or inhibiting waste prevention within businesses, especially in SMEs. The prevailing collective attitudes, values and norms embedded in structures and processes appear to be more powerful driving forces than individual attitudes, values and norms: people’s behaviour in the workplace tends to conform to the corporate culture.</p>
<p>Future evidence work should focus on three main ‘pillars’ in waste prevention and resource efficiency:</p>

<p>We acknowledge the huge contribution of one of our co-authors, who, sadly, is no longer with us. Kit Strange was unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734242X12453609">Read, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0734242X12453609">Wilson, 2012</xref>) and he used his extraordinary web of databases and professional contacts across the world to identify the near-1000 evidence sources on which this work was built. He is sorely missed. This may be his last published article and we hope that it is a fitting tribute.</p>
