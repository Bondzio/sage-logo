<p>This article aims to demonstrate how a derived approach to case file analysis, influenced by the work of Michel Foucault and Dorothy E. Smith, can offer innovative means by which to study the relations between discourse and practices in child welfare. The article explores text-based forms of organization in histories of child protection in Finland and in Northern Ireland. It is focused on case file records in different organizational child protection contexts in two jurisdictions. Building on a previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011416878">Satka and Skehill, 2011</xref>), we attempt to demonstrate the potential of how the relations between practices and discourses – a majorly important theme for understanding child welfare social work – can be effectively analysed using a combination of two approaches. This article is based on three different empirical studies from our two jurisdictions Northern Ireland (UK) and Finland; one study used Foucault; the other Smith and the third study sought to combine the methods. This article seeks to report on ongoing work in developing, for child welfare studies, ‘a history that speaks back’ as we have described it.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011416878" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to share with readers how a derived methodology for analysing care-control relations in child protection is being developed to offer new insights into how transformations in social work are understood and responded to. This will be done through the texts and documents produced in practice. By referring to ‘transformation’ we mean changes in social work which are described as major shifts in thinking, e.g. the shift from welfare to risk since the 1970s. We have previously introduced our theoretical and methodological ideas for this emerging innovative approach in discovering a way of writing ‘histories that speak back’ to the present agents of child protection by taking advantage of two different methodologies for research developed by Michel Foucault and Dorothy E. Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011416878">Satka and Skehill, 2011</xref>). We concluded that Foucault's approach enabled effective and in-depth studies of child welfare focused on the discursive level of a child welfare documents while Smith's appeal and additional value is to offer a means to analyse more deeply at the level of actual working events related to child protection work in the social relations of the time and place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325011416878">1</xref></sup> This article proposes that learning from these two methodologies can lead to the development of a derived approach for textual analysis which aims to capture both the objective nature of discourses alongside the subjective practices in the complex realm of child welfare and protection. Alongside this, research tools for capturing the nature of relations between micro and macro forces are also explored. This derived method should prove useful to allow researchers to dig deep into child welfare archives such as case files, to seek to understand and illuminate the relations between different levels of discourse and practice at different times and in particular spaces and places.</p>
<p>Giving attention to space and place in research methodology is not common in social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011416878">Shaw, 2010</xref>) and indeed this experiment is an ongoing one which requires further application. The empirical examples provided here are from current ongoing studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325011416878">2</xref></sup> Nonetheless, we hope to show how our approach might prove helpful in discovering enlightening knowledge for the participants in the very complex child protection practices of how power and governing has operated. This article should thus be considered an ongoing exploratory one, aimed at sharing ways in which this methodology could effectively unearth taken-for-granted discourses pertaining to child welfare and protection both past and present. The overall intention is to contribute to the debate in relation to transformations in child protection social work by exploring relations between discourses and practices. The shared research interest is in contributing to understanding this complexity through studying in more depth the way in which practitioners mediate between new requirements defined by law, policy and research on the one hand and the complexities of everyday practice on the other. In other words, we are interested in the relations between discourses and practices where the beginning assumptions are that these relations are: non-linear; complex; temporal; spatially specific; and in need of problematization. This interest comes from a concern to do ‘history of the present’ research that attempts to capture the complexities inherent within relations between practices and discourses and ‘gives recognition both to the acting subjects and to discursive practices in time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011416878">Satka and Skehill, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For the three researchers, the shared underpinning goal is to seek tools of analysis which illuminate the nature of major shifts and transformation in the nature of aspects of child welfare and protection social work such as field work practice (Skehill and Satka) and residential care (Hoikkala). The authors' referred research is the following: Skehill's work is based in the UK (Northern Ireland). The main research questions are: Was practice in the post-war period as optimistic as generally perceived? If so, what factors made this so? If not, what <italic>was</italic> the nature of practice and what can be learnt from this for present day practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011416878">Skehill, 2010</xref>). Satka's work is based in Finland. The main research question is: How do the relations of ruling operate in child protection social work practice at the present compared with 1970s and 1990s. The concept of ruling relations refers to the distinctive translocal forms of social organization and social relations that have become dominant in the modern child welfare organizations. They are objectified forms constituted externally to particular people and places, and relying on textually based realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith, 2005</xref>: 227). Satka's data includes children's case files in one organization of child protection at different times in addition to policy documents, administrative memos and practical local regulations, several acts of child welfare, committee reports. Hoikkala, also researching in Finland, asks in her research how the restraints and disciplinary practices have changed in the past, how those changes have taken place in the everyday institutional life and how the staff members have produced knowledge about them. The data consists of written sources like memos of staff meetings, the journal of punishments and reports of restraints, and children's case files.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473325011416878">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is of interest to note that although many transformations in child welfare and protection have occurred at national and global levels, a struggle to understand what the main implications of such transformations remain relevant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011416878">Loone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011416878">Satka et al., 2011</xref>). Based on our experiences as empirical researchers, we argue that use of history can help to develop deeper understandings of transformations that are neither the result of discursive or practice changes alone but rather the outcome of a complex interplay of organizations, regulations and discourses between various actors and at a number of levels. Such being the case, it is crucial that the applied approaches in research are problem-led and share the interest of problematization by illuminating a case or a work process rather than trying to make sense of the ideas of the time as a whole.</p>
<p>Our suggestion is that the potential for a derived method discussed in this article offers an effective means of analysing textual documents in child welfare – case files, memos, records – in a way that helps capture the complexities of how, for example, discourses become practices and how practice generates discourse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011416878">Satka and Skehill, 2011</xref>). In so doing, it offers the possibility to broaden understanding of the nature of transformations in child welfare across time and space in an innovative and useful way.</p>
<p>What follows below is an introduction to a set of four relatively practical steps in research. Steps One to Three refer to the work of Satka and Hoikkala who have relied on the application of Smith's methodology to child protection documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011416878">Satka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011416878">Hoikkala, 2010</xref>) whereas Step Four takes advantage of the genealogical endeavours of Skehill. Although the steps are practical in terms of research, they also involve a particular methodological thought that seeks to give recognition to acting subjects, discursive practices and relations between these. We believe that while still at an exploratory stage, this kind of approach has significant potential to add to the critical tools available for understanding transformations in a practical strategy such as social work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011416878"><title>Step One: Deciding the problematic</title>
<p>Deciding ‘the problematics of study’; establishing a standpoint; defining the particular object of study; and choosing a time and place are the first important choices to be taken using Smith's approach. The two first mentioned – deciding the problematic and standpoint – aim to establish or reorganize a personal relationship between the investigator and her target of research – in order to develop a firm focus for the investigation that follows.</p>
<p>According to the ontology of the social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011416878">Smith, 1987</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">2005</xref>) one assumes constant incongruence between people's experiences and the institutional (i.e. child protection) or organizational (e.g. agency) discourse. It assumes two basic orders of reality, <italic>the world of ruling</italic> (apparatuses)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473325011416878">4</xref></sup> with related discourses of governing, and <italic>the everyday world of local events and experiences</italic>. This approach makes space for the existence of forces other than discourses which shape practice and gives more credence to the impact of the murky and difficult to capture effect of everyday acts. The social ontology is the point of view we take advantage of in our investigations that follow. The leading methodological guideline is that power relations between people's real life world and the institutions and discourses are discoverable in institutional texts and documents whose function is to mediate between the two orders of reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473325011416878">5</xref></sup> We assume people's daily activities in child protection organizations are coordinated by practices of language, texts and discourses – all essential and connected in the daily production of institutional knowledge in all organizations. This is also the point where one digs beneath discourses to examine everyday practice.</p>
<p>Hoikkala's study is an example of the personally discovered ‘problematic’ which required use of tools that could make sense of everyday actions within the context of broader discursive shifts and transformations. This interest was raised from the experience of working as a practical mental health nurse in various children's residential care units for several years in Finland. Via these experiences she became personally aware of the dilemma between care and control in children's institutions. The methods of care meant very often strict restrictions, sanctions and discipline. She also learned that there is a complex relationship between the concrete practices, their regulation and concepts and discourses describing them. For example, the legal base of certain restrictions (e.g. drug testing) implemented in the everyday institutional life was unclear until the reformation of the Child Welfare Act in November 2006. At the same time, a very interesting conceptual and discursive shift was witnessed. For instance, the term ‘closed care’ was replaced by the term ‘special intensive care’ because of the current legislation concerning children's rights. From the practitioner's point of view, the practical implications of this shift were unclear. Hoikkala wondered why the present restrictive practices are as they are in the Finnish children's residential care. What is the relation between the actual practices and the discourses describing them? Hoikkala is exploring how the setting and regulation of restrictions and discipline work in the residential settings. This means the exploration of the relations of ruling, the material effects of various texts in the everyday residential life, the organization and knowledge formation of restrictive and disciplinary practices in a definite actual place and time from a standpoint of residential workers (‘a site for a knower’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011416878">Smith, 1999</xref>: 232–233; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith, 2005</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>In summary, this results in important insights into the relations of ruling in child protection organizations but, while offering some tools for connecting different levels of practice and policy through intertextuality, the authors recognize that Smith alone leaves the broader connections in time between micro practices and macro lacking in a clear framework for critical analysis. Working together, the authors have sought to consider how one can apply the tools of Smith and Foucault in tandem to provide this multi-layered form of analysis in time and place and the possibilities for this are introduced in Step Four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011416878">Satka and Skehill, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011416878"><title>Step Two: Organizing the data</title>
<p>One of our interests in historically oriented research of the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011416878">Foucault, 1977</xref>), is targeted on discovering the nature of transformations in a particular child protection organization at a particular moment in time by means of archived texts and documents. We have investigated, for example, how the standardization of activities with children and families has taken place at various times (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011416878">Smith, 2001</xref>: 160). In this kind of investigation the textual sources become particularly important. Because of both practical and ethical reasons, the major entry point in a history of public institutions is often via remaining texts and archived documents.</p>
<p>‘Organizing the data’ means very practical activities such as 1) deciding and figuring out the most informative and available data sources, 2) accessing and collecting them, 3) organizing the different data pools, and 4) choosing the primary and secondary sources. The problematic and the object of study, the chosen analytic strategy and the theoretical lenses as well as the availability of potential sources, direct the researcher to find the most suitable data. In this example, the theoretical lens is influenced by Smith's ontology regarding relations of ruling and the problematic of understanding everyday life that lies <italic>beneath</italic> and <italic>within</italic> discourse. The underlying interest when choosing and organizing one's data is meant to ensure that the data can capture both the detailed accounts of everyday life and the material connections for explicating the relations of ruling and power beyond the local setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011416878">Campbell and Gregor, 2002</xref>: 59, 69). Therefore multiple data types and data collection methods must be considered.</p>
<p>According to Smith, ‘texts are foundational to the existence of organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011416878">Smith, 2001</xref>: 170) and they ‘are not a discrete topic but… they enter into and coordinate people's doings' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith, 2005</xref>: 228). Written, drawn or otherwise reproduced texts are material and replicable (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011416878">Smith, 2001</xref>: 164). By emphasizing the materiality of texts, it is possible to investigate how a text can be present in our everyday world and at the same time connect us into the social relations beyond the local settings. A good example of the materiality of text is a given diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): as soon as it is written in case file documents, this diagnosis begins to organize the practices of the various professionals involved in his case. He will be provided with new kinds of services and he probably receives more empathy than before. In other words, the simple application of a word ADHD to the person's file results in different practices, attitudes and responses.</p>
<p>The data includes various institutional texts as major coordinators of its activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith (2005</xref>: 212) defines intertextuality as ‘the hierarchy of texts at one level that establish the frames and concepts that control texts at lower levels and, inversely, of texts at lower levels that are fitted to the frames and concepts of higher order texts'. Intertextual hierarchy means that the focus is on the relations between the various types of texts and the researcher has to separate the higher level texts from the lower level texts (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011416878">Campbell and Gregor, 2002</xref>: 86–93; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith, 2005</xref>: 184–200, 211).</p>
<p>A visual drawing or mapping is useful in making the links between these various textual sources visible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1473325011416878">Figure 1</xref>). The data includes those textual documents that include information about what actually happened in a particular child welfare work setting – the everyday practices. In the research discussed here, the individual case files and memos are the primary source. Other sources such as diaries and daily record books can be equally relevant. We name this pool as ‘documentary texts'. They contain personal information of a particular family and/or child produced as part of the everyday practices and documentation routines within the child welfare organizations. Via them the researcher can access the detailed information of the work processes in time and place.
<fig id="fig1-1473325011416878" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mapping links between textual soruces.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1473325011416878-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The other source of the data set focuses on broader discourses which help the researcher to discover the missing organizational and institutional details of how the local child welfare setting and its practices work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011416878">Campbell and Gregor, 2002</xref>: 60). For instance, regulatory texts include policy documents (e.g. administrative texts), law and guidelines (e.g. child welfare legislation) and professional texts (e.g. social work theories, ethics and methods). The regulatory texts govern the activities of social work professionals and work as the mediators of the local and extra-local. Discursive texts, such as policy documents, mediate the wide narratives of various institutions, e.g. child welfare. They also offer important links and reference when it is time to move towards genealogical analysis which involves searching for answers to how the present practices became possible.</p>
<p>The second step is overlapping with the first and third ones. The organization of data is often a kind of detective work, digging and discovering during the research process. The data collection does not finish before the researcher has located and collected all the sources that help her to explore the power and ruling relations beyond the actual practices. Sometimes the sources can be found by accident; by ‘following your nose’. For example, Hoikkala decided to use the single case study design in her study. Before entering the actual data gathering process, she had to look for a possible case study institution. One of the criteria for the final selection of the unit was the availability of different textual data sources (i.e. the journal of punishments, case files, the memos of staff meetings) produced by residential workers in this particular setting. In Hoikkala's study, one of the main aims is to explicate the material effects of various texts in the social organization of everyday life at three temporal points. Her aim is to explicate the social organization of knowledge behind disciplinary practices by asking questions such as: how do the regulative texts enter into actual work in the residential unit? The data gathering process included many unexpected turns. For example, the memos of staff meetings became the most informative source of primary data instead of many others. In the residential unit, those memos are used for standardizing the activities implemented by residential workers at a particular time. Therefore they are considered as mediators between the discursive and the everyday institutional life. They also form the local basis for regulation of residential activities. The memos make visible the social relations within the residential unit and the wider societal context as well as the structure of organizational setting and the hierarchy between the workers of the institution. Working with data is always connected with the theoretical commitments of a study as explicated in the following step.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011416878"><title>Step Three: Analysing the points of transformation</title>
<p>In fact, it is by investigating the recorded forms of practice that the discovery of particular institutional practices of child protection as a form of governance of the time become possible. From this perspective, we can see a case file record as containing a story of child protection practices written by way of the objectifying institutional language. When analysing case records or documents far back in time this means connecting their analysis in their contemporary social relations and interpreting the text as part of the particular institutional and organizational relations of its time and place. When this is done the text enters analysis carrying the threads of the relations by which it is organized.</p>
<p>Thus, through child protection case files one can discover how the transformation from actual into institutional takes place in the documents social workers have been writing of the case. One can also identify the regulatory frames which define the organization of institutional processes beyond the local and particular (the regulating frames like the institutional discourse of child protection at the time). It is at this point that one can connect the ‘everyday’ discourse with institutional and organizational discourses.</p>
<p>This approach addresses <italic>documents</italic> or <italic>memos for institutional purposes</italic> as products of professional reading and writing activities of social, medical or psychological professionals in a child welfare organization at a particular time. Reading the texts (documents) in our data, we <bold>activate them by reading them in time and context</bold> and analyse them as if they were in use. Therefore, we refer to them with the term of <italic>active text</italic> which is comparable to a lens which bends the light as it passes through. Active text is also a two-way street to explore the same relations in which the actors are active and which govern them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011416878">Smith, 1987</xref>: 176, 214; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011416878">Smith, 1990</xref>: 4–6). Analysing texts in actual practices of their time and place differentiates the analyst's work from discursive approaches in general because of this dual process of analysing and understanding. The implication is that access to textually mediated relations of ruling is discoverable by the means of critical reading along the lines discussed above. However, there is more to it than this: the analyst must also be aware that the text's ability to organize a social action depends always on the reader's or writer's interpretive skill.</p>
<p>When we choose to approach a document from the viewpoint of a social worker, who is/was writing a case file, we assume she/he participates in a discourse in an <italic>agent position</italic> in the relations of ruling of the organization, and in the particular <italic>ideological institutional order of child protection</italic> of the time. <italic>Discourses and administrative regulations create agent positions (or locations) and particular performances</italic> for agents, like social worker, mother, child, etc. in and for a practice encounter. In other words, the subject position of the writing social worker is defined in advance by discourses, and other relations of ruling in effect via texts. Furthermore, his/her position involves power such as the power to objectify, name and displace other forms of knowledge like the one of client's narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith, 2005</xref>: 33, 120).</p>
<p>When investigation focuses on this kind of professional action, the analysis begins by <bold>identifying the various agent positions of social workers</bold> and the performances that follow in a working process with a child and his/her family keeping in mind that several simultaneous positions are also possible. It continues by <bold>discovering the regulatory texts and discourses (such as laws, policies and professional discourses)</bold>, the determinants of her position and the working procedure in question. Together they create a hierarchal organization, a kind of two-way street for institutional coordination; first, for the making of institutional realities and representations out of people's actualities so that they become actionable for child welfare, and second, for the organization of institutional texts so that texts at one level establish well organized frames and concepts operating at lower levels in the production of institutional realities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith, 2005</xref>: 185–200). When making the relations of ruling visible, recognition of <italic>intertextuality</italic> and the role and relations of the various textual frames for practice is one of the key points since this analytical phase makes it possible to expand the exploration also to higher levels of organization.</p>
<p>The following case example from Satka's research illustrates this point. At first Satka reorganized the collected case file data as temporally shaped working processes. The duration of one process varied from a few weeks to several months depending on the case and the surrounding conditions and possibilities to deliver services. ‘Working process' is a very practical term: it covers the actions of the social worker and other professionals such as they are documented until some solution to the posed problem is achieved. The common start is an official referral of a child by someone to the municipal authorities of child protection. A particular working process comes to its end when the problem is solved, or a decision is made by the child protection authorities. Next, the detailed working processes were reconstructed one by one and plotted on a temporal diagram on the basis of the main events documented by the social worker.</p>
<p>The social workers must process a case under the same regulatory texts in their practices when working in one organization at the same time. It means that their practices are organized by particular orders, discourses and conceptual practices and by the professional culture of the time. They apply all these in various ways depending on the actual situation, personal preferences, and need of the child. The task is to discover how people involved in child protection practices become related to each other in pre-determined ways as mediated by various texts and how the position and performances of the social worker have been conditioned by the contemporary relations of ruling. In what follows, Satka is <bold>reading the documents from the point of view of the writing social worker in time and place</bold> and analysing, based on the documents written by him/her, how the uses of regulatory power take place in his/her relations to children and parents – how, for example, the workers themselves and their practices are regulated by discourses, various regulations (especially by laws), and forms of the current child protection practice.</p>
<p>The following is an example of how to write a report when the task is to discover the interpretive scheme for a child protection organization in time and place. The limits of the article require this to be brief; if writing this as part of the research process, the record would describe the archive carefully, outlining the background of the case, the process of involvement and a detailed observation about the report in terms of how the practices are organized by particular orders, discourses, conceptual practices and culture of the time:<disp-quote>
<p>At the end of the 1960s a boy is born to a family who live in bad housing conditions. The father has a history in children’s institutions and suffers from drinking problems. The relationship of the couple is filled with disagreements. When the boy is about one year old, a social worker from another town makes an official referral to child protection authorities based on the mother’s concern of her baby boy, whom she has been forced to leave with his father.</p>
<p>Because of the announcement, the responsible social worker is obliged to investigate the boy’s condition and circumstances for adequate care and protection immediately (LsA §3 and local regulations). In this case, the social worker is positioned as <bold>prime investigator</bold> and mandated to make the required official account of the boy’s case. The task for evaluation is determined by the legal discourse of child protection but its content is flexible and follows thus e.g. organizational tradition and knowledge of theories of child care and experience in child protection evaluations more than a textually determined procedure which does not exist. Thus, the social worker in charge invites the boy’s father to her office immediately but – at his request – the social worker decides to make a home visit.</p>
<p>In her investigation of the boy’s conditions the main emphasis is given 1) to parenting, in this case to the father (and mother) from the point of view of his attachment to the boy, as well as 2) to his ability to co-operate with child protection authorities. The result is: the father is normal and honest. An equally important result in the evaluation report is 3) the evaluation of conditions at home and in life in general: especially tidiness at home, parents’ way of life and family income. The description is detailed, but the report does not end with a final conclusion. As the boy was sleeping during her visit, the only professional statement concerning the boy’s well-being (i.e. a statement that was mostly based on information given by the father) in her report is: ‘While sleeping the boy seems to be a child who is cared for.’ These performances in the reporting are based on the long institutional tradition of child protection, child psychology and attachment theory, and might thus be referred as <bold>the contemporary conceptual practice of child protection</bold> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011416878">Satka, 1995</xref>). The legal discourse sets the task but does not provide a ready-made means as to how to complete it.</p>
<p>Many sentences in the report seem neutral on the surface, however, for anyone knowledgeable in child protection discourse, they build strong relations with regular causes of concern in child protection practice, i.e. they activate knowledge of child protection discourse. For example, the report states how the person who provides day care for the boy is a former client of child protection whose own children are presently in custody. It also makes visible inconsistencies in the father’s statements. Nevertheless, the boy is left to his father’s care without further monitoring.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This story paints a vivid picture of the 1970s complexities of Finnish social work practices of front line child protection work. The pre-determined positions for social workers might be contradictory and they may lead them to act as mediators against their personal will and also against their professional knowledge in the ruling relations at present. The story helps to understand the power of both regulative and discursive texts in time and place but leaves open how to interpret transformations in time as part of the broad socio-historical context of knowledge formation and changing modes of governance.</p>
<p>The discovery of discourses, norms and orders through this particular lens, involved a kind of detective work; it presumes an analytical reading of the documents with particular questions in mind, like: What terms does the author of the document use? What actions are taken? What problem definitions are made and intervention strategies taken? It is helpful <bold>to write a memo of observations</bold> of each working session. In the next phase the memo serves as an extra source to identify the key terms – and the related terms – which organized the working process of the child protection social worker. In addition, the memo serves as material for the sketching of a conceptual map that refers to intertwined discourses and regulations which are influential in the actual working process. The remaining task for the researcher based on a considerable number of case analyses is <bold>to reconstruct a well-argued plot for the story</bold>, i.e. ‘the skeletal underpinnings' of how the setting worked, and what were the ruling relations of coordinating and ordering the daily practices of child protection social workers in a particular office at a particular time.</p>
<p>The writing of the analysis means telling a well-argued story of what you have learned from the data: that means in many cases an interpretation by the investigator of how the data illuminates the way the setting works and how it exercises the power it has in the lives of individuals, and what the social relations of the setting are like. ‘Analysis is done in your writing and as you write’, claim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011416878">Campbell and Gregor (2002</xref>: 93). One of the key objectives of the analysis is to identify working processes. In practice this means reading the data (texts) analytically by using familiar reading practices to child protection so that it makes visible how they are coordinated. The investigator has to rely on her insight to identify what points are analytically interesting. She has to make conceptual links to the analytic framework of social organization of knowledge which refers to what is lived and brought into existence in time and place by actual people. The interpretative argument is developed in stages by tracing a chain of reliable arguments as the data allows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011416878">Campbell and Gregor, 2002</xref>: 93–99; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011416878">Smith 2005</xref>: 183–220).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1473325011416878"><title>Step Four: Genealogy as a tool to make history speak back to the present</title>
<p>Genealogy, in our opinion, offers a way to move from describing, interpreting and analysing the in-depth case study set out in earlier steps towards a broader critical appraisal of how this relates to the broader legal, organizational, political, intellectual and social context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011416878">Garland, 1992</xref>). There are many examples of how genealogy has been used drawing directly from Foucault's history of the present approach (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011416878">Dean, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011416878">Garrity, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011416878">O'Farrell, 2005</xref>) and the potential of Foucault-informed studies to analyse the nature and form of child welfare and social work are well evidenced in recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011416878">Garrity, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011416878">Gilbert and Powell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011416878">Schmid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011416878">Skehill, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011416878">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011416878">2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011416878">Skehill (2010)</xref> demonstrated how social workers were engaged in constructing child welfare discourses in the post-war period in the UK (Northern Ireland) on a case by case basis and highlighted how the relations between the practices and the broader discourses coming from policy were far from linear or one-directional. The emerging findings from ongoing research demonstrates the benefit of capturing the <italic>nature</italic> of transformation via a genealogical frame to offer an insight into the history of child welfare during this key moment beyond the general histories that are currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011416878">Caul and Herron, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011416878">DHSSPS, 2003</xref>). For example, such histories report the core factors affecting developments at the time as including the challenge of dismantling the poor law; professionalization of practice; development of work processes; policy development and new relations between different levels of government and processes of governance (e.g. Central Government; Ministry of Home Affairs and local authority welfare committees). A genealogical analysis looks in-depth at how these factors impacted on <italic>specific</italic> practices via a lens focused on layers of power relations, regulations, discourses and institutions. It focuses on a key moment of transformation (in this case, the shift from the Poor Law to the welfare system from 1947–1953) in one jurisdiction, and involves the consideration of the individual case file discourses (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011416878">Skehill, 2010</xref>) in the context of the practices of the welfare committees and the Ministry of Home Affairs in particular. Through focusing on a particular question which relates to the <italic>nature</italic> of practice during this period, data emerges from these documentary sources that absorb the reader in the process of literally how decisions were made to employ certain professionals as child welfare experts and respond in a certain way to child welfare needs. As found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011416878">Skehill (2010)</xref>, the current genealogical analysis finds continuity in practice regarding the emphasis on the ‘socio-legal’ responsibilities of the committee and the Ministry and the ever-present balance between regulation and support. Themes such as ‘boarding out’; ‘parental rights orders', ‘children committed to care’ are brought forward via a genealogical analysis which illuminates how the local committee and/or the Ministry interpreted the new child welfare legislation of the time and how this translated to practice via the welfare and children's officers charged with doing this work. Effectively, genealogical analysis avoids presenting transcendental truth about how practice <italic>was</italic> by relying on a specific empirically based focus to derive understanding and illumination on context. Its aim is to create a history of the present which is critical, attentive to complex power relations and interested in how certain practices become discourses and discourses practices.</p>
<p>The question remains, could one combine a Smith informed analysis, as set out in Steps One to Three, with a genealogical analysis? Reflecting back on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1473325011416878">Figure 1</xref>, the contribution genealogy could make would be to enable the development of a more interactive mapping of the relations between discourses and practices, at various levels including subject, organization, municipality, policy, theory and so on which emphasizes relations based on problematization of the subject; discourses and power especially at the moments of transformations. Considering the detailed case analysis provided by Satka, in response to her question of how the relations of ruling operated in everyday practice, genealogical analysis takes this further by posing questions such as: How did the social worker become the prime investigator in child welfare? What positions were common, and on the other hand, impossible for a child protection social worker or for a mother? Bearing in mind the connection between power, subjectivity and discourse, genealogical analysis could raise more critical questions from this in-depth analysis to consider, for example, how was it possible that notwithstanding the legal context, the social worker appeared to exercise notable discretion in determining the outcome of this case?</p>
<p>In sum, the argument in Step Four has been that genealogy offers a framework which enables the analysis of relations between discourses and practices to focus on the <italic>specificity</italic> of the wider context rather than merely considering this at a macro level. Moreover, in addition to a broad conceptual approach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011416878">Skehill, 2007</xref>), genealogical analysis offers excellent tools to examine moments of transformation by analysing the range of discursive and non-discursive forces that come to impact on that moment. In so doing, it helps to map relations between micro and broader macro levels of analysis in terms of how practices and discourses emerge from local centres of power and at the same time, offers a means by which one can analyse layers of inter-connectedness and variations. Genealogy thus helps us to achieve the final aim in our approach which is to be able to introduce a story of the nature of the present care versus control tensions as borne out in history. The way forward for this work is that Hoikkala is presently completing her PhD, combining these methods and Skehill and Satka are developing this methodology for application in relation to parallel research. Thus, the work remains ongoing.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1473325011416878" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For the three authors of this article, our starting point has been a concern about the present conditions in child protection practice influenced by a broad history of the present stance; we are interested in history that speaks back to people. While using different starting methodologies, the shared aspect of our work has been the transforming balance of care and control in child protection practices in our own jurisdictions since both countries have evidenced a turn towards more control during the last decades (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011416878">Satka et al., 2007</xref>). In examining this transformation, three main concepts are paramount: discourse, power and the subject (or agent). Steps One to Three have demonstrated how one might map and analyse the intertextual mediation of ruling power into the grass root practices of child protection social work in time and place within this context. The steps show how documents can be interpreted in a thoroughly in-depth manner – taking the insight arguably further than Foucault's more illustrative approach can do (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011416878">Skehill, 2007</xref>). However, our argument has been that if one wishes to fully understand the nature of power relations in transformation, while maintaining a focus on the specific rather than the general, it is Foucault's genealogy – Step Four – which is most constructive for helping to make sense of the nature and form of local practices and subjectivities vis-a-vis the wider socio-political context.</p>
