<abstract>
<p>Existing studies on peer rejection are predominantly quantitative in nature and do not adequately engage children’s voices and provide a comprehensive view of the peer rejection phenomenon. There are also limited studies at the preschool level, especially in the Singapore context. This study addresses these limitations by presenting insights into what constitutes a holistic understanding of the phenomenon. The objective is to investigate the subjective perceptions of the rejection phenomenon as experienced by different preschool children, and to draw out the essential characteristics of these experiences. A qualitative collective case study methodology informed by phenomenology was employed. It utilized in-depth individual interviews and children’s dialogic engagement with their drawings to elicit the meaning of experiences from eight preschool children from four to seven years old. Seven major themes and 31 sub-themes emerged from the data, illustrating the complexities of the children’s perceptions. They demonstrate that the children were capable of identifying and appraising their peer rejection experiences in terms of attributions, coping mechanisms and effects. The study reveals that peer rejection appeared to be an inevitable component of peer interactions, predisposing them to a host of adverse consequences. Although there are common elements, the personal construction of experiences led to diversities existing within the phenomenon, illustrating the uniqueness of some of the experiences. The implications for appropriate pedagogical practices to help preschool children cope more effectively with peer rejection are presented.</p>

<p>Early peer relationships are crucially important for children because the child who is rejected and prevented from participating fully in the peer culture can experience negative consequences in his development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12456251">Asher and Williams, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476718X12456251">Hartup and Moore, 1990</xref>). Peer rejection has also been reported as a dominant predictor of later life adjustment, leading to maladjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476718X12456251">Pedersen et al., 2007</xref>). It has also been noted that the reputation for being rejected once acquired also tends to persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476718X12456251">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>). Mize and Ladd (1990, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456251">Choi and Kim, 2003</xref>) observed that peer rejection not only emerges but also stabilizes in the preschool years. Another compelling reason to address the problem of peer rejection is the heart-wrenching ordeal children facing rejection are undergoing. These include distressing feelings of victimization, alienation, sadness, insecurity and a sense of self-worthlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X12456251">Blackhart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X12456251">Cassidy and Asher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X12456251">Crick and Ladd, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of the studies during the last decade have been primarily quantitative in nature focusing on behavioral and social correlates of peer rejection. Two main groups can be discerned – correlational and experimental studies. They generally utilized some forms of sociometric and/or teachers’ ratings of peer status, and sought to identify the at-risk group by examining links between behavioral problems and other aspects of children characteristics, and peer rejection.</p>
<p>In general, the empirical studies indicated that children who display externalizing (e.g. aggressive) and/or internalizing (e.g. withdrawn and anxious) behavioral problems are more likely to be rejected by their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476718X12456251">Ladd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476718X12456251">Rieffe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476718X12456251">Waas and Gracyzk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476718X12456251">Wood et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Significant predictive relationships have also been found between insecure attachments and peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476718X12456251">Wood et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476718X12456251">Szewczyk-Sokolowski et al. (2005)</xref> added temperaments into their studies, and concluded that temperament was a stronger factor influencing the predictability of peer relationships than the quality of the child’s early attachments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476718X12456251">Wood et al. (2002)</xref> have examined differences amongst sub-groups delineated by gender for preschool children and the results showed that in general overt aggression was associated with peer rejection more for boys while rejected girls tended to display more relational aggression and internalizing behaviors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476718X12456251">Ladd’s (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476718X12456251">Waas and Graczyk’s (1999)</xref> work indicated that age is a factor to be considered. Their findings revealed that externalizing behaviors tend to be correlated with peer rejection during early rather than later childhood. Rejected children have also been reported to have a higher tendency to show an attributional bias to ambiguous peer events which suggests that they suffer from a general delay in social reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X12456251">Crick and Ladd, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476718X12456251">Rieffe et al., 2005</xref>). A group of researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X12456251">Cassidy and Asher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X12456251">Crick and Ladd, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476718X12456251">Hubbard, 2001</xref>) have investigated children’s perceptions of their peer experiences by exploring the underlying emotions associated with being rejected by peers. They employed experimental studies and their findings showed that rejected children experienced a greater sense of loneliness and expressed more verbal and facial anger.</p>
<sec id="section1-1476718X12456251">
<title>Limitations of quantitative studies</title>
<p>The trend in the above-mentioned studies appears to be the employment of quantitative methodology using some measures of observable constructs. Even internal constructs such as emotions, awareness and subjective responses were coded. Such research captures limited and distinct components of the phenomenon. They also embraced researchers’ pre-conceived knowledge because they determined what the important variables were to be investigated.</p>
<p>The quantitative studies have therefore used an external lens to examine peer rejection. This lens can be viewed as one that focuses on peer rejection as an overt phenomenon and naturally shifts the focus to conduct studies on already rejected-established children. This can lead to a biased and limited understanding of the rejection phenomenon.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the manner in which interventional studies have responded to the findings in the field by seeking strategies to overcome the factors that have been identified by these quantitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456251">Ayduk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456251">Choi and Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476718X12456251">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>). What is apparent is that such studies are guided by what is known about peer rejection from the empirical evidence and therefore likely to be limited to tackling observable and/or measurable characteristics such as aggression, social deficiency and insecure attachment. They hold a longer-term view towards the problem rather than helping children cope with the immediate distress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1476718X12456251">
<title>Foregrounding children’s voices</title>
<p>Hence, depending on external measures only allows researchers to identify partial and possibly inaccurate understanding of the complex nature of peer rejection. In order to capture the unseen dimension of the peer rejection phenomenon, there is a need to probe deeper by going beyond the external facet to what lies within the child. There is the possibility that children’s agendas are unconsciously sidelined when the research focus is taken over by an adult’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476718X12456251">Davie et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476718X12456251">Hood et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476718X12456251">Wright (2003)</xref> called for adults to lay aside their preconceived notions in order to penetrate the world of children.</p>
<p>Engaging children’s voices is important if we are to seek a true understanding of their rejection experiences. Their perspectives can provide us with valuable insights as to which children will most likely benefit from intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X12456251">Crick and Ladd (1993)</xref> stated that for children who have experienced rejection, ‘an understanding of their feelings in social situations may be crucial in delineating possible sources and contributors to their peer difficulties’ (p. 244).</p>
<p>A common reason cited for a lack of research that focuses on preschool children’s perspectives is that they are not able to critically describe or evaluate their experiences. This view suppresses the richness and complexities of children’s perspectives by attempting to box-up children’s experiences into a predictable developmental outlook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476718X12456251">Hood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X12456251">Robbins, 2003</xref>). This deficit view of children however has been vigorously challenged in recent years by the more contemporary image of the young child as one that is capable of making meanings from diverse experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X12456251">Arthur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X12456251">Dahlberg et al., 1999</xref>). The ‘new’ sociology of childhood supports this conception of children as competent social actors and privilege their voices and active role in socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476718X12456251">Matthews, 2007</xref>). In her research on children’s emotions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476718X12456251">Sorin (2003)</xref> emphasized that ‘children’s voices can be powerful and possibly richer than those adults acting on behalf of children’ (p. 31).</p>

<title>Framework for the study</title>
<p>To fully comprehend the phenomenon of peer rejection, one needs to go beyond externalizing problems and intersubjectivity to what is developing within the child. Listening to children’s voices enables researchers to understand children’s experiences from their perspectives. I have adopted a postmodernist framework which is particularly supportive of children’s conceptual understanding and meaning-making from their experiences. Two central tenets of the framework are:</p>
<list id="list1-1476718X12456251" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>Children are not only experts of their own experiences, but also competent thinkers and communicators of these experiences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The emphasis is on a personal construction of reality which allows for the existence of diverse realities within a phenomenon.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Knowledge in this context is no longer viewed as just a mere reproduction of facts, but is open-ended, and children are regarded as active and capable meaning-makers of their own experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X12456251">Dahlberg et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section5-1476718X12456251">
<title>Overall research design</title>
<p>The case study methodology informed by phenomenology was adopted as the main design for the study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X12456251">Feagin et al. (1991)</xref> viewed case study as an ideal methodology when there is a need for a holistic, in-depth investigation of an issue. Therefore, the author embraced this because it provided a mode of inquiry for a comprehensive investigation into a complex issue. In particular, the collective case study approach was adopted because of the need to examine a number of cases in order to inquire into a particular phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476718X12456251">Stake, 1995</xref>). The bounded system of the case study also makes it suitable for it to be employed together with other qualitative strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476718X12456251">Merriam &amp; Associates, 2002</xref>). As the research purpose requires the understanding of the phenomenon as it is understood from the perspectives of the participants, added emphasis was given to this by incorporating principles drawn from phenomenology in the overall approach. The defining characteristic of phenomenology is the study of the lived experiences of the people encountering the phenomena and how they interpret these experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476718X12456251">Bogdan and Biklen, 2003</xref>). The search for the essence of the phenomenon from the perspectives of those encountering it constitutes the central tenet of the phenomenological approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476718X12456251">Van Manen, 2002</xref>). Phenomenologists therefore embrace the notion of multiple realities because they are seeking for the subjective meanings of experiences. The ‘voices’ of the participants are given centrality in the search of meaning. The focal theme of my research is in line with this pursuit of the meaning of an experience. The objective is to understand the subjective perceptions of the rejection phenomenon as experienced by different preschool children, and to draw out the essential characteristics of these experiences. Such experiences will be laden with emotional content that is not easily quantifiable and will require an approach that seeks out the meaning of these from an insider’s view. The case study approach informed by phenomenology allowed the author to explore this type of less overt, more complex personal information in an in-depth manner and to uncover the essence of such lived experiences. The methodology therefore provided an excellent platform in which the children ‘voices’ were brought to the forefront.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The children for the study were recruited solely from the author’s preschool class. The sample consisted of four girls and four boys with ages ranging from four to seven years. In line with the research focus which upholds children’s voices and values them as reliable informants of their own experiences, both parental consent and the children’s assent were sought for the research project. The process of obtaining children’s assent involved explaining the main features of the research study in terms appropriate for children’s comprehension. Children were encouraged to ask questions in order to clarify their understanding. Agreement of participation was elicited through the completion of a child’s ‘consent’ form designed specifically for the study, the contents of which were carefully explained to them. When completed, the children were asked to comment on what they had expressed in the form in order to further ascertain their understanding further. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476718X12456251">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476718X12456251">2</xref> are examples of two completed forms.</p>

</fig>
<p>The in-depth one-to-one individual interviews were employed as the main instrument. A semi-informal interview structure was adopted to allow the author to explore the children’s ideas naturally as they evolved. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. Confidentiality of the participants was maintained by the use of pseudonyms. The design of the interview incorporated a hypothetical scenario in the form of a narrative story about how a child encounters a rejection episode as an indirect approach to seeking the children’s perspectives on the topic first before exploring their personal experiences. Specific analytic questions were also developed to engage children’s perspectives further after the hypothetical case was presented.</p>

<sec id="section7-1476718X12456251">
<title>Children’s inter- and intra-dialogic engagements with their drawings</title>
<p>To probe deeper into what lies within the child, the author has integrated children’s drawings and their narratives about their drawings either through self-talk, the intra-dialogic dimension, or through interacting with the author, the inter-dialogic dimension, into interview process. The exploration of children’s inter- and intra-dialogic engagements with their drawings was chosen as a key thrust of the data collection process because in recent years, this methodology has been proven to be a successful instrument to access children’s inner thoughts, reflections and emotions. Past literature on children’s drawings which focused only on the end product has led to a deficient view which examined only the structural aspects of children’s drawings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X12456251">Cox, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X12456251">Coates and Coates (2006)</xref> noted that the emphasis on the tangible outcome rather than on the relationship between children’s narratives and their drawing process has led to a failure to capture the most crucial aspect of children’s meaning-making which is ‘children’s simultaneous utterances which might potentially inform the nature and content of the work and help to elucidate their intentions and processes of thinking’ (p. 221). Through exploring the accompanying narratives and drawing process of very young children from three to five years old, they provided evidence that the dialogic engagement serves as a window to the thinking behind the finished drawing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X12456251">Brooks (2005)</xref>, in her examination of the interpersonal and intrapersonal dialogues of young children’s drawing, also concluded that through these, children were able to explore increasingly complex ideas. The inter- and intra-personal dialogue that emerge from the drawing process cannot be dichotomized from the drawing itself. What children say when they draw and what they draw should be considered together, and both should be seen as an integrated unit if we are to be able to draw upon this methodology in getting the critical information about children’s perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476718X12456251">Dockett and Perry, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1476718X12456251">
<title>Data analysis and interpretation</title>
<p>The concept of ‘explicitation’ from phenomenology was used in the data analysis and interpretation process. The term is used to emphasize the need to keep the phenomenon intact while examining the parts (Hycner, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476718X12456251">Groenewald, 2004</xref>). To accomplish this, the author employed a modified version of the explicitation process outlined by Hycner. This commenced with a procedure termed as bracketing and phenomenological reduction. It requires that one brackets ‘all knowledge, all theory or theoretical meaning, all belief in what is real, and aim at evoking concreteness or living meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476718X12456251">Van Manen, 2002</xref>). This means that any subjective judgments or preconceived notions about the phenomenon need to be bracketed out or suspended so that they did not intrude into the unique experiences of the participants. The author conceded that this process of phenomenological reduction presented itself with challenges in practice. All researchers are positioned – by their pre-understandings and historicity as they relate to the research issue. To attain a purely objective stance is elusive and has been deemed not necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X12456251">Ahern, 1999</xref>). The process of reflexive bracketing has been adopted instead. This constituted a process which required a tuning in to oneself so as to be consciously aware of one’s subjectivity and how this can possibly impact the interrogation of the data. The essence of this is to understand how one’s positionality on the issue influences the research and to ensure that an openness is adopted to the way the phenomenon may unfold itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476718X12456251">Finlay (2008)</xref> alluded to this as a ‘phenomenological attitude’, a process which allows the researcher to preserve ‘a wonder and openness to the world while reflexively restraining pre-understandings’ (p. 1).</p>
<p>The second procedure in the explicitation process is the development of coding categories. The literal content of each interview was examined thoroughly in order to extract those parts which can be delineated into units of meanings. This was followed by classifying units of meanings into initial themes. From these, general and unique themes were teased out to streamline the data further. This shaped the data and drew out the essence of the experience. Care was taken to preserve differences because some children’s experiences of the phenomenon were unique. Finally, a composite summary was drawn up in which the phenomenon was reconstructed into a holistic picture. To stay through to the phenomenological reduction concept, themes which emerged from the interview data were not derived from any existing biasness, theories, philosophies, taxonomies or paradigms. By themselves, they represented an original or fresh viewpoint of the phenomenon that was being investigated. This was very much in line with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476718X12456251">Van Manen (2007)</xref> had stated, that phenomenological themes are the working material for the phenomenon being explored.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The process of coding/categorization of the transcripts took on a fluid nature. Initial categorization was reviewed with each additional interview being analyzed. The results yielded seven major themes which captured the essence of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1476718X12456251">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Nature and context of rejection acts, and types of rejection</title>
<p>All the children were able to identify specific acts of rejection suffered by them. Four main categories can be discerned: employing exclusion, showing disapproval, employing verbal hostility and using physical aggression. Acts of exclusion dominated the children’s perceptions of what rejection is. Most of these were blatant and overt in nature, and can be individual or group rejections. The following were some of the typical responses:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Alan:</speaker>
<p>In the game, they don’t let me. . . they don’t let me. . . they don’t let me sit in the boat.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>Because. . . because. . . actually they have one more space to play with. Then I saw that space. Then I went and ask them and then they say no.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ding:</speaker>
<p>They are playing at the. . . they are playing family. Then one time I. . . I come already but they still don’t want to play with me.</p>
</speech>
<p>Only one child reported a rejection act that is more subtle: ‘Inside the school bus, the two bad guys cover his mouth like this [puts hands over his mouth].’ Feeling hurt, he uttered that they ‘do bad things’ to him. The play arena emerged as the fertile ground for acts of rejections. Most of the acts of rejection took place in the context of free/unstructured play.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1476718X12456251">
<title>Occurrence of rejection acts</title>
<p>The majority of the children recounted acts of rejection in the current year. However, three of the children remembered rejection acts inflicted on them in the previous year while one child recalled such acts at least two years before. This shows that that peer rejection can be a traumatic event in a child’s life as they are etched in their memories long after it has happened.</p>
<p>The other notable features are the repeated nature and the short duration of the rejection acts. Most of the children bemoaned how they had to contend with acts of rejection repeatedly. One child was able to describe this vividly to the author (Joan):</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>‘Mm. . . do they do this to you once or twice or many times. . . or a few times?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Alan:</speaker>
<p>Twice already.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Twice already huh. You mean recently twice?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Alan:</speaker>
<p>I mean that day.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Twice on that day! What about other day . . .?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Alan:</speaker>
<p>They do more times.</p>
</speech>
<p>The following account on the other hand depicted clearly the short-lived nature of these acts:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Let’s talk about. . . you know. . . that day with John. You said he didn’t want to play with you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Anne:</speaker>
<p>Yes. Umm. . . tomorrow he will play with me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>He will? Why do you say that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Anne:</speaker>
<p>Because he’s not thinking about bad things?</p>

<title>Internal struggles experienced by the children</title>
<p>Peer rejection was an emotion-provoking social incident for all the children. The state of rejection is generally perceived by the children as a painful and stressful event resulting in distress at various levels. Most of the children described themselves as suffering from a range of emotional difficulties such as feeling sad, angry, unloved, etc., rather than from a single dominant emotional distress. The following account showed how agonizing the experience could be:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>Sad also.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Sad. . . and what else?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>And rejected also. Rejected and then I cry already. Because after everyone keeps doing me so pain, then is. . . the heart will pump so. . . pump. . . will pump not quickly anymore and slower and will be angry because the. . . the children make my whole body so angry.</p>
</speech>
<p>Struggling with feelings of alienation was another major distress cited by some of them. A vivid portrayal of this sense of abandonment can be seen from the following child’s drawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1476718X12456251">Figure 4</xref>). The visual separation from the group of peers projects this sense of isolation.</p>

</fig>
<p>The accompanying narrative tells of how the child was painfully ‘ignored’:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Let’s talk about what happened alright. So they were all ready to catch the ball. And what. . . why were you here, not together with your friends?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>Because they all don’t let me. . . invite me to play.</p>
</speech>
<p>Later on in the conversation:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>You want to take the ball, is it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>Mm hmm. But the children keep throwing over here (points to ball in the picture).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Oh the other side. You wanted this boy to throw the ball to you (points to boy in the center)?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>(Nods)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>But he threw the other side.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>And how does that make you feel?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>Rejected.</p>
</speech>
<p>Only one described feelings of victimization and another, fear of retaliation. These were unique perspectives.</p>
<p>The findings also revealed that the personal difficulties encountered by the children were not of the same level of severity. Some of the children seemed to experience elevated levels of distress. One child, for example, harbored feelings of hurt so much so she had an episode of nightmare about it. This other child was obviously less affected by it: ‘I just go home. . . I just go home. . . I just go home and play with my sister.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1476718X12456251">
<title>Attribution of rejections by the children</title>
<p>The majority of the children were able to assign attributions to rejection acts. Only on a few occasions, the children were unable to understand the cause of the rejection meted out to them. The two major causal factors cited were deviant/inappropriate behavior and the existence of differentness. One child, for example, was able to attribute her rejection by her peers to her unacceptable action of ruining their play and she stated apologetically, ‘. . . I’m not do that one anymore. . . anyhow mess up the things. . . the toys at. . . at yesterday.’ Another child, on the other hand, understood her personal rejection experiences as arising from gender differences:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>Yes. He. . . he. . . he didn’t want to let me be Power Ranger. He loves to be Power Ranger.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Oh he loves to be Power Ranger. You wanted to be Power Ranger with him. Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>I want to be the pink one.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Pink Power Ranger?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>I can be Power Ranger too!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Yes. I noticed he always play Power Ranger. Okay, so he didn’t want you to be Power Ranger. Why do you think he didn’t want you to be Power Ranger?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>Because I am a girl!</p>
</speech>
<p>The other only attribution cited is the unwillingness to accommodate additional playmates by the rejectors as portrayed by the following: ‘Because they. . . they don’t want me to play. They say they didn’t tell me only three persons can. . . two persons can play with her. The. . . then that’s why I go to a corner.’</p>
<p>The data reveal that the children perceived acts of rejections primarily not as spontaneous acts but as a reaction to certain conditions, issues or behaviors. It can further be seen that most of the causal factors perceived by the children can be classified as internal attributions, that is, the outcome was caused by self.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1476718X12456251">
<title>Coping mechanisms employed by the children</title>
<p>Seven different types of coping strategies emerged from the data: seeking adult’s help, conveying desire directly, employing problem-solving strategy, resorting to hostile retaliation, complying with demands, seeking alternative playmates and making withdrawals. Each of the children embraced more than one type of coping mechanism.</p>
<p>Seeking adults’ help emerged as the single most popular strategy. The children tended to view adults, in particular the teacher, as authority figures who could actively intervene in their situation and advocate their cause on their behalf. The drawing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1476718X12456251">Figure 5</xref> and following narrative illustrate this:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. And I went to tell the teacher.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Okay and. . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>And the teacher is next to me okay. (Adds picture of teacher.) It’s you.</p>
</speech>
<p>Later on in the conversation:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>What can the teacher do?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chen:</speaker>
<p>She says, ‘Jason you must play with Chen.’</p>
</speech>
<fig id="fig5-1476718X12456251" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1476718X12456251-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The prevailing pattern which emerged is that the children employed chiefly an active/ confrontational rather than a passive avoidant style of coping strategies. Active coping strategies are problem-focused and are directed at manipulating or altering some aspect of the triggering factor. Only one child adopted a more passive coping strategy by submitting to the demands his rejectors:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>What can you do. . . you know. . . so that they want to play with you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>Give them my toy and broken it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Give them your toys huh.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>You know toys.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>Yeah I can see. And what do you mean by broken it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>I let Jason and Kang broken it one. Because I let them broken. . . because I will make another one.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1476718X12456251">
<title>Unique themes</title>
<p>Some unique perspectives of the children’s rejection experiences have already been presented within the major themes. There were other unique perceptions which did not fit into any of the major themes.</p>
<p>For example, one child assumed both the roles of the rejecter and rejectee when what started out as a request which was impolitely delivered ended up with a double rejection scenario:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>Yah. I saw my Marymount Kindergarten. . . and I saw Andrew.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>And what did he do?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>And he didn’t ask politely, I don’t let him play.</p>
</speech>
<p>Later on in the conversation:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Joan:</speaker>
<p>So he didn’t ask politely. . . how does that make you feel?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eddy:</speaker>
<p>Mm. . . rejected.</p>
</speech>
<p>This is understandable with one whose rejection sensitivity is high and/or who has a tendency of making hostile attributions for his peers’ ambiguous acts. Rejection acts also tend to snowball when they are coupled with reactive aggression.</p>
<p>The rejection scenario depicted by the drawing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1476718X12456251">Figure 6</xref> was also different from the rest. For this child, rejection was perceived even though she belonged to a group as well. This could be the case when one group is perceived to be more popular than the other group, and belonging to this so-called ‘in-group’ becomes desirable. The child was denied entry to such a group even though she tried. Evidence that the incident was a ‘heart-wrenching’ issue for her could be seen when she drew weeping hearts to represent her group’s condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study explored the lived experiences of eight children by engaging their voices through in-depth one-to-one interviews in order to gain an insider’s perspective of the phenomenon of peer rejection.</p>
<p>Overall, the children in the current study perceived peer rejection as a pervasive negative relational phenomenon capable of upsetting the children’s sense of well-being because it predisposed them to a host of adverse consequences and coping reactions which were felt at various levels and intensities by the children.</p>
<p>The current study provided evidence that preschool children are capable of identifying and appraising their peer rejection experiences. They were able to give personal interpretations of these experiences. This finding is consistent with the observation made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X12456251">Cassidy and Asher (1992)</xref>. They indicated that young children between five and seven years old are capable of discerning when they have peer relationship difficulties, including those relating to peer rejection.</p>
<p>The concept of rejection which emerged from the study is that of exclusion from an activity. The children perceived peer rejection primarily as specific acts which exclude another from their play activity. They were therefore more overt than subtle in nature. This is not surprising because preschoolers’ perceptions tend to be more concrete than abstract.</p>
<p>Most of the rejection acts recollected by the children occurred during the free/unstructured play periods. In their study which analyzed the reasons for peer rejection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X12456251">Asher and Williams (1993)</xref> also concluded that rejection among young children tend to revolve around play situations. They commented that preschoolers and early grade-school children are likely to base their decision to accept or reject a child on whether the child is fun to play with.</p>
<p>Both individual and group rejections were experienced. Preschoolers’ play can occur at various levels, ranging from solitary play to cooperative games. Hence children’s interactions which are mainly embedded in play activities also exist at the individual and group levels resulting in both types of rejections occurring.</p>
<p>Peer rejection seemed to be an inevitable component of peer interactions. All the children in the study reported personal accounts of peer rejection incidents. From a teacher’s assessment of their peer status, the author would classify the children in the current study as socially well-adjusted rather than rejected children. However, this did not preclude them from encountering peer rejections.</p>
<p>The findings further revealed that peer rejection can emerge very early in a child’s life. Two of the children indicated rejection experiences which could have occurred to them when they were as young as three years of age. This is consistent with the finding made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476718X12456251">Wood et al. (2002)</xref>. They attested that peer rejection can emerge as early as three to five years of age because children often experience their first cohesive peer group when they enter preschool, and this is where they will begin to encounter both positive and negative peer interactions.</p>
<p>A prominent characteristic of the rejection acts that could be inferred from this study was its non-enduring but recurring quality. Most of the children perceived the rejections inflicted upon them as having a rather transient nature, and the difficulties they experienced with their peers were restored subsequently over a short period of time. This tended to happen on a repeated basis.</p>
<p>It was also evident from the present investigation that peer rejection can be a stressful and emotionally painful event for preschoolers because they have to deal with multiple forms of distress. All the children saw themselves as hurting as a result of being rejected by peers. The finding therefore supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X12456251">Sandstrom’s (2004)</xref> suggestion that rejection experiences can be perceived of as a ‘stressor’ for many children because of the subjective distress which it can cause.</p>
<p>Perceptible differences in subjective responses to rejection experiences were experienced by the children in the study. Some experienced heightened trauma while others were obviously less upset by their experiences. This suggests that the children differ in their rejection sensitivity, and it could be an important factor contributing to the heterogeneity in children’s subjective responses to their rejection experiences. These observations are consistent with those made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456251">Ayduk et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476718X12456251">Sandstrom et al. (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>The fact that the majority of the children were able to perceive the reasons for their rejections implies that they did not perceive the acts of rejection as spontaneous acts. This supports what has been put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476718X12456251">Arnold et al. (1999)</xref>. Although their study focused only on aggressive acts, the researchers were able to conclude from their investigations that for preschoolers, acts of rejections are rarely spontaneous acts. The children however have a tendency to hold critical self-referent causal attributions. Internal attributions emerged as the main attributional style. Such a non-adaptive attributional style can add further distress to a child’s emotional state.</p>
<p>The current study also shed light on what preschool children perceived as the main causes of their rejection experiences. Two main groups of causal factors were cited: inappropriate/deviant behaviors and differentness by the participants. This finding corroborates with the established views in the field of what are considered to be the main antecedents to peer rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X12456251">Burton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476718X12456251">Evans, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476718X12456251">Waas and Gracyzk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476718X12456251">Wood et al., 2002</xref>)</p>
<p>The children employed chiefly an active/confrontational coping style. Seeking adults’ intervention emerged as the main coping mechanism. This stemmed from the children’s perception of adults, in particular the teacher, as the authority figure capable of bringing the desired change to their adverse circumstances. Overall, the active/confrontational coping approach used by the children in the current study can possibly be explained by the fact that preschoolers have the required language and cognitive skills to be more proactive and self-directed in their problem-solving.</p>
<p>Although some main trends did emerge from the current study, peer rejection as perceived by the children was far from being a unitary phenomenon. Many of the children gave unique appraisals of their rejection experiences, formulating meaningful interpretations from their personal viewpoints. This supports the viewpoint made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X12456251">Sandstrom (2004)</xref>. She observed that there is variability in children’s cognitive, behavioral and emotional responses to negative peer encounters. Such variability reflects and preserves the postmodernist perspective of children that perceives children as unique individuals capable of forming and shaping their own understanding of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X12456251">Dahlberg et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section17-1476718X12456251">
<title>Implications for pedagogical practice</title>
<p>The current investigation provides evidence that peer rejection can be a pervasive problem among preschoolers. In Singapore, the majority of our young children are in preschool settings. Hence it is likely that many of the children are subjected to the problem of peer rejection from an early age. This necessitates re-looking at the early childhood curriculum to include the development of social skills as a critical input in children’s education. Many of the existing social skills programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X12456251">Ayduk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X12456251">Choi and Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476718X12456251">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>) are designed as intervention strategies which are primarily aimed at helping child who has been accorded the rejected status. However, the current study has shown that all the children were affected regardless of their social status. In other words, the preschool social skills program should not be a restricted program designated only for children accorded rejected status. Instead it should form an integral part of the preschool’s overall program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476718X12456251">Johnson et al. (2000)</xref> highlighted that the preschool years are critical periods for social skills development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476718X12456251">Howard (1998)</xref> indicated that although preschool children have the potential to acquire social skills, the behavior itself must be learned. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X12456251">Asher et al. (1982)</xref> stated that children’s peer relations can improve when peer interaction takes on a mutually satisfying and productive nature. Hence the problem of peer rejection in the preschool should be dealt with in a more comprehensive manner to benefit every child.</p>
<p>The main results from the current study suggest that there are certain crucial aspects that must be included in the social skills program in order to tackle the problem of peer rejection more effectively. The program should include the following as key components:</p>
<list id="list2-1476718X12456251" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Develop children’s perspective taking abilities. The incidence of rejection can be reduced when children are better able to empathize with the affected child. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X12456251">Barrett (1999)</xref> noted that preschoolers are capable of altruistic behavior.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Equip children with appropriate communication skills. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X12456251">Kemple (1992)</xref>, a preschooler’s ‘no’ could mean many things – for example, there are too many players already in this game or I can play with you later but now I want to be alone. Early childhood practitioners can guide children to respond in more positive terms such as teaching them to give a reason for the exclusion or provide alternatives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide on-the-spot guidance especially during play/free interaction time. The social skills program should be a two pronged approach embracing the formal as well as the informal curriculum. The latter is particularly important because it has been seen that free play is the main context in which rejection takes place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adapt to the individual child. The heterogeneity in terms of the children’s perception of their rejection experiences means that there is no one-fit-all type of solution. Individualized strategies may be necessary to meet specific needs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Work in partnership with families. In the current study, the parents were primarily depicted as playing the ‘rescuer’ role where they approached the teacher to seek some form of intervention for their children. Instead of this, parents can be advised to adopt a more positive approach such as facilitating their children’s problem-solving skills. Practitioners can facilitate parental support in a more productive manner.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Another key finding is that preschool children can be subjected to multiple forms of distress, some of which may be quite hurtful and traumatic. Hence intervention should not just be targeted at the development of social skills. It should embrace the emotional needs of the preschool child as well. The preschool child who is undergoing the painful ordeal of being rejected may require immediate attention from the teacher to help him/her cope with the consequent emotional upheaval. This can be looked upon as a ‘first aid’ measure of helping a child facing distress from rejection. It will help prevent the distressed condition of the child from deteriorating into a more serious emotional state which may have longer-term adverse consequences.</p>

<title>Recommendations for future research</title>
<p>Future research could focus on expanding the investigation to incorporate qualitative observational data so that there is some triangulation to increase the validity of the overall data. This should be a supplementary measure. Another supporting measure which could be included in subsequent research to strengthen the data is to consider interviewing preschool children either at the point or shortly after their rejection experiences. This would be extremely valuable in eliciting children’s emotional response to their rejected state. I have noticed that the preschool children in my class would often approach me almost immediately to share about their predicaments. This therefore is an important channel for exploring children’s perceptions because the incidents would be fresh in the children’s minds. The current study explored the perceptions of preschoolers in a full-day childcare setting. However, in the Singapore context, the kindergarten preschool setting constitutes a significant part of the local preschool scenario. Future research should therefore this in order to ascertain whether the setting is a crucial variable. The present investigation has demonstrated that children differ in their rejection sensitivity and that their subjective responses could be crucial in determining the detrimental effects of peer rejection, regardless of their status. The variables that contribute to children’s rejection sensitivity could be explored in future studies.</p>
