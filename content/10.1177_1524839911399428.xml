<abstract>
<p><italic>Objectives</italic>: The purpose of this project was to evaluate a water safety curriculum in a low-income, minority-focused, urban youth summer camp. The curriculum is available to Safe Kids Coalitions across the country; however, it has not previously been evaluated. <italic>Methods</italic>: Participants were pre-K to third-grade students (<italic>n</italic> = 166). Children watched a video and received the curriculum in a classroom setting. Each child was given a pre-, post-, and 3-week retention exam to assess knowledge change. Mean test scores and number of safety rules participants could list were analyzed using paired Student’s t tests. Parents were given a baseline survey at the beginning (<italic>n</italic> = 140) and end of the weeklong curriculum (<italic>n</italic> = 118). <italic>Results</italic>: The participants were 50% male, 27.5% Hispanic, 68.7% African American, and 3.8% biracial. Children were divided into three groups: pre-K/kindergarten, first and second grade, and third grade. Children in each of the groups received higher knowledge scores at the posttest (<italic>p</italic> = .0097, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, respectively), with little decline in scores at the 3-week retention exam. Similar results were seen for the ability to list safety rules, though the number fell slightly between the posttest and retention test. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: The study demonstrates that children possessed more knowledge of water safety after receiving this curriculum. This knowledge increase was maintained through the 3-week retention exam. Further evaluation of the curriculum’s content and its impact on water safety beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are needed, as well as evaluation of additional settings, risk areas, and the role of parental involvement.</p>

<title>Introduction/Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1524839911399428">
<title>Drowning Incidence and Prevalence</title>
<p>Drowning is among the top three causes of unintentional injury death in the United States among children aged 0 to 14 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911399428">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006</xref>). The CDC reported 3,579 unintentional drowning deaths in the United States in 2006. Of these, 765 were children. In Texas, drowning was the leading cause of unintentional injury death among children 1 to 4 years old in 2006. At 32.7% of all deaths in the 1- to 4-year age group, drowning in Texas was attributable to a higher percentage of young child deaths than the national average (28.4%) that same year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911399428">CDC, 2006</xref>). Among older children aged 5 to 14 years in 2006, drowning was the second leading cause of unintentional injury death in Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911399428">CDC, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In Travis County, Texas, where summer heat draws residents to water, 33.3% of accidental deaths are attributed to drowning among 1- to 4-year-olds and 7.7% of the same deaths among 5- to 14-year-olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911399428">Texas Department of State Health Services, 2006</xref>). Travis County is home to the city of Austin, an urban setting with a substantial minority population and an abundance of free and low-cost municipal swimming pools (both natural and artificial) and neighborhood/apartment complex pools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839911399428">
<title>Increased Risk in Urban Communities</title>
<p>Children of low-income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911399428">Schwebel, Brezausek, Ramey, &amp; Ramey, 2004</xref>), urban families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911399428">Santer &amp; Stocking, 1991</xref>) have been shown to be at greater risk for injury in general. In addition, a 2006 study by Saluja et al. showed that minority populations (in particular Black and Hispanic male youths) are at greater risk of drowning than their White counterparts. A national study in 1994 revealed that 62% of African Americans self-report a limited swimming ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911399428">Gilchrist, Sacks, &amp; Branche, 2000</xref>). Other studies suggest that low-income and minority populations may have fewer opportunities to take swimming lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911399428">Gilchrist et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911399428">Schuman, Rowe, Glazer, &amp; Redding, 1977</xref>). As of the 2006-2008 American Community Survey, Austin was classified as a minority majority city with Hispanics and African Americans representing 35% and 8% of the population, respectively, and White non-Hispanics at 49.4%. Therefore, the abundance of swimming opportunities in the metropolitan area combined with low-income (23.8% of children younger than 18 years live below the poverty level) and increasing minority populations, render drowning prevention education particularly relevant to the Austin community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911399428">U.S. Census Bureau, 2006-2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the research highlighting the need for public health interventions in the area of water safety among low-income and minority youth, there is a paucity of evaluated programming available for this population. To our knowledge, no water safety programs exist that are designed specifically for the cultural learning styles of minority populations. For this reason, the researchers chose an urban summer day camp setting serving exclusively low-income and minority youth (African American, Hispanic, and Biracial). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Danger Rangers water safety curriculum on these participants’ water safety knowledge.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 166 pre-K through third-grade students attending an urban youth summer camp participated in the program. Children were split into classrooms by grade, with one pre-K, one kindergarten, and two first-, second-, and third-grade classrooms. A parent or guardian of each child was provided with written information about the research study and gave consent for themselves and their child or children to participate.</p>

<sec id="section6-1524839911399428">
<title>The Danger Rangers Water Safety Program</title>
<p>The Danger Rangers Water Safety curriculum was developed by Educational Adventures in collaboration with the American Association of Health Educators and SafeKids Worldwide. The curriculum is available to 250 SafeKids coalitions throughout the United Stated and internationally.</p>
<p>The Danger Rangers water safety program consisted of a water/sun safety cartoon-style video, classroom story book, a detailed curriculum guide for each classroom leader, and an activity book and certificate of completion for each child. The curriculum was delivered daily for 4 hours over 1 week of a 6-week program. Prior to the start of camp, classroom leaders, representative of the cultural backgrounds of participants, attended a 4-hour teacher training, including a curriculum overview and question and answer session. The curriculum was age appropriate and differed for each grade group: pre-K through kindergarten; first through second grade; and third grade. For each group, the first lesson centered on viewing the water safety video and completing an activity based on the video’s story line or message. Each lesson encouraged family participation with home assignments.</p>
<p>Pre-K through kindergarten curriculum consisted of three lessons, including participation in a “float versus sink” science experiment, learning safety rules through dramatic play, and investigating the role of lifeguards in water safety. First and second grade students participated in five lessons, including the “float versus sink” science experiment, investigation of the role a lifeguard plays in water safety, learning of water safety rules through song, identification of water safety items, and the importance of sunscreen use. Third-grade students’ activities were more advanced and consisted of identification of water safety rules with development of a community-based water safety plan, use of sunscreen and tracking of the local UV index, water safety advocacy, investigation of water safety devices and their use, and development of a water safety book. Each classroom was visited by a lifeguard, who explained his or her job, the importance of water safety, and answered student questions. Children also participated in a nonresearch-related field trip to a water park where classroom leaders reinforced lessons from the curriculum.</p>

<sec id="section7-1524839911399428">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study used a pretest/posttest design with a 3-week post intervention test to assess participants’ retention of the curriculum. Prior to study start, parents were asked to provide baseline information regarding their child’s swimming ability, history of swimming lessons, use of sunscreen, and prior clinic or hospital visits for near drowning. All program participants were administered a pretest on the first day of the water safety curriculum to assess general baseline knowledge. On the third and final day of the water safety curriculum, participants were administered a posttest to assess water safety knowledge gained. Three weeks after the posttest, participants were given a retention test to determine water safety knowledge retained. Parents were asked to complete a survey at the end of the water safety week to recount observations of their child’s interest regarding water safety and Danger Rangers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839911399428">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Mean overall test scores and mean number of rules listed for each age group separately were compared using paired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. To ensure that study findings were not because of chance given multiple comparisons, statistical significance was considered at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA SE10 (STATA, College Station, TX).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 166 (92.7%) camp participants consented to participate in the Danger Rangers water safety research program (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911399428">Table 1</xref>). One parent (&lt;1%) denied giving consent to participate and 12 (6.7%) neither gave nor denied consent. Of the consented participants who provided data on race (<italic>n</italic> = 131), 90 (68.7%) were Black, 36 (27.5%) were Hispanic, and 5 (3.8%) were biracial. Fifty percent of all participants were female and the overall mean age of participants was 6.9 years (±1.5). Overall, 44% of participants who provided baseline water safety information reported knowing how to swim prior to the program, whereas 37.1% reported having taken swimming lessons previously. According to participants’ parents, none of the children (0.0%) reported receiving past medical treatment for a near drowning episode. Only 9.4% reported always wearing sunscreen prior to program participation, whereas 78.3% reported sometimes wearing sunscreen, 11.6% reported never wearing sunscreen, and 0.72% (one individual) left the item blank.</p>

<p>To compare the total number of water safety rules listed, data were analyzed for the two oldest age groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839911399428">Table 3</xref>). Pre-K/kindergarteners were not asked to write lists of water safety rules because of the complexity of the task. The first/second grade group were able to list significantly more rules on the posttest as compared with the pretest (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), with a slight decline from posttest to retention (<italic>p</italic> = .0023). Despite this, the number of rules listed in the retention test was still statistically higher than that of the pretest (<italic>p</italic> = .0014) for this group. The third graders also demonstrated an increase in the mean number of rules listed from the pretest to the posttest (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) with a similar decline from posttest to retention (<italic>p</italic> = .0136).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although research suggests that water safety and drowning prevention efforts should be directed at low-income and minority youth, few evaluated programs are available to this specific population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911399428">Greene et al. (2002)</xref> evaluated Think First, a nationally available brain and spinal cord injury prevention program with a water safety component. This school-based program was found to increase knowledge among child participants and represents one of the only other nationally available injury prevention programs that cover water safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911399428">Greene et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911399428">Gresham et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to this previously tested program, the Danger Rangers water safety program, delivered to pre-K through third-grade children attending an urban summer camp, was shown to increase children’s knowledge of water safety.</p>
<p>Our study has several strengths. We were able to target minority youth in this study. In warmer climate urban settings, where public swimming opportunities abound, special attention should be given to water safety and drowning prevention education among preschool and school-aged minority and low-income children. Programming should address possible cultural and economic circumstances that may put minority and low-income children at greater risk for drowning. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911399428">Saluja et al. (2006)</xref> suggests that community-wide, culturally appropriate interventions are needed to target low-income and minority children, youths, and their families. Cultural factors and learning styles must be further explored to develop and deliver effective drowning prevention programs among these high-risk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911399428">Anderson, 1988</xref>). Saluja et al. further suggest that lower income families may be at greater risk because they lack opportunities to take swimming lessons. Inability to access swimming lessons combined with cultural factors may also affect drowning risk for minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911399428">Saluja et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings demonstrated that only 37.1% of study participants previously had swimming lessons. Future studies should examine the combination of the Danger Rangers curriculum with a swimming lesson component to increase access and to increase the interactive dimension of the intervention.</p>
<p>In addition, the inclusion of a parental component in the Danger Rangers intervention may have contributed to the success of this program. We were able to involve almost 80% of parents via a postcurriculum questionnaire. It was clear from questionnaire results that children in the program were reporting to their parents about lessons learned from the Danger Rangers program. Researchers have long found social support (and by parents and teachers in particular) to be particularly protective factors in successful prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911399428">Cobb, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911399428">Durlak, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911399428">Heaney &amp; Israel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911399428">McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, &amp; Glanz, 1988</xref>). The fact that classroom leaders matched the cultural backgrounds of participants may have had a beneficial effect on participants’ experience with the curriculum. Parental inclusion in drowning prevention programs is also important as vigilant parental supervision is widely recommended as a drowning prevention strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911399428">Brenner, Trumble, Smith, Kessler, &amp; Overpeck, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911399428">Passo Coffman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911399428">Schnitzer, 2006</xref>). Parental involvement in drowning prevention programs also merits further examination.</p>
<sec id="section17-1524839911399428">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although the Danger Rangers curriculum was considered age appropriate, the researchers feel that the evaluation tests of the pre-K/kindergarten group created for this study may have been too easy, thus resulting in high pretest scores and little change at posttests and retention tests. Future research and programming should focus on age-appropriate evaluation tools for this age group. This study examined changes in knowledge only and did not look at behavioral changes, nor injury outcomes in this population as a result of participation in the Danger Rangers program. Further study of content validity is recommended. Additionally, the single group study design may also serve as a limiting factor for this study as the increase in knowledge scores could be attributable to other factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1524839911399428">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study demonstrates that children possessed more knowledge of water safety after receiving the Danger Rangers curriculum. This knowledge increase was maintained through the 3-week retention exam. Further evaluation of the curriculum’s content and its impact on water safety beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and injury outcomes is needed, preferably in a randomized control trial. In addition, the Danger Rangers curriculum should be examined in other settings (e.g., classroom setting during the school year) and additional risk areas for this population should be explored.</p>
