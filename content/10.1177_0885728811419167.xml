<abstract>
<p>Individuals with disabilities face persistent challenges in gaining meaningful employment. One of the barriers to successful employment is a lack of employability skills. The purpose of this study was to identify employability skills that employers value as being important and to examine whether employers have different expectations for individuals with and without disabilities. One hundred sixty-eight employers from different industries participated in this survey study. Employers considered certain skills as essential for all entry-level employees; however, there were noticeable differences between employers’ expectations for employees with and without disabilities. Different expectations were also found between male and female respondents and between employers from service/business areas and those from science/technology areas. Implications of study findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Employment is a major aspect of social integration. Research on the well-being of individuals with disabilities (IWD) has revealed that employment is positively related to various dimensions of quality of life, including economic resources, job satisfaction, positive self-perception, active social network, recreational activities, and preferred living arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885728811419167">Blackorby &amp; Wagner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885728811419167">Butterworth &amp; Gilmore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885728811419167">Stephens, Collins, &amp; Dodder, 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, IWD generally achieve poorer employment outcomes than the rest of the population. As a group, they encounter issues such as unemployment or underemployment, low wages, and a lack of support in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811419167">DeLeire, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885728811419167">Yamaki &amp; Fujiura, 2002</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885728811419167">Office of Disability Employment Policy (2009)</xref> reported an employment rate of only 19.8% for IWD aged 16 and above compared with 64.6% for individuals without disabilities. Not surprisingly, in 2008, the median household income for those without disabilities was about twice as high as it was for those with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885728811419167">Bjelland, Burkhauser, Schrader, &amp; Houtenville, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The low rate of employment of IWD may be attributed to a number of factors. One of the major obstacles is employers’ concerns about, and misconceptions of, employing IWD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885728811419167">Millington, Rosenthal, &amp; Lott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885728811419167">Unger, 2002</xref>). Specifically, many employers doubt that IWD have the necessary work-related skills and work-related personality attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885728811419167">Johnson, Greenwood, &amp; Schriner, 1988</xref>). Furthermore, in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885728811419167">Domzal, Houtenville, and Sharma (2008)</xref>, employers who self-reported as not actively recruiting employees with disabilities cited a lack of employability skills and experience as the second major reason for not hiring them. Indeed, inadequate work skills, poor attendance, abusive behaviors, refusing to accept instructions, punctuality, appearance, and safety have been associated with job loss for IWD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811419167">Blanck, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885728811419167">Chadsey &amp; Beyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885728811419167">Olson, Cioffi, Yovanoff, &amp; Mank, 2001</xref>). Thus, employability skills are important for job search and retention and it is necessary for schools to provide relevant trainings to youths with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885728811419167">Bryen, Potts, &amp; Carey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811419167">Guy, Sitlington, Larsen, &amp; Frank, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Employability skills</italic> refer to general and nontechnical competencies required for performing all jobs, regardless of types or levels of jobs. They are not job specific, but are considered attributes of employees that make them an asset to employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811419167">Buck &amp; Barrick, 1987</xref>), and are “skills which cut horizontally across all industries and vertically across all jobs from entry level to chief executive officer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885728811419167">Sherer &amp; Eadie, 1987</xref>, p. 16).</p>
<p>Research has suggested that employability skills can be, and need to be, taught by schools so that students are better prepared for successful employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885728811419167">Cotton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885728811419167">Poole &amp; Zahn, 1993</xref>). It is particularly important to identify general employability skills that employers expect from entry-level employees so that a variety of vocational preparation programs can incorporate them into their training.</p>
<p>Prior research has attempted to identify employability skills that employers expect all entry-level employees to possess. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811419167">Baxter and Young (1982)</xref> surveyed 96 employers and other stakeholders to identify skills and attitudes high school graduates needed to be employed. The most valued skills fell in areas of employee attitudes, communication, and basic knowledge. The highest rated attitudes were dependability, staying with a task, getting along with others, and recognizing the importance of good health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885728811419167">Hazler and Lotto (1987)</xref> surveyed 46 employers and found similar results. Attitudes (e.g., dependability, staying on task, getting along with other people) were also rated as most important, followed by general skills (e.g., reading, listening, speaking), with job-related skills (e.g., record keeping) rated last. More recently, four organizations (i.e., the Conference Board, Corporate Voices for Working Families, the Partnership for 21st Century Skills, and the Society for Human Resource Management) conducted a survey of 231 employers to obtain their perspectives on basic knowledge and applied skills of new entry-level employees. The five skills rated as most important for high school graduates were professionalism or work ethic, teamwork or collaboration, oral communication, ethics or social responsibility, and reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885728811419167">Casner-Lotto &amp; Barrington, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, little research has been done involving IWD (i.e., individuals who received special education in school under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act). The limited number of studies that involved this population have tended to focus on employers’ attitudes toward IWD, aiming to identify employers’ perspectives on benefits and concerns of employing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885728811419167">Hernandez, Keys, &amp; Balcazar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885728811419167">Mansour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885728811419167">Unger, 2002</xref>) rather than general employability skills.</p>
<p>A limited number of studies specifically examined employability skills that employers’ expect of IWD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885728811419167">Burton and Bero (1984)</xref> interviewed 25 employers in southern California to determine the skills they expected of employees with disabilities. Most interviewees mentioned interpersonal skills and social skills, such as dependability, accepting authority, getting along with people, and persistence. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885728811419167">Chamberlain (1988)</xref> surveyed 46 employers in San Diego County. Employers ranked four categories of employability skills for employees with severe disabilities from most to least important: work-related skills, personal attributes, communication, and social skills. The top five most important employability skills included getting along well with others, interest in the job, efficiency, dependability, and adaptability.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that very few studies compared employers’ expectation of employability skills for employees <italic>with</italic> and <italic>without</italic> disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885728811419167">Bricout and Bentley (2000)</xref> conducted a survey on employers’ employability ratings of job applicants with and without disabilities. In particular, survey respondents were asked to rate applicants without disabilities, with acquired brain injury and with schizophrenia on 22 employment-related attributes from four categories, including personality, power, competence, and professionalism. They found nondisabled applicants were rated higher than applicants with a severe disability. There is a need to compare employers’ expectations for employees with and without disabilities because such comparisons may reveal potential discrepancies in the requirements of employability skills, which schools can then take into account when preparing students with disabilities for employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885728811419167">Bricout &amp; Bentley, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, existing research on employability skills has not investigated employers’ perceptions within the context of their attributes, such as gender of respondents, types of industries, and company size. For example, the sector of a given business or industry can be a factor that affects employers’ attitudes toward the employment of IWD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885728811419167">Unger, 2002</xref>). Finally, most studies that have addressed employers’ expectations of employability skills were conducted in 1980s and 1990s. However, the importance of entry-level employability skills may change over time due to the evolution of knowledge, technology, and globalization. Employability skills that were not perceived as important 10 or 20 years ago may be considered important in the 21st century. Therefore, a new study with a larger sample of today’s employers is needed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify employability skills that employers expect of entry-level employees with and without disabilities. The present study was designed to answer three research questions:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from a metropolitan area with a population of approximately 150,000 and its surrounding seven counties. A list of 950 businesses was obtained from the primary Chamber of Commerce in the area. Among the businesses, 625 had valid email addresses, which were used to send an email, along with instructions, to the head of these 625 businesses to invite them to go online to complete a survey.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted via the Qualtrics system, an online survey system managed by the university where the authors were employed. Responses to survey items were individually captured for each respondent and stored in an Excel data file. Four weeks after the first mailing, a second round of email invitation was sent to these businesses again to encourage participation.</p>
<p>A total of 188 individuals started the survey, reflecting a 30% participation rate. However, 20 of the forms were not complete and, therefore, were eliminated. As a result, a total of 168 (26.7%) participated in the study. Among respondents, 84 (50%) were males and 84 (50%) females; 148 (88%) were Caucasians, and the rest were African Americans or belonged to other races. Their job titles included manager, CEO, director, president, owner, and so on. Nineteen (11.3%) employers indicated having worked at their current position for 0 to 5 years, 34 (20.2%) for 6 to 10 years, 48 (28.6%) for 11 to 20 years, and 67 (39.9%) for more than 20 years. A total of 94 (56%) employers worked in a company with fewer than 50 employees, 20 (11.9%) in a company with 50 to 100 employees, and 54 (32.1%) in a company with more than 100 employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0885728811419167">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>A researcher-developed survey instrument was used. Survey items were generated based on a review of previous studies, published topical reports, and current school practice. An electronic search was conducted by using the following databases: Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Vocational &amp; Career Collection (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (CSA). Search terms included <italic>employability, employability skills, job skills, vocational skills, employer, attitude, expectation, satisfaction, handicapped</italic>, and <italic>disability</italic>. Skills drawn from identified literature were added to the draft instrument, which was later reviewed by selected transition educators and specialists. The final instrument consisted of two sections. Section I contained 36 items which represented 36 specific skills or attributes. These 36 items were further divided into five categories, each of which represented a specific skill or attribute area (construct) that is potentially important for an entry-level employee. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of each skill on a 4-point Likert-type scale for employees with and without disabilities, separately. The five skills or attribute areas consisted of basic skills (8 items), higher order thinking skills (4 items), personal management skills (11 items), interpersonal skills (6 items), and personal attributes (7 items). The four choices included “not important,” “somewhat important,” “very important,” and “extremely important.” Section II consisted of items that collected demographic information on respondents’ gender, type of industry, educational levels, and years of experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0885728811419167">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The Excel file generated from the Qualtrics system was converted to an SPSS file. Before any analysis was conducted, the data file was screened for incomplete or missing data. As a result of the screening, 20 incomplete cases were deleted and 2 cases with some missing values were dealt with using the conventional data imputation method of substituting means for missing values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885728811419167">Hertel, 1976</xref>). This resulted in a final sample of 168 cases. For the purpose of data analysis, the variable labeled “types of industries,” which originally included 16 types, was recoded into two types. Specifically, eight types were coded as science/technology (<italic>n</italic> = 61, 37%). These included agriculture, food, and natural resources; architecture &amp; construction; arts, audio/video technology, and communications; health science; information technology; manufacturing; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and transportation, distribution, and logistics. The remaining eight types were recoded as service/business (<italic>n</italic> = 107, 63%). These included business, management, and administration; education and training; finance; government and public administration; hospitality and tourism; human services; law, public safety, corrections, and security; and marketing, sales, and service. The reason for this classification of two types of industries was that we were interested in examining differences between those companies that were in the science/technology fields versus those in the service/business fields. We believed that because employers in these two fields had distinctly different training and engaged in distinctly different work (one on production and the other on services), their perceptions and tolerance levels might be significantly different. Similarly, we felt that females might be more caring and tolerant than males and might have answered the survey differently. So, we decided to compare the difference between males and females. The variable of gender was dummy coded for this comparison. However, age and ethnicity were not of interest to us in this study because we did not feel that age and ethnicity of the respondents would significantly affect their perceptions about employability skills.</p>
<p>As indicated, the 36 items in Section I of the instrument were categorized into five areas (constructs) based on prior research. To further confirm the constructs, factor analyses were conducted to examine whether items in each construct measured similar skills and belonged to the same category. Specifically, we used the cross-validation approach to examine the robustness of factor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885728811419167">Thompson, 2004</xref>) in four steps: (a) randomly splitting data for the IWD group into two halves, (b) analyzing the first-half data with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure, (c) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to cross-validate the factor structure with the second-half data, and (d) using CFA to cross-validate the same factor structure with the individuals <italic>without</italic> disabilities group.</p>
<p>The EFAs were computed in SPSS (Version 17.0) using the principal components analysis with Varimax rotation methods. The factor extraction was based on the scree plots. Of all 36 items, only items with factor loadings larger than .45 on a construct were selected. Five items were excluded from the analysis according to this criterion. As a result, 31 items were kept and divided into five constructs: basic skills (4 items), higher order thinking skills (9 items), social skills (6 items), basic work skills (7 items), and personal traits (5 items). All the CFAs were conducted following the EFA by using Mplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885728811419167">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2004</xref>) to confirm the five constructs for the IWD group and individuals <italic>without</italic> disabilities group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885728811419167">Table 1</xref> lists model fit indices on all five constructs for both groups. All the model fit indices suggest a fair to good fit, confirming the constructs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885728811419167">Table 2</xref> provides the final items of the five constructs as well as the excluded items. Internal consistency reliability was examined for each construct and measured by Cronbach’s alpha (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885728811419167">Table 2</xref>).

<p>After the constructs had been validated, a mean score across all items was calculated for each construct and used as the composite score for the construct. Two different analyses were subsequently conducted. First, average ratings on each construct for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities were graphed, and descriptive statistics were calculated. The purpose of this analysis was to compare average rating scores among all the constructs within each group. Second, a repeated-measure MANOVA was conducted on each construct to examine whether the average ratings were different for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities group versus employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. The repeated-measure MANOVAs were performed because each respondent was measured multiple times, and there were multiple dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811419167">George &amp; Mallery, 2008</xref>). The multivariate test is considered to be far more powerful than any other analysis approach or even the most powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885728811419167">Davidson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885728811419167">O’Brien &amp; Kaiser, 1985</xref>). Specifically, the present study employed the repeated-measures design of “two between and one within factors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885728811419167">Stevens, 2009</xref>, p. 440). The within-factor consisted of each construct for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. The two between-group variables were gender and types of industries (i.e., science/technology and service/business). An advantage of this design was that it allowed for simultaneous interpretations regarding whether there was any difference on ratings for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities and whether the differences were associated with the respondents’ gender and/or the type of industry.</p>

For employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities, the five highest means are same, except for the last item, which for individuals without disabilities was “ability to read with understanding” (<italic>M</italic> = 3.59, <italic>SD</italic> = .70).</p>

<p>The descriptive statistics and the zero-order correlations (based on the composite scores) for the five constructs for both groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885728811419167">Table 3</xref>. As shown, the means of all five constructs for the employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities group are higher than those for the employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885728811419167">Figure 1</xref> presents graphical comparisons of the five constructs between employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. Two trends can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885728811419167">Figure 1</xref>. First, the five constructs are ranked in the same order for both groups; from the highest to lowest means are basic skills, basic work skills, social skills, personal traits, and higher order thinking skills. This indicates that there is a set of generic skills that employers consider as fundamental for both employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. Second, within each construct, the ratings for employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities were higher than the ratings for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities, which indicates that employers may have higher expectations for employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities than for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities, which needs to be further confirmed by the following multivariate tests.</p>

<sec id="section10-0885728811419167">
<title>Basic skills</title>
<p>The first repeated-measure MANOVA examined whether the employers’ expectations of basic skills differed for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities, and whether the differences were related to respondents’ gender and/or types of industries. The results revealed one significant main effect for disability status, <italic>F</italic> = 14.396, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .284, observed power = .965, which means that ratings for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities were significantly different (mean difference = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). No main effects were found for gender or types of industry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0885728811419167">
<title>Higher order thinking skills</title>
<p>The repeated-measure MANOVA on higher order thinking skills revealed a significant main effect for disability status, <italic>F</italic> = 14.788, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .288, observed power = .969, which means that there was a significant difference between ratings for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities (mean difference = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The test of between-participant effect also revealed a main effect for type of industries, <italic>F</italic> = 7.360, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .207, observed power = .769, which suggests a significant difference on ratings between respondents from the two the types of industries: science/technology and service/business (mean difference = −0.234, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Respondents from service/business had higher expectations for higher order thinking skills than employers from science/technology. The test of gender effect revealed no significant difference.</p>

<sec id="section12-0885728811419167">
<title>Basic work skills</title>
<p>Multivariate statistics from the repeated-measure MANOVA for basic work skills revealed a significant main effect for disability status, <italic>F</italic> = 7.849, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .214, observed power = .796, and a significant interaction effect for disability status and gender, <italic>F</italic> = 8.825, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .166, observed power = .574. The ratings on basic work skills were different for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities (mean difference = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Female respondents held higher expectations than male respondents for both employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities to have basic work skills. The test of between-participant effect also revealed a main effect for gender, <italic>F</italic> = 8.825, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .226, observed power = .840, which also indicated that female respondents had higher expectations for employees to possess basic work skills than their male counterparts (mean difference = 0.201, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0885728811419167">
<title>Social skills</title>
<p>For social skills, there was one significant main effect on disability status, <italic>F</italic> = 10.588, <italic>p</italic> = .001, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .246, observed power = .899, and a significant interaction effect between disability status and gender, <italic>F</italic> = 5.291, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .177, observed power = .628. Thus, respondents’ ratings on social skills differed for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities (mean difference = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). For both groups, female respondents had higher expectations for social skills than their male counterparts. The test of between-participant effect revealed a significant main effect for gender, <italic>F</italic> = 22.535, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .348, observed power = .997, a significant main effect on types for industries, <italic>F</italic> = 7.028, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .203, observed power = .750, and a significant interaction effect between gender and types of industries, <italic>F</italic> = 4.748, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .168, observed power = .582. These indicate that female employers had higher expectations for social skills than male employers (mean difference = 0.348, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and those from service/business valued social skills more than those from science/technology. The same trend existed among female respondents from both types of industries; that is, they all had higher expectations than males for all employees to have social skills, whereas males from service/business valued social skills more than those from science/technology.</p>

<p>The final repeated-measure MANOVA was performed on personal traits. A significant main effect was found for disability status, <italic>F</italic> = 5.688, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .183, observed power = .659, which means that the ratings of importance of personal traits were different for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities (mean difference = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Two significant between-participant effects were also found, including a main effect on gender, <italic>F</italic> = 4.674, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .166, observed power = .575, and a main effect on types of industries, <italic>F</italic> = 4.429, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, effect size <italic>r</italic> = .162, observed power = .553. These results indicated that for all employees, female respondents valued personal traits more than males (mean difference = 0.159, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and participants from service/business rated personal traits higher than those from science/technology (mean difference = 0.155, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify employability skills that employers value as important for entry-level employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. One finding indicates that the same four skills were viewed as most important for both groups, including “demonstrating personal integrity/honesty in work,” “ability to follow instructions,” “ability to show respect for others,” and “ability to be on time.” Apparently, employers consider some employability skills as essential for all entry-level employees regardless of whether an employee has a disability or not. Demonstrating adequate personal integrity and honesty is most important, even more so than some specific job skills. This is consistent with findings of some previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811419167">Baxter &amp; Young, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811419167">Buck &amp; Barrick, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885728811419167">McCrea, 1991</xref>), which also identified general employability skills such as dependability, attendance, and following instructions as top skills that employers considered most important for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities. All these top-rated skills are fundamental personal attributes rather than specific job skills such as computing skills.</p>
<p>Based on comparisons among the five skill areas, respondents ranked skill areas in the same order of importance for both employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. The most important area was basic skills, followed by basic work skills, social skills, personal traits, and higher order thinking skills. This finding further confirms the results of previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811419167">Baxter &amp; Young, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885728811419167">Murphy &amp; Jenks, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885728811419167">Poole &amp; Zahn, 1993</xref>) that basic skills (e.g., reading, writing, and communicating) are consistently viewed as most important by employers.</p>
<p>However, some noticeable differences were found between employers’ expectations for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities. First, a difference emerged between the two groups in terms of the fifth important skill. For employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities, it was the “ability to show high regard for safety procedures,” whereas for employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities, it was the “ability to read with understanding.” It seemed that employers were more concerned with the safety of employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities, which may indicate a misconception that all people with disabilities have safety problems due to their physical or mental conditions.</p>
<p>If not adequately addressed, this misconception could lead to fears and negative expectations toward hiring IWD. For example, some employers may be afraid that an employee with a disability will require too much supervision, accommodations, or additional job training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885728811419167">Siperstein, Romano, Mohler, &amp; Parker, 2006</xref>). However, this fear is not warranted because most employers who have direct experience with employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities have positive experiences with and attitudes toward hiring IWD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811419167">Levy, Jessop, Rimmerman, &amp; Levy, 1992</xref>). Employers’ differential expectations for being able to read with understanding seem to indicate their low or negative expectations for IWD to be able to read. This misconception often impedes opportunities for those with disabilities to be hired to perform higher level tasks or be promoted to higher level jobs.</p>
<p>Second, employers expected more skills from employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities than from those <italic>with</italic> disabilities in all of the five skill areas, with the largest discrepancy being in the area of basic skills, followed by higher order thinking skills, basic work skills, social skills, and personal traits. Results of the repeated MANOVA tests indicated that the differential expectations were statistically significant for all five areas. Employers’ higher expectations for employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities may be justifiable given the discrepancies between the postschool outcomes of IWD and individuals <italic>without</italic> disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885728811419167">Chambers, Rabren, &amp; Dunn, 2009</xref>). However, employers must be informed about individual differences and the need to avoid stereotypical hiring practices because some IWD are more capable of performing higher order jobs.</p>
<p>When examining the differences within the context of respondents’ gender and type of industry, it was found that respondents from service/business areas had significantly higher expectations than those from science/technology areas for their employees to have higher order thinking skills, social skills, and personal traits, whereas no significant difference existed on basic skills and basic work skills. Clearly, employers in service/business areas valued skills needed for adequate interactions with others (e.g., consumers, clients, coworkers). It was interesting to find that female respondents tended to have higher expectations than male respondents for their employees to have better skills in the areas of basic work skills, social skills, and personal traits. However, it is not clear why female employers value these skills more than male employers. One assumption is that female employers may be overrepresented in certain types of businesses that value these skills more than other types of businesses and, therefore, value these skills more than male employers. It is worth mentioning that because the alpha level was set at the .05 level in our analyses, there was a probability for Type II errors to occur, which means that these differences could be not statistically significant. However, the likelihood of a Type II error is small, but recognizing the difference may make a difference from a practical standpoint.</p>

<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>There were several limitations to the current study. The first is associated with the sample and data collection. Specifically, data were collected based on respondents’ self-report, and some respondents may have provided “politically correct” answers rather than reporting what they truly believed and did. Furthermore, respondents were from a small area in a southern state and, therefore, might not represent the nation. Participation in the study was voluntary, and those who chose to respond might represent a group of employers who had better awareness of disability issues than those who did not respond. Because of these limitations, generalizations of study results should be considered with caution.</p>
<p>Second, the nature of survey studies and the inherent limitations associated with them apply to this study. In particular, we were not able to follow up with respondents to find out why they valued certain skills and in what circumstances. Future research is needed to conduct in-depth interviews with employers about what they know about IWD and why certain skills are or are not important for employees with disabilities compared with employees without disabilities.</p>
<p>Third, educators were not included in the study, and no comparisons were conducted to examine similarities and differences between the perspectives of employers and educators. Educators hold the key to employability skills training. If their perspective does not align with that of employers, the career preparation that students with disabilities receive may be off target. Therefore, future research is needed to compare the perspectives of educators and employers. Findings from such study can be used to inform educators so that they can change perspectives and teach appropriate skills to IWD.</p>

<sec id="section17-0885728811419167">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Knowing employers’ expectations for specific employability skills, educators and vocational rehabilitation (VR) professionals can incorporate these skills into their training programs. Most employers place the responsibility for workforce readiness on educational institutions and new entrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885728811419167">Casner-Lotto &amp; Barrington, 2006</xref>). Schools and VR need to align their job development practices with employers’ needs and teach IWD to focus on employers’ needs when seeking jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885728811419167">Luecking, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, it is essential for IWD to build up and be able to demonstrate these qualities/skills to employers.</p>
<p>Because employers valued certain personal attributes and nonspecific job skills over technical skills, such as integrity/honesty, following instructions, showing respect for others, and being on time, prevocational and vocational training curricula should emphasize these positive work attitudes, habits, and social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885728811419167">DeMario, 1992</xref>). In particular, high schools need to reform their employment preparation programs to put more emphasis on basic skills (reading, writing, and communicating) because employers clearly value basic literacy skills and related academic skills. Unfortunately, a majority of current high school employment preparation programs focus on teaching technical skills (54.8%) and job awareness and exploration (28%), with only 18.5% focusing on general employability skills training in English and math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811419167">Guy et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, many schools stress technical skill training and attenuate academic skill training for IWD.</p>
<p>The findings from this study should serve as a reminder to schools that basic academic skills are most valued by employers. Schools should always emphasize training in basic literacy skills, as well as math and communication skills, and provide students with adequate instruction.</p>
<p>The study found discrepancies between employers’ expectations for employees <italic>with</italic> disabilities and employees <italic>without</italic> disabilities, which indicate potential misconceptions about and bias toward hiring IWD. Lower expectations could be associated with lower pay and benefits, lower level tasks, and job positions. In reality, many studies have revealed that employees with disabilities have average or above-average performance, safety records, and attendance based on employers’ ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811419167">Blanck, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885728811419167">Smith, Webber, Graffam, &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885728811419167">Unger, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To eliminate or diminish potential negative expectations toward IWD, vocational counselors and vocational rehabilitation agencies should proactively respond to employer concerns by building effective business–rehabilitation partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885728811419167">Unger, 2007</xref>), facilitating demand-side job development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885728811419167">Luecking, 2008</xref>), increasing contact with employers, and advocating for IWD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885728811419167">Gilbride, Stensrud, Ehlers, Evans, and Peterson (2000)</xref> suggested that VR agencies develop a systematic approach to managing relationships with employers. Employers who are frequently contacted are more likely to hire IWD than other employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885728811419167">Vandergoot, 1987</xref>). IWD also need training in self-advocacy, job application, and interview skills so that they can demonstrate their potential and convince employers that they have adequate skills for the desired position.</p>
<p>In addition, this study found that respondents from service/business areas have higher expectations than those from science/technology areas for their employees to have higher order thinking skills, social skills, and personal traits. This means that schools must teach more of these skills to students if they plan to work in service/business industries. This finding has direct implication for the transition planning process when students work with their families and support staff to develop their postsecondary employment goals. This goal needs to be specific enough so that appropriate instruction can be provided to the student to prepare them for the industry in which they are likely to acquire employment. Schools also need to provide training to students about the job application and interview process so that they learn how to highlight their skills depending on where they apply for a job and who interviews them.</p>
