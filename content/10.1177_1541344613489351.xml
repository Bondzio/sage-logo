<p>Many well-educated adults, viewed as outstanding students in formal classroom settings, can be fairly inept learners. Their learning ineptitude begins to show when the classroom focus shifts from <italic>what they know</italic>, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613489351">Argyris (1991</xref>, p. 99) called “single loop learning” to inquiring <italic>how they know</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344613489351">Kegan, 2000</xref>). As Argyris explored how to teach “smart people how to learn” (p. 99), he highlighted the difference between finding and correcting errors or solving problems and the more intense and deeply reflective process of understanding how individual tacit knowledge may contribute to the very problems they are trying to solve. Questions that address the latter often stump highly educated students and, in truth, many advanced graduate students become very uncomfortable if they find themselves in a state of <italic>not knowing</italic> for any length of time. The more well educated, the less one expects to be frustrated by, or have difficulty with, new knowledge or skills, yet the “double loop learning” Argyris described requires critical examination of one’s present perceptions and, perhaps, being in a state of not knowing for quite some time. Advanced degree-seeking students typically trust their ability and experience to figure things out quickly and, if they cannot, try to preserve their identity as <italic>good students</italic> by engaging in strategic responses to the unfamiliar knowledge. For example, in the authors’ classrooms, students facing instrumental knowledge that does not quickly connect to past knowledge, have labeled the concepts as “useless” or “strange,” verifying Mezirow’s (1997) contention that people reject ideas as aberrations or nonsense when faced with something that does not fit his or her known world. “Whoever talks like that?” was the judgment placed on unfamiliar terminology in a recent doctoral class.</p>
<p>These same students are even more challenged when faced with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344613489351">Mezirow (1997</xref>, p. 2) described as communicative learning, a process that “involves at least two persons” working to understand each other’s purposes, values, beliefs, and feelings. Because this form of knowing is centered on the knower, it requires students to step back and fully examine the nature or origins of ones’ knowing. Communicative learning in the classroom requires one to freely offer an authentic self—to let go of the well-practiced <italic>good student</italic> behaviors and risk personal discomfort in order to successfully engage in the self-reflection that leads to mutual learning. Most adults prefer to avoid this type of learning in public settings, particularly when they are among a group of strangers. In fact, most students would much prefer to read articles or books, write papers, get a grade, and go home rather than examining personal behaviors and beliefs that might connect them to an organization’s or group’s problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344613489351">Argyris, 1986</xref>). One study of pedagogical approaches in educational leadership classrooms found that students gave the lowest ratings to peer–peer interactions (social processing) and the highest ratings to information processing, activities that included lectures, and writing papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541344613489351">Shroth, Pankake, &amp; Gates, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Communicative learning is essential for current educational environments. The increasingly diverse and dynamic communities require leaders with nimble-enough habits of mind to unify diverse interests. The process of unifying a dynamic ever-shifting community does not occur without advanced capacity or mastery of communicative knowledge. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613489351">Follett (1919</xref>), unifying only works if the “self is always in flux, weaving itself out of its relations” (p. 577), a theory she developed that mirrors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541344613489351">Habermas’ (1971)</xref> dialogical and self-reflective learning and Mezirow’s transformative learning theory. In order to gain more insights into the actual experience of self-reflective learning, Rusch and Brunner initiated a learning experience that used masked identities in a virtual environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344613489351">Brunner, Hammel, &amp; Miller, 2003</xref>) for two doctoral groups on campuses 1,000 miles apart. Our goal was to learn if advance knowledge of approaches to learning would lead to deeper, and perhaps, transformative insights about learner and leader behaviors in multiple contexts.</p>

<title>Transformative Learning</title>
<p>The earliest versions of transformative learning were grounded in Habermas’ view of “reflection as a form of self-formation that emancipates as it releases one from the constraints of dysfunctional beliefs” (Habermas cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613489351">Mezirow, 2000b</xref>, p. xiii). Self-formation requires “communicative competence” because it is “a process of examining, questioning, validating and revising those perceptions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613489351">Cranton, 1994</xref>, p. 26). Mezirow argued that if perspectives really transform, the individual must modify a personal paradigm, reject a habit of mind, or reorder, assumptions, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344613489351">Brookfield (2000</xref>) suggested, can lead to epiphany of cataclysmic proportions or “a shift in the tectonic plates of ones’ assumption clusters” (p. 139).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1541344613489351">
<title>Learning Sensemaking</title>
<p>Perspective transformation is fostered by critical reflection, a process that moves beyond uncovering assumptions or the tacit knowledge that governs actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613489351">Boud &amp; Walker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344613489351">Brookfield, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541344613489351">Schön, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541344613489351">1987</xref>). Critical reflection seeks to understand how power and hegemony actually mediate our assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344613489351">Brookfield, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613489351">Mezirow (2000b</xref>) pointed out that while we easily learn to critique the assumptions of others, learning to critically reflect on our own sacred truths is not as easy. Critical reflection, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344613489351">Kreisburg (1992</xref>), can expose domination and lead to less than comfortable unlearning and relearning experiences.</p>
<p>Instructional experiences that require reflection are rife with dilemmas and pitfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613489351">Boud &amp; Walker, 1998</xref>) because instructors often see reflection as a bounded activity that can take place on demand if one has a good lesson plan, a solid conceptual framework, and treats the process as an intellectual activity. Boud and Walker described challenges that often become insurmountable barriers, such as the inhibiting nature of a formal learning environment and the inherent power relationship between instructors and students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38a-1541344613489351">Weick (1995</xref>) used the term retrospective sensemaking, pointing out that retrospect or reflection centers around the concept “that people can know what they are doing only after they have done it” (p. 24) and “we are always a little behind or our actions are always a bit ahead of us” (p. 26). Despite the challenges, researchers of adult development promote intentional use of reflective practices, so that learners will recognize their own human agency for transforming perspectives, “for liberating ourselves from that in which we are embedded.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344613489351">Kegan (2000</xref>) advocated for the practice, stating, “this is the most powerful way I know to conceptualize the growth of the mind” (p. 34).</p>
<p>In his critique of transformative learning and critical reflection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344613489351">Brookfield (2000</xref>) cautioned that perspective transformation that actually leads to action is no simple task. Human tectonic plate shifts lead to strong emotions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541344613489351">Dirkx (2008</xref>) suggested are “a kind of baggage that impedes effective teaching and learning” (p. 8). In other words, the affective aspects of transformative learning may be seen as the biggest inhibitor of the practice, yet transformative learning (Mezirow), ideological shifts (Brookfield), or double loop learning (Argyris) cannot occur with making sense of the emotions that emerge when smart people become aware of a challenge to long-held beliefs.</p>

<title>Sensemaking</title>
<p>Karl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541344613489351">Weick (1969</xref>) in his seminal treatise on <italic>The social psychology of organizing</italic> highlighted the critical importance of <italic>affect</italic> within groups. In the case of problem solving or decision making, Weick noted, “affective distinctions (i.e. feelings of like and dislike) develop long before the ability to make cognitive distinctions” (p. 14). Drawing from the work of sociologist George Simmel, Weick concluded that the prominence of affect among individuals in groups led people to “like and interact with those who are most similar to them” (p. 14), thus fostering groups that are likely to be connected more by emotions and feelings than intellectual or cognitive elements. Weick’s work foreshadowed efforts of transformational learning theorists to understand the interdependence between the affective and critical reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541344613489351">Taylor, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38a-1541344613489351">Weick (1995</xref>, p. 4)continued to develop his concepts related to human endeavors of organizing, he introduced the notion of <italic>sensemaking</italic>, the process of forming “unconscious and conscious anticipations and assumptions, which serve as predictions about future events.” Pointing out that sensemaking is something more than mere interpretation of the moment or situation, Weick posited that sensemaking also involved “authoring” (p. 8); in other words, individual sensemaking is “creation, as well as discovery” (p. 8). He then connected his concept to Shöns’ explanation of problem solving, a process that involves limiting what one will attend to based on what one gives meaning to or senses. Sensemaking then, Weick argued, “is about ways people generate what they interpret” (p. 13).</p>
<p>The actual process of sensemaking, as delineated by Weick, involves the construction of personal identity (e.g., the definition of self) as a key factor. Two points, among the various interpretations of identity construction, offered a framework for the pedagogical experience described in this article. First, Weick described a “complex mixture of proaction and reaction” (p. 23) that individuals engage in as they interpret the behavior of other and then intentionally try to influence that behavior. Second, and most importantly, Weick argued, “the idea that sensemaking is self-referential suggests that the self, rather than the environment, may be the text in need of interpretation.” (p. 23). In later work, Weick and Roberts explored the concept of a “collective mind” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541344613489351">1993</xref>, p. 357) and concluded that integrative practices based on Follett’s concepts of reciprocity and continuous recreation of the self with in reciprocal relationships were key elements of today’s social and neural networks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1541344613489351">
<title>Classroom Sensemaking</title>
<p>Classroom settings are vivid examples of the self in flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613489351">Follett, 1919</xref>); individuals are constantly engaged in sensemaking and identity construction that, in turn, inform group interactions and group identity. Both students and instructors filter classroom environments through a complex screen of personal assumptions, values, beliefs, and past experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613489351">Cranton, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613489351">Mezirow (2000b</xref>), frames of reference always involve cognitive, conative, and affective dimensions. For example, when learning takes place, the brain becomes very active, sensing surroundings, communicating, and processing previous experiences in an attempt to make sense of people, a situation, or an assignment. Cognitively, the moment is vetted through files of past experiences, looking for an assumptive rubric that best fits what individuals see or feel. Multiple factors such as culture, heritage, class structures, gender, race, and life experience influence an individual’s sensemaking of the moment. Simultaneous to the cognitive processing, personal affect is triggered by memories of past experience.</p>
<p>According to the current brain science, as rapidly as we make sense or meaning of a new situation, person, or idea, our stored emotions, mostly unrelated to the moment, come to the surface, and influence our immediate sensemaking. For example, if the mental file of the past experience (cognitive) is about an encounter that led to conflict or failure, an individual’s affect will instantly inform the current encounter. In other words, stored feelings about a previous experience may shape a lifetime of actions.</p>
<p>Conation, the action or volition of learning, is the most visible elements of sensemaking in any situation. In fact, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613489351">Johnston (1996</xref>), our conative processing compels us to act in a certain manner. When individuals encounter people or situations, cognition reveals the assumptive rubrics that translate into affect and affect, in turn, translates into conation or actions. In face-to-face situations, conative responses, or the actions of sensemaking, are sometimes less than tactful. For example, individuals who easily respond to new ideas can appear visibly impatient with peers who ask persistent and repetitive questions. At the same time, others may appear frustrated with individuals who seemed compelled to offer lengthy explanations and judgments are made about individuals who never contribute anything to a discussion. When interactions are convoluted by race, gender, sexual orientation, or some other form of difference, the affective responses translate into subtle and not-so subtle intra and interpersonal dynamics. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541344613489351">Weick and Sutcliffe (2005)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p> … sensemaking unfolds as a sequence in which people concerned with identity in the social context of other actors engage ongoing circumstances from which they extract cues and make plausible sense retrospectively, while enacting more or less order into those ongoing circumstances. (p. 409)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These dynamics do not foster “unifying” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613489351">Follett, 1919</xref>), and they potentially thwart any individual and/or group potential to practice the skills critical to the development of educational leaders who can unify diverse communities. For individuals to make better sense of a group, they need skilled actions that overcome the scene narrated above. That skill set, we argue, should be grounded in transformative learning, which according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613489351">Mezirow (2000b</xref>) “is at the heart of significant adult learning” (p. xv).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1541344613489351">
<title>Integrating and Unifying</title>
<p>Rusch’s understanding of transformative learning was enhanced by the work of Mary Parker Follett who developed theories in the early 20th century that seem to mirror many of the assumptions that ground transformative learning. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344613489351">Brookfield (2000</xref>) referenced her terms <italic>power over</italic> and <italic>power with</italic> to describe the transformation of the power relationship between students and instructors when promoting critical reflection (p. 137).</p>
<p>Follett had a passion for public life and democratic engagement so, while educating new American immigrants in the early 1900s, she developed and tested theories for community development, civic engagement, group processes, leadership, and democratic deliberation. Following what she called the <italic>principle of unifying</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541344613489351">Follett (1918</xref>, p. 97) posited that the skill of unifying, building common purpose, or integrating multiple ideas was a “secret that would revolutionize the world.” New understandings, in her view, occurred because individuals and environments were constantly creating and recreating one another. Follett argued that relationships and interactions were circular in nature, governed by mutuality and reciprocity, and she promoted active discussion as a tool for unifying diverse ideas. She actually disavowed compromise as a useful strategy for dispute resolution, proposing that opposing ideas be integrated into a third way. She saw discussion as a better tool for looking at multiple and diverse ideas or facts, believing that opposing ideas had the possibility to enrich one’s own view. Follett described the process as “intellectual teamwork” (p. 97). This scholar’s words and work lay dormant for most of 50 years, but today her ideals, theories, and proposed actions easily fit alongside mainstream organizational scholars who promote integrative and collective thinking, particularly the scholars of transformative learning.</p>

<title>Leadership Sensemaking and Virtual Environments</title>
<sec id="section8-1541344613489351">
<title>The Learning Plan</title>
<p>The literature clearly suggests that if adult learners are going to challenge their deepest-held meanings, to attend to retrospective sensemaking in ways that lead to critical reflection, the learning environment needs to support the effort. After observing a demonstration of experiential simulation (<italic>ES</italic>), a virtual learning experience developed by Brunner, Rusch posited that <italic>ES</italic> held untold possibilities for profound learning experiences about leadership. The <italic>ES</italic> process uses blinded identities in an attempt to get beyond the typical classroom “automaton” responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344613489351">Cranton &amp; King, 2003</xref>, p. 31). With the support of a University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) President’s Diversity Initiative grant, Rusch and Brunner began a cross-institutional collaboration with two groups of students enrolled in two different educational leadership doctoral classes. The key question that guided the collaboration was:
<disp-quote>
<p>Could a virtual simulation environment support qualitatively different understandings of power, identity, and collaborative decision-making, particularly as each applied to the development of democratic communities where gender, race, class, and territory are no longer barriers to participation? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344613489351">Dewey, 1907</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Instructional planning and analyses were guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344613489351">Mezirow’s (2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613489351">2000b</xref>) adult learning theories, Johnston and Dainton’s (1987) Interactive Learning Model<sup>©</sup> (ILM), Weick’s (1995) views of sensemaking, and Follett’s (1919) theory of integration. The primary activity involved two individual doctoral classes working on a common problem of practice through the <italic>ES</italic> environment. Based on prior experiences, we speculated that a learning inventory, used in conjunction with the ES process and retrospective sensemaking activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38a-1541344613489351">Weick, 1995</xref>), would help individuals connect their <italic>learning self</italic> to actions that constructed a personal identity, so Rusch’s cohort also completed a learning inventory related to the ILM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613489351">Johnston, 1996</xref>). Our intent was to discover if advance knowledge and understandings of individual approaches to learning would contribute to insights about learner and leader behaviors.</p>
<p>During the 3-week <italic>ES</italic> experience, all students were required to respond to a series of reflective questions and read the transcripts of online chats. When students returned to the face-to-face class, they were instructed to refrain from any discussion until they had responded to 10 open-ended questions about their personal experience in the <italic>ES</italic> space. At the end of the term, students also wrote a reflective essay that documented their learning journey, a form of Weick’s retrospective sensemaking. Our analysis of the data gathered during and after the <italic>ES</italic> experience suggested that a process of retrospective sensemaking, coupled with knowledge about individual learning processes and skills of reflective discourse, supported deeper and, in some cases, transformative insights into beliefs and actions that affect leader behaviors. The following sections detail the <italic>ES</italic> process and the ILM, describe the instructional planning process, and, using our data, offer insights into the student and instructor learning experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1541344613489351">
<title>ESs</title>
<p>
<italic>ES</italic>s is an innovative communications method, developed by Brunner, that unmasks how identity gets in the way of interpersonal understandings, true dialogue, and socially just interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541344613489351">Rusch, 2003</xref>). The <italic>ES</italic> process uses computer visualization capabilities to present individuals to others with a Modified Persona. Standard online course development tools—website, chat room, threaded discussion, video and audio clips—allow course participants (aspiring and active educational leaders), to meet virtually for three 4-hr sessions to collaborate on an assigned problem-based learning, decision-making task (the simulation). Students enter the <italic>ES</italic> environment unaware that their real identities are masked or altered completely. Each participant is assigned a chat number and only that number appears in the chat space. Students are given access to a group photo and although each individual sees his or her own photo above their identifying participant number, that same individual is depicted with another photo to all other class participants. For example, during a faculty <italic>ES</italic> pilot, Rusch saw her own 66-year-old White female photo above #18, but her chat roommates were seeing the photo of a young White male. Prior to the third chat session, the masked photo is revealed to each individual, but they still do not see each other’s masks. Thus, the masked photos and numbers became identity markers for individuals in one’s chat group as the simulation progresses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1541344613489351">
<title>ILM</title>
<p>Leadership preparation classrooms can be a practice field for managing interpersonal and intrapersonal differences, so Rusch posited that knowledge about the learning self would foster a different kind of sensemaking, specifically Weick’s (1995) notion using the self as a text. After a decade of using a learning inventory and the ILM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613489351">Johnston, 1996</xref>), a process grounded in cognitive science, Rusch concluded that when students and the instructor had a common language related to learning, differences became easier to confront, communicative competence increased, and educators reported intentionally different actions in their work settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541344613489351">Rusch, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541344613489351">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541344613489351">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>ILM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613489351">Johnston &amp; Dainton, 1987</xref>) depicts the simultaneous interactions of cognition, conation, and affectation (noted earlier as related to Mezirow’s work on adult learning) through a 28-item <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344613489351">Learning Connections Inventory</xref><sup>©</sup> (LCI) that reveals the strength of four synchronous learning patterns (sequence, precision, technical, confluence). After extensive testing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613489351">Johnston (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613489351">1996</xref>) concluded that the interactions of an individual’s patterns represented how any learner saw the world, internalized or integrated stimuli, and formulated responses. The LCI<sup>©</sup> includes three open-ended questions that triangulate responses to the other 28 forced choice questions. Three ranges of use emerge from the inventory: use first (25–35); use as needed (17–24); and avoid this pattern (7–16). Nationally and internationally validated, the LCI<sup>©</sup> has test–retest reliability, as well as content, construct, and predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613489351">Johnson &amp; Dainton, 1997</xref>). The process has proved to be an effective tool for learning and team building in educational and industrial settings in the United States and abroad because, unlike typical styles inventories, the LCI<sup>©</sup> fosters understanding of how the patterns interact and govern sensemaking actions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541344613489351">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Researchers have demonstrated that this advanced learning system gives people the means to understand who they are as learners so they can articulate that awareness to others in important relationships. In both educational and workplace settings, researchers find (1) heightened awareness of learning orientations in self and others; (2) a change in the assumptions of individuals who learn and teach within a given context; (3) lowering of bias toward those individuals whose learning patterns are different from oneself; and (4) increased awareness of embedded stereotypes of successful and unsuccessful learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613489351">Johnston, 1998</xref>). Equally important, the effectiveness of this advanced learning system is predicated on reflective practice being used <italic>with intention</italic> to increase the conscious understanding of every individual’s unique actions, thoughts, and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344613489351">Brookfield, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613489351">Osterman &amp; Kottkamp, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-1541344613489351">
<title>Preparation</title>
<p>A UNLV President’s Institutional Diversity award supported all the cross-institution activities related to bring the ES technology to Rusch’s educational leadership program. The summer prior to implementation, three of Rusch’s colleagues, from three different programs, participated in a University of Minnesota (UM) summer course that used the virtual environment to solve a problem of practice in the superintendency. Each participant was given a virtual identity and throughout the course none knew the others’ masked identity.</p>
<p>During an onsite visit to debrief the experience, the participating faculty verified that, even when all were aware that identities were altered, interactions during the simulation sessions were governed by the visual images of the people in the discussion group. It was startling to discover that even those of us who teach about human dynamics and coach intrapersonal development, connected visual images from masked photos to individual behaviors of chat mates and we moderated our reaction based on those identities. The other surprising discovery was that individuals from three very different disciplines (law, workforce education, and educational leadership) could successfully participate in a common problem of practice related to the role of a superintendent. The following spring, arrangements were made for Rusch’s UNLV doctoral cohort in Human Dynamics and Organizational Development to partner with Brunner’s doctoral class on Women and Leadership at UM for three class sessions, using a blackboard chat room space to address a common problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1541344613489351">
<title>Coordinating ES Across the Miles</title>
<p>The easiest part of this process was the faculty agreement to collaborate and connect doctoral classes between two campuses that are over 1,000 miles apart. Although UNLV had approved funding for the project, the individuals and departments that needed to implement the grant were stymied by the proposed collaboration. Negotiating transfer of grant funds from one institution to another turned out to be a legal nightmare and negotiating student access to another institution’s blackboard system was a close second! To complicate matters more, each campus had different calendars and start dates for classes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the grant supported multiple opportunities for the cross-campus team to meet for debriefing, negotiating, and planning. At a November 2008 meeting, Rusch and Brunner concluded that their spring 2009 classes, Human Dynamics and Organizational Development and Women and Leadership, would meet in a chat room environment to address the following problem:
<disp-quote>
<p>Within the context of power, privilege, and difference, what does a high stakes accountability system (in any and all fields—for example, politics, business, and education) bring into existence for leaders and organizations? And why is it important or not important to think about this question.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although each group had similar advance readings, timelines, and instructions in preparation for the group problem (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1541344613489351">Appendix</xref>), the groups were decidedly different. Brunner’s class on Women and Leadership enrolled doctoral students from a variety of fields, with most of the students coming from the UM Institute of Public Affairs. Brunner’s class was an elective and most students had not worked together before. In contrast, Rusch’s group was a doctoral cohort that had taken classes together for four terms and the course, Human Dynamics and Organizational Development, was required. The common thread across both courses was a focus on concepts of power, privilege, and difference.</p>
<p>Student preparation for the <italic>ES</italic> process typically is a student photo session that becomes part of the simulation photo bank. Rusch’s <italic>ES</italic> photo session proved to be another challenge; even though the cohort was readily accessible during the fall term, the department’s 3-year-old digital camera did not produce photos that were readable at UM. Multiple conversations across the miles, using unfamiliar terminology with technologically challenged instructors, led to increasing frustration on several fronts. Thanks to crafty technicians in Minnesota, that problem was resolved just as the term began.</p>
<p>The variation in start dates was also a challenge, but one that turned out to offer interesting variations to the <italic>ES</italic> process. The instructors decided that the UM group would enter the chat space during their first three classes, without having met each other in person—the standard approach to previous <italic>ES</italic> activities. UNLV’s term actually began earlier than UM so, based on the cohort structure, Brunner and Rusch decided that UNLV students would proceed with classes as usual and engage in the <italic>ES</italic> process 2 weeks into the class. During that time, UNLV students completed the LCI<sup>©</sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1541344613489351">
<title>Learning About the Learning Self</title>
<p>The 2 weeks of face-to-face contact at UNLV focused on understanding the <italic>learning self</italic> and how individuals’ approaches to learning had operated within the cohort context. The discussions during the first class were centered on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28a-1541344613489351">Quinn’s (2000)</xref> view that organizing is natural and
<disp-quote>
<p> … humans form groups to pursue life’s purposes…. As we interact with each other, we naturally develop norms or patterned ways of being. We develop cultures or sets of shared beliefs that carry the explicit and implicit rules of behavior. People take on roles and a hierarchy emerges. The hierarchy is a natural form that reflects the ways we think. (p. 231)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>After completing the learning inventory, students were asked to describe how their learning processes appeared and influenced the organization of the cohort. Working from a class chart that displayed their LCI scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541344613489351">Table 2</xref>), students easily extracted experiences and events that highlighted learning patterns in actions that others recognized. The yearlong relationship among the 11 cohort members supported increased personal disclosure. For example, the student with the highest sequence (34/35) described that process as a disability, noting that he was compelled to order his life “step by step, week by week.” Several highly confluent individual talked about the ease of change and how much they enjoyed the risk. Information about the nature of each pattern (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541344613489351">Table 1</xref>) led to insights about how patterns with similar strengths interacted and triggered actions or reactions. For example, student #9 with a use-first technical score and use-as-needed precision score was compelled to solve problems but had far less need to gather information about options for solutions. She tended to operate with a <italic>just do it</italic> approach. Essentially [Author’s] students went into the ES setting with a qualitatively different knowledge base about their own and others’ approaches to learning tasks and a very different view about the cultural norms of their cohort.</p>

<p>Prior to the ES experience, the UNLV cohort members were certain they could identify one another, despite the blinded identity, because they had come to know each other so well during the past 2 years. Some noted that the opportunity to be anonymous would be an interesting and welcome experience. “It will be like participating in a mystery,” one student noted.</p>
<sec id="section14-1541344613489351">
<title>A Mystery Unfolds</title>
<p>Just prior to the 3-week <italic>ES</italic> activity, students were given detailed instructions for entering the site, cell phone contacts for tech support, a must-have list of materials needed during the online sessions, and information about the overall schedule structure that would tightly monitored by the lead instructor. The instructions include reminders such as:
<disp-quote>
<p>As a group, you will make decisions about how to proceed in all regards, including what needs to be accomplished before Session 1 is over and WHAT YOU WILL ACCOMPLISH DURING THE FIRST THREE ON-LINE SESSIONS. Remember, that you only have this session and two more to get the task completed. You, as a group (the Task Force) will also decide how to provide evidence that you have completed the Task. Every class member must have a significant part in the presentation. (<italic>ES</italic> preparation materials)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Students were also reminded, both in the written instructions and during online sessions, that they were not to engage in discussions of the online work between sessions. Finally, students were instructed to print off transcripts of each chat session in order to prepare for the next session. They were also directed to post weekly responses to a series of reflective questions on power and identity. Cumulated responses to these questions framed on-site discussions for each class during the remainder of the semester.</p>
<p>This ES simulation was conducted with three mixed Task Force groups of seven to eight students who were asked to respond to the following question:
<disp-quote>
<p>Within the context of power, privilege, and difference, what does a high stakes accountability system (in any and all fields—for example, politics, business, and education) bring into existence for leaders and organizations? And why is it important or not important to think about this question?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As they entered the online site, students had access to a numbered class photo, which they were urged to print in advance. They saw their own photo and name but did not know that others saw a different photo connected to their name. As students began to chat, the number of the participant appeared as the only identifier. Instructors in both states were in the site at all times monitoring the interactions in all three chat rooms. All chat room organizing comments were entered by Brunner but neither instructor added any other comments to the chat sessions. The analysis of the UNLV cohort experience is based on analysis of 12 classroom hours of transcripts, student questionnaire responses, instructor observations of subsequent classes, and the contents of the retrospective reflective essays.</p>

<title>Unpacking a Learning Journey</title>
<p>“Community building in democratic environments is no simple task” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344613489351">Brunner et al., 2003</xref>, p. 4). Personal confrontation with <italic>otherness</italic>, or those human qualities that are different from our own and the outside groups to which we belong, often causes discomfort. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344613489351">Argyris (1993</xref>) points out that humans carefully craft systems of defensive behaviors to protect themselves from issues that seem too complex. The outcomes of the <italic>ES</italic> learning experience certainly verified the discomfort and defensiveness that permeate complex human dynamics, however, student reactions and responses suggest that when individuals have more nuanced insights into their own and others’ learning processes, their retrospective sensemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38a-1541344613489351">Weick, 1995</xref>) is richer and more personally useful. The qualitative review of all collected data and the instructors personal notes led to four themes: (1) a cohort <italic>ES</italic> experience; (2) content connections; (3) diverse learners and <italic>ES</italic>; and (4) leadership and transformative learning lessons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1541344613489351">
<title>Findings From a Cohort <italic>ES</italic> Experience</title>
<p>Rusch, the instructor of the UNLV cohort, is highly confluent (likes change and uniqueness), so she thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Both instructors observed all the chat rooms simultaneously throughout the three sessions and noted that the interactions in the three chat rooms was a study, in and of itself, on how working groups organize (or donot). Transcripts of the discussion were available 24 hr after a chat session, allowing for further content analysis and verification of observations. For example, one group spent all three sessions deeply engaged in intellectual discussions of the readings, of their interviews, and of their viewpoints. Their transcript included references to readings or interview notes that supported viewpoints. They spent minimal time worrying how to organize a presentation and in the end, had the most comprehensive presentation based on their insights about accountability, privilege, and power. A second group spent an inordinate amount of time fussing over the presentation and in fact, tackled that problem first. A third group included one individual who inserted clever, humorous, and distracting remarks so often, that during the last session one member intervened quite boldly. That group had the least useful or interesting presentation and the most members who engaged in only limited ways. Whatever the dynamics, it was amazing to watch three groups of people self-organize, self-direct, and complete a product when they had no contact outside the chat space.</p>
<p>Most of Rusch’s UNLV cohort did not share her enthusiasm for the experience. Only 3 of the 11 students indicated they enjoyed the <italic>ES</italic> process and would choose to participate again. One student observed, “Now I know what it feels like to be on <italic>Survivor</italic> when they arrive in camp.” However, despite the overall discomfort with the self in flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613489351">Follett, 1919</xref>), responses of all 11 students to the written open-ended questions and retrospective reflection included personal insights about their actions or nonactions in the virtual environment. For example, one student stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>The group dynamic was interesting to watch though. I found it interesting that after a couple of sessions students, like me, would let others take the lead. I am sure that I deferred in the chat much more than I normally do in regular group situations. I feel that had the assignment occurred in a regular setting I would have been a much better contributor. (Student 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The notion of <italic>regular setting</italic> appeared in one form or another in response to a question on the difference between the <italic>ES</italic> process and the cohort classroom. To a person, all cohort members were anxious to return to their face-to-face group, albeit, for a variety of reasons. Security was cited by Student 7, who said, “I know when to jump into the discussion as the cohort sits around the table. I was very hesitant to jump into the chat room.” Another pointed out the lack of “personal connections” and called the chat space a “very sterile environment”. A number of individuals, primarily African American and female cohort members, commented on the inability to “see body language.”</p>
<p>No one was concerned about peer reactions as the cohort returned to the classroom; one student observed, “I respond better in a face-to-face setting” (Student 6). In fact, the responses to the question about returning to the classroom setting were expressions of relief. Student 2 observed that “it will be the same as before” and Student 11 made a similar observation, noting, “we have a history together.” Despite that history, students chose not to reveal their numbers to each other, a decision that held throughout the remainder of the term. That decision led to ongoing references to the ES transcripts as students as examples or applications of theoretical constructs.</p>
<p>The comments on the open-ended questions led to extended discussions about <italic>group comfort zones</italic> and the ways in which familiarity can create barriers to growth and change. The need for clear identity markers, such as facial expressions, also led to more in-depth discussions about race, gender, privilege, and power than Rusch had experienced in previous classes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1541344613489351">
<title>The Content</title>
<p>A review of the transcripts revealed that students readily addressed privilege and power related to race and gender in the <italic>ES</italic> environment. During follow-up discussions, many noted how interesting it was to discuss Allan Johnson’s (2005) views on privilege and gender when they were in a blinded identity environment. One minority female noted, “I learned it was OK to make comments that might be earth shattering.” In two of the three groups, discussions of more emotionally charged topics occurred more readily and at a deeper level than is typical in face-to-face discussions. Anecdotally, the <italic>ES</italic> process dramatically enhanced student comfort with and continued engagement in discussions related to power and privilege and the human dynamics in diverse environments. Conversations that were initiated in the <italic>ES</italic> chat space had little of the awkwardness that one sees in a face-to-face classroom, even among cohort members who are very comfortable among each other. When students returned to the classroom, the anonymity of the <italic>ES</italic> discussions, and their decision to maintain that anonymity, allowed persistent references to viewpoints and exchanges and fostered deeper and more critical conversations about complex human dynamics.</p>
<p>The <italic>ES</italic> transcripts served as an ongoing textbook, as the class moved on to discussions of group development theories. During one class session, a discussion of leader actions that construct and perpetuate the privilege, power, and differences at play during group interactions, students wondered if good ideas had been “silenced” by those who so readily offered contributions and critique. The introduction and practice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344613489351">Argyris’ (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344613489351">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344613489351">1993</xref>) ladder of inference not only had greater meaning for students at this point but actual classroom practices among cohort members visibly changed during the rest of the term.</p>

<title>The Learners</title>
<p>Student learning patterns had a visible and rather profound influence on how students engaged in and adapted to the <italic>ES</italic> experience. Additionally, personal knowledge of the pattern combinations served as very different identity markers for most students as they reflected on their degrees and types of engagement in the chat space.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1541344613489351">
<title>Highly Sequential Learners (Low Confluence)</title>
<p>The cohort learning patterns detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541344613489351">Table 2</xref> reveal that Students 1–5 and Student 8 have high degrees of sequence and precision, a pattern combination that prefers order, clear directions, and specific plans. These students also have confluence at a Use as Needed level, meaning ambiguous, creative, and risk-taking situations are less comfortable. All but one of these students had limited engagement in the <italic>ES</italic> process and described the experience as stressful (Student 3). One comment was representative of the entire group. “Everything in that assignment was so jumbled up, and conversations were so random, that I eventually found myself shutting down completely” (Student 1).</p>
<p>Two students in this group contributed extensively, Student 5 and Student 8. Student 5’s high precision, partnered with confluence led the way. The transcript shows her persistent efforts to organize the group and provide some sequence, but she also described her efforts to carefully “read and listen before adding my input to be sure it was an appropriate time to interject.” Precision always wants to be prepared and these learners like to know as much as possible so they will <italic>get it right</italic>; her transcript has multiple entries that say LENGTHY CONTRIBUTION. Student 8, an African American woman, also had a lengthy transcript, most of which focused on comments related to privilege, power, and various diversity issues. A poignant reflection came from Student 1 who wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>While I personally found my reaction unacceptable, it was an enlightening moment for me. I’ve been in situations such as that in the past and I’ve never understood why I was unable to flourish. With the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344613489351">Learning Connections Inventory</xref> fresh on my mind, I was able to gain an understanding as to why I felt my participation in the online assignment was not acceptable. While that didn’t make that particular assignment any better, it made me think about how I can approach similar situations in the future so that I can learn to overcome my “Sequential Disability” in less structured settings. (Student 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This student, like many peers, did not enjoy the ES experience, but by the end of the term was clear that the personal lessons were not only useful but would continue to inform his leader practices.</p>

<title>Highly Confluent Learners (Lower Sequence)</title>
<p>Another interesting pattern emerged among Students 7–11; all of these students have a confluence score in the Use First range, suggesting that a new and less-than-orderly experience would be interesting. One student noted, “It was an interesting experience working with, what are essentially, complete strangers. It was odd and refreshing to have no ability to identify, and thus, prejudge people based on any outward observation” (Student 10). This group of students was the most engaged in chat sessions, often contributed extensive comments, and were more favorable in their comments about the <italic>ES</italic> experience. For example, one student related the experience to
<disp-quote>
<p> … quantum leadership theory. Our first session was fairly disjointed until everyone responded to the same questions, which provided our mental energy to all move in the same direction. We created meaning as we went along. (Student 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Transcripts also show this student exhibiting her high sequence by trying to keep members of the chat space organized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1541344613489351">
<title>High Precision Variations</title>
<p>A strong precision pattern played itself out in the chat space with lengthy entries and detailed references to reading. That was particularly true for Students 4, 7, and 10. One student intentionally tried to manage his or her high precision so the group could flourish, but eventually his need to engage took over. He said,
<disp-quote>
<p>The thing I learned about myself that stood out the most was that I am who I am, even when I know it and try not to be. I purposefully tried to hold back in the second session and let others dominate the conversation. In the end, however, my desire to lead and to guide the conversation could not be held at bay.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The need to appear knowledgeable, to have an identity of a good contributor led to some of these students expressed great frustration with the pace of the chat space. One student described the experience as “totally against my nature” and said “the online experience made me nuts” (Student 7). She described her solution in her retrospective reflection:
<disp-quote>
<p>After the frustration of not feeling comfortable in the situation, I took the time to make notes that could be used as a tool to keep me in the loop. <italic>I was determined to get my ideas across</italic> (emphasis added) to the unknown members of my team.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Student 6, who has much less confluence, had a very different reaction, stating, “I felt that I had much to say, but could not get into the discussion.” He “resisted the urge to give up,” but in the end, contributed a minimum amount to the chat sessions. Yet, this student’s retrospective reflection paper showed one of the deepest understandings of the key concepts from the chat space discussion and some key insights into his leadership behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1541344613489351">
<title>Technical Contributions</title>
<p>One prolific contributor to discussions on power and privilege was Student 9, who connected his own background as an individual who had been academically marginalized most of his life to the discussions on privilege. His retrospective reflection is most revealing of his high technical learning pattern. He wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>During the first online session, I came to the conclusion that I would be a passive participant. I found it to be more interesting to read the dialogue and interactions taking place than actively participating. (Student 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>His frustration with the process was also evidence of a highly technical learner who “wanted to get right to the point and finish.” In his view, “the sessions were filled with too much debate over semantics.”</p>
<p>The data suggest that how individuals process a unique and new learning experience is definitely mediated by their innate approaches to learning. Each of the participants was a dedicated doctoral candidate, determined to get the most out of her or his classroom experiences. Despite the fact that this was a required activity, actual student engagement varied greatly and certainly did not fit student descriptions of quality cohort learning during the previous four terms. Their comments and reflections also supported Rusch’s earlier contention about the impatience of advanced degree students when they are faced with real learning. Few students (3 of the 11) initially saw the ES environment as a useful learning experience, a response that matched earlier research on pedagogical approaches in educational leadership programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541344613489351">Shroth et al., 1999</xref>). Shroth and her colleagues found that activities that engaged students with their peers were the lowest ranked approaches, concluding that students found them “awkward” and probably needed to engage in more peer interactions rather than less. In the case of the ES approach, the key to transformative learning was using the remainder of the term to treat the <italic>awkward</italic> experience as a living textbook to examine concepts of adult learning, transformative learning, learning organizations, and change agentry. For many, use of the personal to understand the conceptual eventually led powerful insights about individual leadership behaviors.</p>

<sec id="section23-1541344613489351">
<title>Leadership Lessons</title>
<p>The class discussion and retrospective reflections revealed how profoundly students were affected by the connection of the learning inventory to the <italic>ES</italic> experience. One of the most thoughtful reflections came from Student 1, who wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>For the duration of my adult life, I have felt as though I was aware of my “quirks” but I’ve tried to ignore them as a way of telling myself that they really weren’t anything. However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344613489351">Learning Connections Inventory</xref> was able to, in my eyes, quantify the way my brain works…. Doing this activity helped me realize that my way of thinking is not only acceptable, it’s perfectly normal. I’m about as high on the sequencing scale as any human being could possibly be, and understanding this learning pattern helped me realize why I excel in certain environments and why I try to hide in others.</p>
<p>I like things to be in order. I like purpose, I like meaning, and I like to know what I’m to be doing at all times. With this in mind, I have an extremely hard time flying by the seat of my pants.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He concluded,
<disp-quote>
<p>Obviously, I can’t expect the entire world to cater to my sequential way of thinking, so I think the most important thing I can take out of this course is the self-realization I’ve come to that I have to learn to adapt to environments that do not fit with my personal style. Although this is easier said than done, being able to do so will greatly enhance both my academic work as well as my professional career. (Student 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The importance of retrospective sensemaking was noted by a student who wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the online sessions, there were a lot of interesting moments and revelations to unpack. I’m not even sure everyone has fully thought through the implications of those sessions… . I thought it was interesting that some groups chose to try or even elect a leader. Despite the poor function of systems we operate in, some of us continue to perpetuate existing problems for lack of attempting an alternative. Thinking about Marris’ work, those with lesser ambivalence lead, others grieve. (Student 10)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another student altered her actions in the classroom for the remainder of the term and noted in her article,
<disp-quote>
<p>This experience taught me to be more vocal. I have been really saying things as I see them. I feel liberated. Previously, I would feel nervous or concerned with what others might think. (Student 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some self-examinations were visibly awkward as students found personal patterns of interacting that did not fit their perceptions of their leader-self. One student openly talked about his reluctance to engage, a very different behavior set from his regular classroom demeanor. He spent the remainder of the term examining his daily actions as an assistant principal, looking for other patterns of avoiding leadership. One classroom discussion led to a breakthrough. The reading and discussion that led to his transformative moment stressed,
<disp-quote>
<p> … challenging all assumptions and questioning why we do what we do. Again, this seemed to emerge as a theme for me throughout the class. In my own practice this spring, I have taken that idea and presented it to my principal. Challenging our assumptions. That is something I have really pushed for with my boss. Is who we say we are, really who we are? (Student 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Retrospective sensemaking was less visible for one group of learners, those with extraordinary high sequence and mid-low range confluence. The final reflective papers for students 1–5 were far more academic, more focused on the content of the <italic>ES</italic> process, and offered few or no insights into the personal experience of the process. Although each discussed personal leadership lesson that the class fostered, none connected any of those insights to the interactions related to the <italic>ES</italic>, either the chat room or class discussions. Anecdotal evidence from other classroom experiences with the learning inventory and reflective activities suggest that this particular learning pattern combination does not support retrospective sensemaking. As one student noted in a personal conversation many years ago, “When something is done, its done; I don’t think about it anymore. I want to get on to the next thing on my list.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1541344613489351">
<title>Retrospective Sensemaking: A Path to Transformative Learning</title>
<p>Mastering classroom practices that foster sensemaking and critical reflection is no simple task. Instructors find multiple strategies to create comfortable, seemingly risk-free classroom spaces but none of these actions guarantee that students will engage in or become skilled at “critically reflect[ing] on … sacred truths” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613489351">Mezirow, 2000b</xref>), or engage in unlearning and relearning experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344613489351">Kreisburg, 1992</xref>). Yet, transformative learning cannot occur without full engagement in each of these experiences.</p>
<p>Graduate-level learners, particularly educators, are a unique lot. The <italic>ES</italic> experience lent some support to the original assertion, that many outstanding adult students are less-than skilled at learning. They have mastered the standard processes and practices of schooling and, in fact, learned how to engage without really engaging (often referred to as <italic>jumping through hoops</italic>). Observations of the <italic>ES</italic> interactions suggested that the <italic>good student</italic> identity, so carefully crafted in face-to-face classrooms with familiar cohort members, limited engagement for most students during the three chat sessions and led to negative reactions to the whole experience. For some students, the conscious decision to not appear as a full participant was quite distressing and led to far deeper examinations of personal motivations to be a fully engaged learner.</p>
<p>The strength of this ES process is that retrospective sensemaking was a vital component of the activity. The anonymity in the virtual environment led to unexpected kinds of engagement and unique observations about human dynamics. Using the experience as a personal “textbook” to explore biases and the perceptions of <italic>other</italic> became powerful experience that fostered a very personal pathway to theories and processes of leadership many students had only processed in a surface fashion up to this point. This learning experience offered clear evidence that when individuals engage in experiential learning that disrupts a carefully crafted student identity and that experience is supported by enhanced knowledge of the learning self, facilitated reflection can lead to a marked shift in both learner and leader identity. In many cases, that shift or transformation in perspective led to intentional modification of leadership actions. In some cases, the compilation of experiences supported an individual’s efforts to bring more congruence between particular values and subsequent leadership actions. In a few cases, the transformation of self led to efforts to transform the system in which he or she worked. Overall, the ES simulation and the follow-up retrospective sensemaking brought crystal clarity to the importance of human dynamics in the development of more democratic communities.</p>
<p>Leaders of democratic communities must have advanced communicative competence. Because communicative competence is centered on the knower, it requires an individual to step back and fully examine the <italic>how</italic> of one’s knowing, to bring an authentic self to the classroom—to let go of a set of well-practiced <italic>good student</italic> behaviors and risk personal discomfort. The <italic>ES</italic> process triggered reactions that did lead to epiphanies, opening doors for more profound sensemaking about the nature of human dynamics. In this case, the element that took the conversation and individual perceptions to useful and transformational knowledge was the addition of the Learning Combinations Inventory.</p>
<p>The benefit of knowing one’s <italic>learner self</italic>, supported by the learning inventory information, is that it is not a bounded activity that anticipates deep understanding on an assignment timeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613489351">Boud &amp; Walker, 1998</xref>). The knowledge of learning processes in action unfolded overtime and became visible in unpredictable and very teachable moments. The knowledge of personal and peer learning patterns gave students a common language to critique the experience and their own behaviors in ways that led to deeper metacognition and personal sensemaking—the basic elements of transformative learning. Students leave the class knowing that their learning patterns and approaches will not change; however, they also have a sense of how to <italic>sense</italic> the responses of self and others in ways that allow intentional mediating of their leadership actions. According to Schein, “unless leaders become learners themselves—unless they can acknowledge vulnerabilities and uncertainties-then transformational learning will never take place” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344613489351">Cuoto, 2002</xref>, p. 6). The evidence so far suggests that transformational learning is feasible as long as learners have quality self-knowledge that supports quality sensemaking about the connections between theoretical concepts and daily practice.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<p>With identities masked in various ways, students have the opportunity to discover how their own and others’ identities affect decision-making processes and other leadership practices. Because leaders have very few opportunities to <italic>see themselves as others see them</italic>, they can make mistakes that are invisible to them. The <italic>Experiential Simulation</italic> process, therefore, is not only rare experiences but also an important one. Self-discoveries are evoked by responding to questions at the close of and between each chat session, you will have the opportunity for self-discoveries.</p>
<p>In order to provide the strongest learning experience, <italic>all participants MUST work hard to keep their identities hidden from others</italic>. Keeping identity hidden means that gender race, ethnicity, economic class, professional position, information about family, personal life, experience of all types, personal history, and anything else about the self must be kept out of the chat room.
