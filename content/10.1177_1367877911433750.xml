<abstract>
<p>This article stems from a project examining cultural assets in Wollongong – a medium-sized Australian city with a decentralized <italic>and</italic> linear suburban pattern that challenges orthodox binaries of inner-city bohemia/outer-suburban domesticity. In Wollongong we documented community perceptions of cultural assets across this unusual setting, through a simple public research method. At the city’s largest annual festival we recruited the general public to nominate the city’s most ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places, by drawing on a map of Wollongong and telling their stories. Hand-drawn maps from 205 participants were combined in a Geographical Information System and 50 hours of stories transcribed for qualitative analysis. Over 2300 places were identified. Among them were some surprising results: although places known for the arts and bohemian creative industries figured prominently, these were not only in the inner-city but in beachside suburbs with unique cultural histories. Also, a range of affective engagements with place, including unconventional forms of creativity, were described in industrial and blue-collar suburbs. Network topology analysis by place of residence also revealed the extent of localism, as well as specializations and aggrandizements among suburbs. Our conclusions are threefold: first, that ‘creativity’ is relationally situated and linked across all parts of the city; second, that decentralized forms of small-scale cultural infrastructure provision are vital for vernacular cultural pursuits; and, third, that ‘creativity’ is a polysemic and contested category – only ever partially revealing the contours of cultural vitality in the suburbs.</p>

<p>This article explores how ordinary people across a medium-sized, regional city – Wollongong, Australia – feel about the place in which they live, and what this means for cultural planning. It does so in an unusual geographical context where concentric ring models of urban density do not neatly apply.</p>
<p>It is also a time when the practice of cultural planning is growing, professionalizing and diversifying. Ideas about creativity have been highly influential. It has been a decade since the ‘discovery’ of creativity by urban planners, and yet the manner in which creativity has infused actual planning practice remains haphazard. Despite the slew of subsequent research seeking to unlock the secrets of creativity – from economic geography, sociology, media-communications and cultural studies – the concept still appears as opaque and polysemic as ever. Another problem is the neoliberalism (i.e. orienting to the capitalist market; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877911433750">Peck, 2005</xref>) underlying much creative cities planning: an ideology (usually unstated or unconscious) favouring a key list of creative <italic>industries</italic>. The focus is on the private sector, on firms and entrepreneurs, on transforming traditional arts into business and on the so-called ‘creative class’ who inhabit such worlds, rather than on people as individual creators, as city residents or citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911433750">Ettlinger, 2010</xref>). Fringe groups, amateurs, community non-profit collectives and unusual forms of creativity are often missing from analysis and from creative city visions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911433750">Mayes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Neoliberalization of creative industries thinking also produces a fundamentally geographical problem, for the industries most commonly chosen for analysis – film, music, digital media – often organically locate in inner city parts of major cities or high-tech corridors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877911433750">Searle and Pritchard, 2005</xref>), where critical mass, local labour markets, audience size and proximity to paying clients ensure viability. Much theorizing about the creative industries has thus emphasized clusters and the creative milieu (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877911433750">Reimer et al., 2008</xref>), reflecting a focus on prominent districts or industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877911433750">Gibson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877911433750">Martin and Sunley, 2003</xref>). Cluster-type theories are regularly confirmed in these instances and, unconsciously, the circle closes around circumscribed notions of ‘creativity’ as commercial innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911433750">O’Connor, 2009</xref>) and around the inner city/creativity nexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911433750">Brennan-Horley and Gibson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of increased cultural planning, what then is to be made of creativity outside the gentrified inner city? A growing body of work has sought to explore creativity in suburbs, working-class districts, country towns and remote areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911433750">Felton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877911433750">Gibson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877911433750">Jayne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877911433750">Jayne et al., 2011</xref>). These are places where creative industries might seem insignificant in census counts, but where creativity is often present in quirky or vernacular forms, and can indeed prove significant for cultural planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877911433750">Johnson, 2006</xref>). New work has focused on remote areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911433750">Andersen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911433750">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>); marginalized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877911433750">Warren and Evitt, 2010</xref>); women’s ‘crafts’ (as distinct from high-status ‘arts’ activity – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911433750">Mayes, 2010</xref>); and what constitutes ‘creativity’ in the context of class relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911433750">O’Connor, 2009</xref>). We acknowledge such work here, recognizing that much of our story could be analysed similarly. Our particular focus, however, is on elaborating the complexity of the <italic>geography</italic> of creativity in the city.</p>
<p>Socially constructed geographical discourses – of proximity, remoteness, smallness – filter how creativity is understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433750">Bell and Jayne, 2009</xref>). The popular urban planning rhetoric of creativity – emanating from big cities – has led some cultural planners in smaller and suburban places to glorify metropolitan, inner city variants on creativity, eschewing the local people’s talents and potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877911433750">Waitt and Gibson, 2009</xref>). In places with no obvious film or digital media industry, with no concentrated cultural milieu or main street café culture, a problematic assumption can be made that creativity is an external quality, with efforts necessary to attract the creative industries or creative class <italic>to</italic> these places. This in turn glamorizes outside ‘creatives’ who must be imported for their creativity and vitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911433750">Barnes et al., 2006</xref>). In other cases, creative city rhetoric is rejected altogether as metropolitan thinking inappropriate for local circumstances. Both of these positions fly in the face of empirical observation of vernacular creativity in such places, and clash with grass-roots ideological influences also currently shaping cultural planning practice, such as community cultural development (which seeks a more inclusive, democratic approach to local diversity and endogenous cultural vitality – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911433750">Askew and Mee, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911433750">Milbourne, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Cultural asset mapping – an alternative approach</title>
<p>The project discussed in this article – Cultural Asset Mapping for Regional Australia (hereafter ‘The CAMRA project’) – builds on these critiques, and seeks to document local voices on what matters for cultural planning, especially in regional Australia where creativity is either overlooked or, worse, assumed to be absent. We do not automatically cast aside creativity as a concern, but instead wish to approach creativity as one potential cultural planning need among others.</p>
<p>No presumptions are made about what creativity might be, where it resides, or its importance to cultural planning practice. Instead, the CAMRA project prioritizes experimenting with methods within research partnerships. It brings together researchers across four universities, peak arts organizations and six local councils, with the aim of developing a new mode of research to support cultural planning. A strong influence is the growing field of community-engaged research for arts and cultural planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911433750">Bromberg, 2009</xref>), which emphasizes process and outcomes – the politics of knowledge production being equally significant to the knowledge created.</p>
<p>Key to the CAMRA project is <italic>cultural asset mapping</italic> – a phrase from action research where negotiating the politics of knowledge-generation and delivering tangible ‘data’ are goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877911433750">Underhill-Sem and Lewis, 2008</xref>). For us, cultural asset mapping can embrace diverse activities and perspectives without prescribing fixed methods. In each of six case study localities, methodologies to document cultural assets emerge from within the project’s place-bound partnerships. People involved in the collaborations interact through the project’s website, which we describe as ‘facebook for cultural planners’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877911433750">1</xref></sup> Through it we produce regular reports, write blogs and foster online policy discussions.</p>
<p>We report here on just one partnership within the CAMRA project – in Wollongong, NSW. Wollongong is a medium-sized Australian city with a population of 200,000, an hour from Sydney, dominated historically by coal and steel. It is predominantly working-class, lower socio-economic status (although pockets of wealth exist), with high levels of multicultural diversity. Its decentralized <italic>and</italic> linear suburban pattern – stretched thinly along 60 km of coastline – challenges binaries of inner city bohemia/outer suburban domesticity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911433750">Gibson and Brennan-Horley, 2006</xref>). In total there are 75 suburbs in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877911433750">2</xref></sup> To the north is a string of ex-coal mining villages hemmed in between beaches and dramatic escarpment; near the city centre and university are medium-density suburbs, and to the south are the steelworks and low-density post-war suburbs. There is a roughly north–south socio-economic divide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367877911433750" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Over the course of a year, research plans were negotiated between university researchers and cultural planners at Wollongong City Council. It was agreed that the research method needed to be, first and foremost, a public one – with profile, simplicity and accessibility. Collaborating cultural planners wanted a method sensitive to community needs but that delivered ‘hard data’.</p>
<p>We proposed a public research exercise recruiting people for short ‘mapping interviews’, seeking opinions about Wollongong, while they drew on a paper map of the city. Such methods, already trialled in Darwin, NT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911433750">Brennan-Horley and Gibson, 2009</xref>), combine the strengths of ethnographic methods with the flexibility of geographic information technologies. Recorded interviews capture qualitatively rich data, while hard-copy, paper maps generate quantifiable data. Later digitization and analysis of those maps revealed underlying spatial patterns, while interview narratives explored diversity. As feminist geographers have argued, when used in this way maps act as research output and as research medium – empowering research participants as active subjects, communicating results to diverse audiences and allowing documentation of vernacular voices, via the map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877911433750">Kwan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877911433750">Pavlovskaya and St Martin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The mapping interview research exercise was conducted at Wollongong’s largest annual festival, the Viva La Gong Festival, in November 2009. This enabled a point of contact for the general public with minimal disruption (passers-by could simply pause, answer some questions and draw on a map, as part of their ramble through the festival). In advance, glossy postcards were distributed to advertise the exercise, and one university researcher promoted the research in local media interviews.</p>
<p>Critical decisions were made about questions to ask research participants – for recorded narratives, and for the mapping component. The key was ensuring symmetry between qualitative questions asked and instructions to draw on maps. People would not hang about our festival stall for long, and so a detailed interview was not feasible.</p>
<p>We needed simple, catchy questions and a novelty ‘hook’ (in this case, the mapping element). The angle taken was to ask the general public two short, simple questions: Where is ‘cool’ Wollongong? Where is ‘creative’ Wollongong? The hope was that these two questions, framed in a ‘pop culture’ format, were enough to elicit rich narratives about place, combined with a mapping methodology. We recognized that both words – ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ – were loaded with cultural meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877911433750">Skelton and Valentine, 1998</xref>) and neither could generate data perfectly. There was also the danger of becoming ‘cool hunters’, as with other increasingly sophisticated uses of mapping for the advertising industry (see for example, Ray-Ban sunglasses’ ‘Rare Places’ campaign).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877911433750">3</xref></sup> Against these risks, ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ were terms with promise to engage participants and open up discussion quickly.</p>
<p>Passers-by were invited to record a ‘vox-pop’ interview about what and where they thought ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ Wollongong was, and asked to draw on a hard-copy paper map.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877911433750">4</xref></sup> No pre-determined ideas of what constituted ‘cool’ or ‘creative’ were assumed (indeed, participants were encouraged to think laterally, to list literally anything they considered to be ‘cool’ or ‘creative’), and participants were free to answer as briefly or as comprehensively as they wished. At the end of each recorded interview, participants were asked to record their age, gender and place of residence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367877911433750">
<title>A profile of research participants</title>
<p>A total of 160 map interviews were completed at the festival (representing the views of 205 people – many single maps were drawn by two people combining their responses). There were 2355 drawings of ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places on these maps – an average of 14 per map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367877911433750">Figure 1</xref>). Recorded interviews accompanying the maps varied in length from 3 to 45 minutes; in total over 50 hours of interviews were recorded, equating to 107,000 words of transcribed narrative material. Participants were from diverse demographic backgrounds, including whole families, retirees, students, farmers, motorcycle bikie gang members, Buddhist monks (Wollongong happens to be a major centre of Buddhism, featuring Australia’s largest temple), steelworkers and well-known figures in the regional Aboriginal community. The average age of participants was 41, the youngest 8, the oldest 80. The geographical distribution of participants was uneven across the city, but broadly reflected patterns of population density. More women (62%) participated than men (38%). Frequently participants mentioned that they had seen recent television media coverage of the exercise and were keen to ‘draw on a map and have their say’. Many found the process of mapping challenging – taking considerable time to begin drawing. But judging by comments at the end of interviews, participants also found it fun – evidence perhaps of a new enthusiasm for the spatial resulting from the infiltration of maps into popular culture and everyday locative media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877911433750">Sanders, 2008</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>After the festival, interview audio files were transcribed and coded by theme, suburb of respondent, and suburb of identified ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places. Drawn maps were scanned and digitized in ArcGIS and combined for analysis. Three GIS methods were used: choropleth mapping by suburb for total counts; 3D visualization using rasterized pixel counts; and network topology analysis based on a suburb-to-suburb matrix (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911433750">Brennan-Horley, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911433750">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911433750">2010c</xref>). The first two of these methods assisted in visualizing which ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places were drawn (with each scribble on a map becoming a polygon or ‘map contour’ that was layered with others to create a combined map); the latter method enabled analysis of <italic>flows</italic> of linkages between suburbs: that is, where a participant from suburb x identified somewhere in suburb y as ‘cool’ or ‘creative’. Acknowledging that our dataset is much deeper than can be comprehensively analysed in one article, we focus our exploration of results here on two broad themes, which we weave together below: (1) the geography of participants’ views about ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places in the city; and (2) diversity and contradictions in how participants discussed ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places. These results show how creativity has a suburban as well as city centre geography (with implications for cultural infrastructure provision), but also how neoliberal policies promoting ‘creativity’ barely capture what is possible through cultural planning. Through our alternative method – map interviews – we captured vernacular, prosaic and suburban creative practices, but also reveal some deeper contradictions and confusions surrounding ‘creativity’ itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367877911433750">
<title>City centre and the suburbs: conventional versus vernacular creativity</title>
<p>Overall, the resulting spatial pattern is contradictory: it both reinforces a city-centric geography – Wollongong and nearby North Wollongong were the two most commonly identified locations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367877911433750">Table 1</xref>) – <italic>and</italic> reveals a scattered and diverse suburban geography. Viewing both ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ responses as 3D maps emphasizes central city locations repeatedly identified by participants – they appear as the highest ‘peaks’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367877911433750">Figure 2</xref>. But ‘peaks’ occurred outside the city centre, such as ‘arty’ Thirroul, the largest northern beachside ‘village’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367877911433750">5</xref></sup> Mount Kembla and Stanwell Tops were also highly identified places beyond the city centre – both scenic topographical peaks in the Illawarra escarpment, as well as peaks on our ‘cool Wollongong’ 3D map.</p>

<p>Notably, only 18 percent of all responses were for Wollongong city centre or North Wollongong – the remaining 82 percent of ‘cool’ or ‘creative’ places were outside the city centre (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367877911433750">Table 1</xref>). Among the top ten ‘cool’ or ‘creative’ places were older, established middle-class localities (Gwynneville), working-class industrial suburbs (Port Kembla, Fairy Meadow) and tiny beachside villages to Wollongong’s extreme north (Wombarra, Coledale). These top ten suburbs accounted for 55 percent of all responses. The remaining 45 percent (over 1000 in total) were scattered across 65 other suburbs in the region. Beyond an obvious concentration in the city centre is another, substantial, and decidedly <italic>suburban</italic> geography, with its own peaks, troughs and plateaus.</p>
<p>Topological analysis of participants’ suburb of residence versus their identification of ‘cool’ and ‘creative’ places<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367877911433750">6</xref></sup> revealed that all parts of Wollongong, as well as other proximate towns, are linked functionally through the cultural life of the city. This is not a micro-geography of inner-city milieu; neither is it a story valorizing suburban creativity as somehow distinct. Rather, it reveals how cultural activities and the contours of people’s everyday affective relations to place are networked across city spaces, from central arts precincts to public housing estates, into hinterlands and leafy suburbs, beaches and national parks.</p>
<p>Some responses to the ‘creative’ question were predictable – citing established cultural infrastructure such as the municipal art gallery, performing arts complex, community theatres and festivals – all of which are located in the city centre. It was no surprise, then, that in our network topology, in-flows to Wollongong City Centre formed a ‘perfect’ radial pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367877911433750">7</xref></sup> With its concentration of well-known and easy-to-identify facilities – and with transport networks converging there – Wollongong city centre acts as ‘central place’ for the region’s creative industries, at the top of the urban hierarchy.</p>
<p>Further diversity was revealed when focusing on specific sites mentioned, and patterns of responses to questions about ‘cool’ versus ‘creative’ places. There were numerous examples of vernacular, amateur, unusual and everyday, unheralded creativity: buskers, choir groups, writers’ clubs, community gardens, markets, fire-twirling, bellydancing, linedancing, bluegrass nights, the local hardware megastore (a parallel to our Darwin research – where it too showed up as a creative place, specifically its paint aisle, a well-frequented place among visual artists), full moon parties, sculpture gardens, garage bands, scrapbooking, graffiti-art (especially unsanctioned graffiti), the Nan Tien Buddhist temple, bike tracks, art shops and even a Doll Club.</p>
<p>Ever-present for both ‘creative’ and ‘cool’ responses were a range of landscape features – beaches, headlands, escarpment, mountains, scenic lookouts – that served as spaces of everyday engagement with nature, or for artistic inspiration. For a 50-year-old female:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I really like the liminal stuff, the mountains and the sea. [Draws on map …] Along this escarpment it’s got some lookouts and some parts of [it] that give access to walks. So you can kind of stand on the lip of it. It’s like you’ve got the rest of Australia behind you and here you are on the lip looking out on the coast and the ocean. It’s that in-between quality there. I see that then manifested in so many different other areas, the whole cross-cultural thing, the life and death of the steelworks, all of that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sites of informal, prosaic creativity were documented and described by participants in response to the ‘creativity’ question (beachcombing for refuse used in garden sculptures, for instance); but, curiously, some participants only cited examples of vernacular creativity in answer to the ‘cool’ places question, where they talked more freely and confidently:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The community garden at North Wollongong’s pretty cool … actually it’s creative. I guess it’s something out of the ordinary, a creative idea. They do create things using interesting materials. They don’t have a lot of funding or anything. They have to be creative and use recycled stuff that they go and find or source for free … wood and whatever, for garden furniture. (Female, 29)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There were contradictions and confusions in responses to the ‘creativity’ question. Self-deflation was common (‘Creative Wollongong? I don’t know – I’m not really the person to ask about that’), and only after prompting did some cite predictable examples of city galleries and theatres. For others, confusion over what was creativity spurred free association:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Where is a creative place in Wollongong?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>R:</speaker>
<p>Umm, I think that equates to, it’s more about beach culture. When I think of creativity I don’t think of art works or things like that. Umm, I don’t know, you really stumped me. That was the first thing I thought of when I thought of creativity, I don’t know why. (Female, 26)</p>
</speech>
<p>Others were cranky with the concept of creativity, for its implicit elitism:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>We’re asking people where they think the creative places are in Wollongong, where’s Wollongong’s creative place?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>R:</speaker>
<p>What a dreadful question. How elitist are you? I worked in Cringila for years – and I’ll tell you what, when it came to creating the home grog and the vegetable gardens, even though it was grown in soils full of lead, it was extremely creative, right? Wherever there’s human endeavour there’s creativity. It’s the knitting and the gardening… at the moment I think creativity is the people who are building street gardens like the one in Port Kembla, that’s very creative… There’s people who sing who never get on stage but who still sing to their children and sing in their neighbourhoods… I mean even that poor bastard copper over there, you‘ve got to give it to him; in some aspect of his life he’s probably very creative… everyone is in some way. (Female, 54)</p>
</speech>
<p>While many forms of creativity in everyday lived experience were captured by our map interview exercise, so too were critical voices questioning the very utility of ‘creativity’ as an analytical category.</p>

<title>Contestation: class, identity and local pride</title>
<p>Insightful responses came from participants from downtrodden or plain low-density industrial suburbs, with large public housing estates – that were nonetheless described as ‘cultural’, the focus of a number of non-profit community groups and programs. For one 60-year-old woman:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I like Warrawong because it is very much cultural, I go to Cringila for Illawarra Woman’s Multicultural Common Group, I go to Ribbonwood Centre at Dapto for scrapbooking and book club. Even though I’m retired I’m very busy here. Cringila, there’s a lot of talent in those multicultural women … we meet weekly for singing in the various languages and storytelling, we also have links with the Indigenous community and with Port Kembla school in storytelling. That’s a very good creative outlet, it’s grassroots, we all create the performances.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For a 27-year-old female: ‘I will say Port Kembla … the Steel Works. I used to study art and I drew the Steel Works once. If you look at from an artist’s perspective, you see it differently.’ Nearby Cringila, also downtrodden, was creative for a 43-year-old female, although:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a lot of it you don’t see. You see bits that are put out on the streets, but it’s hidden.… There’s Red Point Artists that are doing some really good stuff with the locals and the migrants. Trying to capture their art and craft before it’s lost.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Infusing responses were cultural biases, from classism (<italic>I</italic>: Why do you say Austinmer Beach is one of the coolest places in Wollongong? <italic>R</italic>: Because it’s like high class, like Bondi Beach, the deros don’t go there’ (Female, 21)); to inferiority complexes (‘if you go out of Wollongong, it’s still perceived outside as being a dirty steel town’ (Male, 62)); and city-centric attitudes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>when you look at the map and look out, there’s a lot of suburbia out there. I’d be surprised if anybody said that Balgownie is cool, or you know Cordeaux Heights, only because they’re suburbs with houses. You gotta be where the action is and downtown Wollongong is where that is. (Male 30 and female 28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Topological analysis also revealed the extent of localism in suburban cultural identifications. On the whole, participants were more likely to identify their own suburb as ‘cool’ than ‘creative’, except for those living in the ‘creative’ hotspots of Wollongong, North Wollongong, Thirroul and Austinmer – who voted for their own suburbs as creative. Creativity was for many an abstract activity, associated with established cultural infrastructure in the city centre; whereas ‘cool’ places were closer to home. Local pride in place found expression in leafy suburbs such as Figtree (where all 11 people who identified it as ‘cool’ lived within 3 km – no-one else in the entire city identified it as ‘cool’ or ‘creative’); and especially on Wollongong’s south side,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1367877911433750">8</xref></sup> where there was a strong patchwork of links, particularly in response to the ‘cool’ question (‘I’m gonna have to say Unanderra ’cause that’s where I live. It’s just a great place’). This was a story of local pride in otherwise prosaic suburbs – a mundane but consistent counterpoint to discourses of creative cities as ‘exceptional’ places.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367877911433750">
<title>Specializations and aggrandizements</title>
<p>There was also evidence of specialization in the city – some suburbs were iconic ‘cool’ places at a regional scale, more so than they were ‘creative’ places, and vice versa. North Wollongong – with a historic pub popular with young people, a scenic beach, student sharehouse scene, cafes and nightlife – was a regional-scale ‘cool’ place, drawing people from across the entire city. That pattern was not nearly so clear for its ‘creative’ topology. Bulli, further north, had a network topology featuring a city-wide spread of creative rather than cool identifications, with the Heritage Hotel (a historic pub now known as the region’s ‘quality’ alternative live music venue), the Illawarra Folk Festival (one of Australia’s largest), and the Sandon Point tent embassy – a focus of green/Aboriginal/left-wing/anti-development political struggle for well over a decade.</p>
<p>An almost perverse contrast was that of Port Kembla, adjacent to the city’s main steelworks, which has fallen into disrepair since the 1980s, following cutbacks at the steelworks over several decades, migration of working-class communities to new estates, and decentralization of retail to large undercover malls on the city edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911433750">Barnes et al., 2006</xref>). Shops in Port Kembla’s Edwardian-era main street were abandoned and the area harboured unregulated street sex work, and had a reputation for madness, addiction, homelessness and dirt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911433750">Barnes et al., 2006</xref>). There have been numerous attempts at revitalization through place-making, public art and community schemes. In our research, Port Kembla showed up regularly as ‘cool’ and ‘creative’, but with a very peculiar network topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1367877911433750">Figure 3</xref>). No-one rating Port Kembla as ‘creative’ lived there, and only two people (out of 20) lived within adjacent suburbs. The remaining 90 percent rating Port Kembla as creative lived to the (more affluent) north, especially from those suburbs – Wollongong, North Wollongong, Thirroul and Austinmer – that were rated the ‘most creative’ overall. No-one from the working-class south side rated Port Kembla as ‘creative’ or ‘cool’. Interview narratives provided an explanation: after attempts to reinvent it as a cultural hub, Port Kembla’s ‘creativity-led transition fantasy’ (to paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877911433750">Lovering, 1995</xref>) has permeated into some people’s consciousness – but only, apparently, those who live in the more ‘arty’ parts of Wollongong. For a 29-year-old female from the northern beachside village of Coledale:</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know there’s a push to make it more of a arty kind of place; it’s my opinion that the council should encourage everybody to rent out their all those derelict shops for $20 a week for art studios, and make it into an arts community. There’s about six shops in Port Kembla that are actually open. It looks like crap. Surely it’s better for everybody to encourage it to become an arts community. I know some people have already thought of that … if you’re an artist you can hire a studio space that you can sell out of for very little money. I think there’s plenty of people that would take that opportunity because when you’re an artist, having somewhere to create your work is a challenge. (Female, 29)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ironically, the network topology of inflows to Thirroul – that most bohemian of northern beaches – was almost entirely sourced from Wollongong’s south side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1367877911433750">Figure 3</xref>). Just as arty, affluent northerners fantasize Port Kembla as site of creative renaissance, those from the working-class south aggrandize the northern beaches as idyllic creative villages. Creativity both amplifies and transgresses long-held geographical imaginations of the polarized city.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is much to learn about creativity and cultural vitality in the suburbs by talking to those who live there. In this project, we sought to achieve this on a city-wide scale through a simple, accessible and fun public research exercise. We may well have missed out on complex stories – of gender and social exclusion, for instance – but insights were forthcoming on the geography and complexity of affective links to place across the city. Relaxing tight definitions of ‘creativity’ and ‘creative industries’ catalysed a chaotic jumble of responses. But from this stemmed opportunities to rethink how observed patterns, diversity, confusion and contradictions might inform cultural planning practice.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with recent relational thinking in human geography that questions the taken-for-granted ontology of scales (city, suburb, region, nation) and instead emphasizes networks, affect and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911433750">Amin and Thrift, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877911433750">Massey, 2005</xref>). People move through and develop affective connections to place in complex ways, in their neighbourhoods and further afield. Theories of creative cities and industries that emphasize cultural milieu or cluster effects only capture one possible form of affective urbanity. One cultural planning implication is to look beyond the inner city professional creative sector for stories people tell about <italic>their</italic> creative places. A qualitative approach centred on people’s narratives of place reveals the multiple voices of citizens jostling in cultural planning, and integration of GIS methods adds a <italic>quantitative</italic> dimension to this – producing maps as communication tools that make ‘hard data’ out of vernacular perspectives.</p>
<p>At another level are opportunities for dialogue with cultural planners about the spatial distribution of cultural infrastructure. Integration of conventional ethnographic methods and spatial information technologies revealed some of the layered geographies of cultural vitality in the city, suggesting a mix of central-city and suburban affiliations, specialization of some suburbs at the city-region scale, and local pride in place – even in suburbs apparently bland to outsiders. Previous approaches to cultural infrastructure provision – informed by successive civic arts and creative industries discourses – have centralized investment in flagship regional arts institutions or industry incubation schemes. There is also evidence here that decentralized, small-scale cultural infrastructure – community halls, writers’ centres, youth music studios, art spaces – are highly valued and perform an important function in encouraging vitality and creativity. In an era of heightened governmental accountability and competition for scarce resources, our findings suggest that unheralded and prosaic sites of suburban creativity deserve better and more sustained financial support.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are insights about the performative power – and limitations – of ‘creativity’ and ‘culture’ as categories, especially when considering how all this might feed into practical cultural planning options for local government. Many participants struggled with what was meant by ‘creativity’, either deflating their own capacity to answer the question, or shunning creativity as antithesis to working-class identity. Others kept creativity ‘at arm’s length’: readily identifying conventional cultural infrastructure, although never having been there themselves. Amidst confusion over what constituted creativity were possibilities for alternative understandings. Asking people about ‘cool’ places added to this diversity. We would argue that researchers interested in culture and creativity – especially in places like the suburbs that have tended to be overlooked in much private sector-oriented, city-centric research – would do well to relax the categories used in research, experimenting with new methods where appropriate, in the context of community-partnered research.</p>
