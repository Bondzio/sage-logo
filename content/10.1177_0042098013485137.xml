<p><italic>Starring New York</italic> surveys a series of films made in the 1970s, presenting a refracted intertextual view of the cultural and economic history of the city in a period of profound crisis and change. Drawing on key spatial thinkers, Stanley Corkin shows how the representational messages of these films situated viewers, first, in a “broader tale of anti-urbanism”, then later, within “a broad process of gentrification that would include both the city’s physical space and its residents” (pp. 8–9).</p>
<p>The proliferation of films utilising New York City as both location and motif in the 1970s, was connected to cultural and economic factors such as the decentralisation of the Hollywood ‘dream factory’, a more relaxed rating system introduced in 1968 and technological developments such as lighter cameras and faster film stock. The demand for greater ‘realism’ expressed in the liberal 1960s found multiple locations in the urban textures of New York and, as the soundstage was gradually superseded, “the city opened up as one large location” (p. 6).</p>
<p>As Corkin notes in his eminently material account, the support of films which frequently portrayed the city in a negative, even dangerous, light may seem disingenuous in hindsight, but in an era of overproduction and fiscal crisis, film production provided a ‘clean’ industry for a city increasingly bereft of productive employment: “As job loss continued apace in the late 1960s and 1970s, and population declined, New York City increasingly took on the role of film set” (p. 7).</p>
<p>A ‘discourse of decline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098013485137">Beauregard, 2002</xref>) has long been central to the revaluation of land and property. Urban disinvestment, abandonment and the planned shrinkage and decline of social services in New York were soon matched by gentrification and subsidies to the affluent as New York became a laboratory for neoliberal urbanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098013485137">Harvey, 2007</xref>, pp. 44–48). Corkin here examines how the decade-long shift from a “nadir of disinvestment and deindustrialization”, culminating in the city’s default on bond payments in 1975, to “a city of gentrified spaces and yuppies” (p. 11), was both anticipated and framed by cinematic representation.</p>
<p>The overall discussion is indebted to Edward Dimendberg’s <italic>Film Noir and The Spaces of Modernity</italic> (2004) and Dimendberg’s reworking of Henri Lefebvre’s conceptions of centripetal and centrifugal space—tendencies of concentration and dispersal respectively (p. 9). These terms are deployed by Corkin in an analysis of the spatial representation of New York as an emergent ‘glocal’ city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098013485137">Brenner, 1998</xref>), as a key economic nexus in an era of accelerated globalisation and a reterritorialising project seeking competitive local advantage in the global economy.</p>
<p>Through an analysis of <italic>Midnight Cowboy</italic> (1969) and <italic>Klute</italic> (1971), the second chapter considers the territorial stigmatisation of New York as a place of limited employment opportunities, urban decline and moral decay (pp. 22–23). Corkin argues that popular representations of moral decadence transposed the social impact of New York’s drastically declining manufacturing base onto the individual. <italic>Midnight Cowboy</italic>’s vision of Times Square as a site of hustling and urban decadence refracts the replacement of unprofitable manufacturing concerns with an expanded pornographic empire, while <italic>Klute’s</italic> individualised representation of prostitution obfuscates the extent of a sex trade that burgeoned alongside an expanded service sector, becoming one of the few means of income for those without jobs or capital.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 and 4 focus on Little Italy and Harlem respectively. <italic>The Godfather</italic> films (1972 and 1974) and <italic>Mean Streets</italic> (1973) are characterised by Corkin as “ethnic nostalgia” (p. 51), representing a reified community of Italian immigrant experience which had been drastically recomposed through deindustrialisation, suburbanisation and new immigration patterns. Corkin reads these films as both mirroring and blurring the anxiety of traditional ethnic Italian communities in a period of significant social and economic scalar change: “The world of these films has largely eroded and was eroding even in the period depicted” (p. 56).</p>
<p>If Little Italy was simulated in discrete nostalgic form, Harlem was largely objectified as a world of racialised, dystopian space. The off-shoring of Fordist production made redundant the African American labour which had contributed to, and contested, that order most in the city (p. 81). By the 1970s, Harlem was negatively defined as a repository of surplus labour, framed cinematically in the lack of visible employment and the recourse to criminality as sole source of revenue in <italic>Superfly</italic> (1972) and <italic>Across 110th Street</italic> (1972). Unlike the hermetic representation of Little Italy, Harlem’s centripetalism is constrained from without, insufficient within. The Black cultural legacy of the ‘Harlem Renaissance’, for instance, is routinely erased in the films of the 1970s (p. 96), even if the slogan has now resurfaced as a marker of ‘authenticity’ for contemporary gentrification strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098013485137">Zukin, 2012</xref>, p. 65).</p>
<p>The films in chapter 5, <italic>Serpico</italic> (1973), <italic>Dog Day Afternoon</italic> (1975) and <italic>Prince of the City</italic> (1981), suggest deterriorialisation and ungovernability, and horizontal sprawl rather than centripetal cohesion—effects of fiscal crisis, the planner Robert Moses’ ‘suburban solution’ to urbanisation and the creative destruction of inner-city areas. As New York gradually asserted itself as a ‘world city’, a key node in international finance, the selected films capture “a reorientation of scale, away from the local and toward the global” (p. 119).</p>
<p>Characterising neoconservative arguments for maintaining order in urban spaces, “as a necessary moral imperative and as a precondition to their gentrification” (p. 135), the vigilante responses represented in the films of chapter 6 anticipate neoliberal solutions to urban fiscal crisis through the free market and revanchist policing. As with the previous chapter, these representations are anticipatory rather than coeval with the neoliberal exceptionalism that would define the 1980s and 1990s. Thus, the (anti-)heroes of <italic>Death Wish</italic> (1974), <italic>Taxi Driver</italic> (1976) and <italic>Marathon Man</italic> (1976) are interpreted as “avatars of gentrification” (p. 151), a temporary manifestation of an archetype that would become more permanent over time.</p>
<p>The play of cinematic temporality is also evoked in the final chapter’s group of films, which anticipate a socially and geographically segregated ‘post-fordist’ city of cultural and creative industries; a space “of networks and of information dispersal and exchange” (p. 162). As Corkin acerbically notes, the cultural domains inhabited by the characters of <italic>Kramer vs Kramer</italic> (1979), <italic>An Unmarried Woman</italic> (1978), <italic>Annie Hall</italic> (1977) and <italic>Manhattan</italic> (1979) suggest the isolated affluent world that parts of New York became in the next decade, not the reality of the era depicted. The style of the films changed too: more drawing room comedy than film noir (p. 164), focusing exclusively on personal tribulations while retreating from public to private spheres. For Corkin, they represent a fait accompli for the next decade’s gentrification, reflecting the narcissistic needs and desires of a privileged minority.</p>
<p>The films capture the same transition from public to private space that Sharon Zukin identified in <italic>Loft Living</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098013485137">1988</xref>): the transformation of the lofts of the garment industry into an ‘artistic mode of production’—the sites of productive industry becoming pioneer places of performance, soon sanitised, then gentrified, by finance workers and skilled ancillary sectors (p. 189). They “usher in and confirm” (p. 192) an economic transformation of space, culture and class where productive industry has been displaced and where commitment to low-income minorities and social welfare provision is subsumed under a dominant paradigm of neoliberal economic development and a symbiotic relationship between finance and the art of rent. A by now familiar story perhaps, but what sets this reading apart from critical urban studies literature is that we also obtain a visual <italic>record</italic> of these changes through the films and a deeper understanding of how representational regimes are utilised to assist gentrification strategies through stigmatisation and affirmation.</p>
<p>In summary, Corkin’s central thesis that cinematic representation, and territorial stigmatisation, played a key role in the creative destruction and urban renewal of New York from the 1970s is convincingly argued. However, one criticism is that his analysis sometimes suggests a retrospective fait accompli, merely describing the gentrification process he implicitly disputes. More attention to contradictions and moments of resistance would better have contested the narratives of neoliberal urbanism he so well describes. That comment aside, <italic>Starring New York</italic> demonstrates a hugely productive alignment between urban, cultural, and visual studies that suggests the potential for a range of interdisciplinary studies in this area. Those interested in such an intersection will find much to commend in the book.</p>
