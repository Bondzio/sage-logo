<p>Nonviral gene delivery that enables exogenous gene expression in bone mesenchymal stem cells could accelerate clinical application of cell-based gene therapy. This study systematically investigated and compared the potential of polyethylenimine and Lipofectamine 2000 as gene carriers to modify bone mesenchymal stem cells including transfection efficiency, cytotoxicity, intracellular trafficking as well as cell membrane damage and apoptosis/necrosis. Polyethylenimine at its optimal N/P ratio of 10 demonstrated the same toxic effects but lower transfection efficiency (17.1% vs 39.5%) compared to Lipofectamine. Intracellular trafficking resulted in over 80% of bone mesenchymal stem cells that were able to take up polyethylenimine polyplexes, but only 20.69% showed nuclear uptake; however, for Lipofectamine, about half bone mesenchymal stem cells were found to uptake lipoplexes but about 30% displayed nuclear localization. Moreover, the percentages of nuclear localization of both vectors were in close relationship with their transfection efficiency. We concluded that for bone mesenchymal stem cell transfection, polyethylenimine displayed high cellular uptake but Lipofectamine was more effective in delivering genes into the nucleus, which was likely the underlying basis for a more efficient gene expression. Further structure modification of polyethylenimine such as improving its nuclear entry ability will eventually make it a better candidate for bone mesenchymal stem cells’ in vitro gene delivery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a promising strategy for the treatment of many inherited and acquired diseases, gene therapy, which is defined as the genetic modification of target cells for a therapeutic benefit, has been actively pursued for many decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911513481893">1</xref></sup> Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been used for the treatment of a variety of diseases as they can be engineered to deliver a series of proteins to repair wound sites or induce new tissue formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513481893">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911513481893">3</xref></sup> BMSCs are capable of differentiating into several nonhematopoietic cells such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and cardiac myocytes as well as nonmesodermal cells such as neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513481893">4</xref></sup> Moreover, BMSCs can be grafted into the host without systemic immunosuppressants, which is an important consideration that limits the application of cell-based therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911513481893">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Successful gene therapy relies heavily on suitable carriers that can efficiently deliver therapeutic genes into target cells with minimum cytotoxicity. Nonviral gene vectors have attracted much attention because they are particularly suitable, as they are safe, easy to produce, and lack specific immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911513481893">6</xref></sup> Cationic liposomes and cationic polymers are frequently used as nonviral systems, because their positive charges play an important role in improving DNA condensation and lipoplex/polyplex formation as well as facilitating the passage of DNA through the cell membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513481893">7</xref></sup> However, these two systems exhibit different mechanisms of cell uptake, cytoplasmic delivery from the endosome, and nuclear entry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513481893">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among a variety of nonviral gene vectors, polyethylenimine (PEI) as cationic polymer and Lipofectamine 2000 as cationic liposome are the most widely available commercial products. PEI is a branched polyamine with high buffer capacity that will facilitate polyplexes to escape from endosomes according to the “proton-sponge” hypothesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911513481893">9</xref></sup> Lipofectamine 2000 is a cationic liposome formulation that is usually referred to as the gold standard transfection reagent. These two classical vectors have been successfully used to deliver exogenous genes into BMSCs, and different transfection efficiency data were reported; however, those data still indicate lower effectiveness compared to viral vectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513481893">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513481893"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513481893"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513481893">13</xref></sup> Thus, it is very important to explore the intracellular gene delivery route as well as the cellular barriers for these two vectors. Moreover, with respect to BMSC-based gene therapy, the cytotoxicity of the vectors should also be considered for the sake of a safe application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513481893">14</xref></sup> The high toxicity of PEI has been shown for a wide range of cell lines which limits its application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513481893">15</xref></sup> Lipofectamine 2000 demonstrated relatively high cytotoxicity when used in high doses or during long-term exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513481893">12</xref></sup> However, the mechanism of nonviral vector induced cytotoxicity is still unclear. Gaining insights into these mechanical aspects is crucial to further improve the biological performance of future nonviral gene delivery systems.</p>
<p>In the current study, we compared branched PEI 25 kDa and Lipofectamine 2000 as in vitro BMSCs gene delivery reagents using two model plasmids that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and luciferase. Their transfection, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking characteristics as well as effects on metabolic activity, membrane damage, and apoptosis were investigated.</p>

<title>Isolation and identification of BMSCs</title>
<p>BMSCs were isolated from bilateral femurs of 9-day-old Sprague Dawley rats. In brief, bone marrow was flushed out from the femurs using a syringe containing alpha-modified minimum essential medium (α-MEM; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL) and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco BRL). The marrow solution was centrifuged at 1000 r/min for 5 min, suspended in fresh complete medium, and directly seeded on a single flask and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 72 h, the nonadherent cells were removed from the medium. The confluent cells were trypsinized on day 7. After three to four subcultures, BMSCs were identified by BMSC markers and differentiation capacity, and the identified cells were used in this study.</p>

<sec id="section4-0883911513481893">
<title>Preparation of polyplexes and lipoplexes as well as transfection of BMSCs</title>
<p>PEI/DNA complexes with N/P ratio varying between 5 and 30 were prepared. Branched PEI 25 kDa (Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved at appropriate concentrations in 150 mM NaCl to yield 100 µL of solution. One microgram of Luciferase Reporter Vector pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) or EGFP Expression Vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was also diluted in 150 mM NaCl to form another 100 µL of solution. Equal volumes of solution were quickly mixed together and gently vortexed for 15 s. Then, the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and used immediately.</p>
<p>The lipofectamine/pDNA complexes were prepared according to the manufacture’s instruction. pDNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 1:2 weight:volume) were diluted in two independent microcentrifuge tubes containing Opti-MEM<sup>®</sup> reduced serum medium (Gibco BRL) and mixed gently. After 5 min of incubation, the Lipofectamine solution was added to pDNA solution, mixed gently, and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature to allow lipoplex formation.</p>
<p>In transfection experiments of BMSCs, cells were allowed to grow until 60%–70% confluence after which the complete medium was replaced with Opti-MEM. Then, polyplexes and lipoplex solutions (containing 2, 1, and 0.25 µg pDNA) were added to 12-, 24-, and 96-well plates and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. After removing the medium, each well was supplemented with fresh complete medium and incubated at 37°C for 24–48 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883911513481893">
<title>Transfection efficiency study</title>
<p>BMSCs were transfected by polyplexes at various N/P ratios or by lipoplexes using pGL3 or pEGFP-C1 in 24-well plates. BMSCs in the pGL3 group were lysed in lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h posttransfection, followed by two freezing–thawing procedures. Aliquots of 20 µL lysate were added to 100 µL of luciferase assay substrate (Promega) and vortexed, and the light emission was measured using a Lumat 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) for 10 s. The relative light units (RLU/mg protein) were normalized against the total protein concentrations in the cell extracts, which was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). BMSCs in the pEGFP-C1 group were individually trypsinized, and the percentage of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive BMSCs was counted by a flow cytometer (FCM; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). GFP-positive BMSCs were also stained by 50 ng/mL of Hoechst 33258 (Gibco BRL) to identify the nucleus and then imaged using a fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE200; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Cell metabolic activity assay</title>
<p>After 4, 24, and 48 h of transfection in a 24-well plate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed to measure the cell metabolic activity. Three wells of each group were randomly chosen and washed twice with serum-free α-MEM. A total of 100 µL of filtered MTT (Sigma–Aldrich) solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well. After incubation at 37°C for 4 h, the medium in the wells was aspirated carefully, and then 500 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to dissolve any insoluble formazan crystals. A total of 600 µL solution from each well was transferred into three wells in a 96-well plate, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm on an ELX Ultra Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Untreated cells were taken as control with 100% viability. The relative cell viability was calculated as a percentage relative to untreated control cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0883911513481893">
<title>Lactate dehydrogenase assay</title>
<p>After 4 and 8 h of transfection in 96-well plates, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed to measure membrane damages using a Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ, USA). Briefly, each sample was divided into two sections: maximum LDH (high control) and experimental LDH release. Wells with untransfected cells were considered as low control. To both experimental LDH wells and low control wells, 10 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added for volume correction. A total of 10 µL of 9% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to high control wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C for complete lysing. Then, 50 µL of the supernatant was collected after centrifugation and transferred into a separate 96-well plate, followed by adding 50 µL of LDH substrate, shaking at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, and recording the absorbance at 490 nm with an ELX Ultra Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). Release of total LDH for each sample was calculated according to the following formula: % Total LDH release = (experimental value − low control)/(high control − low control) × 100.</p>

<title>Apoptosis analysis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining</title>
<p>After 24 h of transfection in 24-well plates with coverslips on the bottom, BMSCs were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays to identify apoptotic cells using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, BMSCs grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were treated with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–methanol followed by two more washing with PBS. The cells were then treated with permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 10 min on ice. Samples were washed twice with PBS again and incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–labeled deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. Finally, the samples were incubated with an anti-FITC–peroxidase (POD) conjugate. POD activity was shown by diaminobenzidine (DAB). Samples were then counterstained with hematoxylin. For each experimental set, untransfected BMSCs were incubated in the absence (blank control) or in the presence (positive control) of DNase I pretreating, in addition to negative control groups prepared by omitting TdT from the reaction mixture. The percentages of TUNEL-positive cells were obtained by image analysis (Image-Pro Plus v5.0, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Three specimens in each group were chosen, with at least three visual fields per specimen, and three randomly chosen areas were analyzed.</p>

<sec id="section9-0883911513481893">
<title>DNA uptake, intracellular trafficking, and nuclear localization</title>
<p>pGL3 was labeled with Label IT<sup>®</sup> Cy3 Nucleic Acid Labeling Kit (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA) by incubating pDNA and the marker in the dark according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Cy3-labeled pGL3 was complexed with unlabeled PEI or Lipofectamine, and the complexes were used for the transfection of BMSCs. The percentage of BMSCs displaying Cy3-labeled pGL3 uptake after 24 h transfection was quantified by counting the Cy3-positive BMSCs (10,000 events/sample) using FCM with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.</p>
<p>At the end of each incubation period (0.5, 2, 4, and 24 h), BMSCs in 24-well culture plates with coverslips at the bottom were fixed with 4% formalin for 30 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Then 50 µL of rat monoclonal anti-β-actin primary antibody solution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) containing 50 ng/mL Hoechst 33258 was added and incubated at 4°C overnight. Finally, 50 µL of FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added and incubated for another 30 min. Intracellular localization of Cy3-labeled pDNA was visualized using a Leica TCS-SP5 spectral confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a multiphoton system. The sensitivity and conditions were kept constant for each sample. The percentages of cells displaying pDNA nuclear localization were obtained by image analysis based on CLSM images using a method described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911513481893">16</xref></sup> Results were calculated as ratio between the number of cells displaying Cy3 fluorescence in the nucleus and the number of total cells in certain field.</p>

The mild and time-delayed cytotoxicity of Lipofectamine became obvious after 12 h of transfection while most PEI groups displayed immediate toxicity at 4 h posttransfection. The cytotoxicity of PEI was found to increase with increasing N/P ratios. The PEI group at an N/P ratio of 10 had a toxicity comparable to Lipofectamine (p &gt; 0.05); however, at higher N/P ratios, much lower cell viability was observed (p &lt; 0.01). Another interesting phenomenon was that the PEI group at an N/P ratio lower than 10 demonstrated a time-dependent cell growth, which means the percentage of cell survival increased with increasing transfection times. PEI groups at N/P ratios higher than 15 displayed decreasing cell viability with increasing transfection times, suggesting that PEI-transfected cells lost renewal function when the N/P ratio was higher than 15.</p>

There were two kinds of TUNEL-positive cells with typical apoptotic or necrotic morphologies: nuclear condensation with cytoplasmic fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">Figure 4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">(d)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">(f)</xref>, solid arrow) or nuclear condensation without cytoplasmic fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">Figure 4(b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">(d)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">(e)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">(g)</xref>), hollow arrows). For the PEI group, the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells was found to increase with increasing N/P ratios; however, the cell density decreased dramatically. TUNEL-positive cells and the cell density for the Lipofectamine group were similar to the PEI group at an N/P ratio of 15. To obtain the percentages of TUNEL-positive cells, image analysis was used, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481893">Figure 4(k)</xref>. The PEI group exhibited an increasing percentage of positive cells with increasing N/P ratios. At an N/P ratio of 10, PEI caused 11.5% of TUNEL-positive cells, which was not statistically different from the results obtained for Lipofectamine (p &gt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Intracellular trafficking of pDNA</title>
<p>Intracellular trafficking of Cy3-labeled pDNA was analyzed by CLSM, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911513481893">Figure 5</xref>. An optimal N/P ratio of 10 was chosen for PEI 25 kDa. Throughout the observation periods, the polyplexes were found in small vesicles, whereas the lipoplexes formed relatively large vesicles that were about 3–5 times the size of the former. This difference may be partly related to the size difference between polyplexes and lipoplexes themselves.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, both groups showed similar behavior indicating that most of the fluorescent particles had localized around the boundaries and attached to cell surfaces. Others dispersed in the cytoplasmic periphery. Two hours after transfection, enhanced fluorescence was seen randomly dispersed in the cytoplasmic compartments for both groups, and some particles were found to interact with the surface of the nuclear membrane. Nuclear localization was already detected for the Lipofectamine group at this time-point. At 4 h posttransfection, the amount of fluorescent particles around nuclear membranes increased further, and some nuclear localization was observed in both groups. However, in the Lipofectamine group, more and larger fluorescent patches accumulated in the cytoplasm than in the PEI group. After 24 h of transfection, significant differences appeared between the groups. For polyplexes, a large amount of fluorescent dots appeared in the vicinity of the nucleus, and some diffuse particles appeared inside the nucleus. For lipoplexes, there were still many fluorescence patches scattered in the cytoplasm of most cells, and simultaneously significant pDNA localization within the nucleus was observed, highlighted by the accumulated fluorescent clumps as well as large and irregular fluorescent patches inside the nucleus. Almost all of cells in the field of view showed pDNA nuclear localizations.</p>

<title>DNA uptake and image analysis of nuclear localization</title>
<p>The control group, naked pDNA without any carriers, yielded ~2% Cy3-positive BMSCs. A pDNA uptake in the Lipofectamine group was found in about half (49.02%) of the cells, and approximately 37% of cells displayed pDNA nuclear localization. In contrast, the majority (82.59%) of the cells exhibited pDNA uptake in the PEI group with an optimal N/P ratio of 10; however, a smaller percentage of the cells (20.69%) exhibited pDNA nuclear localization, indicating a diminished ability to transport pDNA into the nucleus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Transfection efficiency is the most important factor to assess the quality of gene delivery vectors. Retroviral and adenoviral vectors were reported to achieve almost complete transfection of BMSCs (80%–98%);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513481893">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513481893"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513481893">19</xref></sup> however, the transfection efficiency of nonviral gene delivery in BMSCs was much lower. Lipofectamine 2000 demonstrated about 17%–19.6% of BMSC modification under optimum condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513481893">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513481893">20</xref></sup> PEIs have a high affinity for BMSCs but only a 12.7% cell modification was reported at an N/P ratio of 10 in the study by Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513481893">14</xref></sup> In another study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911513481893">21</xref></sup> 10% of rat BMSCs were found to be transfected using PEI at a higher N/P ratio of 16. Recently, a study on PEI-mediated gene delivery into human BMSCs exhibited a maximum of 24.24% transfection efficiency at an N/P ratio of 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513481893">10</xref></sup> In this study, the transfection efficiency of Lipofectamine (37%) was much higher than those reported data. Branched PEI with an N/P ratio of 10 achieved 17.1% of GFP-positive BMSCs, which was also higher than in previous research under the same conditions. In PEI, the maximum transfection efficiency of GFP (39.55%) at an N/P ratio of 30 was comparable to that of Lipofectamine; however, luciferase was expressed through PEI only at one-third of the capacity of Lipofectamine. This indicates a better protein-secreting capacity for BMSCs transfected by Lipofectamine.</p>
<p>Cytotoxicity is another critical factor that needs to be considered when assessing the safety of gene delivery vectors. As reported, PEI-mediated transfection mainly caused two types of cytotoxicity: an immediate toxicity associated with uncombined PEI and a delayed toxicity associated with PEI released from polyplexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911513481893">22</xref></sup> The cytotoxicity of lipoplexes might be due to nonspecific interaction with the cell membrane causing transient pore formation and lysis as a result of excess positive charges and their amphiphilic nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911513481893">23</xref></sup> Moreover, a number of investigations reported that both of them have a genotoxic potential for target cells by inducing apoptosis and necrosis pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513481893">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911513481893">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, different techniques were used to evaluate the BMSCs’ viability after polyplex/lipoplex transfection in order to systematically explore different mechanisms of toxicity. Morphological changes were a direct indicator of cell survival. MTT assays determine mitochondria and metabolic activity of the cells. The LDH release assay was used to evaluate cell membrane damage. The TUNEL assay was used to investigate the percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells. Based on the results, PEI exhibits an N/P ratio-dependent cytotoxicity. Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity need to be balanced in order to obtain acceptable gene delivery. In this study, an N/P ratio of 10 was found to be optimal for PEI to balance both sides because at this condition, PEI successfully delivered model genes into 17.1% of BMSCs, and morphological changes of cell were acceptable. Furthermore, a relatively high cell viability (75%–80%), mild cell membrane damages (about 15% of LDH release), and moderate amounts of apoptosis/necrosis (11.5% of TUNEL-positive cells) were observed. Although PEI had lower transfection efficiency than Lipofectamine under those conditions, the toxic effects caused by polyplexes were similar to those caused by Lipofectamine. Both vectors were found to induce TUNEL-positive cells, which indicated that apoptosis/necrosis was the cause for cell death in PEI and Lipofectamine-transfected cells.</p>
<p>The relatively low effectiveness of these two classical nonviral gene vectors compared to viral vectors is partly due to the intercellular barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513481893">7</xref></sup> Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the cellular uptake and intracellular disposition of genes as well as their carriers will provide more information crucial for improving the method of transfection and designing nonviral gene delivery system. In general, in order to deliver DNA, polyplexes/lipoplexes adhered first to negatively charged cell membranes and were subsequently taken up by cells and then they followed the endolysosomal pathway and fused with lysosomal vesicles in the cytoplasm, assembled in the perinuclear region, and a fraction of polyplexes/lipoplexes were released into the cytoplasm and DNA then translocated into the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911513481893">25</xref></sup> Endocytic trafficking as well as cell barriers, including endosome–lysosome, cytoplasm, and nuclear envelope, can be important limitations for gene expression in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513481893">26</xref></sup> CLSM was used to observe the intracellular trafficking of pDNA delivered by PEI and Lipofectamine at different transfection stages. It was determined that the fluorescent dots of lipoplexes were much larger in size and brighter than those of the polyplexes, which may in part be related to the size differences of the actual carrier structures. The larger size and brighter fluorescence indicated the stronger ability of Lipofectamine to condense DNA, which means that more copies of pDNA were carried in a single lipoplex particle. After 0.5 hour of transfection, fluorescent dots could be found in the cytoplasm for both vectors, which indicated that pDNA could be easily transferred through the cell membrane; in other words, the cell membrane entry was not the limiting step. Both polyplexes and lipoplexes can be endocytosed through the cell membrane, which is considered the most important pDNA uptake mechanism for cationic polymer and liposome vectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911513481893">27</xref></sup> Moreover, the colipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in Lipofectamine could also promote the internalization of lipoplexes through membrane fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911513481893">28</xref></sup> After internalization, polyplexes/lipoplexes must escape from the endosome–lysosome, which is the major obstacle of intracellular trafficking, so that pDNA can be released into the cytoplasm and then delivered to nucleus. It was shown by CLSM that the vectors in both groups assembled in the perinuclear region after 4 h of transfection, in some cases even after 2 h of transfection, which meant that polyplexes/lipoplexes escaped from the endosome–lysosome and delivered pDNA to the cytoplasm. PEI polyplexes probably escaped the endolysosomal compartment by a “proton-sponge” mechanism, which involves osmotic lysis of the compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911513481893">9</xref></sup> Lipoplexes were considered to cross the endosome barrier by mechanisms that included disrupting the endolysosomal membrane, charge neutralization, endosome membrane fusion, and pore formation within the endosomal membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911513481893">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911513481893">29</xref></sup> The nuclear membrane is the last obstacle for intracellular trafficking of pDNA. In this study, pDNA nuclear localization appeared after 24 h of transfection in the PEI group, but Lipofectamine was more efficient in delivering pDNA into the nuclear compartment, indicated by early (2 h) fluorescence localization in the nucleus and a time-dependent fluorescence aggregation at 24 h posttransfection. The nuclear transportation mechanism of polyplexes involves in part the polyplex fusion with the nuclear membrane, which is mediated by the polyplexes’ interaction with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513481893">26</xref></sup> Cell division is another important manner of pDNA nuclear localization for both polyplexes and lipoplexes. During mitosis, the integrity of the nuclear membrane is transiently lost, which allows the nuclear entry of transgenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911513481893">30</xref></sup> BMSCs are a highly proliferated cell type, and the cell division theory should be considered as nuclear entry of pDNA.</p>
<p>In order to find a correlation between transgene expression and the ability of polyplexes/lipoplexes to cross the intracellular barriers, this study also used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and CLSM combined image analysis to investigate cellular uptake as well as percentage of pDNA nuclear localization. The results demonstrated that in the case of PEI-mediated transfection, most BMSCs were able to take up the polyplexes (over 80%), but only a small proportion (20.69%) showed nuclear pDNA uptake. However, for Lipofectamine, about half BMSCs were able to uptake lipoplexes, and about one-third displayed pDNA nuclear localization. This indicates that PEI transports pDNA readily through the cell membrane, and Lipofectamine has a much stronger capacity to deliver pDNA into nucleus. It was reported that the rate-limiting step for intracellular pathways was dependent upon the gene delivery vector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911513481893">31</xref></sup> Our results are in good agreement with those obtained by Varga,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883911513481893">32</xref></sup> which suggested that lipoplexes were limited by cellular uptake, whereas polyplexes were limited by nuclear import. For both PEI and Lipofectamine, the amount of pDNA taken up by BMSCs did not correlate with the transfection efficiency, suggesting that the cellular uptake of polyplexes and lipoplexes was not a limiting step for transfection. However, interestingly, the percentages of nuclear localization were found in close relationship with the transfection efficiency (37% vs 37.36% for Lipofectamine and 20.69% vs 18.58% for PEI at an N/P ratio of 10), which indicated that the membrane of the cellular nucleus is the most important barrier that needs to be overcome for an efficient transgene expression.</p>
<p>Thus, the transport of genetic constructs into the nucleus is the key stage for an efficient gene delivery process. However, whether the polyplexes/lipoplexes disassemble before DNA enters the nucleus has not yet been elucidated. For PEI polyplexes based on the evidence, PEI not only accompanied DNA to the nucleus but moreover targeted it to the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911513481893">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911513481893">34</xref></sup> Godbey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883911513481893">35</xref></sup> also found that PEI remains attached to DNA after entering the nucleus. For lipoplexes, researchers tended to consider that DNA should dissociate from the liposome because lipid coating of the DNA would inhibit transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883911513481893">36</xref></sup> In this study, the same size and morphology of fluorescent particles localized in nucleus indicated that undissociated PEI kept pDNA condensed inside the nucleus. For Lipofectamine, it was not clear whether Lipofectamine accompanies pDNA into the nucleus; however, based on the significant gene expression, pDNA seems to undergo intracellular dissociation before entering the nucleus.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, the capacity of two classical nonviral gene delivery vectors for plasmid DNA into BMSCs, PEI and Lipofectamine 2000, was systematically investigated and compared in terms of transfection efficiency, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking. PEI demonstrated lower transfection efficiency at an optimal N/P ratio of 10 (17.1%) than Lipofectamine (39.5%). However, the toxic effects of PEI polyplexes at optimal conditions were similar to those of Lipofectamine. The cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking data indicated higher cellular uptake of PEI polyplexes by BMSCs but a more preferential nuclear localization of DNA delivered by Lipofectamine. Furthermore, the percentages of nuclear localization were in close relationship with the transfection efficiency. We concluded that PEI was a good candidate to deliver genes into BMSCs, and further structure modifications of PEI could improve its nuclear entry ability which would make it a potential, nontoxic in vitro transfection vehicle for BMSCs.</p>
