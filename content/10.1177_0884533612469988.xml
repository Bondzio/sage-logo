<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Although parenteral nutrition (PN) has become an integral component of patient care, the risks and costs associated with this therapy must be weighed against the benefits. The Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at our tertiary referral, university-affiliated hospital has audited the use of enteral nutrition and PN based on criteria devised from guidelines developed by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.). We aimed to examine the use of PN over time and in particular to investigate the appropriate and inappropriate use of this feeding method. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: Each patient referred for PN was assessed by a dietitian and need for PN evaluated. The appropriateness of the PN was categorized according to predefined criteria. <italic>Results</italic>: A total of 1191 patients had 1409 episodes of PN during the study period. According to the predefined criteria, 82% of PN episodes were considered “appropriate.” PN was “appropriate but avoidable” in 13% of cases. In 5% of episodes, the commencement of PN was considered “inappropriate.” The use of appropriate PN increased significantly over the study period (<italic>P</italic> = .018). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Most PN episodes were deemed appropriate. We saw 5% inappropriate usage, which is lower than reported in comparable studies. This study underlines the importance of continuous audit and evaluation of practice to maintain appropriate and evidence-based practice in nutrition support.</p>

<p>Malnutrition is an independent risk factor for morbidity, increased length of hospital stay, higher readmission rates, delayed recovery, lower quality of life, greater hospital costs, and higher mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612469988">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612469988"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612469988"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612469988">4</xref></sup> Malnutrition is common in Irish hospitals, on all types of wards and in all diagnostic categories, and at all ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612469988">5</xref></sup> In 2011, the second national nutrition screening week survey was undertaken in the Republic of Ireland. This major survey of 1262 adult admissions in 26 hospitals revealed that 27% of patients admitted to Irish hospitals were at risk of malnutrition, most of whom were at high risk (20%) and a minority (7%) at medium risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612469988">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The annual public health and social care cost associated with adult malnourished patients in Ireland is estimated at over €1.4 billion ($2 billion), representing 10% of the healthcare budget. Most of this cost (70%) arises in acute hospital or residential care settings, with nutrition support estimated to account for &lt;3% of spending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612469988">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The evidence for the effectiveness of nutrition support, including the use of enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN), has grown considerably in recent years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612469988">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612469988"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612469988"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612469988">4</xref></sup> showing improved outcomes in many disease states and patient populations. PN is an essential feeding method for specific patients who cannot meet their nutrition requirements through oral intake or enteral tube feeding. However, PN is invasive and not without risk and has been associated with many clinical complications. Therefore, appropriate and judicious use is imperative. Several studies have noted that PN is often inappropriately used in the hospital setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612469988">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612469988"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612469988">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since 2005, the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at our tertiary referral, university-affiliated hospital has audited the use of both EN and PN based on criteria devised from guidelines developed by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) in 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612469988">10</xref></sup> The principal purpose of this continuous audit was to examine the use of PN over time and in particular to investigate the appropriate and inappropriate use of this feeding method.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612469988" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Patients commenced on PN in our hospital between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, were included in a prospectively maintained database. Data were not included for 2009, during which the audit was not completed. Where the PN episode continued onto a new calendar year, the episode was recorded as a new episode due to the annual nature of the audit.</p>
<p>Each patient referred for PN was assessed by the dietitian affiliated with the team and need for PN evaluated. As the audit was conducted over several years, several dietitians were involved in data collection. The appropriateness of the PN was categorized according to predefined criteria. The categories were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0884533612469988" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Appropriate and unavoidable</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Appropriate but avoidable</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inappropriate</p></list-item></list>
<p>PN was deemed appropriate and unavoidable only if nutrition support was indicated by <italic>both</italic> predefined diagnostic and nutrition criteria. The diagnostic criteria were a diagnosis consistent with need for PN: evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) malfunction or precluded GI access (detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612469988">Table 1</xref>). Following nutrition assessment by a dietitian, patients were categorized into 1 of the following nutrition categories (nutrition criteria)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612469988">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612469988">12</xref></sup>:</p>

<p>PN was deemed appropriate but avoidable when nutrition support was indicated but there was a functional GI tract that had not been accessed (eg, after gastroesophagectomy) yet no jejunal access gained intraoperatively. PN was deemed inappropriate if none of the criteria stated above were true yet PN was still initiated.</p>
<p>If PN was started before the dietitian assessment, this was noted. The primary outcome of each PN episode was recorded according to a predefined list. Options included “successfully weaned to enteral tube feeding or oral diet,” “transfer to another hospital,” “discharged home on PN,” “continued to the next calendar year,” “death,” premature discontinuation due to “nonadherence to the nutrition care plan,” and mechanical, physiological, or infectious complications. Data were analyzed at the end of each year by a clinical specialist dietitian. Feedback was provided by the dietetic department to multidisciplinary colleagues, and education was targeted at areas identified for improvement.</p>
<p>We analyzed the data using Minitab, Release 14 (Minitab, Inc, State College, PA). χ<sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare proportions, and a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>
<p>The study proposal was submitted to our institutional review board, the Joint St James Hospital and Tallaght Hospital Ethics Committee, and the study was deemed exempt from full review by the board due to its nature.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1191 patients had 1409 episodes of PN during the study period (patients may have had more than 1 episode of PN in a given calendar year). The most common indication for PN was “diagnosis consistent with need for PN” (n = 700), followed by “evidence of GI malfunction” (n = 333) and finally “precluded GI access” (n = 194). The majority of PN (83%, n = 1169) was started following dietetic assessment.</p>

<title>Nutrition Status</title>
<p>On assessment by the dietitian, patients were considered severely malnourished in 41% (n = 582) of episodes. In only a small number (3%, n = 40) of episodes, patients were considered “well nourished and not at nutrition risk.” In the remaining episodes (56%, n = 787), patients were considered “well nourished but at risk.”</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>During the course of hospitalization, in more than two-thirds (n = 999, 71%) of episodes, patients were transitioned to either enteral tube feeding or oral diet.

Some episodes continued to the next calendar year (n = 44, 3%). In the remaining episodes (n = 83, 6%), PN was prematurely discontinued due to nonadherence to the nutrition care plan or due to mechanical, physiological, or infectious complications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PN is an essential feeding route for specific patient groups to prevent or treat malnutrition. However, PN carries significant complications, so appropriate usage is essential. Quality of care and adherence to evidence-based practice are paramount.</p>
<p>PN is an expensive therapy compared with enteral feeding. The average daily cost for PN is difficult to establish because there are the direct costs of the product and equipment, as well as indirect costs of facilities and personnel who administer it. Based on regimens alone, PN is more expensive than enteral feeding by €80–€150 per day ($101–$189),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612469988">13</xref></sup> depending on the formula or solution used. It has also been estimated that a dietitian spends at least twice the personnel hours managing PN patients compared with patients on enteral tube feeding or oral diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612469988">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>When compared with the results of the national screening week, a higher percentage of our patients were considered severely malnourished. This may be explained by the fact that those requiring PN tend to have complex underlying clinical conditions that adversely affect nutrition status.</p>
<p>In some cases, PN is avoidable with more aggressive use of jejunal feeding, insertion of intraoperative feeding tubes, aggressive use of prokinetics, and the employment of nasal bridles to prevent inadvertent dislodgement of feeding tubes. However, these techniques may not be standard practice in many institutions. In this study, the use of PN that was deemed appropriate but avoidable dropped in 2005–2010 from 17% to 11.5%, a clinical but not statistically significant drop. This coincided with the successful introduction of the 10, 10, 10 method of insertion of bedside nasojejunal feeding tubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612469988">13</xref></sup> and nasal bridles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612469988">14</xref></sup> in our institution. Also contributory were ongoing education, interaction, and monitoring by the dietetic department with their multidisciplinary colleagues to highlight alternative routes of feeding to PN. This education included presentations at hospital grand rounds, multidisciplinary team education meetings, and daily informal multidisciplinary discussions. Annual audit reports were sent to consultant physicians with a per speciality breakdown of PN usage and appropriateness data. This is likely to also contribute to improving data from year to year. However, education must be ongoing, as demonstrated by the increase in the rate of appropriate but avoidable PN in 2011 following several years of improvement. The use of audit and feedback reports of PN practices also plays a role in improving nutrition practices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612469988">15</xref></sup> by providing objective data, serving as evidence of the need for improvement, and by providing a gauge of success.</p>
<p>Inappropriate usage of PN from the study group was 5%. Over the study period, this percentage decreased, and low levels were maintained, which compares favorably with the literature. A recently published multicenter study using similar predefined criteria classified inappropriately prescribed PN at 32%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612469988">7</xref></sup> Chan and Luman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612469988">8</xref></sup> reported a 15.9% incidence of inappropriate PN use in a single-center study. Maurer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612469988">9</xref></sup> showed a 32% rate of inappropriate PN use at a large teaching hospital over a 2-year period.</p>
<p>Overall, PN outcomes were positive. The number of patients discontinuing PN due to withdrawal of active treatment or death reflects the critical nature of the patients who require PN. Although the number stopping PN due to mechanical, physiological, or infectious complications was low and improved during the study period, it highlights the potential complications of this treatment.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. The audit was not completed in 2009. Because the data were analyzed annually, the quality and interpretation of the data may have been affected; in particular, when patients received PN at the end of a calendar year, the episode was counted as a new episode on January 1 of the following year. Although this affects the overall data interpretation, it must be noted that the numbers involved were small (n = 44) given the overall large sample size, and episodes were not reevaluated. The study was also dependent on an individual dietitian’s clinical judgment on determining if an episode of PN was appropriate; therefore, there is a risk of bias and inconsistency. This audit used the A.S.P.E.N. 2002 guidelines as the basis for our “inappropriate” criteria; however, these guidelines have since been updated. PN may now be considered inappropriate and avoidable in certain scenarios (eg, severe acute pancreatitis) where it may have been considered appropriate in the past. Nevertheless, this study represents a method for the continuous audit of practice of PN, which provides valuable assistance in practice improvement. Within a single institution, specific areas of practice may be highlighted, providing valuable information of positive and negative trends in usage of PN to enhance the quality of nutrition care and its delivery.</p>
<p>Although PN has become an integral component of patient care, the risks and costs associated with the therapy must be weighed against the benefits. Comprehensive clinical management includes selecting appropriate candidates, implementing and monitoring therapy, and ensuring a seamless transition to enteral/oral feeding when PN is no longer required. In our institution, ongoing and sustained education provided with the assistance of annual data has created awareness of the importance of judicious PN usage and continues to be a priority in the nutrition management of our patients.</p>
