<abstract>
<p>A comfortable indoor environment is an essential condition for establishing a healthy housing environment. The indoor comfort is influenced by not only architectural conditions, but also residents’ psychological adaptation and behavioural adjustments. Moreover, specific information about adjusting behaviours, such as opening windows, closing blinds and adjusting clothing, is important to enhance indoor comfort effectively and reduce energy consumption at home.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to explore residents’ evaluation and adjusting behaviour related to the indoor comfort of apartments in Korea. This study collected residents’ evaluations of thermo, sound, light and air conditions through surveys on their satisfaction, and the study identified factors affecting residents’ evaluations. In addition, this study investigated adjusting behaviours that would improve levels of indoor comfort based on the unique attributes of apartments and residents’ living culture, and it analysed the relationship between such behaviour and their satisfaction. The questionnaire survey was collected from apartment residents. Frequency analyses, <italic>t</italic>-test and multiple linear regression analysis were employed.</p>
<p>The results of this study would contribute to developing plans and management guidelines for enhancing indoor comfort and satisfaction as specific and practical data.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1420326X11420120"><title>Study Background</title>
<p>Residents’ demands for their housing environment are not only getting diversified day by day, their demands for quality improvement are also rising. As well-being and health have become the key issues in the housing environment, housing has become a place where residents should promote and maintain their health, beyond the conventional notion of shelter. Accordingly, new types of houses with newly coined names, such as eco-friendly house, well-being apartment, and healthy housing, have been designed, and existing houses have been restructured or transformed into healthier environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11420120">1</xref>]. The indoor environment should provide the essential condition for establishing a healthy housing environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11420120">2</xref>], and a critical factor for evaluating the quality of housing environment. Thus, it is necessary to seek ways to maintain and improve comfort levels of indoor environments.</p>
<p>Previous studies on indoor comfort have focused on the following topics: (1) the physical conditions of indoor environments, (2) factors affecting the comfort of indoor environments and (3) assessment of indoor environments. In order to identify the comfort levels of indoor environments that are measured by heat, air, light and noise conditions, experimental studies have examined the physical conditions including temperatures (°C and/or °F), humidity (%) and concentrations of pollutants (ppm), and suggested optimal ranges of those conditions or recommended levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11420120">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11420120">6</xref>]. However, as these studies have mostly focused on commercial space or public buildings, such as offices and hospitals, it is necessary to accumulate research data on residential spaces.</p>
<p>In addition, rules and regulations on comfort ranges have been revised by many countries with architectural and technological developments, and each country has implemented different laws, regulations and/or recommendations according to its climate and cultural background. The comfort levels of indoor environments are influenced by various factors. For example, physical attributes like building forms, facility levels and the degree of deterioration could affect the comfort levels of indoor environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11420120">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11420120">13</xref>]; although the physical conditions of a building may fail to meet the comfort ranges, the building can be as comfortable to its residents as buildings with better physical conditions if the residents have a high awareness of apartment maintenance and management and close relationship with neighbours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11420120">14</xref>]. Additionally, if residents are given control over their indoor environments, their comfort zones tend to be wider. When experimental subjects were allowed to control indoor temperatures, the comfort temperatures of the subjects could vary as widely as 7.2°C. The researchers argued that psychological factors, or users’ control over the environment, were important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11420120">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11420120">16</xref>]. As stated, the comfort range of indoor environment could be influenced by various factors including physical conditions, and thus it is necessary to consider wide-ranging aspects to improve the comfort level of indoor environments.</p>
<p>The majority of assessment studies on indoor environments have focused on technical evaluation by adopting objective criteria, such as a range of comfortable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11420120">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11420120">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11420120">21</xref>]. However, healthy and pleasant environments should be assessed by not only technical and functional aspects, but also residents’ interaction with the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11420120">22</xref>]. As the need for indoor environment evaluation that factor in residents’ perceived quality of indoor environment has emerged, studies on residents’ evaluation of indoor environment have also been conducted in order to more comprehensively evaluate indoor environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11420120">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11420120">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies on the indoor comfort of apartments in Korea have been experimental ones that identified architectural factors that could be affecting the comfort range and also suggested improvement measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11420120">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11420120">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11420120">13</xref>]. Considering apartments are collective residences, physical attributes such as building size, level of stories, arrangement, the number of unit houses, floor plan and heating system would have great influence on the comfort level of indoor environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11420120">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11420120">33</xref>]. However, such factors are fixed at the architectural design stage, and thus residents have little control over them. Residents’ perceived comfort level of indoor environment could differ largely depending on their personal attributes, such as age or clothing habit, and could also be greatly affected by psychological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11420120">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11420120">34</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider not only architectural factors, but also residents’ behavioural and psychological attributes when planning measures to improve comfort levels of apartment indoor environment. Some apartment residents set indoor temperatures high and wear only short sleeves and pants in winter while others set temperatures low and wear more clothes. Some use air cleaners or air purifiers for ventilation without opening the windows. Furthermore, some people always draw curtains or blinds to protect their privacy at the expense of sunlight. As these habits suggest, residents are ceaselessly interacting with the environment at home in order to satisfy their needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11420120">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X11420120">40</xref>]. When residents feel uncomfortable with their indoor environments, they make adjustments to improve the satisfaction levels. Therefore, residents’ adjusting behaviours at home are direct and efficient methods to enhance their comfort levels. At this time, when households are interested in reducing energy and saving resources, residents’ adjusting behaviours could be important and useful to control indoor environments. As residents have more control over houses than other types of buildings and each resident or household would present different adjusting behaviours, it is called for to specifically understand residents’ adjusting behaviours based on the apartment environment and living culture of Korea.</p>
<p>In order to establish sustainable and healthy housing environments, this study will determine efficient measures to improve the comfort levels of indoor environments based on residents’ awareness and behaviours. To this end, this study examines the relationship between residents’ perceived comfort levels of indoor environment and their housing satisfaction through evaluations of the comfort levels of their apartments’ indoor environments. This study seeks to fully understand the attributes of indoor comfort from residents’ perspectives by looking into their adjusting behaviours. This study is expected to serve as a practical tool for developing plans and management guidelines to improve comfort levels of indoor environments, and ultimately to provide useful data to enhance housing environmental quality and satisfaction.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11420120"><title>Study Contents and Methodology</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to establish practical data about resident-oriented measures to improve comfort levels of indoor environments, based on residents’ satisfaction with indoor environment and adjusting behaviours to enhance comfort levels. The objectives of the study are as follows:
<list id="list1-1420326X11420120" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Find two apartments that have similar site conditions, and understand the residents’ perceived comfort levels of heat, noise, light and air conditions of the indoor environment through surveys on their satisfaction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analyse correlations between residents’ satisfaction with overall housing quality and their perceived comfort levels of indoor environment, and examine the importance of indoor comfort for housing environmental quality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify influential factors (architectural, socio-demographical and psychological) in indoor comfort based on precedent studies, and understand the relationship between indoor comfort and residents’ perceived comfort levels through empirical studies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Discover residents’ adjusting behaviours to improve comfort levels of the indoor environment based on the unique attributes of an apartment and the residents’ awareness and lifestyle, and predict the relationship between such behaviour and their housing satisfaction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Propose directions for future studies on plans and guidelines to efficiently maintain and manage comfortable and pleasant indoor environments.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Towards this end, this study referred to precedent studies and research materials about indoor comfort and conducted surveys of apartment residents. The questionnaires were designed to be easily comprehensible for the respondents and to examine the residents’ satisfaction on the indoor comfort of the apartments. Evaluation items of the indoor comfort would encompass general conditions such as thermal, noise, light and air in both summer and winter seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11420120">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1420326X11420120">42</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11420120">Table 3</xref>). The survey questionnaire included questions on overall housing satisfaction, not to mention indoor comfort, in order to comprehensively address housing environmental quality. Five-point scale questionnaires were adopted to examine residents’ evaluations through their satisfaction levels about indoor comfort; “Not satisfied at all” = 1, “Generally not satisfied” = 2, “Neutral” = 3, “Generally satisfied” = 4 and “Highly satisfied” = 5. Furthermore, by reviewing precedent studies on factors affecting indoor environmental conditions, this study identified physical (facing direction, living floor, balcony and household location in the building), demographical (age, family composition, income level, sensitivity of indoor comfort and clothing amount), and psychological (levels of interest in indoor comfort, awareness of energy use and saving, recognition about indoor environment controllability, pride in one’s apartment unit, awareness of apartment maintenance and awareness of neighbour relationships) components. Finally, based on precedent studies and essay questionnaires, 29 items about residents’ adjusting behaviours were developed and analysed.</p>
<p>Subject apartments were selected from two different apartment complexes in Busan to effectively verify the assumption that both physical attributes and psychological factors could affect the residents’ perceived comfort levels. The questionnaire survey was distributed to the women residents in the two apartment complexes from December 20–30, 2010. A total of 182 out of 200 distributed (91.0%) were collected and analysed. The SPSS program was utilized to carry out <italic>t</italic>-test, ANOVA and multiple linear regression analyses of the survey results.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11420120"><title>General Description of Subjects’ Apartments and Respondents</title>
<p>The architectural blueprints of the subject apartments are as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11420120">Table 1</xref>. Both A and B complexes are located in the same area, and thus they have similar location, surroundings and climate. The subjects have similar physical conditions, such as floor area ratio, floors, accommodating households, building arrangement and facing directions. However, the two subject apartment complexes are different in their ages: A is 16 years old and B 5. Those apartments’ physical ages are reflected in the residents’ perceived deterioration levels of their apartments. That is, B residents did not consider their apartments deteriorated, while A resident did (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11420120">Table 2</xref>).

</p>
<p>According to demographic surveys shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11420120">Table 2</xref>, the wives are 46.1 years old on average, with B (45.2) lower than A (47.1) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Of the respondents, 57.8% are full-time housewives and 42.2% employed. The number of family members was 3.7 (SD = 0.8) on average and the average amount of clothing that families wear indoors in winter was 0.95 clothes.

<p>With respect to psychological characteristics, the wives’ awareness of energy use and saving (3.98 (0.73)) and their interest in the indoor comfort (3.85 (0.75)) were high.</p>
<p>With respect to housing characteristics, 50.5% of the A group said their houses face east, while the majority in B said their houses face south (76.0%) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.000); more B respondents (43.5%) said they had extended the balconies of their living rooms and/or bedrooms than residents in A (25.5%) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.000). Finally, their awareness of the deterioration of their apartments was A: 2.45 (0.77) and B: 3.49 (0.94), showing that A residents who lived in apartments 16 or more years old were more concerned about the deterioration of their apartment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.000). B apartment complex was relatively newly built, and its residents tended to be younger and high-income earners (monthly income of 5 million won or over), and there are more residents in this apartment complex who had extended their balconies.</p></sec>

<p>The indoor comfort was assessed by residents’ satisfaction levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11420120">Table 3</xref>). Subject residents presented a moderate satisfaction level about the overall indoor environment (OC), with the average of 3.12 (0.49).

<p>To demonstrate item by item, subjects rated heat, air and light conditions as moderate or better, while they were dissatisfied with noise conditions (SN1, SN2, SN3, WN2). Evaluations on the noise conditions showed significant differences between the two groups, where B residents showed dissatisfactions with water system/drainage noises and other daily noises (SN1, SN2, WN1, WN2).</p>
<p>Additionally, in the controllability questions, residents found most uncomfortable when they are not able to control noise conditions (37.0%), followed by air (35.4%), light (17.3%) and thermal (10.2%), showing that apartment dwellers are mostly sensitive to noise and air conditions. According to the precedent study in 1997, apartment residents were most dissatisfied with noise conditions of their apartments, and air and noise conditions were most influential when evaluating the comfort levels of indoor environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1420326X11420120">43</xref>]. Residents in the 15-year-or-older apartments were the least satisfied with noise conditions, demonstrating that it is urgent to improve noise conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11420120">26</xref>]. Considering that Korean apartment residents have consistently raised issues about the two conditions, further efforts in design as well as residents’ living management are called for to secure more pleasant noise and air conditions.</p>
<p>As stated above, subjects showed differences in their thoughts about the deterioration levels of their apartments. To be specific, A group said that their apartments were not well insulated and thus largely influenced by outside temperatures (3.58), and thought that their apartments were deteriorated (3.55). Nevertheless, A residents presented a higher satisfaction with the indoor comfort than B. This may be understood by that residents’ evaluation on indoor comfort levels was not simply about physical conditions or functions of a building, but about a mix of complex aspects, including psychological and behavioural factors.</p>
<p>In order to identify variables that could affect indoor environment evaluations, analyses were conducted after classifying them into architectural, demographical and psychological factors. Subjects’ satisfactions with SA2, SL1, WA2 and WL1 would differ depending on the floor on which they lived; those living in the lower floors (1st and 2nd floors) tended to be dissatisfied with ventilation, natural lighting and privacy protection conditions. In response to the questions about the directions which their apartment buildings faced, differences were found in the questions of ST2, SN2, WT1, WT2, WA1, WL1, WL2 and WL3. Those living in the eastward buildings were less satisfied with heat conditions in winter and sight conditions than those in southward ones. According to the location of their unit housings, they presented significant differences in noise conditions both in summer and winter (SN2, SN3, WN1, WN2 and WN3) and ventilation in winter (WV2). Those living in both ends of the apartment buildings were dissatisfied with noise and ventilation conditions, while those living in the middle tended to be satisfied. Balcony expansion could also have affected residents’ satisfaction with noise conditions both in summer and winter (SN1, SN2, WN1 and WN2) and indoor temperatures in winter (WT1). Those who expanded their balconies were dissatisfied with noise conditions, and less satisfied with the indoor temperatures and warmth in winter than their counterparts. This explains that balconies have an influence on the indoor comfort of apartments, such as blocking noises and saving heating bills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11420120">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11420120">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1420326X11420120">44</xref>].</p>
<p>With respect to the socio-demographic attributes, differences were found by subjects’ ages in the satisfaction levels of ventilation conditions in summer and winter (SA2, WA2), and light conditions (WL2). Overall, those in their 60s were most satisfied with all conditions and those in their 40s the most dissatisfied. In terms of monthly income levels, those with 5 million won or over rated the routine noise conditions (SN2, WN2), showing that they were the least satisfied.</p>
<p>Considering residents’ psychological aspects, differences were identified in 17 questions, except for ST2, SN3, WT2 in accordance with their awareness of energy consumption and saving. Those who are more concerned about energy saving at home were more satisfied with indoor environmental conditions in summer and winter. In Korean apartment complexes, when residents become more aware and enthusiastic about energy saving, they become more satisfied with their residential environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1420326X11420120">45</xref>]. Raising awareness of efficient energy use and energy saving not only enhances the comfort levels of indoor environment and overall housing satisfaction levels, but could also contribute to the national efforts of energy saving at a time when energy saving and management are at the centre of national interest. In regard to residents’ awareness about apartment maintenance and management, all questions delivered significant differences. This can be interpreted that residents’ satisfaction with apartment maintenance and management systems would be directly associated with their perceived comfort levels of indoor environment. Residents were more satisfied with indoor environment when they have more control over the environment, whereas they presented no significant difference pertaining to noise conditions (SN1, SN2, SN3, WN1, WN2 and WN3). This finding is in line with the result that residents had found it most difficult to actively control noise conditions (41.4%) among other components of indoor environment. Although residents have more control over the environment, they can hardly satisfy noise conditions by adjusting the behaviour. In addition, when residents have higher pride in their unit housings, they showed higher satisfactions in 17 questions, except for SN2, WN2 and WN3. Besides, in accordance with residents’ attitude towards their neighbours, significant differences were found in 16 questions, except ST1, ST2, SA1 and WT2. This demonstrates that residents who are more satisfied with their neighbours are more satisfied with their indoor environment.</p></sec>

</p>
<p>The beta-value of the regression analysis was construed as the weight of each factor. Accordingly, pride in one’s unit (<italic>β</italic> = 0.268), awareness of apartment’s maintenance and systems (<italic>β</italic> = 0.261), awareness of neighbour relationship (<italic>β</italic> = 0.245), location in building (<italic>β</italic> = 0.162) and balcony expansion (<italic>β</italic> = −0.152) were critical to residents’ satisfaction of indoor environment. To sum up, residents are satisfied more with their indoor environment when they are proud of their unit housing, when they are satisfied more with their neighbours and apartment complex maintenance conditions and when they did not extend their balconies and their unit housing is located in the middle of building.</p>
<p>The results show that residents’ evaluation on the indoor comfort would be influenced more by architectural and psychological attributes, such as awareness of maintenance and management conditions and their neighbours, than socio-demographical attributes, such as their sensitivity to indoor environment or the number of their family members. Therefore, in order to create healthy and comfortable indoor environments, two different stages come into play: the design stage for architectural attributes, or fairly fixed factors, and the usage stage for psychological attributes, or flexible factors. In the design stage, it may be considered to discriminately supplement insulation or soundproof materials according to the directions and/or locations of unit housings, or to arrange unit houses for better sight conditions. In the usage state, consideration should be given to specific measures that can enhance residents’ satisfaction with and pride in their apartments, such as invigorating residents’ interaction space and programmes, and establishing efficient maintenance and management systems that factor in residents’ routines and lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1420326X11420120">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11420120">47</xref>].</p>
<p>A positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.467) was found between residents’ perceived levels of indoor comfort and their evaluation on overall housing environment. Indoor comfort is verified to be a critical dimension to establishing a sustainable and healthy housing environment and enhancing residents’ satisfactions with housing environment, and thus residents’ psychological attributes should be given further consideration in designing a comfortable indoor environment.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X11420120"><title>Residents’ Adjusting Behaviours to Enhance Indoor Environmental Comfort</title>
<p>This study assumes that people could adapt their personal and/or environmental characteristics to suppress or diminish discomforting stimuli. This is derived from the adaptive principle that: “If a change in the thermal condition occurs, such as producing discomfort, people react in ways which tend to restore their comfort” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11420120">36</xref>]. Accordingly, residents adapt themselves to the indoor environment by adjusting behaviours such as opening windows, adjusting blinds, switching lights, controlling the heating, cooling and ventilating equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11420120">37</xref>]. Residents typically adopt different behaviours when adjusting to their indoor environments; these behaviours could also affect their degree of stimuli acceptance. Residents’ behavioural adjustment and psychological adaptation to indoor environment are important for their comfort and satisfaction levels. Therefore, this study had intended to identify residents’ adjusting behaviours to enhance the comfort and satisfaction levels of their indoor environments in Korean apartments.</p>
<p>To this end, by reviewing precedent studies, users’ adjusting behaviours were identified and sometimes modified if the behaviour occurred in the non-residential space, and finally 11 factors were derived. Considering that such behaviour could differ depending on the group or culture they belong to, an essay-questionnaire survey was conducted to understand residents’ adjusting behaviours in Korean apartments. For this preliminary survey, 100 students and their family were randomly chosen from Pusan National University. The open questions were “Is your family satisfied with the indoor environment that you live in?” and “What are you doing to adapt yourselves to the indoor environment or to enhance your comfort level at home?” The subjects were allowed to describe their ideas at their disposal, and the contents analysis method for answers was used. The contents analysis process was based on the words and phrases in the description that imply adjusting behaviours. In this study, 34 items were identified by drawing words and phrases that explain their adjusting behaviours to enhance comfort levels, or in case different words and phrases imply the same meaning, they were re-organized into a group. Through this process, 29 adjusting behaviours were identified, eliminating duplicated items out of the total 45 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11420120">Table 5</xref>).

<p>Looking into the adjusting behaviours drawn from the open questions, apartment residents tend to do something about thermal conditions, such as using heating systems, installing chassis films, opening windows and wearing more/less clothes. They found that noise conditions (40.2%) were the most difficult to control among four conditions, followed by air (27.6%), light (20.5%) and thermal (11.8%), implying that they tend to show more adjusting behaviours related to thermal conditions since they assume it can be more easily controllable than others.</p>
<p>Besides, although they considered noise conditions hard to control, they still showed adjusting behaviours, such as restraining noise-making behaviours, closing windows, furniture arrangement and installing finishing materials to reduce noise. Residents were also sensitive to air conditions, and accordingly showed adjusting behaviours, like indoor gardening, using air purifiers, operating ventilation systems and installing eco-friendly finishing materials.</p>
<p>The adjusting behaviours identified in the primary research were empirically examined by surveys. The questionnaire was designed based on a 5-point scale; 1 = not at all, 2 = hardly, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often and 5 = very frequently/always (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11420120">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the survey results, adjusting behaviours which frequently appeared are “(B29) trying to refrain from noise-inducing behaviours,” “(B4) opening the windows and trying to cool down the inside temperatures in summer,” “(B20) keeping plant at home to improve the inside air quality,” “(B12) opening the curtains and receiving sunlight in winter due to the short daytime,” “(B2) trying to use less heat-generating electronic devices in winter,” “(B6) always turning on the heating system (boiler) in winter,” “(B9) mostly heating in frequently used rooms in winter by controlling the individual heating system,” “(B14) not expanding the balcony to keep a better indoor environment,” “(B15) drawing the curtains in summer to block heat,” “(B21) controlling the inside humidity by hanging washed clothes inside to dry,” “(B19) installing lighting fixtures that are fit to the usage of each room in order to improve the indoor visual condition” and “(B28) mostly keeping the windows closed to block outside noise.”</p>
<p>As the item (B29) is an agreed-upon rule between residents in the high-rise high-density Korean apartments in order to minimize and/or block routine noise, noise-minimizing/blocking behaviours, like the items (B29) and (B28) appeared most frequently. However, residents considered noise as the most sensitive but uncontrollable condition, and this was in line with the dissatisfaction level stated above. Therefore, the apartments should be designed to improve the noise conditions, and develop guidelines for residents so that they can be more proactive to manage noise. Curtains and blinds were used to control the heat environment more often than to protect privacy. Apartment residents felt solidarity (we-ness) with other residents. They were open to their neighbours, not very sensitive about privacy matters, and accordingly less likely to use curtains and/or blinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1420326X11420120">48</xref>]. In winter, most residents turned on the heating, and the heating was concentrated in the rooms that they most often use for the sake of heating efficiency and energy saving. This demonstrates the importance of individual heating control systems and pleasant heating environment. To handle the dry indoor condition in winter, they tended to hang laundry inside rather than use humidifiers or other electronic equipment. Despite new washing machines that come with dryer features, residents were shown to prefer natural drying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1420326X11420120">49</xref>]. By hanging laundry indoors, not at the balcony, in winter, they try to adjust the dry air at home. Balconies in the Korean apartments were used for multiple occasions, including laundry dry space, supplementary kitchen in accordance with the Korean dining culture and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1420326X11420120">50</xref>]. Recently, apartment residents have altered balconies into part of their indoor space, showing the changes in the function of balcony. Meantime, some other residents decided not to expand or alter balconies so that they can better block outside noise or heat loss, and they used balconies to control the indoor comfort levels, such as pouring water on the balcony to cool down the temperatures in summer. Furthermore, those who had not expanded balconies delivered higher satisfaction with noise and heat environments. Therefore, there should be guidelines for balcony functions and the efficient usage could serve to control the indoor comfort level.</p>
<p>In regard to the items that delivered differences between the two groups, A residents tended to film-coat on the windows and open the front doors to control indoor temperatures in summer, wear more clothes, heat the frequently used rooms intensively and utilize insulation materials like sealing strips. They were more likely to use porches to adjust to hot weather, as less of A group had expanded their porches. It was also found that A residents tended to spend more time outside rather than avoiding unpleasant weather, i.e. hot and cold weathers, at home and doing adjusting behaviours. In terms of the adjusting behaviours to noise conditions, A group was more active than their counterparts. For example, they placed big furniture close to the windows and used soundproof materials to block noises.</p>
<p>Overall, residents in the A apartments showed adjusting behaviours pertaining to indoor environment more actively and frequently than those in B. Although A residents recognize more deterioration in their apartment and the insulation performances, they presented more adjusting behaviours regarding indoor environment and higher comfort levels of indoor environment. In addition, the two groups show no significant difference in overall housing satisfaction, and moderate satisfaction with the average of 3.50 (0.64) with A 3.50 (0.63) and B 3.50 (0.65). As explained by psychological and behavioural adjusting mechanisms, residents perceive given environmental conditions, and make adjusting behaviours and psychological adaptation, so that they can minimize, or at least reduce, environmental discomfort, and maintain their satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>In the residential space, residents have more opportunities to actively change or modify their environment than in other places, and accordingly would satisfy themselves to a certain degree by adjusting the indoor environments. Unlike previous apartment plans and management guidelines that have focused on experts on apartment designs and facilities, this study is more resident-oriented, focusing on residents’ adjusting behaviours to improve their comfort levels, and thus provide practical data for establishing plans and guidelines for efficient indoor environment management. Follow-up studies are also called for to examine residents’ perception of housing environments and their adjusting behaviours in response to the changes in the housing environment and residents’ living culture.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11420120" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study attempted to find efficient measures to improve the indoor comfort levels based on the understanding of indoor comfort characteristics in housing cultural perspective, in order to establish a sustainable and healthy housing environment. To this end, this study specifically examined the indoor comfort levels of their apartment by evaluating residents’ satisfaction and residents’ adjusting behaviours to enhance indoor comfort levels based on the apartment environment and living culture of Korea.</p>
<p>The following conclusions are derived from the findings of this study:
<list id="list1-1420326X11420120" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Residents were satisfied with thermal, air and light conditions, while resident were not satisfied with noise condition. They were most sensitive about noise condition consistently and tended to consider noise conditions hard to control, which demonstrates the needs for continuous architectural and managerial efforts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The indoor comfort is a critical dimension to the quality of housing environment, and thus it is required to consider architectural conditions that affect indoor comfort levels, such as building arrangement, facilities and balcony, when designing apartments. The indoor comfort level would be affected by not simply the architectural conditions or performance of a building but also psychological factors. It is necessary to fully understand the residents’ psychological and behavioural aspects in order to find more resident-friendly alternatives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In particular, residents turned out to recognize physical performance of their apartments, and to reduce discomfort levels and to maintain or improve their satisfaction with the indoor environment through adjusting behaviours. Therefore, qualitative studies are called for to establish the optimal range of indoor comfort levels and to plan a healthy housing environment.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>This study is meaningful to understand residents’ behaviours in relation to housing culture for improvement of indoor comfort. Residents’ adjusting behaviours would serve as concrete and effective information to improve indoor comfort levels and reduce energy consumption at home. Also, the results could serve as a useful reference to establish management guidelines for enhancing the indoor comfort and residential satisfaction, and contribute to designing a healthy housing environment based on the user-oriented approach.</p></sec></body>
