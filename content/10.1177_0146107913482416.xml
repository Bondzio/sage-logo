<abstract>
<p>The role of warfare in the life of the Christian is a debated topic. Typically, one wonders if the Christian <italic>can</italic> participate in warfare, but perhaps the question is more appropriately <italic>should</italic> the Christian do so? In this article I hope to demonstrate the role of conflict in the Bible and two distinctions: the difference between God as warrior and humans as warriors, and the difference between God's enemies and human enemies. For instance, God is presented positively as a warrior, but human warfare is condoned only if God sanctions it. God's enemies are those opposed to God's purpose, whereas human conflicts are often fought according to human purposes. Warfare is traced through Scripture, and several hermeneutical approaches to warfare are discussed and evaluated. It appears that God's overall conflict with Satan and evil should be the basis for any conflict—especially conflict undertaken in the name of God.</p>

<p><italic>“What a cruel thing war is … to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors.”</italic></p>

</disp-quote>
<p>For millennia, blood has been spilt in the name of God. Is this also in the spirit of God? The Bible contains no direct commands about the Christian's role in war and violence, and what remains is often interpreted in <italic>very</italic> different ways. The role of war in God's mission with his people is complex, but perhaps a plausible interpretation is obtainable. In this article I hope to demonstrate that, with a view to restoring justice and peace, both temporally and eternally, God is a warrior who destroys his spiritual and physical enemies, on occasion with the help of appointed human agents. The organization will follow both canonical and thematic structures: beginning with God as a warrior, then discussing the presence of warfare in the Old Testament, hermeneutical approaches often employed by those discussing warfare as related to the New Testament, and finally Jesus as warrior, as seen in Revelation.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146107913482416">
<title>God as Warrior</title>
<p>God is not only <italic>a</italic> warrior, but also <italic>the ideal</italic> warrior. Scripture describes God as one who acts in history as an advocate for his people, ultimately for the fulfillment of his purposes. The first two chapters of the Bible are free from conflict, but at the dawn of the third chapter, God's archrival appears. This rival interrupts the peace and order of the garden, and he introduces doubt, sin, and shame. It is God's war with this Adversary that sets the stage for all subsequent conflict, and it is due to this Adversary that God must fight at all. Thus, any proper discussion of warfare will adequately treat the tension between human and spiritual conflict and keep in mind that all conflict is invariably spiritual, as it derives from and delights the Adversary. As God fights and as humans fight on his behalf, one ought always to recall that these are in response to the first conflict that destroyed the intended created order.</p>
<p>While the ultimate battle is spiritual and cosmic in scope, God does enter human history as a warrior. At the Exodus, Moses explains, “The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent” (Exod 14:14). Later, the Ark of the Covenant was a symbol of God's presence that was commanded to be taken into battle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146107913482416">Longman 2001</xref>). Isaiah cries out, “The Lord goes out like a mighty man, like a <italic>man of war</italic> he stirs up his zeal” (42:13, emphasis added). There are also several miraculous stories of God aiding his people to destroy their enemies, for instance, the battle of Jericho (Josh 6), which was won by marching and trumpeting. In Exodus 17, when the Amalekites attack, the Israelites have the upper hand only as long as Moses keeps his arms raised. After these battles, it is not the violence about which they rejoice, but the work of God.</p>
<p>Some have posited that in discussions of warfare and violence in the Bible, the relationship between the Old and New Testaments poses the greatest issue (Swartley: 196), but as Longman notes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The God of the Old Testament is not a different God from the God we encounter in the New Testament. Nor did God change his mind. The war [in the OT] was simply an earlier phase of the battle that comes to its climax on the cross and its completion at the final judgment” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146107913482416">Longman 2003</xref>: 184–85].</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>So the question is not: Is God a warrior? That is clear. It is more appropriately: Are humans permitted (or even encouraged) to be warriors? The interpretive issue to discuss is whether it is feasible that God operates within a different ethical framework than humans.</p>
<p>One possible clue could come from the designation “man of war” (<italic>îs milḥāmá</italic>), also translated as “warrior” (Durham; Stuart; Cole), which describes both God and humans within Scripture. Of God, the title is used in praise, as in the Song of Moses (Exod 15:3; cf. Isa 42:13 above). Of humans, it is used three times without commentary (Josh 17:1; 1 Sam 16:18, 17:33), but the final description of David as a “warrior” occurs in 1 Chronicles 28:3, “But God said to me, You may not build a house for my name, for you are a <italic>man of war</italic> and have shed blood'” (emphasis added). Some have argued that this refers to the plague that follows David's condemned census (Kelly; Dirksen), which is plausible. The other possibility is his militaristic conquests. If this is the case, it is important to note that this statement does not condemn David, who was a “man after God's own heart” (1 Sam 13:14; cf. Acts 13:22), even after shedding blood, but it does exclude him from the full privileges of the covenant provided in 1 Chronicles 22:8–9 (cf. 2 Sam 7; Thompson; Wright; McKenzie). Though some might argue that this interpretation is problematic because Solomon was also a violent king, the Chronicler omits Solomon's violent actions in 1 Kings 2:13–46, perhaps to maintain his suitability for building the temple (Dirksen).</p>
<p>If David's excessive participation in war is what disqualifies him from building the temple, then shedding blood is not the ideal, and thus God does indeed operate within a different ethical framework than humans. His ability to perfectly discern and his perfect justice make him solely appropriate as one who takes life.</p>

<sec id="section2-0146107913482416">
<title>Humans as Warriors in the Old Testament</title>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles and the Geneva Convention are modern documents that provide the standards of respectable behavior of nations at war. Deuteronomy 20 outlines the principles for war within the land of Israel, which are very different from modern sentiments, but before the principles for individuals are outlined, God's status as the ideal or ultimate warrior is reiterated (20:1, 4; cf. Ps 23:8). After this statement, the individual provisions are even more surprising because they not only differ from current ideals for soldiers in the modern era, but also allow for the unfortunate reality that some will still question <sc>yhwh</sc>'s ability to fight for them. For instance, <sc>yhwh</sc> commands the officers to ask the question, “Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his fellows melt like his own” (20:8). No punishment follows this retreat. This does demonstrate the strength of <sc>yhwh</sc>, who can wage war with very few (or no) soldiers and be victorious (cf. Judg 6–7), but it does not diminish the provisions that allow these men to abstain from battle. War is for those made of sterner stuff. It is also considered reasonable for a man who has built a new house, not enjoyed the fruit of his vineyard, or consummated his marriage to retreat; thus, God provides several exceptions to the command for individual participation in warfare.</p>
<p>With these provisions in place, it could be argued that war is not the ideal, which is certainly the case, yet it is an unfortunate inevitability after conflict is introduced into the world. For the Israelites, participation in war was holy or just <italic>if</italic> <sc>yhwh</sc> sanctioned it. This is the case with <italic>hërem</italic> and with the ultimate resolution of conflict in Revelation (see below for discussions of both). While this <italic>might</italic> appear to contradict the above discussion about shedding blood not being ideal for humans, but only for God, it does not. With <italic>ḥērem</italic> (and the conflict in Revelation), God is the initiator and overseer of the conflict through the instructions and provisions in the Law (Deut 7); the humans are mere instruments. God is wholly loving, wholly just, and all-knowing, which allows him the unique ability to judge the Canaanites (conversation with Younger 2013).</p>
<p>Additionally, a discussion of the unifying characteristics found in Israel's wars in the Pentateuch is helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146107913482416">Emery 2003</xref>). Unfortunately, other than the principles discussed in Deuteronomy 20, there is no indication as to whether these are descriptive or prescriptive, but the narrative appears to view these battles favorably. One characteristic is that the wars are almost entirely defensive. The war with the Amalekites (Exod 17:8–13), the wars from Arad to Bashan (Num 21–25), and other conflicts in the Pentateuch are all accounts of other groups attacking Israel; thus the Canaanites (Num 14) are the only group that Israel outwardly attacks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146107913482416">
<title>War in the Pentateuch</title>
<p>Most of the principles provided for warfare in the OT seem reasonable, and a majority provides more grace and/or leniency for the enemy, except one: <italic>ḥērem.</italic> To understand the command given by <sc>yhwh</sc>, it is necessary first to determine the meaning of this lexical root. At its most basic level, it appears that <italic>ḥērem</italic> signifies something that is dedicated or devoted to God. The connotation (i.e., whether it is a dedication for praise or a dedication to destruction) is determined by the context of the occurrence. For instance, Leviticus 27:21 states that a field released at jubilee “shall be a holy gift to the <sc>lord</sc>” like one “that has been devoted.” There is nothing negative in this passage about the gift. Other instances of <italic>ḥērem</italic> describe something being dedicated to God without implying destruction (e.g., Lev 27:28; Deut 13:18; Josh 7:1, 7:11, 7:13, Josh 7:15, Josh 22:20, Micah 4:13, 1 Chron 2:7); likewise, some things are dedicated to members of the Levitical Priesthood (e.g., Num 18:14; Ezek 44:29).</p>
<p>Even with those occurrences that imply destruction, dedication to God is still the sense portrayed; thus “every context in which the term is used … carries a religious connotation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146107913482416">Emery 1990</xref>: 51). The interplay between what could be deemed the positive (i.e., dedication without destruction) and the negative (i.e., dedication with destruction) instances of <italic>ḥērem</italic> can be seen clearly in Joshua 7:11–15 where Achan steals from among the “spoils.” Achan's failure to provide adequate sacrifice to God has rendered him the necessary sacrifice.</p>
<p>A majority of translators choose to render <italic>ḥērem</italic> as “ban” or consider it to connote a “curse,” but these renderings do not take into account the broader meaning. The sense of the word discussed above could be a development of a metaphorical interpretation of the other meaning of the noun, “net.” “The ‘divine net’ in the hand of <sc>yhwh</sc> or used by others at his behest is a symbol of power and sovereignty” (Giesen: 202). Those things that are devoted have been collected into his net.</p>
<p>Especially during the conquest, <sc>yhwh</sc>'s net included many nations. In Deuteronomy, <italic>ḥērem</italic> is the means by which right worship of God, the great provider of the land, is obtained. It is a means of judgment and expulsion of the nations who inhabited the land and included “any individual or party that deviated from this monolatry to worship other gods [who] would be considered traitors and be subject to the same removal as the nations that once stood in the way of Israel's full possession of its territory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146107913482416">Emery 2003</xref>: 384).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146107913482416">
<title>War in the Historical Books</title>
<p>In the Historical Books, the acquisition of the land furthers the need for a rigorous practice of <italic>ḥērem.</italic> The special emphasis at the time of Joshua was that Israel was to keep itself undefiled, and the land itself was to be undefiled” (Howard: 109). In this book, there are two stories that create tension in the overall scheme of <italic>ḥērem.</italic> The first, the story of Achan's sin (mentioned above), demonstrates that destruction will come to <italic>anyone</italic> who outwardly disobeys God's commands to remain pure in worship, whether he is an Israelite or not.</p>
<p>The second is the story of Rahab. Though God says, “No one devoted, who is to be devoted for destruction from mankind, shall be ransomed” (Lev 27:29), Rahab is able to escape this fate. This juxtaposition of a “trusting Canaanite” with “a rebellious native son” demonstrates that what “truly counts with God is submission to his will” (Hubbard: 129).</p>
<p>The concept of <italic>ḥērem</italic> is also essential to the book of Judges, particularly because the downward spiral portrayed by the narrator often is linked to the Israelites' failure to destroy the religious influence of the Canaanites. The Canaanites are wicked in the eyes of <sc>yhwh</sc> (Deut 9:4), but they still come into contact with his slow anger. The first indication of their future wickedness is in the Curse of Ham (Gen 9:25–27; Merrill). Later, when God re-articulates his promise to Abraham, he makes clear that this punishment does not come until the people truly deserve their lot (Gen 15:16; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146107913482416">Longman 2003</xref>). When his judgment finally occurs, God commands this destruction to punish the Canaanites, as well as protection for the Israelites (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146107913482416">Younger 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Some have argued from Joshua and Judges—the latter with the most occurrences of <italic>ḥērem</italic>—that God's command is genocide, but this group was not ethnically homogenous (Tsumura: 124) and “the <italic>ḥērem</italic> was not designed by God to eliminate the Canaanite culture per se but to eliminate the Canaanite religious influence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146107913482416">Younger 2002</xref>: 76; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146107913482416">Younger 2012</xref>). This clarification excludes a justification for genocide <italic>and</italic> for the imposition of one's culture on a recently evangelized or conquered area. This people is dedicated for destruction because they would “pollute” the Israelites with their idolatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146107913482416">Longman 2003</xref>; Merrill).</p>
<p>Later, in the Historical Books, the model of God as warrior, particularly Israel's warrior, continues. In 1 Samuel 7, he “thundered with a mighty sound” against the Philistines and desolates them. God's military function works because the nation is a theocracy (Merill). This shifts in the Historical Books when the people cry out for a king. In 1 Samuel 8, just one chapter after God's great victory on their behalf, the Israelites demand a king who will “go out before [them] and fight [their] battles” (8:20). This betrayal disconnects Israel from the protection of God—not because God lacks patience, but because that's exactly what they requested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0146107913482416">
<title>War in the Prophets</title>
<p>In Tremper Longman III's schema for war in the Bible, he describes five phases of development. This model is very helpful, but unfortunately it does not take into account the spiritual conflict underlying the physical conflict depicted in the Old Testament. The first phase, “God fights the flesh-and-blood enemies of his people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146107913482416">Longman 2001</xref>: 837), describes the Pentateuch and overlaps some in the Historical Books with the second phase, “God fights against Israel.” This phase continues through the pre-exilic prophets that culminates in the destruction of the temple (838). Then, the next phase begins: “God, the future warrior.” This phase of salvation history focuses on the great hope of the Messiah, but in addition to that, it is also the hope that <sc>yhwh</sc> will again fight the battles of Israel. Someday their desolation will be avenged by the Great Warrior. The prophetic books are also pivotal because in many ways, their focus shifts from physical to eschatological warfare; “Though it is not a main theme, the Old Testament prophets sometimes draw the curtains back and allow the reader to see the spiritual battle that has been waged throughout history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146107913482416">Longman 2003</xref>: 187), and “God's dealings with the nations in eschatological times are decidedly militaristic in flavor” (Merrill: 73).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146107913482416">
<title>Common Hermeneutical Approaches to Treating Warfare</title>
<p>The final two phases of Longman's schema occur in the New Testament. The fourth is “Jesus Christ, the divine warrior.” Longman, as well as others, assert that the coming of the Messiah changes altogether the way that war is fought. “Jesus fights the battle with spiritual weapons, not with physical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146107913482416">Longman 2001</xref>: 839; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146107913482416">Younger 2002</xref>). For evidence he cites these three points:</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482416" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the lack of force on Jesus' part at his arrest,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Paul's view of the cross as warfare (Col 2:15), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the Armor of God (Eph 6:10–20)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Unfortunately, these passages are often not those debated when discussing an ethic of warfare in the New Testament, but they demonstrate the concerns of the biblical authors.</p>
<p>Other passages that are often ignored in this discussion can also provide helpful principles. For instance, just as Jesus tells his followers not to worry about their earthly treasures or provision (Matt 6:19–34), perhaps they also ought not worry about their earthly protection. Jesus also explicitly speaks to this later in Matthew: “Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matt 10:28–29).</p>
<p>These passages in Matthew do not diminish the pain and horror that this current age allows, but they demonstrate the relative importance of the spiritual treasure, provision, and protection offered by God to those aligned with him. In the passages cited above, a well-reasoned exegesis makes this even clearer. For instance, in Colossians 2, Paul cites several accomplishments of Jesus' work on humans' behalf, ending with the literal and metaphorical <italic>coup de grâce</italic> for his opponents, the cross. But Paul does not end the argument there. He then states that this victory affords believers the ability to shed earthly conflict. While the conflict over festivals and other regulations may have been free from physical conflict, it still demonstrates a principle of transcendence, particularly since Paul then begins his discourse calling them to “seek the things that are above” (3:1).</p>
<p>In Ephesians, Paul is more explicit about the nature of the fight. He says,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places [6:11–12].</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Christians have been given much more efficient weapons than swords or guns, as Origen says:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We by our prayers vanquish all demons who stir up war, and lead to the violation of oaths, and disturb the peace … in this way [we] are much more helpful to the kings than those who go into the field to fight for them. And we do take our part in public affairs, when along with righteous prayers we join self-denying exercises and meditations, which teach us to despise pleasures, and not to be led away by them. And none fight better for the king than we do (Roberts <italic>et al.</italic>: 668).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Therefore, an eschatological or spiritual interpretation does not discount Jesus as the Divine Warrior, but it commands attention to the Enemy who lies behind every atrocious deed, genocide, racism, natural disasters, and ultimately death for every person who has walked the earth. Jesus <italic>is</italic> the ultimate warrior because he fights the ultimate enemy and conquers him, not through the death of others, but by his own death and sacrifice (cf. Isa 53).</p>
<p>To discuss the contemporary perspectives on this issue, it is necessary to discuss the major interpretive methods employed by New Testament exegetes, rather than walk through debated passages. This is due to the relatively consistent nature of arguments for each. On the one hand, those who hold that Christians may participate in war take these passages more literally. According to them, the passages above and the many others describing violence are Jesus' “endorsement” of war (Swartley). Pacifist interpreters, however, would argue that any mentions of weapons, warfare, battles, etc., are either figurative or eschatological depending on the context. For instance, Matthew 10:34–36 would not be a call to war, but instead a description of the nature of the gospel, which reorients the world in front of the text—that of its recipients. Jesus' message creates division because it is contrary to the nature of the world into which it enters (cf. above).</p>
<p>Another debated example is a passage <italic>usually</italic> championed by proponents of war, Luke 22:36–38, where Jesus tells his disciples to make sure they have a sword. This is used by those advocating participation in war to show Jesus' support, but when some exclaim their readiness with “two swords,” Jesus responds curiously with “It is enough.” I. Howard Marshall states, The saying in Luke 22:36 is grimly ironic and was never meant to be taken literally, as verse 38 shows” (Marshall: 549).</p>
<p>The teachings of Jesus provide the most ambiguity regarding war because interpreters have erred in two major ways on both sides of the issue:</p>
<list id="list1-0146107913482416" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>arguments from silence, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>failure to maintain a balance between a present and an eschatological reality (see above).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The major argument from silence for pacifists is, of course, the lack of a direct command for war (excluding parables and more veiled phrases). To this can be added the fact that there is no example of war or violence committed or commanded by Jesus. The latter issue, a lack of example, could be explained by Jesus' obedience to the Father. He knew that he must die, and thus violence in this instance was not an option. This accounts for Jesus' rebuke of Peter for attacking Malchus (John 18:10–11), as he cites God's will in telling Peter to withdraw.</p>
<p>The arguments from silence for just war theorists or proponents of Christian participation in war generally revolve around a lack of condemnation from Jesus and his followers to the soldiers they encountered. For instance, Luke 3:14 recalls the soldiers asking John the Baptist what to do now that they have believed. He exhorts them to fulfill their duties without coercion (Swartley), but he does not commend their duties.</p>
<p>Another argument from silence would be that there is no explicit call to reject violence and warfare. Jesus calls for individual nonviolence or non-retaliatory efforts, but can this be translated to warfare? While it may seem foolish to recount what Jesus <italic>does not</italic> teach, the fallacious construction of arguments by pacifists <italic>and</italic> proponents of Christian participation in war renders this necessary.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one clear statement by Jesus regarding participation in war is found in the Beatitudes: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God (Matt 5:9, NIV). This, coupled with Jesus' explicit teaching about turning the other cheek (5:38–42) and love for enemies (5:43–48) makes a much stronger case for a pacifist interpretation of Scripture.</p>
<p>With Paul and the other New Testament writers, another interpretive issue surfaces: submission to governmental authority. Some argue that this submission means active engagement in warfare, but this assertion is certainly not necessary and very likely irresponsible. There is another context in Scripture that very clearly demonstrates disobedience to the governing authorities to save lives: Exodus 1, about the Hebrew midwives. This argument (submission to government) is the least strong of any for Christian participation in war because it necessitates circular reasoning and another argument from silence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0146107913482416">
<title>Jesus as Warrior—Revelation: The Last Battle</title>
<p>The picture of Jesus in Revelation is the Lamb who was slain, as well as the great triumphant warrior. In Revelation 19, a particularly gruesome depiction of Jesus emerges, as covered in the blood of those he is about to fight. This violent imagery has led many to argue for Christian participation in war based on Revelation alone. This, however, is the culmination of the eschatological interpretations presented in the earlier New Testament writings.</p>
<p>Revelation begins the final phase of Longman's schema, which is entitled “Jesus, the future warrior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146107913482416">Longman 2001</xref>: 839). In many ways, this phase is a return to the first phase, “God fights the flesh-and-blood enemies of his people”; except now, God fights all of his remaining enemies with the help of the saints. What the modern interpreter must keep in mind is the context of this war. It is God's ultimate desolation of evil, not a skirmish over land or goods. This, like the wars in the Old Testament, has a clear commander: God.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146107913482416" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The issue of war is difficult as the results of either position render some as “collateral damage.” Participation in war implies obvious detriment to the opponents, but pacifism also might render some helpless without a physical protector in this age. The tension between the present reality of conflict and pain and the eschatological vindication of all those in Christ Jesus can be difficult to reconcile. Truly, “only the first two chapters of the Bible (creation) and the last two (re-creation) fall outside the long period of human conflict” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146107913482416">Longman 2001</xref>: 835). Thankfully, some day believers can look forward to a day when the idyllic peace found in the garden returns to the city.</p>
