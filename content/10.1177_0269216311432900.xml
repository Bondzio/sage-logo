<abstract>
<p>We present the case of a 30-year-old patient with pontine glioblastoma multiforme, World Health Organisation grade IV (WHO IV). This case is of particular interest in terms of the patient’s use of social media as a medium of expression. This popular form of communication raises important clinical, ethical and social issues relating to confidentiality and the nature of the physician–patient relationship in a unique context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Blogs are the main contributors to the large number of new websites created each year. They are part of the whole new generation of Internet services, commonly referred to as social media, The term ‘blog’, a contraction of the words ‘web’ and ‘log’, came into common usage in the late 1990s and fundamentally describes a form of online diary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311432900">1</xref></sup> Posts are displayed in reverse chronological order and one may additionally engage in real-time conversations with other users who are online concurrently. The medical blogosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311432900">2</xref></sup> is populated by a whole host of personalities with the main aim being to express oneself creatively, share experiences, impart knowledge and ultimately influence how others think.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311432900">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311432900">4</xref></sup> Information is continually requested, consumed and reinterpreted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311432900">5</xref></sup> It features a highly connected digital network of medical commentary that is freely accessible but unedited. The system is devoid of safeguards in relation to the quality or accuracy of information provided. This increasingly popular tool has enormous potential, but is clearly not without substantial risk.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>A 30-year-old retail manager was admitted to the Specialist Palliative Care Service with an 8-month history of pontine glioma (WHO IV). He was previously under the care of the Neurosugical and Oncology Services. He initially presented with headache, ataxia and neck stiffness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated a space occupying lesion within the brain stem. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a glioma (WHO IV). Surgical intervention was not feasible. Despite chemo-radiation, there was evident clinical and radiological progression of his disease. On admission to the Specialist Palliative Care Inpatient Unit (hospice), he had a complete right hemiplegia, an evolving left hemiplegia and was anarthric. Communication with staff was by means of the notepad function of his iPad, accessed with his non-dominant left hand. He also used his iPad to update his blog. Fortunately the motor function of his left hand allowed him to communicate when all other avenues were lost. This was a form of communication that was a new concept for many staff members and certainly one which few had encountered in clinical practice. It chronicled his experiences from the day of diagnosis and contained images of the procedures that he underwent from stereotactic biopsy to intravenous line insertion. He updated the blog on an almost daily basis, describing in detail, both his physical and psychological status. The blog also contained messages of support from others with similar diagnoses. They shared intimate accounts of meetings with physicians and of procedures experienced along the way.</p>
<p>Our patient used his blog to express considerable existential distress. He felt cheated of the life that he was destined to live. The fact that he could no longer hold his 1-year-old son was dreadful to him. He saw little meaning in his suffering. This search for meaning permeated clinical encounters.</p>
<p>The blog also reflected his determination to fight. Often the sense of frustration communicated was directed at the medical community.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the blog attracted local media interest and hospice care became the subject of debate on a local radio station. From a family perspective, this conversation was particularly unwelcome and distressing, not least because of a perceived invasion of privacy and distortion of the truth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311432900" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case is noteworthy for a variety of reasons. It brought hospice staff into unfamiliar territory. It challenged us to consider social media as a method of communication in life-limiting illness. This new communication network included the patient, family and hospice staff, but in addition, was freely accessible to other patients, casual bloggers, and even a local radio talk-show host and his listenership, adding a new dimension to the traditionally private clinical relationship between patient and doctor.</p>
<p>It provided a rare insight into the patient’s perception of hospice care. In one entry the patient noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I don’t know what the idea of this hospice is? This place isn’t a hospital so I don’t know what it’s supposed to be??? I hope I get better soon.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In some respects, perhaps the relative anonymity of the blog allowed the patient to more freely express his true feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>The blog provided us with a fascinating account of each stage of illness. Not only was each encounter and intervention described, but we also gained rare insights into his emotional and spiritual journey. We saw how he perceived every aspect of his illness. Through the medium of poetry and song lyrics he described his situation in detail rarely encountered in clinical practice. In one very telling illustration he depicted a radiotherapy mask in the style worn by gladiators descending into battle and under it were the words ‘This time it’s war’.</p>
<p>In completing the blog, the patient drew comfort from the fact that he was leaving a lasting legacy for his family and friends. He postulated that it would allow his son to get to know him. He believed that the blog would encapsulate his spirit in the event of his demise. His family felt an enormous sense of pride that he was reaching out to other cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p>The primacy of patient-centred care and patient autonomy is enshrined in the Irish Medical Council’s guide to ethical conduct and behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311432900">6</xref></sup> It aims to safeguard the public by ensuring the quality of the doctors’ competence, behaviours and relationships that underlie his/her professionalism. Blogs may portray doctors accurately or inaccurately, without any recourse to reply. Do doctors have the right to edit or respond if they feel unjustly represented? Equally, institutions may feel that they are unfairly or inaccurately portrayed. Do they have any real right of reply?</p>
<p>In this case the blog did start a debate on a local radio station where manifestly existential distress was represented as uncontrolled physical pain. The subsequent radio debate included a call for the legalisation of cannabis. This caused tremendous embarrassment to the patient’s family.</p>
<p>Blogging is already a popular phenomenon in neonatal and paediatric practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311432900">7</xref></sup> and is expected to gain momentum in palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311432900">8</xref></sup> The end of life is a time of emotional shifts. For example our patient engaged and disengaged with his illness in a pendulous fashion from day to day. One day he would plan his funeral, the following day he would request transfer to the acute hospital for further chemotherapy. His published thoughts were captured in real time.</p>
<p>Electronic dissemination of these records is likely to become the social norm. Are we ready?</p>
