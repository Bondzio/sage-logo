<abstract>
<p>Drawing upon indigenous Chinese models, perspectives and concepts, the article proposes an idealised model of harmonious leadership that is grounded in the concepts of <italic>Tao</italic> (way), <italic>Te</italic> (power) and <italic>Ho</italic> (harmony). Various approaches to modelling Chinese leadership are reviewed and four major impediments that have handicapped this work are identified. In an effort to overcome these impediments, the authors suggest the use of the hermeneutic method as a means of engaging more deeply with the Chinese leadership literature. Guided by this hermeneutic reading, a holistic model of harmonious leadership conforming to the ideals of Tao is formulated that can be subjected to further theoretical and empirical refinement.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742715012444054" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the impressive plethora of scholarly inquiries into the phenomenon, we are still no closer to a consensus on ‘what’ indeed leadership is; we continually rediscover that leadership is still something that means different things to different people. Grint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012444054">2005</xref>) has suggested that this is an inevitable and even desirable state: leadership should remain an essentially contested concept. There is, however, increasing consensus around the importance of context to our understanding of what leadership is. The where and the when of leadership affect how it is done and for what purposes; leadership does not occur in a vacuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715012444054">Jackson and Parry, 2008</xref>: 61).</p>
<p>A study of the context that is the nexus of leadership and culture is one of the most intellectually challenging and endlessly fascinating avenues of inquiry for both leadership scholars and practitioners. For Jackson and Parry, leadership is in its essence a cultural activity suffused with ‘values, beliefs, language, rituals and artefacts’ (2008: 63). Leadership has been a central preoccupation since the dawn of human experience, a leader’s relationship with those who follow represents ‘one of the oldest, most natural and most effective of all human relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1742715012444054">Slim, 1957/2003</xref>: 143). Generating new perspectives on leadership in a particular context might, therefore, profit from reconsidering some very old contextual perspectives on this ancient and elusive phenomenon. Following this line of argument, Rarick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742715012444054">2009</xref>: 59) has argued that ‘a deeper understanding of a culture is achieved when one explores the historical antecedents of the beliefs and values of the people comprising the culture’.</p>
<p>The linkage between history and leadership is one that is readily grasped by many leadership practitioners. Indeed, a rapidly expanding genre of leadership books has emerged to cater to this very interest, cataloguing the leadership ‘lessons’ and ‘secrets’ that can be gleaned from ‘his-stories’ of an impressive array of famous and infamous historical leaders, ranging from Attila the Hun to Shaka Zulu. It is, therefore, all the more surprising to note that the linkage between the academic leadership literature and history has been surprisingly under-recognised and underexplored. Historical research is by no means a research priority for this young but growing field. When reviewing the core academic reference works in leadership studies, one is struck by the scant attention that is paid to history or historical figures. This is further confirmed by the almost exclusive concern with contemporary leadership contexts in the empirical articles that are published within leadership journals. Perhaps because of the predominance of the psychological imagination in leadership studies, the field remains doggedly and disturbingly atemporal and aspatial.</p>
<p>There have, however, recently been some promising scholarly moves to promote the historical study of leadership. Most notably, the opening chapter from the <italic>Sage Handbook of Leadership</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012444054">Grint, 2011</xref>) provides a timely and compelling invitation for leadership scholars to pursue the historical study of leadership. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012444054">Humphries and Einstein (2003)</xref> have charted the historical development of transformational leadership, beginning with Xenophon through into the medieval period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742715012444054">Muniapan (2009)</xref> has endeavoured to integrate (eastern) historical models of leadership with contemporary business theory. A few reference works have also been published which actively promote and demonstrate the value of a historical view of leadership: <italic>Leadership: Classical, Contemporary and Critical Approaches</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012444054">Grint, 1997</xref>); <italic>The International Library of Leadership</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1742715012444054">Wren et al, 2004</xref>): and <italic>Leadership: Essential Selections on Power, Authority and Influence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012444054">Kellerman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In her historical survey of leadership sources, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012444054">Kellerman (2010)</xref> notes that the earliest and most enduring forms of leadership literature have come down to us from the sages of classical Greece and China. Leadership, or rather the relationship between leaders and followers, she argues ‘is, and must be, an area of intellectual inquiry that is interdisciplinary. How can we know leadership without knowing… history, philosophy, psychology, politics… literature, art, and so on?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012444054">Kellerman, 2010</xref>: xxv). Nowhere is this more vital to consider than when endeavouring to better comprehend the contemporary leadership context in China. The rapidity and scale of the changes taking place in modern China have made a study of its historic culture an imperative for academics and practitioners in business and politics, whether or not China is their area of special focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715012444054">De Burgh, 2006</xref>). Understanding leadership in modern China is a particularly important study, primarily because of the constant state of political and social flux and crisis that has characterised the country’s rise since the post-Mao era (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715012444054">Shenkar, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012444054">Scobell and Wortzel, 2005</xref>). If leadership is about ‘coping with change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715012444054">McCausland, 2008</xref>: x) then understanding how Chinese leaders cope with the tension, stress and complexity that characterises the modern, globalised world should become a priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012444054">Scobell and Wortzel, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This article responds directly to this challenge and, in the process, seeks to demonstrate the value of actively drawing upon historic perspectives in order to deepen our understanding of leadership processes in contemporary contexts within China and beyond. This article will propose an ideal, that of a Chinese model of leadership which is drawn from classical Chinese philosophies of practice. We will argue that, while it is merely an ideal, this model is as relevant a heuristic to assist our understanding of contemporary leadership practices in China as it is to assist our understanding of the historical cultural foundation upon which these leadership practices are built.</p>
<p>We will commence the article by examining the state of play in leadership modelling in a Chinese context and considering the ‘Chinese model of leadership’ approach. This involves an examination of leadership using indigenous Chinese models and perspectives rather than those derived from purely Western studies. We will highlight four impediments that non-Chinese researchers face when studying Chinese leadership. These are: cultural differences in the model of inquiry; discomfort with paradox; anathema to authoritarianism; and the representation of Confucianism as shorthand for Chinese culture. Acknowledging and seeking to overcome these impediments has proven to be helpful in guiding our leadership modelling work. We hope that they will be important to others who are also engaging in this work.</p>
<p>This section of the article concludes with a caveat regarding the universalistic application of leadership theory. A recognition of the overwhelming predominance of the North American context as the research locus for leadership studies has prompted researchers, ourselves included, to correct this imbalance by conducting research that takes both <italic>emic</italic> and <italic>etic</italic> approaches: that is, studies conducted within or from outside the host culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715012444054">Jackson and Parry, 2008</xref>: 79).</p>
<p>In the next section of the article, we will reassert the importance of Taoism as the philosophical foundation of Chinese leadership, through an examination of the influence of the ideogramatic writing system. We will also look to Taoist literature on Chinese thought, most especially the key concepts of <italic>Tao</italic> (way), <italic>Te</italic> (power), and <italic>Ho</italic> (harmony) as they relate to and explain Chinese leadership. The concept of <italic>harmonious leadership</italic> will be explored before arguing the merits of the hermeneutic method as a means of engaging with the phenomenon at hand. Based on a textual analysis of the Taoist classics, we propose an initial, holistic, hermeneutically derived model of harmonious leadership that conforms to the ideals of Tao. The article concludes by proposing further avenues and applications of our model for students of Chinese leadership.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1742715012444054"><title>Modelling Chinese leadership</title>
<p>Are there some fundamental principles or sources of Chinese leadership philosophy and practice we can draw from to derive generalisations that will aid in our understanding of this crucial phenomenon? Referring to the study of Chinese political leadership, Pye states that ‘it is easier to characterise past systems than generalise about current ones’ (2002: 209). Aided by the gradual opening up of China to academic engagement (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715012444054">Dikötter, 2010</xref>) and the work in English of indigenous Chinese scholars like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012444054">Chen and Lee and their colleagues (2008b)</xref>, the systemic examination of the past of Chinese leadership is beginning to reveal important new insights.</p>
<p>A key to understanding Chinese leadership is to examine it from a multiplicity of angles, and in particular use indigenous Chinese models and perspectives rather than those derived from purely Western studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012444054">Barney and Zhang, 2009</xref>). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1742715012444054">Tsui et al. (2004)</xref> note, the contextual dynamism and complexity of modern China appear to reveal a diversity of leadership models and styles in practice; traditional leadership models derived from ancient Chinese philosophy seem as prevalent as those derived from either Western business thought or those underpinned by Communist theory and ideology.</p>
<p>Heuristics provides us with simple ways of dealing with complex phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012444054">Bazerman and Moore, 2009</xref>: 6–7). In the absence of any real empirical model, the use of ideal heuristic models enables us to better analyse and understand the phenomenon of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012444054">Grint, 2005</xref>: 19). Numerous models like this have been proposed, from the ‘great man’ model as variously formulated by Plato and Carlyle, through to the various interactional, transactional, contingency, and behavioural models that in one form or another examine the role social forces and situations play in the leadership dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715012444054">Rejai and Phillips, 1997</xref>: 1–4). One common aspect of all these models is the apparently implicit confidence in the universality of their application to leadership across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742715012444054">Nguyen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this universalist assumption is being challenged, no more so than with regard to leadership as it pertains to a Chinese context, which is the focus of this article. Two approaches to exploring leadership in China have presented themselves. To paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012444054">Barney and Zhang (2009)</xref>, one can seek to develop either ‘a model of Chinese leadership’ or ‘a Chinese model of leadership’. The first approach focuses on applying and refining theories developed elsewhere in a Chinese context. This envisages researchers using modern business and political practices in China to test and refine general and universal theoretical models. The second approach, the one of interest here, focuses on creating explanations for the existence of Chinese leadership phenomena that are uniquely Chinese. Barney and Zhang see this approach as a rejection of ‘a research agenda created by Western scholars in favour of a research agenda created by <italic>Chinese scholars</italic>’ [emphasis added] (2009: 15).</p>
<p>The Western research agenda has at least four built-in biases that may actually be impeding our consideration of leadership in a Chinese context. These four impediments – cultural differences in the model of inquiry; the discomfort with paradox; the anathema to authoritarianism or paternalism; and the representation of Confucianism as a shorthand for Chinese culture – will be considered in more detail before we proceed to an alternative point of inquiry using Tao.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1742715012444054"><title>Research impediments for the study of Chinese leadership</title>
<sec id="sec4-1742715012444054"><title>Cultural differences in the mode of inquiry</title>
<p>The first impediment for the Western scholar of Chinese leadership is the differences in the model of inquiry that are embedded in both cultures, the principal difference being the respective cultures’ attitude to the ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715012444054">Chan, 1967</xref>). From a Western perspective the concept of ‘ideals’ and the related concept of ‘idealism’ are problematic, meaning quite distinctly different things in a philosophic sense than in, shall we say, an international relations sense. However, the prevalence of scepticism in the Western model of scientific inquiry means that ideals posited in any of the Western schools of thought are regarded as mere abstractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1742715012444054">Zeki, 2000</xref>); models or constructs of a conceptual or aspirational nature are somewhat unlikely to be realised in actuality.</p>
<p>In contrast, Solomon and Higgins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1742715012444054">1996</xref>: 91–3) note that since the classical era, over two and a half millennia before Western philosophers became fixated with language, Chinese philosophy recognised the central role language played in our ways of seeing and understanding our world; Chinese words defined the world and words had ideals built into them. A word like ‘leader’ does not describe a social role or function as it generally does in the West, but rather prescribes a set of values and actions that define leader behaviour.</p>
<p>As the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012444054">Pyes (1985)</xref> have noted in their groundwork on Asian concepts of power, the Chinese, despite their history, are the world’s great optimists, their view of leadership being grounded in a deeply held belief that leaders have solved all ills in the past and will do so again in the future. Therefore, what might seem like an idealised model to Western eyes might actually conform more closely to how Chinese people conceive effective leadership in its actual form as prescribed by the socially mandated ideal. It will be important to keep this key notion in mind when we later posit our ideal Chinese model of leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742715012444054"><title>Discomfort with paradox</title>
<p>A second impediment to gaining an understanding of a Chinese model of leadership is the Western, or at least Anglophone, tendency to think in terms of opposition or duality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742715012444054">Klages, 2006</xref>: 54). The Westminster party system and the judicial trial model are oppositional systems; Judeo-Christian theology pits good against evil, and black is the opposite to white. Ideologically the socialism of the left is opposed to the capitalism or conservatism of the right, and one is either pacifistic or militaristic to varying degrees. History is a linear progression towards the realisation of one positive duality over its other negative duality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715012444054">Shetler, 1997</xref>). For some time Western academics have viewed the interplay of classical Chinese thought through a Marxian lens, seeing a clash of opposites where none existed. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742715012444054">Freiberg (1977)</xref> views Taoism and Confucianism as being systems of ideas that are diametrically opposed, the one a philosophy of and for the people, the other a tool of the repressive state.</p>
<p>However, as Hong and Tsahuidu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012444054">2007</xref>: 13) point out, the Chinese themselves see the two philosophies as ‘two contradicting yet complimentary perspectives in dealing with human relations’, something we will explore in more detail presently. The Chinese have traditionally had ‘the ability… to hold different propositions simultaneously without distress’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012444054">Cotterell, 2002</xref>: 30). This mindset does not see opposites but rather different aspects of the same system. Thus both the positive and negative poles are needed for an electric current to flow, and north is needed for there to be a south. The disappearance of one part of the system would lead to the destruction of the system itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1742715012444054">Watts and Huang, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>The contrast between the Western anathema and the Chinese ambivalence to, and even wilful embrace of, paradox places an intellectual barrier in the way of mutual comprehension of each other’s leadership cultures. This is probably best illustrated through the notion of doing nothing, one ‘that is familiar in the East and unthinkable in the West’; and doing something, ‘an option in the East and a requirement in the West’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012444054">Kellerman, 2010</xref>: 7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742715012444054"><title>The authoritarian model of Chinese leadership</title>
<p>A third impediment to properly comprehending the Chinese model of leadership is the West’s approach to the notions of paternalism or authoritarianism. Rarick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742715012444054">2009</xref>) has noted some of the more common characteristics of the Chinese approach to organisational management. Among these characteristics, centralised control, collectivism, authoritarian and paternalistic leadership, and the primacy of the hierarchical family model would be concepts that are largely an anathema to the Western liberal individualism that suffuses most leadership scholars’ worldviews.</p>
<p>The notion of authoritarianism is particularly repugnant, associated as it is with the extreme variety of the model as exemplified by the disastrous regimes of the fascist and Communist dictators of the 20th century. In her primer on dictatorship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715012444054">Burch (1964)</xref> described authoritarianism as a ‘broad, general term to cover various forms of autocratic rule in which… authority is concentrated in one man or a small group… [it] connotes emphasis on obedience over individual liberty’. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism that is applied with little or no restraint.</p>
<p>After the experiences of the 20th century it is unsurprising that this style of leadership is considered anachronistic and malign. The fascist leader in particular is both a charismatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012444054">Carsten, 1976</xref>) and a paternalistic leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012444054">Heywood, 1998</xref>: 220). Authoritarian leadership styles are commonly associated with the military, a subject notably, and controversially, examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715012444054">Dixon (1979)</xref>, especially as it related to incompetent leadership.</p>
<p>In his early study of Chinese leadership, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742715012444054">Silin (1976)</xref> was critical of the authoritarian model, arguing that it is an impediment for Chinese business moving to the dominant Western organisational model and its egalitarian, individualistic and democratic mores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012444054">Farh and Cheng, 2000</xref>: 88). While China has had its fair share of charismatic leaders on the national stage – the leader of the 19th-century Taiping Rebellion Hung Hsiu Ch’uan being a notable example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012444054">Fairbank, 1988</xref>) – the prevalent leadership style in Chinese culture has been paternalistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012444054">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>). Fahr and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012444054">Cheng (2000)</xref> identified three key elements to Chinese paternalistic leadership: authoritarianism was a key behaviour, but importantly, this was balanced by the presence of benevolent and morality-based leadership behaviours.</p>
<p>For Fahr and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012444054">Cheng (2000)</xref> the authoritarian aspect of paternalistic leadership was the classic command and control model of absolute exercise of authority and demand of obedience in followers. The benevolent aspect was the added concern of the leader for the subordinate’s personal and family well-being. The moral dimension of the model, one that Fahr and Cheng describes as ‘subtle and hard to define’ (2000: 94), comprises behaviours that demonstrate virtues or qualities legitimising the leader in the eyes of the followers through the cultivation of mutual identification and respect.</p>
<p>They thus define their model as a ‘leadership style that combines strong discipline and authority with fatherly benevolence and moral integrity couched in a personalistic atmosphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012444054">Farh and Cheng, 2000</xref>: 94). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012444054">Chen and Fahr later elaborate (2009)</xref>, in the Chinese model, authoritarian leadership is a distinct construct with important modifying differences from that which is practised in the West. Rather than authoritarian leadership they suggest that we better understand Chinese leadership through the notion of authoritative leadership.</p>
<p>It is helpful here to consider leadership through the notion of hegemony. From the Greek term for chieftain, <italic>hegemon</italic> implies one individual, social class, or nation exerting power over others through coercion or dominance of one form or another. The term hegemony (<italic>ba</italic>) has a more subtle meaning in Chinese political thought. <italic>Badao,</italic> or rule through force, as we understand hegemony in the West, carries extremely pejorative connotations. This is in marked contrast to a second form of hegemony, <italic>wangdao</italic> – kingly or benevolent rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012444054">Scobell, 2002</xref>: 7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742715012444054"><title>Confusion about Confucius</title>
<p>Our fourth and final impediment to consider is the pre-eminence of Confucianism as a means to understand Chinese leadership. For a growing number of scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715012444054">Lakey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715012444054">Dhakhwa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012444054">McDonald, 2010</xref>), Chinese leadership is to be, at least partly, examined through the prism of Confucianism, that large corpus of knowledge associated with Confucius, his disciple Mencius, and their students and intellectual descendants. Considering both the enduring primacy of Confucian thought in post-unified imperial China and the recent gradual rehabilitation of the sage and his teachings by the Chinese Communist Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715012444054">Branigan, 2010</xref>), this approach appears to be a valid and promising line of inquiry.</p>
<p>However, while the prism of Confucianism helps to break down and study some of the constituent parts that make up Chinese political and social (and thereby leadership) culture, it can also serve to obscure the source or font of that culture and the dialectical interaction of seemingly opposing philosophies throughout Chinese culture that gives it both its stability and its dynamism.</p>
<p>Before the ideas that bear his Latinised name were elevated to official state doctrine after the Warring States period ended in 221 <sc>bce</sc>, and maintained through the imperial examination system until 1912 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012444054">Cotterell, 2002</xref>: 9–17), Confucius was just one of a number of significant thinkers who helped shape the corpus of knowledge that is classical Chinese thought. Chen and Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012444054">2008a</xref>: 1–3) note that, while for many, Confucianism is ‘the shorthand for Chinese culture’, this displays an ignorance of the formational, evolutionary importance and diversity of the other Chinese philosophies as well as a misunderstanding of the continuous influence of and interplay between each of the major Chinese schools of thought. The Yin of Confucianism and the Yang of Taoism spring from the same shamanistic source.</p>
<p>What we today call Confucianism is itself a fusion of the socio-cultural framework of Confucius and the draconian totalitarianism of the Legalist School that flourished under the brief Qin dynasty (221–207 <sc>bce</sc>). The Han dynasty (206 <sc>bce</sc>–220 <sc>ce</sc>) rulers created a philosophy of rule that embraced the enlightened conservatism of Confucius with the severity of the Legalists to create a paradoxical form of liberal-fascism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715012444054">Stuart-Fox, 2003</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012444054">Barney and Zhang (2009)</xref> have noted, given their relative unfamiliarity with the history and culture of the Chinese people, scholars are in danger of drawing incorrect conclusions from their research, whether through attempting to overlay Western intellectual constructs over an unsuitable Chinese context, or by attempting to understand a phenomenon like leadership from a Chinese perspective but lacking the background knowledge to do so astutely. For Western scholars taking the more difficult latter path, there is the prime difficulty of grasping the subtle tapestry that is the philosophic interplay between the principle schools of classical Chinese thought. To illustrate, as indigenous scholars have observed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012444054">Hong and Tsahuridu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012444054">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>), some of the world’s most eminent and widely published leadership scholars have fallen prey to ascribing particular philosophical concepts to, for example, Confucianism when in fact the concepts in question primarily derive from one of the other schools: Taoism or Legalism, for example.</p>
<p>It is the dominance in the Western mind of the notion of an all-pervading influence of the ideas of Confucius and his disciple Mencius on Chinese culture that may be partly to blame for these mistakes. As Wong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1742715012444054">2001</xref>) has noted, there have historically been a number of important impediments to Western understanding of Chinese culture (and vice versa). These include a tendency on the part of the Chinese to avoid the sort of pure abstract thinking that dominates Western thought and a history of ‘a flexible and ambivalent attitude towards religion and life’ derived from both the non-religious character of, and the cross-fertilising relationship between, the great schools of Taoism, Confucianism, Legalism and the Chinese form of Buddhism. Understanding Chinese leadership requires a more balanced and nuanced appreciation of the dominant, if sometimes covert, philosophic influences on Chinese thought.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1742715012444054"><title>A caveat</title>
<p>While this article endeavours to critique the universalist approach to the application of Western-derived leadership theories to non-Western cultural contexts, we wish to highlight a caveat to this stance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715012444054">Leung (2009)</xref> posits, there is no reason why theories developed within a Chinese context cannot themselves go on to have universalist application. Grint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012444054">2005</xref>: 10) acknowledges the validity of the cyclical approach to leadership, that is the conception of leadership as subject to revolving ‘fashions’, the various authoritarian and liberal models each displacing each other sequentially over time and space.</p>
<p>This cyclical approach conforms to the traditional Chinese view of historical change as a cyclical, as opposed to linear, discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742715012444054">Chang and Inayatullah, 1997</xref>). A Chinese model of leadership, one based on less liberal behaviours that are now currently predominant in the West, may therefore serve to offer us a double bounty: a heuristic to understand current and long-dominant Chinese models of leadership, plus an aide-memoire to leadership as once practised in the West that may return to dominance again at some future point in time.</p>
<p>To develop this heuristic model we will move to an investigation of the idea of leadership as represented in classical Chinese ideograms. By examining key Taoist concepts relating to paradox and harmony we can begin to understand the behavioural ideals that are important for conceiving, and have long prescribed, Chinese models of leadership.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742715012444054"><title>Taoism and the ideogram of Chinese leadership</title>
<p>For the contemplation of the essence of Chinese leadership, the Taoist writings of the broader Warring States period of classical China are ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012444054">Grint, 2011</xref>: 5) for they are at once both historical and artistic works that continue to shed light on modern business and political life through a gaze that is both philosophically detached yet psychologically engaged (Minford in Introduction to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1742715012444054">Sun-Tzu c. 400 <sc>bce</sc>/2003</xref>). To gain a full appreciation of the utility of this source, it is important to consider the contribution of the Chinese ideogramatic writing system to the Chinese way of thought. Chinese language is written using ideograms, literally the visual representation of an idea.</p>
<p>Prior to unification under the Ch’in dynasty in 221 <sc>bce</sc>, China was a land politically fractured, subject to horrific, epic warfare and social discord, yet bearing the fruit of an enduringly rich philosophical, artistic and linguistic whole-culture that, unlike the Celtic or Anglo-Saxon corpus in the British Isles, still forms the intellectual basis of modern Chinese life. This rich and ancient cultural tradition, its ‘nearly timeless written language’ and ‘disparate intellectual threads’, serves as a counterpoint to the tortured political heritage of continuous conflict and measureless human suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715012444054">Sawyer, 2004</xref>: ix). This was the era of the flowering and codification of Chinese culture known as the ‘hundred schools of thought’.</p>
<p>Two great institutions have held the Chinese state together for nearly four millennia – the warrior-scholar ruling elite and the writing system – an ancient system which, unlike Sumerian, its early contemporary, still exists in daily use. Chinese writing has been described as ‘a gift from the past to the present’, one in which whole histories of thought are hidden in single characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1742715012444054">Wolf, 2007</xref>: 48). As early as 1850 <sc>bce</sc> we find written reports recording the direction of great public works by this elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012444054">Fairbank, 1988</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>Chinese ideograms, through millennia of evolution from their rudimentary origins, have a multidimensional, ambiguous quality and, notably for ideograms representing complex ideas, lend themselves to multiple interpretations (Wing in Introduction to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715012444054">Sun-Tzu c. 400 <sc>bce</sc>/1988</xref>). Here again we encounter a great paradox at the heart of Chinese culture. This in-built ambiguous quality leads to potential confusion in the reader over the exact meaning of characters and therefore the specific intent or meaning of the characters’ author. Surely this must be a weakness in any writing system, especially one used to administer the affairs of a great empire? Yet this very weakness was its strength for two notable reasons.</p>
<p>First, the world around us is inherently chaotic, an ‘infinitude of variables interacting simultaneously’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1742715012444054">Watts and Huang, 1979</xref>: 6–7). Alphabetic writing systems are ordered and relatively demanding of the exactitudes of meaning and thus ideally suited to conveying ideas relating to process and product and the everyday happenings of life. However, when it comes to describing complexity, alphabetic systems require equally complex tracts of linguistic description to even begin to capture the multifarious phenomena at hand. ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’ goes the adage, and ideogramatic languages have the ability to represent complex ideas simply and thus conceptualise them. A difficulty in translating ideogramatic based texts into alphabetically based languages like English is that much of the meaning conveyed through the ideogram is bound up with the pictorial idea from which the ideogram evolved. The picture and the nuanced image it evokes are difficult to accurately represent in words.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715012444054">Prince (2005)</xref> has highlighted that, unlike many Western languages, Chinese is a language of verbs rather than nouns and, without definite and indefinite articles, active and passive voices, and distinctions made between singular and plural. Nearly every word can be used in any part of speech. She observes<disp-quote>
<p>Nouns are understood in terms of what they do, or what is done with them … the language itself codes … a world understood in terms of change and interrelationship … for the Chinese, change <italic>is</italic> the background. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715012444054">Prince, 2005</xref>: 109)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The second strength is that through challenging the minds of those who used the language, and thus requiring them to be both broadly and deeply educated, the system created a leadership class, as well as an intellectual class, that were sophisticated and imaginative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012444054">Fairbank, 1988</xref>: 30–31).</p>
<sec id="sec10-1742715012444054"><title>Classical Chinese literature</title>
<p>Sawyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715012444054">2004</xref>: ix) describes how at the nexus of the cultural refinement and the political horror of the period a ‘contemplative literature’ developed that sought to fathom the chaotic order of the world. The way of thinking that permeated all these texts came from ‘the observation and contemplation of the forces at work in the environment, from the attunement of the microcosmic self to the energies of the macrocosm’ (Minford in Introduction to, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715012444054">Sun-Tzu c. 400 <sc>bce</sc>/2003</xref>: xxv). These were works that the rulers and scholars studied and contemplated as they struggled with the complex problems of their day. The classical Chinese canon, including the great works of military thought, lend themselves particularly well as contemplative aids to reflect on the human constant. More than 2,300 of these works have survived the ravages of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715012444054">Pheng et al., 1995</xref>), with only a handful known outside China.</p>
<p>While they are very much products of their time and context, they were written in an ecumenical and immutable fashion, designed to provide advice to anyone at any time. It is the freshness of the language and the eternal relevance of the message that has given works like the <italic>I Ching</italic>, the <italic>Tao Te Ching</italic>, <italic>Chuang-Tzu</italic> and <italic>Sun-Tzu Bing Fa</italic> an enduring status in the West since they were first introduced there from the 18th century <sc>ce</sc> onwards. The compatibility of their teachings to modern business practices has been extensively commented on (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1742715012444054">Tung, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715012444054">Low, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Ongoing research into the construction, use and utility of mandated reading lists in contemporary professional military education as well as ‘must reads’ of the business executive’s canon constantly reinforces the ubiquity of these texts, particularly of the writings of Sun Tzu. These texts’ immutability is due, in large part, to the paradoxical character of the Chinese script. This is most apparent when we consider one of the most fundamental, yet inherently complex, concepts in Chinese philosophy, one that pervades all classical Chinese literature and leads us to our model of harmonious leadership, the notions of Tao, Te and Ho.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1742715012444054"><title>Tao, Te and Ho</title>
<p>The <italic>Tao Te Ching</italic> of Lao-Tzu, sometimes translated as <italic>The Classic of the Way and the Power</italic>, is the essential text with which to begin a consideration of the Taoist view of the world. Often thought in the West to predominantly be an esoteric treatise on the essence of man and the need to transcend the human condition, it is in fact also a commentary on leadership, statecraft, war and matters of everyday life. Doing nothing as a means of getting things done is a constant theme throughout the text. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>He who devotes himself to learning seeks from day to day to increase his knowledge; he who devotes himself to the Tao seeks from day to day to diminish his doing. He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing on purpose. Having arrived at this point of non-action there is nothing which he does not do. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012444054">Lao-Tzu c. 500 <sc>bce</sc>/1891</xref>: ch.48, 1 and 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The idea of Tao or ‘the Way’ can be found in most classical schools of thought. At once simple and incomprehensible it can refer to the natural order of the universe and the ideals of man. Concepts of Tao can be applied to contemplative, metaphysical undertakings or the pragmatic, workaday endeavours of rule and governance.</p>
<p>Chinese intellectuals extrapolated through both these applications of Tao to create a canon that underpinned two crucial Chinese concerns: the primacy and necessity of leadership and the political unity of the Chinese cultural realm. Unity depends on the concentration of Te or power. Te is a thing both strategic/physical and moral/intellectual. For the successful leader, Te is dependent on a mastery of Tao. To have Tao is to understand the eternal interaction of Yin and Yang, the eternal principles of opposites: male/female, dark/light, reason/intuition, friend/foe, etc. Tao helps the leader to conceptually reconcile opposites towards strategic and ethical ends.</p>
<p>The reconciliation of these opposites leads to equilibrium and harmony or Ho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012444054">Chang, 1963/1975</xref>). Successful leadership is dependent on and derives from a mastery of the whole of Tao. Intellectually it is achieved through a generalist approach, not a specialist approach, to knowledge. We can better understand the relationship of leadership and Tao through an examination of the ideogram for the concept.</p>
<p>The simplified modern ideogram for Tao combines the symbol for <italic>go</italic> with the symbol for <italic>head</italic>, effectively a person on a journey; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742715012444054">Figure 1</xref>, ideogram C below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715012444054">Nyo, 2007</xref>). The small seal scripts codified at the end of the Warring States period present a more complex concept; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742715012444054">Figure 1</xref>, ideogram B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742715012444054">Silversmith, 2006</xref>). A contemporary guide to Tao interprets a version of this older ideogram as a combination of the symbols for <italic>movement</italic>, <italic>leg</italic> and <italic>face</italic> to mean in its literal sense ‘a person running along a path’, or philosophically the endless, cyclical and all-encompassing phenomenon that is life as lived by individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012444054">Deng, 1996</xref>: 2). In bronze script, used from the Western Zhou to the early part of the Warring States period (c. 1046 <sc>bce</sc> to c. 400 <sc>bce</sc>), we find the existence of a less abstract ideogram with clearer pictorial meaning for the untutored eye; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742715012444054">Figure 1 &amp; 2</xref>, ideogram A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742715012444054">Sears, 2003</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1742715012444054" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The evolution of the ideogram for <italic>Tao</italic>, circa 1000 <sc>bce</sc> to present.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742715012444054-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Like its successors the ideogram contains a human head and symbols that convey movement, in this case symbols for <italic>road</italic> and <italic>foot</italic>. However, crucial to our understanding of the classical theorists’ understanding of Tao, the manner in which the head and foot are represented are significant. Chang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012444054">1963/1975</xref>: 24–6) points out that interpreting the head symbol and the foot symbol as belonging to a single individual is erroneous as there was already another symbol in common use during the period in question which represented a single person. Rather, for Chang, the head is so stylised as to show authority or leadership. The detached foot then represents a follower.</p>
<p>Taken as they are together flanked within the road symbol, Chang considers it reasonable to interpret the whole as signifying ‘a leader and a follower united in finding their path’ (1963/1975: 25).</p>
<p>Te is an equally esoteric and fleeting concept carrying an impressive range of definitions. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012444054">Deng (1996)</xref> Te is earth, the source of all growth. The way to understanding Tao can be close to home, as simple as contemplating a clump of dirt. For Watts and Huang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1742715012444054">1979</xref>: 107) Te is both the ‘realization and expression of the Tao in actual living… [and] also the unusual… naturalness of the sage – his unself-conscious and uncontrived skill in handling social and practical affairs’. For an early 20th century translator of Lao-Tzu, Te was power. The paradoxical nature of power and leadership is explored in a famous passage:<disp-quote>
<p>The man of highest power does not reveal himself as a possessor of power; therefore he keeps his power. The man of inferior power cannot rid it of the appearance of power; therefore he is in truth without power. The man of highest power neither acts nor is there any who so regards him; the man of inferior power both acts and is so regarded. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715012444054">Lao-Tzu c. 500 <sc>bce</sc>/1934</xref>: ch.38)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Te is Tao in practice. The <italic>I Ching</italic>, one of the oldest books in the world, is the spring from which Chinese philosophy flows. Lao-Tzu based his teachings on its wisdom and Confucius wrote one of the earliest commentaries. The <italic>I Ching</italic> teaches that events do not happen in a random or chaotic fashion but rather follow the way of Tao as revealed through the laws of change. All things are subject to change, nothing stands still, and for everything there is a proper time. The leader versed in Tao adapts to the cycles of changes and the rise and fall of fortune, and is aware that the smallest word or action ‘creates ripples in the ocean of Tao which may have incalculable effects’ on the future, proceeds with modesty and caution at all times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715012444054">Douglas, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>So far we have considered the nature of the Chinese writing system and the key concepts of Tao and Te to consider classical Chinese concepts of leadership and power. Now we must examine the concepts of Ho (harmony) and the Yin-Yang of paradox in more detail, and the interweaving of classical Chinese strategic thought with its parent Taoist philosophy, to consider the Chinese model of leadership through the harmonious embrace of paradox.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1742715012444054"><title>Harmonious leadership</title>
<p>In life there are ups and downs; there are always cycles. <italic>Tai Chi</italic> (there is no beginning or end) prevails, with interplay of <italic>yang</italic> and <italic>yin</italic>; neither an absolute ‘good’ nor an absolute ‘evil’ exists, but instead harmony through balance and the flowing change of the opposite polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012444054">Low, 2010</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>The concept of <italic>Ho</italic> or harmony has been a central component of the Chinese philosophical construct since before the Spring and Autumn period (i.e. pre-770 <sc>bce</sc>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715012444054">Li (2008)</xref> has noted that this concept flowed through the classical consideration of everything from culinary and musical perfection through to the harmonisation of society through sage leadership. The notion of interpersonal harmony is the key traditional Chinese cultural concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012444054">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>) that still offers insight into leader/follower interaction in China. Therefore, the single word that might best encapsulate the core competency of leadership is <italic>harmony</italic>. This idea can be seen most compellingly through the yin-yang polarity.</p>
<p>The yin-yang principle as embraced by Taoism holds that ‘on the one hand, all matters have inherent contradictions and opposites; on the other hand, the opposites are unified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1742715012444054">Tung, 1994</xref>: 61). This polar yin-yang interaction of complementarity is both the ontological basis of all natural phenomena and the basis of all Chinese musings on leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012444054">Fu, 2008</xref>: 15). For Wong, ‘being able to appreciate opposing poles as a driving force, or seeing opportunities in contradiction’ was considered a mark of intellectual maturity by the classical Chinese authors (2001: 310). The shrouding of statements in seemingly contradictory phrases by all the classical Taoist authors is an indication of their widespread embrace of the yin-yang concept.</p>
<p>The idea represented by the yin-yang concept of opposites striving for harmony, can lead us to an idea of the balanced individual intellect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012444054">Davis, 2004</xref>). Being academically steeped in one academic discipline can cause conceptual imbalance; having an abundance of one talent or type of intelligence but a dearth of another cancels out the good of the first. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012444054">Mao Tse-Tung (1966)</xref> frequently commented on the perils of ‘one-sidedness’, a habit of not looking at problems ‘all-sidedly’ or of seeing ‘the part but not the whole’, effectively an imbalance of consideration. This notion of the balanced individual is compatible with Chen and Farh’s construct of the authoritative leader, defined through ‘leadership behaviours that rely primarily on legitimate authority and professional expertise to influence subordinates’ (2009: 34).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715012444054">Nye (2008)</xref> has persuasively argued that successful leadership is all about understanding how to combine and utilise different power resources and leadership styles in different contexts. For Nye, the successful leader was not one who conformed to one particular model or style, but one who had mastered all the relevant styles and could adopt the style most relevant to the context at hand. Nye describes effective leadership styles which all leaders should master as ‘soft and hard power skills’.</p>
<p>Soft power skills are the inspirational skills of attraction and persuasion that Nye categorises under the headings ‘Emotional IQ’, ‘Communications’ and ‘Vision’. Hard power skills are the transactional skills of reward and punishment that he places under the headings ‘Organizational Capacity’ and ‘Machiavellian Skills’. Hard power and soft power is managed through ‘smart power’, or the contextual skills that help the leader adjust, adapt and ‘create luck’. Nye’s model, while using different language, corresponds closely with Chen and Fahr’s authoritative leader model.</p>
<p>For both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715012444054">Nye (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012444054">Chen and Fahr (2009)</xref>, their effective leader wields authority without being authoritarian as the term is understood in the West. For Chen and Fahr, authoritative leadership is defined as ‘leader behaviours that rely primarily on legitimate authority and professional expertise to influence subordinates, such as making final calls on key decisions, expecting employees to comply with and follow through on directives, holding employees accountable for work rules and high performance standards’ (2009: 34).</p>
<p>The conclusion that it is mistaken to ascribe a monistic or stereotypical cultural epithet to a nuance-laden national construct as, for example, a certain nation’s predominant leadership model is evident when regarding the philosophies underpinning Chinese military thinking. Military culture, as we have shown, has played a seminal role in China’s cultural development. Scobell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012444054">2002</xref>: 2) has defined ‘strategic culture’ as ‘the fundamental and enduring assumptions about the role of war in human affairs and the efficacy of applying force held by political and military elites in a country’. He has convincingly argued that China’s strategic culture has two dominant, dialectical and mutually paradoxical strands.</p>
<p>The first strand, influenced by the ideas of both the Taoist Sun Tzu school and the writings of Confucius and Mencius, stresses ‘harmony over conflict, defence over offence… a predisposition for stratagem over combat and symbolic warfare over head-to-head combat on the battlefield’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012444054">Scobell, 2002</xref>: 3). Existing alongside this is a <italic>realpolitik</italic> strand of thought that willingly embraces the use of naked force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012444054">Scobell, 2002</xref>: 3–4). The effect of this is an ideal mindset that is at once both pacifistic and predisposed to using force in times of crisis, a reiteration of ‘holding different propositions simultaneously without distress’.</p>
<p>Former US president Richard Nixon provided us with a living model of this type of harmonious leadership mindset when he described Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai:<disp-quote>
<p>[He] was a communist revolutionary and a Confucian gentleman, a devoted ideologue and a calculating realist, a political infighter and a grand conciliator. A lesser man thrust into the crosscutting roles would have ended up confused in thought and action. But Zhou could assume any one of the roles or combine qualities of each without giving the slightest impression of hesitancy or inconsistency. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715012444054">Nixon, 1982</xref>: 229)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus the harmonious leader avoids ideologies or ‘boxed-in’ thought, wields authority without being authoritarian, prefers peace but is decisive in war, and has a toolbox of hard, soft and smart skills that can be utilised according to context.</p>
<p>Thus far this article has explored the possibility and desirability of leadership modelling within the Chinese context. We have highlighted four impediments that non-Chinese researchers face when studying Chinese leadership and introduced a caveat regarding the universalistic application of leadership theory. Having considered these impediments, we have reasserted the importance of Taoism as the philosophical foundation of Chinese leadership through an examination of the influence of the ideogramatic writing system and have looked to key concepts in Taoist literature on Chinese thought as they relate to and explain Chinese leadership. Now that we have further explored the concept of harmonious leadership, we will conclude the article by arguing for the hermeneutic method as a valuable means of engaging with Chinese leadership before proposing our ideal model of harmonious leadership and drawing some conclusions.</p>

<p>Wong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1742715012444054">2001</xref>: 310) has noted the synthetic and dialectical nature of classical Taoist thinking patterns. This is an important point to emphasise when considering how to further explore the notion of the <italic>Chinese model of leadership</italic>, notably that pursed by non-Chinese scholars. If, as we have argued to this point, the Chinese model of leadership has a substantial Taoist dimension; if the Taoist model of leadership rests on an interactive unity between leaders and followers on their mutual journey; and if the very basis of Taoist thought is the dialectic as represented by the yin-yang principle; then, by conducting cross-textual hermeneutic analysis using a variety of classic texts in a variety of classic translations to extract the presenting essence, it may be possible for the non-Chinese speaker to better experience the richness of the original texts and gain new leadership insights.</p>
<p>The dialectical form of the hermeneutic inquiry is on the surface a dialogue between researcher and ‘cultural members’ or authors of a particular cultural text. In the case of our cultural members, translators of Taoist classics for example, their text has many volumes, editions and translations. The inherent ambiguity and contradictory nature of Taoist statements means they lend themselves readily to a hermeneutic engagement. While texts such as Sun Tzu’s, for example, relate explicitly to warfare, a holistic view of both their translations and the literature surrounding them would strongly suggest that such warfare relates, in the Taoist sense, to conditions of complexity, rapid change and <italic>apolarity</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715012444054">Ferguson, 2004</xref>); conditions also applicable to business, politics and everyday life.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012444054">Cheng et al. (2009)</xref> lament, much research on leadership in China appears more concerned with validating Western leadership theories than actually exploring Chinese culture’s impact on global understanding and practice of leadership. This may well be due to deeply embedded biases, conscious or otherwise, that permeate academia towards Western-derived conceptual models, compounded by the impediments to the study of Chinese cultural phenomena that were outlined earlier in this article. The hermeneutic approach acknowledges that the researcher also comes with acknowledged prejudice or bias and a particular <italic>horizon</italic>, limited to the perspective of the individual’s history, language and tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715012444054">Gadamer, 1960/1996</xref>). Through engagement in the hermeneutic circle the researcher purposefully seeks a more open enlightenment on the topic at hand. He or she engages with the text through the hermeneutic circle, in a cyclical, though evolutionary process, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742715012444054">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715012444054">Machrina and Richards, 1996</xref>).

<p>By way of encouraging further research into the Chinese model of leadership, our engagement with the texts to date has produced an initial holistic, hermeneutically derived model of harmonious leadership that conforms to the Tao. As stated earlier the explorations in Tao revealed the harmonious leader as one who avoids ideologies or ‘boxed-in’ thought; wields authority without being authoritarian; prefers peace but is decisive in war; and has a toolbox of hard and soft skills that can be utilised according to the context. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1742715012444054">Figure 4</xref> we expand upon this model and present a five-element model of Chinese harmonious leadership.
<fig id="fig4-1742715012444054" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Model of harmonious leadership.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742715012444054-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The first element is the intellect of the leader. This is gained through a life-long appreciation of both technical and human arts and artistry, a pursuit of the material grounded in an appreciation of the ephemeral. It is an understanding that we manage things and lead people.</p>
<p>The second element is a mastery of paradox, the realm of complexity and change; this is gained through a rejection of received wisdom or orthodoxy, a rejection of cant and posture in favour of a view of what is not what conformity says ought to be.</p>
<p>The third element is a mastery of continuity. This is gained through the recognition that we are often blinded and seduced by change and thus fail to recognise that much in life remains the same. Despite the technological changes, the characters in the <italic>Chuang-Tzu</italic> for example are as modern as us.</p>
<p>The fourth element is the moral strength of the leader. A counterpart to intellect, morality is an all-encompassing notion that includes physical and mental health and well-being; the ability to communicate for the greater good; the ability to weather the good and the bad; and integrity and contextual bravery.</p>
<p>The fifth and final element is benevolence within the organisation. This is achieved through the harmonious relationship between leader and follower underpinned by authoritative patrimony. The leader understands that authority comes from the followers and that long-term success is built upon a leader/follower trust base.</p>
<p>For students of leadership, particularly those steeped in the Western rationalist intellectual tradition, the most intellectually challenging and disorienting approach to a Chinese model of leadership is to use the Taoist intellectual techniques of paradox management to reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable elements of everyday life. Understanding the five elements of intellect, mastery of paradox, mastery of continuity, moral strength and benevolent organisational environment leads us to the conception of an ideal heuristic – what we refer to as the Chinese model of harmonious leadership. This model is in harmony with the cyclical idea of leadership, one which conceives leadership models as revolving through time and space. This model from the past can tell us much about the Chinese present and, perhaps inevitably, the Chinese future.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1742715012444054" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article proposed an ideal, a Chinese model of leadership that is drawn from classical Chinese philosophies of practice. While it is merely an ideal, we have argued that ideals have a closer relationship to reality in Chinese thinking than they do in the West, and that this model is as relevant a heuristic to assist our understanding of modern leadership in China as it is to assist our understanding of the historical cultural foundation upon which modern leadership is built.</p>
<p>We commenced by examining leadership modelling in a Chinese context and considering the possibility and desirability of a Chinese model of leadership approach – that is, examinations of leadership using indigenous Chinese models and perspectives rather than those derived from purely Western studies. We highlighted four impediments that non-Chinese researchers tend to face when studying Chinese leadership. These were cultural differences in the model of inquiry; discomfort with paradox; anathema to authoritarianism; and the representation of Confucianism as shorthand for Chinese culture.</p>
<p>We then reasserted the importance of Taoism as the philosophical foundation of Chinese leadership through an examination of the influence of the ideogramatic writing system and Taoist literature on Chinese thought, and the key concepts of Tao, Te (power) and Ho (harmony) as they relate to and explain Chinese leadership. We further explored the concept of harmonious leadership before arguing the merits of the hermeneutic method as a means of engaging with the phenomenon at hand. Finally, based on a textual analysis of the Taoist classics, an initial, holistic, hermeneutically derived model of harmonious leadership was proposed conforming to the ideals of Tao.</p>
<p>While this model is indeed just a model, it does provide Western eyes with a construct that, still idealised, may be closer to Chinese notions of the actual than our own sceptically based research culture would normally allow us to acknowledge. At the height of the Cold War, historian AJP Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1742715012444054">1952</xref>: 45) highlighted, if somewhat cynically, a crucial impediment to understanding between the leaders of East and West. His thesis was that in Western liberal democracies we often say things we do not mean, and, with a cultural nod and wink, collectively understand that we do this; however, we get into strife when we fail to understand that people from other cultures, whether commercial or political, sometimes actually do mean what they say (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012444054">McElhatton, 2008</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>The implications of this research may be subtle but nonetheless important for analysts of Chinese cultural behaviour, particularly those in endeavours where it is important to constantly check the cultural assumptions we bring to any negotiating table, restaurant or handshake.</p>
<p>The value of the model is not confined to what Western institutions can learn about our Chinese counterparts, but what we can also learn from them. In East Asian education for example, the effective modern teacher is seen by parents and students as a figure of authority, morality and benevolence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012444054">Economist, 2011</xref>: 20). For many 20th-century Western educational practitioners, authority and benevolence are antithetical rather than complementary behaviours. A disillusionment with the perceived impact on school performance of laissez-faire approaches to classroom leadership has led researchers to examine Chinese models of educational leadership for clues to what we might do better to promote better leadership in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012444054">Economist, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Knowledge of the Chinese model of leadership is vital for anyone, Chinese and non-Chinese, who wishes to engage or re-engage with a continental Chinese culture that has, in one century, experienced more flux and change than Europe has in a millennium. To this end, a worthy body of knowledge can emerge only from Chinese scholars re-engaging with, and Western scholars embracing, indigenous Chinese epistemologies and ontologies. A Chinese model of leadership may thus be divined through a re-examination of our notions of existence and knowledge through the perspectives of philosophies and belief systems as venerable as, if somewhat different to, one’s own.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742715012444054"/>
