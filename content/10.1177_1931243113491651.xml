<p>To paraphrase Charles Dickens, some feel that for journalism and journalists it is the worst of times. To nut graph Mark Briggs’ <italic>Entrepreneurial Journalism: How to Build What’s Next for News,</italic> it could be the best of times for journalists, IF they can think outside the box. By the last page of <italic>EJ,</italic> Briggs has provided a blueprint for journalists rather than accountants, finance majors, and MBAs to take news to the next phase.</p>
<p>The woes of the “old media” news business over the decades have been well chronicled. A slow response to the Internet and mobile interactive technology, massive layoffs to keep the corporate Bottom line up, declining revenues, an economic recession, and “CPM rules” thinking have created new tectonic plates, Briggs argues, on which those who want to practice journalism going forward can stand.</p>
<p>Briggs offers in an 8 × 6-in. format of eight compact chapters a guide to navigate the new media ecosystem and create personally satisfying news vehicles that can positively contribute to the marketplace of ideas. Briggs argues that if journalists embrace the reality of low cost capitalization/entry, technology, motivation, and innovation a satisfying career in journalism can be had. A quick read, Briggs explains the current media environment and shows how journalists can plan, fund, and market new journalism ventures. Tightly written, full of good advice and affordable, <italic>EJ</italic> gives future journalism entrepreneurs good advice on how to create something that could be successful in the current news environment.</p>
<p>Briggs is a widely read author, consultant, speaker, and trainer on the topic of how new media have affected journalism. A Poynter Institute fellow and journalist with experience in newspapers and television to his credit, he is in <italic>EJ</italic> preaching what he has practiced with a Seattle-based website he cofounded.</p>
<p>Beyond Briggs’s obvious passion for the topic, an invaluable aspect of the book is the list of examples of entrepreneurial journalism projects. The examples, some started with a few as two people and others with no money at all, show what can be done by journalists who choose to borrow from George Bernard Shaw and dream of journalistic ventures that have never been and ask “Why not?”</p>
<p>Briggs assumes that its readers know how to “do” journalism, so the pages are not full of tips on how to write, shoot, edit, produce, and report content. For those who don’t know how to actually produce the news, he urges those would be media mavens to factor the need for journalism expertise in their budgets. His target, instead, is those who want to leverage their skill in information collection, synthesis, and presentation while making money. One welcome piece of advice is that journalists should not be averse to making money and should not think their new venture has to be labor of love only. Embrace money, Briggs exhorts, because “Money is not greed … Without it, you have a hobby, not a business” (p. 70).</p>
<p><italic>EJ</italic> is not for every journalist, journalism professor, or student of journalism. Many would not want to learn to wear a boss’ hat or teach how it is done. Because people no longer work for one organization for their entire careers anymore; however, <italic>EJ</italic> is for current journalism students who would be wise to go it alone (out of the realities of the job market) or to begin preparing themselves to disconnect from a disappearing traditional journalism career matrix. Because media economics and management courses are not always required subjects in journalism programs, <italic>EJ</italic> clearly serves a void and could be a supplemental text or book review assignment choice at the very least. In addition to being broad based, current, and timely, it is must reading for any serious student or professor of journalism.</p>
