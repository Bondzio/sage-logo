The objective of this study was to characterize BVDV antigen distribution in 10 PI alpacas of varying age and to compare viral antigen distribution and localization in tissues of PI alpacas with 5 PI calves of varying age. Ocular dysplasia was evident in 1 PI alpaca, constituting the first reported congenital ocular lesion in PI alpacas. Viral antigen was widely distributed in alpaca tissues and was prominent in neurons, endothelial cells, and vascular tunica media myocytes but had limited distribution in lymphoid tissues and moderate distribution in epithelium of several organ systems of alpacas. Macrophages in the alpaca gastrointestinal system submucosa and lymph node medullary sinuses often had prominent labeling. In addition, only 1 alpaca had antigen labeling in the bone marrow in contrast to PI cattle. Labeled cells in calf tissues were more widely distributed, occurring prominently in lymphoid and epithelial tissues. Common features of the 2 host species were widespread antigen labeling and absence of lymphoid depletion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alpacas</kwd><kwd>bovine pestivirus</kwd><kwd>bovine viral diarrhea virus</kwd><kwd>camelids</kwd><kwd>New World</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>persistent infection</kwd><kwd>systemic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a member of the genus <italic>Pestivirus </italic>in the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, as are classical swine fever virus and border disease virus.

One alpaca, A0, was negative for BVDV on PCR and IHC and served as a negative control. Alpacas A1–A10 and calves C1–C5 were confirmed positive for BVDV by virus isolation or repeated positive antemortem PCR and by IHC as previously reported.

Sections were blocked for 30 minutes at 21°C in TBSS with 4% equine serum. After blocking, primary antibody, anti-BVDV monoclonal antibody 15C5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812447827">15</xref></sup> directed against E<sup>rns</sup>/gp 48 (diluted 1:1000 in TBSS) was added, and sections were incubated for 1 hour at 21°C.

Biotinylated horse anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:200 in TBSS with 2% normal bovine serum and 4% horse serum was applied, and slides were incubated for 30 minutes at 18°C to 24°C. Slides were washed as described, and a conjugated avidin–alkaline phosphatase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) conjugated to streptavidin was added and allowed to incubate for 15 minutes. After washing, substrate (Biored Fast Red, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied to the tissue sections, and slides were allowed to incubate for 15 minutes at 20°C to 22°C in darkness. Slides were washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 2 minutes, counterstained in Mayer’s hematoxylin counterstain, and dehydrated. A coverslip was applied, and each slide was examined for labeling. Slides for immunohistochemical evaluation received an antigen labeling score assigned by a single pathologist (JNH) to subjectively record distribution of BVDV antigen in alpacas. Scoring of labeling distribution was performed on a 5-point scale: 0, negative; 1, single cell or single small group of cells with labeling; 2, clearly positive, mild scattered, or regional labeling of cells; 3, moderate scattered or regional labeling of cells; and 4, widespread coalescing to diffuse labeling of cells. Staining was performed in a single laboratory using identical protocols and equipment, and standardized control panels of positive skin tissues with varying levels of antigen staining intensity were included to ensure consistent staining across the platform. Bovine skin from a positive PI BVDV calf was used for the positive control and a BVDV negative ear notch for the negative control. Positive controls were placed at multiple locations throughout the run to ensure staining consistency. Irrelevant slides were performed using a negative mouse antibody (Ventana Laboratories, Tucson, AZ). Alpaca A0 was negative for BVDV, and the same IHC procedure using primary antibody, anti-BVDV monoclonal antibody 15C5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812447827">15</xref></sup> directed against E<sup>rns</sup>/gp 48 was performed in all tissues similar to the positive PI alpacas in this study.

Exceptions to this occurred in skin and endocrine tissues, in which BVDV distribution was similar between the 2 species. Widespread antigen distribution occurred in respiratory, digestive, and cutaneous sites, and these may serve as sources of virus for transmission; thus, PI alpacas appear well suited to serve as a reservoir for BVDV transmission. The uniform prominent staining of cutaneous sites implies that skin biopsy can be a useful screening sample for PI alpacas, as it is in cattle.</p><p>We report the occurrence of ocular dysplasia in 1 PI alpaca associated with BVDV infection; BVDV antigen was localized in the lesion by IHC.

It would appear that PI status affects susceptibility to secondary infections as it does in cattle through immunosuppression. Cattle in this study were identified in screening programs to detect and remove carriers and thus were less likely to have secondary lesions compared with alpacas tested for diagnosis of illness. Thymic atrophy noted in alpacas, characterized grossly by decreased size and microscopically by replacement with adipose tissue, may represent age-related involution or stress, as lymphoid depletion did not occur in PI alpacas.</p><p>There were profound differences in the bone marrow between the 2 species, with infrequent or minimal antigen labeling in alpacas compared with calves.

The data suggest that the sequelae of enhanced secondary infection and ill thrift and the importance of PI alpacas as reservoirs of infection are comparable to those of PI cattle. Skin is likely to be a useful diagnostic sample for screening live animals in addition to blood. Skin, C3 compartment of the stomach, cerebrum, parotid and submandibular salivary glands, thyroid, thymus, esophagus, nasal turbinate, and lung tissue stained consistently for BVDV antigen and will be useful to detect PI alpacas at necropsy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Ed Dubovi for identification of the PI alpacas, Dr. Stephen Ferree for performing necropsies on 2 of the calves, and Mal Hoover for assistance on revisions to the images.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0300985812447827"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0300985812447827"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research Division [grant no.
