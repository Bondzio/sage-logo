<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Findings about the association of left-handedness and ADHD are inconsistent. While abnormal brain laterality is reported in children with ADHD, it is unclear if hand preference is associated with ADHD, severity symptoms, age, gender, comorbid psychiatric problems, or parental characteristics. <bold>Method:</bold> Subjects were 520 boys and girls with a mean age of 9.04 (2.3) years. Only four children were with mixed-handedness. ADHD was diagnosed according to clinical assessment using accepted diagnostic criteria. In addition to the demographic characteristics and hand-use preference, inattention severity, hyperactivity severity, oppositional behavior symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and developmental coordination problems were assessed. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 87.4% were right handed. A total of 12.6% were left handed. Left- or right-hand preference was not associated with age, gender, inattentiveness score, hyperactivity-impulsivity score, comorbid psychiatric problems, developmental coordination problems score, or parental characteristics. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Left handedness is not associated with higher parent-reported inattentiveness or hyperactivity. Hand-use preference is not gender related in ADHD.</p>

<body>
<p>ADHD is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. About more than 10% of primary school–aged children have screening symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Hand preference is heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711429789">Llaurens, Raymond, &amp; Faurie, 2009</xref>). The scores of the Hand Preference Scale are highly correlated with writing hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711429789">Corey, Hurley, &amp; Foundas, 2001</xref>). Some of the mental and medical health problems are associated with laterality. For example, high blood pressure and epilepsy are more common in non-right-handed individuals than right-handed persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711429789">Bryden, Bruyn, &amp; Fletcher, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the incidence of autoimmune diseases in immediate families of individuals with left handedness is higher than those with right handedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711429789">Morfit &amp; Weekes, 2001</xref>). Some psychological health problems are also associated with handedness too. For example, mixed-handedness individuals are more prone to psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711429789">Preti, Sardu, &amp; Piga, 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, left handedness is not a pathological sign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711429789">Reiss &amp; Reiss, 2002</xref>). Right- or left handers as general categories are criticized by some authors. They suggest that it can be as a function of the tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711429789">Llaurens et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Abnormal laterality of brain in ADHD has widely been studied. An electroencephalography (EEG) study indicated that laterality (L &gt; R) is reduced in delta, alpha, beta, and gamma in ADHD. The reduced laterality is negatively associated with inattentiveness and the total scores of inattentiveness/hyperactivity/impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711429789">Barry, Clarke, McCarthy, &amp; Selikowitz, 2009</xref>). Of course, it is not clear whether it is a compensatory phenomenon compared with the healthy controls. Right caudate and its gray matter volume is smaller in ADHD patients than in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711429789">Almeida Montes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711429789">Silk, Vance, Rinehart, Bradshaw, &amp; Cunnington, 2009</xref>). This smaller volume is associated with the number of <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711429789">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711429789">Almeida Montes et al., 2010</xref>). It is also supported by a functional magnetic resonance imaging study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711429789">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). Attentional networks in right brain are impaired in ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711429789">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, enhanced laterality at short-medium interelectrode distances in EEG is associated with good response to methylphenidate in ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711429789">Dupuy, Clarke, Barry, McCarthy, &amp; Selikowitz, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings about the association of left-hand use and ADHD are inconsistent. Left-hand use is preferred, and it has been proposed as a risk factor for ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711429789">Niederhofer, 2005</xref>). However, others did not confirm it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711429789">Biederman et al., 1995</xref>). A more recent study using parent- and teacher-reported questionnaires indicated that mixed-handedness was associated with the higher severity of inattentiveness in children and adolescents with ADHD. However, it was not associated with ADHD hyperactivity symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711429789">Rodriguez et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, the rate of mixed-handedness by a longitudinal, population-based birth cohort study on 7,871 children and adolescents was reported to be 1.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711429789">Rodriguez et al., 2010</xref>). Mixed-handedness reflects atypical brain laterality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711429789">Rodriguez &amp; Waldenstrom, 2008</xref>). It increases the risk of ADHD symptoms in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711429789">Rodriguez &amp; Waldenstrom, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>ADHD is supposed to be a right hemisphere dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711429789">Sandson, Bachna, &amp; Morin, 2000</xref>). Right hemispheric brain pathology affects the control of the left hand in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711429789">Rommelse et al., 2007</xref>). A study on children with ADHD reported that 48.4% were right handed, 48.4% had crossed laterality, and 3.2% had undefined laterality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711429789">Poeta &amp; Rosa-Neto, 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>Although abnormality of laterality of brain has been widely studied in ADHD, the possible association of this laterality to clinical symptoms has not yet been cleared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711429789">Hale et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the results of previous studies are contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711429789">Biederman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711429789">Niederhofer, 2005</xref>). To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations of hand-use preference with the severity of inattention and hyperactivity in children with ADHD. Moreover, this study considers the impact of covariate factors of age, gender, comorbidities, and parental characteristics.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for considering these covariates. Age is associated with the remission of symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711429789">Gau et al., 2010</xref>). Children’s age moderates the association between attention problems and academic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711429789">Kawabata, Tseng, &amp; Gau, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a debate about the association of gender with the symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh, 2009</xref>). Inattentiveness and hyperactivity are reported in boys more than girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711429789">Burns, Walsh, Gomez, &amp; Hafetz, 2006</xref>). Girls with ADHD are less impulsive than boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711429789">Newcorn et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, developmental coordination problems are very common in children with ADHD. Its rate is more than 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711429789">Kopp, Beckung, &amp; Gillberg, 2010</xref>). The impairment of bimanual coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711429789">Klimkeit, Sheppard, Lee, &amp; Bradshaw, 2004</xref>) and impaired handwriting performance are frequently reported in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711429789">Racine, Majnemer, Shevell, &amp; Snider, 2008</xref>). About 30.6% of children with developmental coordination disorder are left handed and 13.3% are ambidextrous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711429789">Goez &amp; Zelnik, 2008</xref>). The rate of left-hand dominance in children with developmental coordination is higher than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711429789">Goez &amp; Zelnik, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a very common comorbid psychiatric disorder in children with ADHD. It has been reported to be 59.3% in a clinical sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh, Mohammadi, &amp; Moini, 2008</xref>). Behavioral and emotional difficulties are more common in children with ADHD and ODD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711429789">Kawabata et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, lateralization is associated with socioeconomic status (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711429789">Boles, 2011</xref>). Parental characteristics were considered to represent SES.</p>
<p>Considering the covariant factors, it is hypothesized that the clinical symptoms of ADHD are not associated with hand-use preference.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants of this study are 520 children and adolescents referred to a Child and Adolescents Psychiatry Clinic affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. The study was conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 2000. The aim of the study was explained for the participants. The children and their parents provided their assent and written informed consent, respectively, for voluntary participation in this study. The participants had the opportunity to ask their questions or any concern for their participation. It was guaranteed that their responses will be confidential. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.</p>

<sec id="section3-1087054711429789">
<title>ADHD Diagnosis</title>
<p>ADHD diagnosis was made using the Farsi version of Kiddie–Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh, Mohammadi, &amp; Yazdanshenas, 2006</xref>). K-SADS is a semistructured interview, which is used for children and adolescents. It has two parts, including a screening section and an appendix section. In the first part, psychiatric disorders are screened. Then, psychiatric disorders are confirmed by conducting the second part. Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711429789">APA, 2000</xref>). The Farsi version of K-SADS has enough validity and test–retest and interrater reliabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh et al., 2006</xref>). Test–retest and interrater reliability for ADHD are .81 and .69, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh et al., 2006</xref>). All the children and adolescents and at least one of their parents were examined and interviewed face-to-face. All subtypes of ADHD were included. Children with clinically estimated or recorded mental retardation in their medical records were excluded. Autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and serious general medical conditions such as reported thyroid dysfunction were other exclusive criteria. Routine clinical care for ADHD was provided for all of the children and adolescents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087054711429789">
<title>Developmental Coordination Disorder–Questionnaire (DCD-Q)</title>
<p>DCD-Q was used to measure subtle motor problems. The Farsi version of DCD-Q was used. It has sufficient validity and reliability. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711429789">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). The Farsi version has been used in children with ADHD. It is a parent-reported 11-items questionnaire with Likert-type responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1087054711429789">
<title>Handedness</title>
<p>The children were asked to write a sentence or draw a picture. Parents were also asked about hand-use preference by their children. Is your child a right-hand user (right handed) or a left-hand user (left handed)? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711429789">Rodriguez et al., 2010</xref>). The degree of handedness is positively correlated with cerebral lateralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711429789">Bourne, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1087054711429789">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>SPSS 15.0 for Windows was used to analyze the data. The association of gender with handedness was examined by chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was rune to explore the (adjusted) relationships of handedness with age, gender, comorbidities, coordination problems, and parental characteristics. The two common comorbid behavioral problems, including oppositional behavior and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) scores were included. The number of <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms of ODD and SAD were considered as their severities. The number of <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms for ADHD was considered as severity of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh &amp; Jafari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711429789">Volk, Todorov, Hay, &amp; Todd, 2009</xref>). There was a Likert-type response to the symptoms of ADHD, ODD, and SAD. The score ranged from <italic>never</italic> = 0, <italic>sometimes</italic> = 1, <italic>often</italic> = 2, to <italic>almost always</italic> = 3. Therefore, continuous variables were as follows: age; inattentiveness score, hyperactivity score, oppositional behavior score, anxiety score, and coordination problems score; and parental age and educational level. Gender and handedness were categorical variables. As the number of children with mixed-handedness was very low, statistical analysis was conducted on children with right- or left-hand-use preference.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1087054711429789" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The participants were 520 children and adolescents with ADHD. Only 4 children were with mixed-handedness who were not included in the analysis. A total of 451 (87.4%) were right handed. In all, 12.6% were left handed. A total of 392 (76.1%) of them were boys. Their mean age was 9.04 (2.3) years.</p>
<p>The means of father’s and mother’s age were 39.4 (6.09) and 33.2 (5.4) years, respectively. The educational levels of fathers and mothers were 11.2 (3.8) and 11.3 (4.1) years, respectively.</p>
<p>Logistic regression analysis indicated that none of the variables of age, gender, father’s educational level; age, mother’s educational level; and age, developmental coordination score, ODD score, SAD score, inattention score, and hyperactivity score were related to hand-use preference in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711429789">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible predictors of hand-use preference in children and adolescents with ADHD. A finding of this study is that hand-use preference in children is not associated with age, gender, comorbidity with oppositional defiant behaviors, anxiety symptoms, severity of inattentiveness, and severity of hyperactivity-impulsivity. A study on 28 children with ADHD reported that non-right-handedness is associated with higher parent-reported attentional symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711429789">Reid &amp; Norvilitis, 2000</xref>). Lack of association of gender and hand-use preference does not support that brain lateralization is different between genders in children with ADHD.</p>
<p>In addition, hand-use preference was not associated with parental characteristics including age, educational level, and job. This supports that handedness in children with ADHD is independent of SES. It may suggest that biological factors rather than socioeconomic factors play a role for hand-use preference in children with ADHD or that hand-use preference is less sensitive to the environmental influence in both genders.</p>
<p>Current results support the hypothesis that hand-use preference is not associated with the type and severity of ADHD symptoms. It is not consistent with the results of previous studies. In the current study, many covariant factors were included and this is a possible explanation for this difference.</p>
<p>The rate of mixed-handedness was very low. This rate is very close to the rate reported from a community sample of children and adolescents (1.1%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711429789">Rodriguez et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, mixed-handedness is not a common condition in children with ADHD in the clinical sample. In addition, low rate of mixed-handedness does not support the assumption that mixed-handedness is associated with some psychological health problems such as proneness to psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711429789">Preti et al., 2007</xref>). Another explanation for this discrepancy is that the pathophysiology of ADHD and psychosis is completely different.</p>
<p>This study assesses hand-use preference via parents’ report and investigator’s observation. However, this study consisted of a large sample of children. The authors could not find any published study that investigated the association of handedness by severity of ADHD and covariant factors. In addition, ADHD was diagnosed according to face-to-face interview using <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria. Furthermore, the analysis was adjusted for the covariant factors.</p>
<p>However, there are some limitations for this study. This study relied on parental report and the observation of the children’s writing. The parents complected a questionnaire to report the severity of inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711429789">Ghanizadeh &amp; Jafari, 2010</xref>). Further studies should be conducted using interview-based reports or objective measures. There are some instruments for measuring handedness, including the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, which may be used in further studies. Sometimes there is a combination of preference for use of hand, eye, and foot. An individual with left-hand-use preference may not prefer to use his or her left foot, eye, and ear. In addition, hand-use preference may not represent lateralization of brain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, hand-use preference in children and adolescents with ADHD is independent of inattention symptoms, hyperactivity symptoms, age, gender, comorbidity with psychiatric problems, and parental characteristics.</p>
