<sec id="sec1-1742395311417638" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the experiences of young women who have been diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). DDH isa spectrum of hip pathologies which rangefrom asymptomatic subtle radiographic signsto mild instability, through to frank dislocations with an abnormal acetabulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395311417638">1</xref></sup> Approximately 1 out of every 20 full-term babies has some hip instability and 2–3 per 1000 will require treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395311417638">2</xref></sup> It is more common in the left hip and bilateral in around 50% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395311417638">3</xref></sup> Eighty percent of all people with DDH are female. DDH may be secondary to infantile hip dysplasia and some patients may have residual dysplasia following earlier treatment; in others, the link with neonatal instability is less clear and there may be no history of infantile hip problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395311417638">4</xref></sup> While it is widely accepted that an early diagnosis of DDH is most beneficial for patient outcome, many cases go undetected until early adulthood, by which time treatment becomes very invasive and traumatic for patients.</p>
<p>Living with this chronic condition poses many challenges for young women. These begin from the first onset of symptoms onto eventual diagnosis of the condition and treatment choice. Initial symptom onset, depending on the severity of the DDH, is usually pain; typically this pain may come on suddenly after several hours of pain-free exercise. Over time, someone with DDH will report a dull aching sensation around the hip on exertion most of the time. They may develop a Trendelenburg limp, restricted range of motion and a marked deterioration in their basic quality of life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395311417638">2</xref></sup> and often a rapid deterioration leading to arthritis.</p>
<p>The search for a diagnosis poses further problems. Initially, the condition is often confused with muscular pain, because of its reporting as arising when exercising. This also tends to mean that the woman does not seek a diagnosis straight away. An experienced surgeon is often needed to make the diagnosis as it can be missed before the symptoms become severe and pain and mobility are compromised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311417638">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following diagnosis, the pathway to treatment is still problematic. The woman is left with many choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395311417638">Figure 1</xref>). As symptoms worsen, the doctor and woman may consider two categories of surgery. The first (peri-acetabular osteotomy, PAO) reshapes, redirects or salvages bone in order to preserve the natural joint for as long as possible and it may prevent progression of the condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395311417638">6</xref></sup> Femoral osteotomy may also be required if the primary structural abnormality is in the proximal femur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395311417638">7</xref></sup> Depending on the extent of degenerative change, it should be possible to predict whether full symptomatic relief is expected, or whether the operation is intended purely to prevent further deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395311417638">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311417638">10</xref></sup> Fully understanding this complex and multi-sequenced option is challenging and compounded by limited certainty over risks and positive outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395311417638">6</xref></sup> Moreover, as PAO is a specialised procedure, it requires a skilled surgeon (there are only a handful in the UK), posing potential challenges for the woman in their identification and gaining appropriate referral.
<fig id="fig1-1742395311417638" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Indicative decision pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395311417638-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The second option, resurfacing or total hip replacement (THR), replaces the entire joint and is used in cases of severe pain, considerably compromised mobility and when cartilage is significantly worn. With resurfacing, more bone is preserved which would allow a subsequent THR. A THR has a limited long-term outcome in younger active patients and would not be appropriate in the early stages when symptoms are mild or moderate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395311417638">11</xref></sup> Multiple revisions of THRs are however problematic.</p>
<p>Yet further difficult decisions arise with bilateral patients, in particular, whether and when to intervene on the other hip. If the patient is symptomatic, evidence suggests operating before there is any further cartilage damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311417638">12</xref></sup> With asymptomatic hips the decision is not so clear. While realigning the hip will prevent damage in the future, there is the risk of the patient undergoing major surgery. There is however little available evidence as to which route to take, complicating the patient’s decision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395311417638">13</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec2-1742395311417638"><title>Diagnosis and its impact</title>
<p>Research in chronic illness has highlighted how people respond to a diagnosis, adjust, live with their condition and cope with the impact on their lives. Diagnosis helps to give meaning to the illness experience, providing an explanation for symptoms, imposing order and regaining control over the illness experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311417638">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395311417638">16</xref></sup> Gaining a diagnosis also gives hope about treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395311417638">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395311417638">18</xref></sup> As DDH patients often suffer arthritic pain at an early age and potentially face major surgery with uncertain outcomes, accepting the diagnosis may be particularly difficult. Adams et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311417638">14</xref></sup> and Kralik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395311417638">19</xref></sup> found that if the diagnosis is not deemed compatible with the individual’s identity it may not be accepted. Searching for ways to manage and live with ongoing symptoms then becomes part of a person’s life and she/he may delay seeking help or go into denial.</p>
<p>Once a diagnosis has been made the individual goes through a process of adjustment, engaging in a cognitive search to interpret and make sense of their symptoms. Those viewing their illness as more serious and as less controllable have been found to have poorer health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395311417638">20</xref></sup> In contrast, seeking social support and beliefs that the illness is controllable is associated with better outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311417638">21</xref></sup> This has implications for DDH as this is a condition that can require several episodes of surgery and periods of pain, disability and rehabilitation throughout a lifetime. Yet other research has demonstrated that persons without a clear diagnosis and treatment plan find themselves in a ‘psychological limbo’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395311417638">22</xref></sup> This again is pertinent for persons with DDH because often the pathway to a definitive diagnosis is not straightforward. Moreover, treatment and expected outcomes, and thus risks, cannot always be explained as they are often not clear at the outset of surgery.</p>
<p>Often, following diagnosis, people feel that their knowledge is incomplete and that they require further information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395311417638">19</xref></sup> One increasingly common source of information is the Internet and, in particular, online message boards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395311417638">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395311417638">24</xref></sup> These can be particularly valuable where the condition is not well known and restrictions on the person’s lifestyle may be a common experience; both are the case for DDH. As other research has demonstrated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395311417638">25</xref></sup> persons may also turn to an online support group, as communication with others in the same situation can be both compelling and supportive. West and Witt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395311417638">26</xref></sup> draw attention to ‘feeling very alone’ with no-one to tell her what life after a PAO would be like and how it might affect her.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395311417638"><title>Aim of the article</title>
<p>This article reports on findings from an exploratory, in-depth study of five women who used an online support group for persons with DDH. It seeks to provide insight into their experiences, and in particular the multiple challenges that they face, following diagnosis and up to the point of PAO surgery.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395311417638" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>As befits an exploratory study, a research method was needed to enable easy capture of the experience of women early on in their DDH journey and to follow them over time as they made choices about what to do following diagnosis. An Internet search was undertaken in order to identify a suitable message board aimed at young women diagnosed with DDH.</p>
<p>The term ‘hip dysplasia, congenital hip dysplasia (CHD) DDH ’ was put into the <italic>Google</italic> search engine, and the first ten websites with message boards that did not require a username or password were selected for further examination. Seven of the message boards focused on general hip problems, but DDH came up only as an occasional thread. The other three focused solely on DDH. These three message boards were monitored to establish which sites were the most active and popular. An active site was considered to be one that contained multiple updates in the form of new messages and posted replies daily. The most active board was chosen for the final data collection.</p>
<p>The data collection targeted five, purposively selected users who posted regularly and over time (one up to a year) on the site. To gain insight into a potential diverse range of experiences, the users were chosen to ensure variability in terms of type of diagnosis (bilateral or unilateral), time of first diagnosis (previous diagnosis or history of surgery as a child <italic>v.</italic> no previous history or sudden diagnosis) and participant age. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, focus lay on looking at a small number of users in detail. A retrospective period of discussions was downloaded into a Microsoft Word document. Collecting data retrospectively ensured that completed discussions (threads) were captured and analysed.</p>
<p>This article draws on data from the selected participants from their first posting on the message board until the last post prior to the day of PAO surgery. These participants all highlighted the dates when they were going for surgery. A subsequent examination will be made of the postings of these users from after PAO surgery, telling stories of their recovery post-surgery and subsequent decision making relating to treatment of the other hip. University ethical approval for the study was obtained. In order to protect the anonymity of its members, the message board is not identified and each woman is given a pseudonym.</p>
<p>The study was informed by the approach of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). IPA aims ‘to explore in detail how participants are making sense of their personal and social world’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395311417638">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395311417638">28</xref></sup> It has been used to analyse message boards for people with complex conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395311417638">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395311417638">25</xref></sup> IPA’s focus lies on exploring the participant’s meanings surrounding particular experiences, events and states. One of the authors (Tina Gambling) read the first transcript in detail, identified significant, interesting themes and then applied these themes across the other four transcripts, adding additional themes as necessary. Both authors independently listed these themes and organised them into meaningful clusters; points of disagreement were resolved through discussion. The resultant clusters were labelled in a way that captured their essence. The clustered themes were then examined for evidence of convergence across all the transcripts, to identify any overarching master concepts relevant to the participants. Finally, both authors jointly explored the interrelationship between primary and secondary subordinate themes and their relationship to the master concepts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395311417638"><title>Findings</title>
<sec id="sec6-1742395311417638"><title>The participants</title>
<p>The selected participants had a range of ages of presentation (infant, child and young adult), providing the potential for diverse experiences of living and adjusting to DDH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395311417638">Table 1</xref>). Two of the women (Keely and Heidi) had surgery for DDH when they were very young and so were aware they had the condition, although not its possible impact on them. They both had a prolonged period through childhood and adolescence with very few signs or symptoms of DDH and were able to live a relatively normal life. One woman (Beth) was diagnosed as an infant but did not have any treatment for DDH and, while having problems throughout childhood, the symptoms were not severe enough to warrant further treatment until her 20s. The other two women (Catrin and Anna) were not diagnosed until later life. The time length of the postings for the cases ranged from 4 to 14 months, and the number of postings varied substantially, from 50 to 335 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395311417638">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec7-1742395311417638"><title>The major concepts: ‘Challenging the Life Course and Identity as a Young Woman’ and ‘Saving My Joints’</title>
<p>Two major concepts were prominent across participants’ accounts; first, ‘challenging the life course and identity as a young woman’ and second, ‘saving my joints’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742395311417638">Figure 2</xref> shows the cluster surrounding the first major concept surrounding diagnosis/re-diagnosis. Central was the women’s description of how the diagnosis of DDH had affected their quality of life and how it challenged the way they viewed themselves as young women. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742395311417638">Figure 3</xref> shows the cluster surrounding the second major concept, relating to issues arising post-diagnosis. Once the women began to understand the long-term implications of having DDH, they all began a quest to save their ‘native joint’, delaying the need for an artificial joint for as long as possible. Each concept is explicated in turn below, drawing on selected aspects from the related cluster, beginning with cluster one, and findings related to the subordinate theme ‘realising something more serious’ and the major concept ‘challenging the life course and identity as a young woman.’
<fig id="fig2-1742395311417638" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The first concept and associated cluster of sub-ordinate themes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395311417638-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig3-1742395311417638" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The second major concept and associated cluster of sub-ordinate themes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395311417638-fig3.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742395311417638"><title>‘Realising Something More Serious’</title>
<p>All the women explicitly described their symptoms pre-diagnosis as wide ranging, from mild to incredibly debilitating. They most often focused on levels of pain, site of pain, what brings the pain on and how long they have experienced pain. They differed however in how long they took to realise their symptoms indicated something more serious and to seek a diagnosis and decide on treatment.</p>
<p>The three women with known DDH tended to wait until their symptoms were fairly debilitating before seeking help. Often the women reflected on things they could no longer do and how the pain had affected their quality of life. Sometimes this level of disability just crept up and began to compromise their quality of life.<disp-quote>
<p>‘It’s been 10 years of increasing debilitation … I just gave up the things that made my hip worse but before I knew it I had no life. I ended up waiting until my life was really crap and I could barely walk before I started finding out about specialists’ (Catrin)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women already knew that they were going to face surgery at some point in their lifetime. Often this made things more difficult to deal with.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I've always known that at some point I'd need surgery… At the grand age of 26 the time seems to have come….I think I just wanna live with the pain than make this decision!’ (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Their experience contrasted with that of the two women who were unaware of any issues with their hips. Their initial postings indicated that while problems were apparent, these had not yet started to really impinge on their quality of life. Pain and problems with mobility often occurred post exercise/activity.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I started getting spasms in my groin… this was bad when I tried to drive and gradually I had to stop running… Then I went to a specialist.’ (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742395311417638"><title>Challenging the life course and identity as a young woman</title>
<p>Once the women had a diagnosis, they struggled to interpret and comprehend the serious impact this condition may have on their lives. The focus at this point was not just on immediate treatment and how serious this was in terms of having to undergo major surgery but how DDH could change their ‘life course and identity as a young woman’. Keely describes below the difficulties she faced understanding that she had an arthritic condition that usually affected older people.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I am 39 now in constant pain … my hip often gives way without warning …. I feel like an old lady… What does the future now hold for me?’ (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Others talked in terms of being ‘thrown off a pathway’ in terms of where life was taking them.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I am a scientist I am on my feet all day, I worry is this the job for me anymore …. should I be thinking about changing career?’ (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women felt that it was hard to talk about DDH to other people, a possible reason for their seeking out and using an online support group. They described instances where other people had asked them why they were limping and their struggle in explaining.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I have a visible limp I get fed up with people asking me what I have done I want to scream, “I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING, I HAVE DDH”. I have ended up just making excuses and saying … I have injured myself. It’s just easier than explaining you have (a) chronic condition and you limp in a way old people do.’ (Heidi)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Those with milder symptoms worried about having surgery and were concerned that their surgery might make things worse.<disp-quote>
<p>‘My symptoms are mild now but I worry if I have the op that I will be worse off … I have no idea how bad it is. I can only hope that the fact that I have got through to 46 without knowing that I had anything wrong means that is isn't that bad.’ (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women tried to be positive about life after surgery and living with DDH and were beginning to research and think about goals post-surgery. For example, Anna was determined not to give up marathon running.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I have led one of those text book lives - 3 text book pregnancies, then all of a sudden WHAM! But I don't give in easily and I told my consultant that I won't give up running without a fight. I have my place for the London Marathon…and I will be there - walking if need be.’ (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women also asked questions from others who had had surgery to find out what kind of lives they were living and what they were able to do and they began to think about a future living with DDH.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I am trying to keep fit by cycling and swimming, also running in the pool with an aqua jogger…. So riding a bike to music would do just as well… I am starting to get very excited! There is life after being Hip!’ (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1742395311417638"><title>‘Saving My Joints’</title>
<p>After the shock of diagnosis and challenges it posed to their identity as a young woman and the life they might have expected, the content of the postings up to the time of their PAO surgery changed and centred on striving to ‘save my joints’. To illustrate the nature of this second major concept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742395311417638">Figure 3</xref>), findings for the sub-ordinate themes, ‘pros and cons of different treatments’ and ‘understanding the outcomes and reassessing lifestyle‘, are presented.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1742395311417638"><title>Pros and cons of different treatments</title>
<p>All the women’s postings demonstrated their need to gather lots of information and ‘facts’ about treatments and outcomes. This was sought from several sources including their consultant(s), the Internet and fellow participants within the message board. They used the discussion group to ask questions, verify information, and seek opinions and find out others’ experiences. They often felt traumatised and very uncertain with the choices they had to make and often in a short period of time.</p>
<p>After gaining a lot of medical information, the women tended to ask each other very specific questions about DDH in order to understand more about the condition and to compare themselves with each other. Keely wanted to compare her DDH with other women.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I wondered …what degree of coverage do you have? … I have mild dysplasia, with coverage of 18 degrees and borderline is 25 degrees, so wouldn't need too much correction.’ (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women understood and could articulate to each other the hierarchy of treatments and risk, outcomes and recovery time. While the information the women exchanged was highly medicalised, it was aiding understand of factors that would lead to a successful PAO. In the extended extract below, Beth demonstrates her understanding of the medical picture and shares her own experiences, passing both on to assist others’ decision-making. Her posting also illustrates the difficulties of the choices the women have to make; for Beth, the odds of success are moderate, yet she is prepared to grasp the chance in the hope that it will give her a few years before a joint replacement is needed.<disp-quote>
<p>‘There are two main things to take into consideration: your age and the deterioration of the hip joint. A PAO is a long, hard surgery to recover from and is usually only performed on younger patients (&lt;50) for that reason. Recovery may be months as opposed to weeks with resurfacing/replacement. The deterioration of the joint will determine how successful the outcome of a PAO will be...I have the beginning indicative signs of OA [osteo-arthritis] (couple of cysts) but my cartilage is still intact - my OS [orthopaedic surgeon] quoted me a 70% chance of success with mine (still awaiting). But your age may factor into this, if you only expect a PAO to last 5-10yrs due to some already underlying OA then you need to make up your mind if it's worth it to stave off the time you'll eventually need a replacement (hopefully via a resurface). For me at 26yrs old, I'd take the chance since I don't want a replacement before 50. If the PAO didn't work you could then have a resurface, and when that has lived its life (which we really don't know how long) then replace the joint totally. It's a tough decision. I was given the exact same choice earlier in the year, but after tests it seems a waste to resurface my hip when we could try salvaging the cartilage with a PAO.’ (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Often the women tried to find somebody who was very similar to themselves to compare stories, help in making decisions and verify they were normal or that theirs was a normal illness trajectory.<disp-quote>
<p>‘Do you know whether you would need a femoral osteotomy as well if your leg length or alignment is incorrect at the end of the operation?’ (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>There was also great concern over what to do with the other hip. Again, others’ opinions and experiences were sought and contrasted.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I’m bilateral my right isn’t bothering me so I think I will leave that until I get any pain.’ (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, Anna was looking to have her other hip operated soon after the first before there was any cartilage damage.<disp-quote>
<p>‘My surgeon said it’s best to get in there and PAO it before there is any cartilage damage. I’m looking to get them done 6 months apart … it only wipes out 18 months of my life.’ (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1742395311417638"><title>Understanding the outcomes and reassessing their lifestyle</title>
<p>The women were keen to obtain detailed individual information in order to assess their own possible (and actual) outcomes. Keely was seeking comparisons of the recovery process from others who had had similar PAO surgeries.<disp-quote>
<p>‘Anyone out there similar to me ...My dysplasia is quite mild … but I have been told I have a lot of cartilage damage in there.....Is there anyone been told similar?... I don’t want to go for such big surgery if I’m doomed.’ (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women asked those who had had surgery about their outcomes and experiences.<disp-quote>
<p>‘Can I ask how old you were when you had your PAO, and what was the prognosis if you didn't have it done?’ (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Anna noted the irony of her surgeon’s comment that ‘if I had had it done 20 years ago then I wouldn't even have to consider a THR.’</p>
<p>It is notable that this group of women were interested in long-term outcomes. They wanted to hear from other women 10 or 15 years down the illness trajectory, in particular, about quality of life and activities those women had been able to do post-op and whether they felt the surgery was worthwhile.<disp-quote>
<p>‘Were you told to avoid any sports … (and did you)? How are you and what can you do? Do you feel any different? I’m worried about feeling more lop-sided, losing range of motion or having a big leg length difference? How many years have you had pain free, do you limp at all, have you led a normal life since, what about kids were you able to have them? ’ (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Often the women asked about how they felt after the surgery. This seemed to be particularly important for Heidi who was coping with extreme symptoms at the pre-op stage; she needed to be able to see surgery as a positive thing.<disp-quote>
<p>‘How is life afterwards? How long time has it taken to get back on track? …Now I’m just preparing my self mentally, physically and nutritionally …’ (Heidi)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They also looked at reassessing their lifestyle to prolong the life of their hip and discussed associated dilemmas. The next two extracts illustrate the conflicting thoughts women had prior to surgery.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I feel if I gave up running it may give me a few more years post PAO, if its’ only something like 5 then I think I will carry on running because I love doing that but if it was say 10 / 15 then I would find another way to get my endorphins maybe cycling.’ (Anna)</p>
<p>‘I would do everything in my power to save my hip for as long as possible…I would I just want to be able to walk normally and not be in any pain. That’s really it for me.’ (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, after the shock of diagnosis and challenges posed, discussions focused on ‘saving my joints’. These were fuelled by a fear of having an artificial joint at such a young age. The women sought advice and information from others and demonstrated ongoing or prior concurrent access to other sources of information, such as the Internet, to supplement that given by clinicians. Through the online support group, they were able to share and ask questions as they needed and to talk to others who were similar to themselves to share experiences. For example, after her search for advice, Beth expresses how she is starting to perceive a lifetime of possible surgeries, periods of pain and disability ahead and beginning to reflect on lifestyle choices with a view to possibly delaying each surgery. She shared her thoughts with other women.<disp-quote>
<p>‘This is my conclusion to date. I feel it’s necessary for me to push back the date I'll need a THR as far as possible into the future. If that means undergoing a PAO that might give me 10yrs, I'll nearly be 40. Then I may be eligible for resurfacing that might give my hip another 10yrs, which will push me into my 50's. ..Also, some very wise cookie said to me “you can always go forward from a PAO, you can't go backwards from an artificial implant”….I think that was the moment right there, “Yes, I'm going to give PAO a go!”.... I also feel if I’m sensible I can make each last as long as possible. They say don’t impact or run on dysplastic hips as they will wear quicker .. so I reckon if I stick to cycling (and) swimming I’m giving myself more hip years yep I can live with that in return for no pain.’ (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Beth’s conclusions are typical as the women strove to empower themselves by sharing their personal experiences and knowledge and hearing from others.</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1742395311417638" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings demonstrate the personal nature and diversity of the journeys the women followed in their search for a diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The interactions between the women were rich and informative, demonstrating understanding of complex medical information. They also drew on and shared detailed and very personal experiences. The postings showed the devastating impact of DDH for women, who were often diagnosed at a time when they were either about to move into adulthood, make decisions about work and child-bearing, or when they were immersed in these important life events.</p>
<p>The findings add to the existing knowledge on coping with a diagnosis and treatment decisions within the relatively unexplored context of DDH. Only two papers were uncovered in the literature on experiences of people with this condition;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395311417638">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395311417638">26</xref></sup> both provide insight into their journey and approach to coping following diagnosis with DDH. Wells’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395311417638">29</xref></sup> experience is well captured in her phrase, ‘moving through pain’. Similarly, but also in contrast, is the account of the trainee surgeon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395311417638">26</xref></sup> her experience of being diagnosed with bilateral DDH and becoming a patient; she talks in terms of ‘being in a state of despair’ when faced with ‘prolonged recovery and rehabilitation periods’, ‘feeling very alone’ and her subsequent identification of a charity, Steps. Such comments find echoes within the postings of the women in our exploratory study.</p>
<p>Our participants played a very active role in their attempt to gather knowledge about DDH. The discussion board, accessible 24 h a day and from their own space, enabled them to ask questions (and receive answers) as and when questions occurred to them, meaning that they did not have to wait until their next medical appointment, or a traditional, face-to-face patient support group. The message board therefore played a key role in individuals’ decision-making processes. Users of the message board were able to access a large amount of rich experiential information (that is not generally available in information leaflets) and feed it into their decision making.</p>
<p>Cohering with the work of Hadert and Rodham,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395311417638">25</xref></sup> the message board provided users with an opportunity to rant and to vent frustrations about their diagnosis; this perhaps could not be expressed in their ‘off-line’ world, It also highlights the need for healthcare professionals to help those diagnosed with DDH to find ways to express their feelings, rather than keeping more negative feelings to themselves.</p>
<p>Our findings point to some positive messages about living with DDH. Some were adjusting and coping in a positive way through staying active. Some set themselves positive goals to achieve post-surgery, such as entering a marathon. These examples of positive emotional expression, articulated through the discussion board, could provide other users of the support group with helpful role models, to assist in psychological adjustment. The women who could see the positive side of their experiences were modelling the use of an active coping style, wherein events are positively reinterpreted and linked to more positive health outcomes, and thus, as, Fredrickson’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395311417638">30</xref></sup> review of the literature on positive emotions concluded, serve a health protection function.</p>
<p>Adjusting to the diagnosis was difficult for these women. The diagnosis impacted on their perceived identity and they all struggled to cope. The ways that these women searched for more information, in this instance within the online group, and their expressed problems with adjustment to the diagnosis concur with other literature centred on the challenge of adjustment in a context where a clear diagnosis and treatment plan is not offered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395311417638">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>A primary focus in the process of adjustment was to save their joints, our second major concept. As often their consultants were not able to answer questions regarding how long they would have before needing further surgery or the sorts of activities they would be able to do, the women sought advice from women further along the treatment pathway. Their questions were very personal and sensitive and covered a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>This small-scale, exploratory study of five women’s postings on an online support group has provided a window into some experiences of women with DDH. Its strength lies in its reliance on the women’s own accounts and theoretically directed selection of cases to maximise the likelihood of accessing diverse experiences. However, the lens adopted was, purposely, limited: time points on the woman’s illness trajectory (from first posting to having a PAO); sample size; and focus on a single discussion forum. The selected participants may not be representative of all those who have DDH. Indeed, forum participants are likely to be those who are more concerned about their diagnosis and treatment options and want to be proactive in finding out as much as they can. By implication, those who are more vulnerable and less proactive may not have taken the first step of looking for and joining, and/or active posting, in such a forum. A further limitation of analysing such discussion group data is that it is not possible to ask the members to expand on particular points of interest or ambiguity (as would be done in the course of an interview). The findings are based on our interpretation of the participants’ use of the message board. Further work in a more extended study could valuably include interviews and further explore the themes found in this exploratory study.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1742395311417638" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>DDH potentially provides a critical case for the process of adjustment. Its treatment pathway and rehabilitation are lengthy and both physically and emotionally demanding. This suggests, as these women demonstrate, close engagement and commitment and mental strength to enable adjustment and coping with the condition. Insight into patients’ experiences also provides valuable indications of patient-meaningful and patient-significant outcome and outcome measures to guide clinical effectiveness studies. Our findings point to the need for more research on the experiences of women with DDH, in particular, the differential experiences of women diagnosed as a child and those diagnosed in young or later adulthood, and exploration of short- and long-term coping strategies. Future research might take the form of further investigation of online support groups, alongside longitudinal studies of women with DDH from thetime of diagnosis. Part of our own workis tofollow our selected cases to gain insight into their coping post-PAO and the longer term impact of living with DDH ongeneral quality of life and psychological functioning.</p></sec>
