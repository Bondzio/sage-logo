<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Exercise therapy in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) is effective for improving muscle strength and functional mobility.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate, in MS patients attending an in-patient rehabilitation program, the additional effects of a 3-week exercise program, performed on a whole body vibration platform, on muscle strength and functionality.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of participating patients was 5.5. This randomized controlled trial differentiated a MS control group (n = 17) and two exercise groups performing exercises on a vibration platform (WBV-full group, n = 20) and on the platform additionally covered by a damping mat (WBV-light group, n = 18). Exercise groups performed, during 10 training sessions, six static and dynamic exercises standing on a platform vibrating at high frequency and low amplitude. Isometric muscle strength of quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior and gluteus medius was measured with a hand-held dynamometer. Functional mobility was measured with Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 3-minute walk test and Timed Get up and Go test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Eight drop-outs occurred in the exercise groups (WBV-full = 4, WBV-light = 4), but were unrelated to WBV as type of intervention. Across groups, significant time effects were found for all muscle groups. For maximal quadriceps and hamstrings muscle strength, interaction effects were found with post-hoc tests indicating exercise group-significant improvements in the WBV-full group only. Significant time effects were found for all functional tests. Improvements on the BBS and 3-minute walk test were larger in training than in control groups, but no significant interactions were found.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A 3-week exercise program on a vibration plate significantly improved muscle strength, but not functionality, in persons with MS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Common motor symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) are muscle weakness, hypertonia and incoordination, leading to functioning problems. Walking difficulties and imbalance are reported in the majority of persons with MS, and lead to decreased physical activity levels in persons with MS compared with sedentary healthy individuals, even more pronounced when disuse is also present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511423267">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511423267">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, ample evidence has demonstrated in ambulatory patients that exercise therapy is an effective treatment method to improve muscle strength, functional mobility and walking, as well as quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511423267">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511423267">7</xref></sup> Different types of exercise therapy can generate beneficial effects, although specific size effects may differ depending on training modality, setting and frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423267">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511423267">5</xref></sup> For example, resistance training had most pronounced effects on muscle strength, while endurance training programs had most pronounced effects on cardiovascular and quality of life parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511423267">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511423267">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511423267">9</xref></sup> In literature, training duration varies from a couple of weeks up to 3 months or longer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511423267">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511423267">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511423267">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511423267">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511423267">10</xref></sup> Exercise therapy mostly implies a rather long training program, with intensive and time-consuming training sessions which may be considered by many persons with MS as barriers to engaging in exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511423267">11</xref></sup> Especially persons with marked muscle weakness and motor fatigue may experience difficulties with performing repetitive voluntary muscle contractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423267">12</xref></sup> In this regard, whole body vibration (WBV) is regarded as a potential alternative exercise modality with the primary aim of gaining muscle strength, as a means to improve functional mobility such as balance and walking. During a whole body vibration exercise, the subject commonly stands in squat positions on a vibrating platform, so that strength training is performed using the subject’s own body weight instead of displacing external weights. The vibrations are transmitted to the body, where they stimulate the muscle spindles, thereby eliciting stretch reflexes and unconsciously driven muscle contractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511423267">13</xref></sup> Evidence in untrained healthy persons and elderly persons showed that vibration training can improve muscle strength to a similar extent as resistance training at moderate intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511423267">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511423267">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies investigating the effects of WBV in patients with neurological deficits such as stroke and MS are still scarce. In chronic stroke patients, an increase in isometric and eccentric knee extension torque and improved postural stability was reported after a single session of WBV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511423267">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511423267">19</xref></sup> Effects of long-term application of a WBV exercise program were investigated in subacute stroke patients, revealing no differential effects on functional mobility compared with an exercise program to music.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511423267">20</xref></sup> In contrast, a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in geriatric stroke patients reported that 15 additional training sessions combining WBV (induced by means of Vibrosphere) and balance training, embedded in the Bobath concept, led to significant beneficial effects regarding postural control, trunk stability and muscle tone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511423267">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In MS, Jackson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511423267">23</xref></sup> found no increased isometric hamstrings and quadriceps muscle strength after a single session of WBV, while a RCT suggested better postural control and functional mobility after a single WBV session (2.0–4.4 Hz, 3 mm amplitude, five series of 1 min each), in comparison to a placebo group receiving Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) while standing on the platform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511423267">24</xref></sup> To our knowledge, only three studies have examined long-term application of WBV in persons with MS. Wunderer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511423267">25</xref></sup> recently reported, in two cases, increased strength in plantar flexors and the quadriceps as well as improved functional mobility after 6 weeks of additional whole body vibration training. The studies of Shyns et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511423267">26</xref></sup> and Broekmans et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511423267">27</xref></sup> although of different duration (4 versus 20 weeks) and type of design (cross-over versus RCT), did not reveal superior effects of exercises performed on a WBV platform, compared with exercises performed on the ground, or no exercise.</p>
<p>The abovementioned RCTs were performed in MS patients living in the community, attending grouped exercise sessions. The present study investigated, in MS patients attending an in-patient rehabilitation program, whether a 3-week dynamic exercise program performed on a vibrating platform had additional effects on muscle strength and functional mobility. A randomized controlled trial included a control group and two exercise groups, which performed a standardized functional training program on a WBV platform. One exercise group (WBV-full) stood directly on the platform receiving full high-frequency vibration, while the other exercise group (WBV-light) performed the same training program with an additional thick mat covering the platform in order to partially damp the vibratory stimuli. The latter intervention was added to differentiate the dose of WBV between training groups. A damping mat was preferred to no vibration, as the latter would likely be noticed by patients during the training period, leading to unblinding.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Persons with clinically definite MS and an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) between 3 and 7 were included in the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511423267">22</xref></sup> Patients who experienced relapses or received relapse-related corticosteroid treatment within the month prior to the study were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were inability to stand in an upright position for 30 s or previous use of WBV within 1 month prior to inclusion in the study. Persons with a pacemaker or baclofen pump, prosthesis, recent osteosynthesis or manifest arthritis in the lower limbs or back were also excluded for safety reasons, as were pregnant women.</p>
<p>Sixty-two patients were recruited by physicians at the national MS center in Melsbroek, Belgium, of whom seven patients were not included based on the abovementioned criteria (see flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511423267">Figure 1</xref> and general patient characteristics of included subjects in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511423267">Table 1</xref>). All patients attended an in-patient multi-disciplinary rehabilitation program with a duration of at least 3 weeks and typically including at least 1.5 h physical and occupational therapy daily besides possible other therapies such as psychological counselling or neuropsychological training, hydrotherapy and others.</p>

<title>Experimental design, exercise program and apparatus</title>
<p>All patients received conventional multi-disciplinary therapy. A concealed envelope allocation method was used to randomize allocation to the control (<italic>n</italic> = 17, 11 female) and exercise groups. Patients in the exercise groups received, on top of conventional therapy, 10 sessions of WBV exercises over a period of 3 weeks. Vibration training was performed on a Vibrafit (Fysiomed NV-SA, Edegem, Belgium) inducing vertical vibration with an amplitude of 1.6mm and at a frequency of 30–40 Hz. Exercises were individually performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist while standing on a standard mat of 2 cm thickness (WBV-full group, <italic>n</italic> = 21, six female). Patients in the WBV-light group (<italic>n</italic> = 18, four female) performed the same exercises on a foam mat of 10 cm thickness put on top of the standard mat. As such, the transmission of the vibration stimulus to the lower leg was reduced, creating a lower-intensity treatment. This was verified in one healthy subject before study onset by means of five custom-made SMB380 tri-axial accelerometers that were adhered to the subject’s skin at the lateral malleolus of the ankle, tuberositas tibiae, lateral femur condyle, trochanter major and Spina Iliaca Superior Anterior (SISA). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511423267">Figure 2</xref>, application of the foam mat resulted in a decrease of the mean acceleration by 37–65% during a squat condition at high-frequency vibration of 40 Hz. Obviously, the acceleration decreased with distance away from the platform. Both exercise groups were not allowed to wear shoes on the platform, to avoid different absorption of vibrations between participants.</p>

</fig>
<p>The training program for both exercise groups consisted of six exercises: static unipodal (right and left leg) and bipodal squat as well as a dynamic squat, toes-stand and lunge. Exercises were followed by 1 min relaxation. During the 10 training sessions, the duration of the exercises gradually increased from 30 s to 45 s to 60 s while vibration frequency increased from 30 Hz to 35 Hz to 40 Hz respectively. The rest period between exercises was initially 30 s, increasing to a maximum of 1 min. As such, total training duration ranged from 7 to 13 min. Changes in training program variables were applied at sessions 4 and 8. One single physiotherapist performed the therapy for both exercise groups.</p>
<p>Maximal muscle strength and functional mobility were measured before and after the intervention or control period of 3 weeks by a physician who was blinded regarding group allocation of the patients.</p>

<sec id="section5-1352458511423267">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Primary outcome measures were muscle strength of the tibialis anterior, quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteus medius, measured by means of a hand-held dynamometer (MicroFET2, Biometrics Europe BV, Almere, Netherlands), which is increasingly being adopted in research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511423267">23</xref></sup> The ‘break’ method was performed, in which the patient first resists a force applied by the examiner for 3 sec. Then the examiner produces a force that overrules the maximal force executed by the patient, so breaking the specific angle of the joint. The ‘break’ method was chosen as it has been shown to produce greater muscular forces than during a ‘make’ test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511423267">24</xref></sup> The reliability of hand-held dynamometry has previously been questioned as the outcome could be influenced by the strength of the tester; however, this seems unlikely to be a valid argument when persons with muscle weakness are tested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511423267">25</xref></sup> Intra-rater reliability was demonstrated to be high for hip abductor and knee extensor strength when using standardized application positions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511423267">26</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511423267">27</xref></sup> The strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings was measured in sitting position with the dynamometer placed proximal as well as anterior and posterior, respectively, to the malleoli of the ankle. For the gluteus medius, the patient was lying down with neutral hip and extended knee position, with the dynamometer placed at the lateral femoral condyle. The strength of the tibialis anterior was tested in the same position with the dynamometer placed proximal to the metatarsophalangeal joints. Values of left and right leg were averaged for each muscle.</p>
<p>Secondary outcome measures were related to three tests of functional mobility. The 3-minute walk test (3MWT) measured the distance (m) covered at maximal gait speed in 3 min.

<p>Eight patients of the exercise groups dropped out during the study for various reasons not related to the training program (see flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511423267">Figure 1</xref>), so statistical analyses were performed on 47 patients (WBV = 16, WBV-light = 14 and control group = 17). Fifteen subjects in each group were considered as sufficient to obtain, with a power of 80% at significance level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and expected drop-out rate of 15%, more than 15% change in maximal muscle strength between experimental groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511423267">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A one-way ANOVA was used to detect differences in baseline values between the three different groups. A 2 × 3 ANOVA was used to measure the effects of TIME (pre/post) by GROUP (Control/WBV-full/WBV-light). Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) were applied to correct for multiple comparisons.

<p>Regarding maximal muscle strength, improvements were overall greater in the exercise groups compared with the control group that received no additional training sessions. Significant Time effects across groups (<italic>F</italic>(1,44) = 10.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and <italic>F</italic>(1,44) = 13.8; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) as well as Time × Group interaction effects (<italic>F</italic>(2,44) = 3.23; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>F</italic>(2,44) = 5.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) were found for maximal quadriceps and hamstrings strength respectively. Post-hoc tests revealed significant improvements in the WBV-full group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 respectively) only. For the gluteus medius muscle, a significant Time effect (<italic>F</italic>(1,34) = 9.3; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as well as a borderline significant Time × Group interaction (<italic>F</italic>(2,44) = 2.7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.07) were found. Albeit the interaction effect was only borderline significant, it is noteworthy that post-hoc tests revealed significant strength improvements in the WBV-full group only (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). For the tibialis anterior muscle, only a significant time effect (<italic>F</italic>(1,44) = 16.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was found.</p>
<p>Regarding functionality, a significant time effect was found for the 3MWT (<italic>F</italic>(1,44) = 41.1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) showing, across groups, a mean improvement of the walked distance between pre and post measurements. Although increases were relatively larger in the exercise groups, no significant interaction effects were found. The TUG test and BBS showed significant Time effects (<italic>F</italic>(1,44) = 5.7; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>F</italic>(1,44) = 8.8; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) without any interactions between groups, indicating that all groups showed an improvement over the 3-week study period. Similarly, although improvements were mainly observed in the experimental groups, no significant Time × Group interactions were found, indicating that these improvements cannot be related to the additional exercises, or to the vibration stimulus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This single-center randomized controlled study investigated, in MS patients receiving a conventional in-patient rehabilitation program, the additional effects of a 3-week exercise program performed on a WBV platform. Main results indicate that additional exercises performed on a vibrating platform led to an additional increase in maximal leg strength and functional capacity. However, increases appeared significant only for maximal quadriceps and hamstrings strength in the WBV-full group.</p>
<p>Overall, beneficial effects on muscle strength and walking were observed in both exercise groups. Given the lack of an experimental group performing the same exercises on the ground instead of on a vibrating platform, one may doubt to what degree improvements were mainly related to the execution of active exercises, or to the provision of vibration stimuli. A contribution of the high-frequency vibratory stimulus to improved muscle strength is, however, assumed, for the following reasons. First, the average increase in strength was systematically larger in the full than the light vibration group. This seems in line with research in healthy controls that has demonstrated an increased muscle activation during WBV application compared with placebo conditions in which the same squat exercises were performed without application of WBV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511423267">37</xref></sup> Second, significant increases in quadriceps and hamstrings strength were found in the higher-dose group (WBV-full) only. A borderline interaction effect was also present for the gluteus medius. As such, WBV seems to increase strength in more muscle groups of the legs than strictly needed during squat exercises. The change in muscle strength during the WBV-light condition, although not significant, as found with post-hoc tests, was larger than expected, which may be explained by the fact that the addition of the damping mat may have induced some imbalance that had to be additionally controlled during the exercises. As such, additional muscle activation could have been needed to be able to perform the exercises, leading to increases in muscle strength not related to the (lower) vibration stimulus. In support of this hypothesis, it is noted that two patients in the WBV-light group dropped out due to insufficient equilibrium.</p>
<p>Regarding functional mobility, the present study found enhanced walking distance and balance in both exercise groups, possibly related to improved knee extensor and flexor strength, given previously shown correlations in stroke patients and elderly persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511423267">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511423267">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511423267">39</xref></sup> However, no significant interactions were found, so there was no clear carry-over effect of increased muscle strength after WBV on walking and balance. It could be that improvements at motor function level need to pass certain thresholds as well as needing more time than a few sessions to translate to changes at activity level, the latter requiring muscle coordination and adaptation to external forces as well as strength.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged, however, that one should be cautious with the interpretations of the findings of the present study, as the sample size in each group is relatively small. Future research on larger samples is needed in MS to verify the reported findings, as the present study observed some borderline significances. It should also differentiate the effects of exercises from the additional impact of high- frequency vibration.</p>
<p>In contrast to the present study, the randomized controlled trials of Schyns et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511423267">26</xref></sup> and Broekmans et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511423267">27</xref></sup> did not find indications for effects of high-frequency WBV on muscle strength after 4 and 20 weeks of training, respectively. Differences between studies may relate to the included patient sample. Schyns et al. and Broekmans et al. recruited patients living in the community, some already attending local leisure centers. One can hypothesize that included patients were relatively well-functioning independent patients living at home, as they had made their way independently to the community center. Patients in the study of Broekmans et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511423267">27</xref></sup> showed an EDSS of 4.3 ± 0.2, indicating rather mild ambulatory dysfunction, while Shyns et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511423267">26</xref></sup> did not report descriptive baseline data regarding level of EDSS or walking performance. These patients may already have been performing near their individual maximal physical activity level, with less potential to improve, whereas the patient sample in the present study consisted of in-patients, with considerable disability, as revealed by a mean EDSS score of 5.5 (range 3–7), and perhaps also a larger degree of disuse. The demonstrated effects of additional exercises on walking capacity in this type of patients are also considered as an important finding, given that most studies on exercise therapy, included in a recent review by Snook and Motl (2010), were performed in samples with EDSS ≤4.5, while effect size was almost zero in patients with EDSS ≥5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511423267">7</xref></sup> Still, one may be surprised by the beneficial effects of additional exercises, as the patients were already attending conventional in-patient rehabilitation, also including physiotherapy with muscle strengthening and walking exercises. However, therapists may have to address multiple symptoms and functioning problems.</p>
<p>Regarding feasibility, it is concluded, with others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511423267">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1352458511423267">43</xref></sup> that WBV is well tolerated by patients with MS. In this regard, a positive impact of WBV on self-reported occurrence of muscle spasms, as measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale (MSSS-88), has been reported, although it is noted that the physician-rated Ashworth scores had not changed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511423267">40</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1352458511423267">44</xref></sup> Despite the feasibility of WBV in MS patients, however, it was found that compliance with long-term WBV exercise programs was not perfect in the study of Schyns et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511423267">26</xref></sup> or in ours. About 25% of persons in the exercise groups dropped out during the study period, for reasons related to insufficient equilibrium and aggravation of pre-existing musculoskeletal problems such as shoulder pain, or to lack of time or presence of psychosocial problems. The reasons related to physical functioning indicate that exercises on a WBV platform require sufficient balance capacities, especially when standing on the added damping mat, or may cause increased physical strain regarding pre-existing impairments. In relation to psychosocial functioning and the time spent, it is possible that additional exercises with WBV were not perceived as important therapy by all in-patients in the present study, and therefore received less priority when other concerns were present. It is noted that drop-outs were never related to fatigue, which is an important observation given that a recently published survey revealed that persons with MS perceived exercise therapy as ‘fatiguing’ and ‘hard work’, an important barrier for patients with a low self-efficacy level to engage in more demanding physical activity programs such as endurance and resistance training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511423267">11</xref></sup> Finally, it is noted that WBV could also be an important rehabilitation tool for other purposes. Many MS patients have reduced bone mass, and thus greater risk of fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1352458511423267">45</xref></sup> In this regard, studies in elderly women have demonstrated that WBV-induced loading provided a sufficient and effective stimulus to increase bone density of hip bones and tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1352458511423267">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511423267">48</xref></sup></p>
