<abstract>
<p>Preparing future music educators to teach diverse students in U.S. schools is essential; diversity is increasing, especially in urban schools. Music teacher education infused with social justice content promotes successful student learning and an understanding of diversity. This 3-year narrative includes social justice materials, successful pedagogical strategies, pitfalls, and students’ comments. The 111 Caucasian students and 3 students of color were enrolled in three required music education undergraduate courses at an urban university. Students reflected about their cultural identities, created presentations with sensitive content, and revealed positive attitudinal changes about diversity. The risk for future music teachers was the requirement to learn a vast amount of traditional music education material plus social justice ideas. The risk for the professor involved breaking the canon of traditional music teacher preparation by teaching social justice content in required courses. What the author learned might persuade others to reevaluate their curricula and include social justice topics.</p>

<title>Social Justice Rationale and Principles</title>
<p>The evolution and rationale of my journey in teaching social justice content in music education form the content of this narrative. I am an African American woman who participated in struggles for civil rights and women’s rights. The development of my mission to ensure an equitable education for all students was described in a brief autobiography about my family and urban teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2004a</xref>). If my experiences are credible to other music teacher-educators, they may choose to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1969, I taught comprehensive general music and chorus with a multicultural orientation based primarily on Western artistic and ethnic music literature. It was a challenge to teach diverse students from prekindergarten through Grade 12 levels and senior citizens at urban, suburban, public, and private schools. I interacted with students and caregivers from every continent with the exception of Antarctica, and the experience was invigorating. Sharing musics and cultures continued in 1989 during my appointments as a K–12 performing arts coordinator of music/dance/drama and a graduate-level adjunct professor teaching music education to classroom teachers from rural schools.</p>
<p>A new position as a music teacher-educator at an urban university, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (UWM), in January 1997 created a change in perspective. That positional leap led to my focus on urban music education because of urban students who did not have access to certified, qualified music teachers; music teachers who taught multicultural music but did not address diversity issues; practicing and future music teachers who avoided teaching positions in urban schools; and startling demographics. According to U.S. Census Bureau figures, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is the fourth-most impoverished big city in the nation with almost 4 in 10 children living below the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057083712450029">Glauber&amp; Posten, 2010</xref>), and it is one of the most segregated cities in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083712450029">Kaiser &amp; McNeely, 2011</xref>). Consistent with national demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2006</xref>), an overwhelming majority of the UWM music education students are from suburban, small town, or rural schools with little knowledge about urban schools and communities. The mismatch between urban demographics and teacher candidates’ backgrounds creates a national urgency to prepare future music educators to teach diverse students.</p>
<p>Music teacher-educators committed to urban curricular reform hailed the open letter to music faculty by the Executive Committee of the National Association of Schools of Music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057083712450029">NASM; 2002</xref>). In discussing the critical shortage of K–12 music teachers “in many areas,” the NASM committee predicted that “. . . inattention to this problem has great potential to damage every aspect of our field” (p. 1). The designation “in many areas” seems to be a euphemism for urban and rural communities. In addition, two diversity frameworks in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057083712450029"><italic>NASM Handbook</italic> (2010)</xref> requirements for the Baccalaureate Degree in Music Education have connotations of social justice education. A paragraph at the conclusion of NASM Program Content specifies that “. . . attention should be given to breadth in general studies, attitudes relating to human, personal considerations, and social, economic, and cultural components that give individual communities their identity” (p. 98).</p>
<p>The next section of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057083712450029"><italic>NASM Handbook</italic> (2010)</xref> includes seven Desirable Attributes for prospective music teachers, and the fifth attribute addresses the ability “to work productively within specific education systems, promote scheduling patterns that optimize music instruction, maintain positive relationships with individuals of various social and ethnic groups, and be empathetic with students and colleagues of differing backgrounds” (p. 98). Six attributes refer to music and arts, and the seventh addresses diversity in the same category with work habits and scheduling. The Characteristics of NASM Standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057083712450029">NASM, 2002</xref>) indicate that each institution creates and develops “its unique program . . . [and the] . . . methods, approaches, and techniques” (p. 1).</p>
<p>Although there is a long history of cooperation between NASM and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and the “standards of the two associations do not contradict each other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057083712450029">NASM, 2012</xref>, p. 1), there are contrasts. A call to action for social justice was ratified by NCATE’s Executive Board in 2007 to fulfill the promises of <italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic>, 1954, and <italic>No Child Left Behind</italic>, 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057083712450029">NCATE, 2008</xref>). Guidelines for the standards include six stipulations for renewing “our commitment to social justice in schooling for all children by demanding well prepared educators for all children” (p. 7). The fourth <bold>s</bold>tandard, Diversity, stipulates that candidates “acquire and demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and professional disposition necessary to help all students learn” (p. 12).</p>
<p>How did faculty at UWM interpret these standards from their accreditation associations? I taught in the UWM Music Department of the Peck School of the Arts where the mission is arts education and professional training with a commitment to recruit “ faculty, staff, and students who reflect the diversity of art-making in a variety of cultures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1057083712450029">UWM, Peck School of the Arts, 2010</xref>). At the UWM School of Education, the mission, vision, two of the six goals, and two of the five values meticulously address urban schools, diversity, and social justice. Two values are “ increasing access to opportunity and promoting social justice” and “continuous critical reflections of self and practice central to the true spirit of diversity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1057083712450029">UWM, School of Education, 2010</xref>). The essence of social justice appears on a banner: “School of Education: Equity, Diversity, Excellence.” The arts and education buildings are in close proximity, but each building contains a separate teacher certification program whereby prospective teachers have to satisfy state diversity field experience requirements in urban schools.</p>
<p>I began studying social justice education after realizing that music education required/elective courses did not alleviate the disconnect between courses and field experiences. Prior to my urban commitment at UWM, music education students’ diversity exposure was in three required courses taught at the School of Education: Developmental Reading, Exceptional Education, and Educational Psychology. Students’ exposure to multicultural music in the Music Department occurred in American Folk and Popular Music, available to all music majors, and general/choral or instrumental methods courses. Unfortunately, the crucial music education introductory course that had a field experiences component included only a limited introduction of multiculturalism. As a music educator, I declared, “If teacher educators teach multicultural music without helping preservice teachers understand conditions contributing to prejudice, then it is like a half-baked cake, an inedible pudding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2006</xref>, p. 56). As an educator, Enid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083712450029">Lee (2009)</xref> declared, “If you don’t take multicultural education or anti-racist education seriously, you are actually promoting a monocultural or racist education. There is no neutral ground on this issue” (p. 10). Lee’s essay is one of 40 by various authors who challenge narrow interpretations of multiculturalism that avoid racism and embrace an updated vision with multicultural education in the larger realm of social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712450029">Au, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Urban education can be considered in the larger realm of social justice. Although confident that my social justice orientation was more powerful than my urban education orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2006</xref>), I was aware that social justice presented curriculum challenges that confront students’ beliefs and attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057083712450029">Nieto and Bode (2008)</xref> explained that social justice is an approach, a philosophy, or actions that are based on an equitable education with provisions for treating all people with “fairness, respect, dignity, and generosity” (p. 11). Their definition of social justice in education includes four action components: challenging stereotypes leading to discrimination based on race, gender, social class, and other differences; providing equitable resources for all students to learn; recognizing and applying the strengths that students already have; and promoting critical thinking that supports social change. Such a preparation if included in music education would enable music teachers to recognize and act against injustices by treating students and caregivers with dignity and respect—wherever they teach.</p>
<p>My social justice approach included the students dealing with complex social issues within their undergraduate majors and the professor’s deviation from traditional music teacher preparation curricula. Music department colleagues believed that I excelled in teaching the required curriculum based on evaluations and awards, and they praised my urban initiatives, articles, and presentations. I had asked the other full-time member of the music education area to join me, but scheduling priorities prevented a partnership. In a critical self-analysis, I wondered if my social justice orientation was considered off-task or radical. Thus, I set time limits and documented students’ learning and found that instead of being radical or off-task, awareness of race and ethnicity eventually was considered vital by my students. In a focus journal on closing opportunity gaps that prohibit students from learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057083712450029">Hawley and Nieto (2010)</xref> stress that it <italic>is</italic> acceptable for teachers to discuss race and ethnicity because it affects students’ learning and teachers’ assumptions. Although opportunity gaps are not related to race or ethnicity, instruction that is unresponsive to the gaps or ethnicities may contribute to low achievement. Many music teacher-educators emphasize the motto, “We teach students, not music,” but is the emphasis really on respecting student diversity?</p>

<title>Social Justice Instruction and Materials Focused on Students</title>
<p>The middle section of this narrative begins with a description of my courses and continues chronologically with annotated readings, pedagogical strategies, and student comments that highlight curriculum topics. The social justice component emphasized recognizing and valuing all students.</p>
<p>From Fall Semester 2005 until my retirement in June 2008, I taught social justice content in three required music education courses at UWM. The sequential courses were Introduction to Music Education (Introduction), one credit in fall semester junior year for all music education students; Teaching Elementary General Music (Methods), three credits in fall semester senior year for elementary general/choral majors; and Seminar in Student Teaching (Seminar), one credit simultaneously with student teaching in fall or spring semesters senior year for all majors. These courses had a naturally occurring population of 111 Caucasian students and 3 students of color.</p>
<p>Since some music education students avoided the sequential recommendation for Introduction and Methods because of academic and personal preferences, each semester I taught students who had never been introduced to these materials and each fall semester several students were simultaneously enrolled in both courses. To firmly establish the social justice landscape with each student during three years, I abandoned the ideal plan to teach different materials in each course. Supplementary social justice activities/discussion occurred primarily during the last 10 minutes of most of the weekly 50-minute Introduction classes and the last 20 to 30 minutes of several twice-weekly 75-minute Methods classes. Seminar met every other week and began with a 1-hour confidential sharing of student teaching experiences. During the second hour discussion of assigned music education and social justice readings, the emphasis was on relevance to student teachers’ current and future classroom experiences. Since I team-taught Seminar with a music education colleague, each of us taught four classes, and urban and social justice content was limited to my classes.</p>
<sec id="section3-1057083712450029">
<title>Year 1 Supplementary Social Justice Materials</title>
<p>The Fall 2005 coursepack for Methods and Introduction included four articles and two books from the introductory course at the School of Education, selected because of my confidence in the quality of these pedagogical materials. The articles included a decades-long research summary of the behaviors of exemplary urban teachers and interviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057083712450029">Haberman (1995)</xref>, the late international educational icon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057083712450029">Nieto’s (2002/2003)</xref> definition of multiculturalism as antiracist education with questions about students, teachers, equity, and access; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057083712450029">McIntosh’s (1989)</xref> groundbreaking term <italic>white privilege</italic> to describe “an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks . . . tools and blank checks” (p. 10); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057083712450029">Jensen’s (1998)</xref> essay about the ultimate white privilege as “the privilege to acknowledge you have unearned privilege but ignore what it means” (p. 1). The books were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057083712450029">Kohl’s (1984)</xref> description of compassion and flexibility in captivating unattainable students and the first edition of a classic masterpiece about race and culture in schools, with cross-cultural suggestions for teachers, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712450029">Delpit (2006)</xref>, a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship recipient. Social justice materials in Introduction did not include Delpit’s book, and Seminar materials were limited to the two books.</p>
<p>Music education articles were also in the coursepack. These materials were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712450029">Campbell’s (2002)</xref> brief autobiography, with suggestions for developing the musical worlds of students; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083712450029">Klinger’s (2002)</xref> explanation of the trustworthiness of musical materials taught in all institutions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057083712450029">Robinson’s (2002)</xref> description of a multicultural elementary general music class with suggestions for redesigning the undergraduate music education curriculum; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith’s (2004a)</xref> previously described article; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith’s (2004b)</xref> article about a university partnership with an urban school system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1057083712450029">
<title>Year 1: Lectures, Autobiographies, and Responses About Color Blindness and Prejudice</title>
<p>Usually, my music education instruction consisted of explaining concepts/skills from texts with modeling, demonstrating with students, critiquing student projects, and sharing resources. In contrast, the first time I taught materials in this unchartered territory, I highlighted each resource via brief lectures with questions, limiting most topics to one lecture/discussion and one review. Assignments were student reflections for everyone, book summaries in preparation for class discussions in Methods and Seminar, and student autobiographies of musical development in Methods. The Methods assignment to write autobiographies of students’ own musical lives was influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712450029">Campbell’s (2002)</xref> assertion that contemplating one’s origin and development provides insight for understanding students. Instructions were to complete all course requirements before beginning the deep reflection required for a 10-page autobiography. In Spring 2006, a Seminar requirement was to write a 6-page student-teaching addendum. Throughout my university instruction, daily reflections in all courses were beneficial, ungraded two-way conversations between students and professor. Detailed student feedback from Fall 2005 was published in a narrative analysis of instructional materials in the three courses and an independent studies course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Initially, most students believed that the benign neglect of students’ color was an appropriate teacher attribute, that is, color blindness. For example, an excerpt from a student teacher’s book summary in Seminar was applicable to most students:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am the absolute first to admit that my experience with African-Americans is limited. I come from the typical White midwestern town . . . I don’t understand why there is such a difference in a teacher’s race. It may be that I have had excellent experiences with excellent teachers who are colorblind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2008a</xref>, p. 289)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She was absent from class during the discussion about <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712450029">Delpit’s (2006)</xref> book when I stressed, “. . . if one does not see color, then one does not really see children” (p. 177). Acknowledging learners’ differences contributes to their visibility, enhances their self-esteem, and promotes their learning.</p>
<p>Two students of color were enrolled in my music education courses in 2005, and both immediately understood the diversity content. When three White student teachers struggled with diversity scenarios presented in two books discussed in Seminar, an African American student passionately stated that both authors reminded her of “those few precious teachers who allowed me to see beyond my poverty stricken area of Milwaukee and see that one day I could reach my goals and attain them. My background did not have to stop me from learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2008a</xref>, p. 288). I thanked her and responded that a teacher’s ultimate purpose is to understand and relate to students.</p>
<p>During a discussion of prejudice, blaming the victim, and language diversity in Methods, some students admitted that it was easier to criticize “others” than to understand. As students became more aware of the impact of diversity, they became more sensitive. A Native American student discussed how he and his brothers felt because they were always closely watched in stores, and his eloquent description was followed by an impenetrable silence. After discussing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712450029">Delpit’s (2006)</xref> explanation of language, he wrote the following reflection:
<disp-quote>
<p>Language is culture period! That’s why it was stripped away in the boarding schools from native children. Relatives were punished for speaking their language. That’s why many didn’t teach their children or grandchildren (to protect them). This class is one of my favorites because of the discussions and interactions. Waewaen! (Thank you). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2008a</xref>, pp. 286-287)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I always thanked students who courageously shared their stories; personal remarks validated curricula concepts about recognizing students’ strengths and challenging stereotypes.</p>

<sec id="section5-1057083712450029">
<title>Three Years of Studying White Privilege</title>
<p>Because of the shocking revelation and positive resolution of students’ perceptions about white privilege, my analysis of 3 years of instruction is combined here rather than presented chronologically. White privilege was the lightning rod topic that generated anticipated student defensiveness in Introduction and Methods in 2005. A typical reflection submitted in Introduction was the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Simply because one is white doesn’t make him privileged. I knew people in my high school who were African-American, came from a vastly more wealthy background than myself, got inferior grades, and still had more scholarships, etc. Who then was the ‘privileged’ one? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2008a</xref>, p. 286)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For 2 weeks, students initiated discussion about white privilege amid complaints about too much time on the topic. Regardless of the professorial desire to follow the syllabus, I sensitively addressed student unreadiness until reflections indicated that white privilege was a fact instead of a “guilt trip.”</p>
<p>Although white privilege was not part of the Seminar syllabus, some student teachers referred to this privilege as in the following reflection from Spring 2006:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was not taught to acknowledge white privilege until six months ago . . . [in Methods] . . . this was absurd to me! I am not racist, neither are 99.9% of the people I come in contact with, and I felt offended . . . It took until now for me to know it is not a matter of racism but more of ignorance, making it our duty to become educated. It took until now, and with the help of my recent experiences in the urban public schools as a student teacher, for me to understand that this is a reality in the face of us all, on whichever end of white privilege a person so falls.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The attitudinal change revealed by this student teacher was a breath of wisdom.</p>
<p>A new instructional strategy in Introduction, Fall 2006, and repeated in Fall 2007, helped eliminate student defensiveness about white privilege. Students entering the room immediately became spellbound while viewing a 40-minute documentary with eyewitness reports of three centuries of U.S. bigotry, <italic>The Shadow of Hate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057083712450029">Guggenheim, 1995</xref>) and answered learning log questions. The following week, class discussion was limited to the answers, and students accepted the existence of white privilege on a continuum from tentative to acquiescent. Since numerous students were simultaneously enrolled in Methods, instead of showing the video of this Academy Award–nominated film in this course, other arrangements were made.</p>
<sec id="section6-1057083712450029">
<title>Year 2 Supplementary Social Justice Materials</title>
<p>Realizing that I had to subtract before adding, the coursepack deletion in 2006 was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057083712450029">Nieto’s (2002/2003)</xref> article. The addition was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083712450029">Gay’s (2002)</xref> article about the theory of culturally responsive pedagogy with culture as a component of five essential elements of teaching—the knowledge base, curriculum, caring classroom community, communication, and instruction. During the first year of instruction, I referenced Gay’s article and regretted the decision not to include it in the coursepack—simply because it was not part of the introductory model at the School of Education. Gay’s works were/are taught in other courses at the School of Education; the article is based on her book, <italic>Culturally Responsive Teaching: Theory, Research, and Practice</italic>, that received the 2001 Outstanding Writing Award from the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education.</p>
<p>Two music education articles were also added to the coursepack, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712450029">Isbell’s (2005)</xref> tips for a successful rural program and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1057083712450029">Wilcox’s (2005)</xref> case study of an exceptional rural music educator.

<sec id="section7-1057083712450029">
<title>Year 2 Instructional Focus: Learner-Centered Teaching/Cooperative Groups</title>
<p>Total revision of Introduction in 2006 included two learner-centered initiatives; one was learning logs, a topic that will be addressed later. The other strategy was cooperative group learning for social justice materials. I set the parameters with a jigsaw cooperative group assignment of readings and questions that required students to establish rubrics for peer and self-assessments. Each student was responsible for learning and presenting part of the readings, skimming all readings, and learning from peers’ presentations and my summaries. Students decided to keep the same groups all semester but changed presentation formats; skit development was their favorite choice. Each skit included culturally responsive pedagogy and social justice content. My evaluation was based on content accuracy, group presentation, individual participation, and student peer and self-assessments.</p>
<p>Three skits were presented by students during my social justice session at the 61st MENC National Biennial In-Service Conference in 2008 (MENC is now National Association for Music Education or NAfME). Student participants had completed my courses, and they scheduled rehearsals on their own. Rehearsal coordinators were student teachers who also wrote session descriptions for conference handouts with permission to use their names. <italic>Super Teacher</italic>, presented by five students, featured an unprepared general music teacher teaching a song and a dance by reading the instructions while each confused student responded in a different language. Wearing a cape, <italic>Super Teacher</italic> “flew” to the rescue and explained how to connect with students and adapt the instruction for English Language Learners. The original skit was created in Introduction during Fall 2006 and was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712450029">Abril’s (2006)</xref> chapter on quality music programs developed by experienced urban music teachers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083712450029">Carlow’s (2006)</xref> chapter with suggestions for limited English proficiency students. The handout description by Benjamin Burrell was the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this skit we tried to dramatize some common mistakes made by young, struggling teachers when addressing English Language Learners in their urban classrooms with advice from successful music teachers. We wanted to present the material in a simple and memorable format. The <italic>Super Teacher</italic> character seemed like a perfect vehicle for presenting the information. In the end both our classmates, and our group retained the information we presented. It might seem hokey, but it worked.

<p>A hilarious skit included an enthusiastic choral teacher with successful choruses at an urban high school; an exasperated television reporter with stereotypical media images of dysfunctional, urban schools; and a cameraman who wanted to leave the neighborhood before dark when it was 2:30 p.m. <italic>Reporting Live From an Urban School</italic>, developed by three students in Introduction during Fall 2007, was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1057083712450029">Smith’s (2006)</xref> description of novice music teachers in urban schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057083712450029">Robinson’s (2006)</xref> analysis of four exemplary urban music teachers who are culturally responsive pedagogues, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083712450029">Carlow’s (2006)</xref> chapter as previously described. Emily Donaldson wrote the following handout description:
<disp-quote>
<p>All three of us come from the demographic that makes up the overwhelming majority of music educators: we are Caucasian suburbanites who, inspired by our well-funded, successful programs, have chosen to pursue music education. As such, none of us had experiences discussed in our chapters. What we knew of the urban school setting was formed largely by the horror stories heard in the media, and [we] had no knowledge of how music education functions in this setting, other than the idea that it is the first program slashed from the budget in the wake of <italic>No Child Left Behind</italic>. From our homogeneous backgrounds, we view the insurmountable challenges of students who do not even necessarily share a common language, and poverty that makes many things impossible that we took for granted as students. This course was the first experience we had where anyone said anything good about the urban music education program, and while acknowledging the challenges, reminded us that students are students anywhere, and they all need music to be a part of their lives.

<title>Year 3 Supplementary Social Justice Materials in Methods</title>
<p>In the third year, I added new coursepack materials in Methods, but Introduction and Seminar remained the same. Since music education department revisions in Fall 2007 included the phased enforcement of Introduction as a prerequisite, most of the Methods students had either previously enrolled or were currently enrolled in my section of Introduction. Therefore, in Methods I deleted all the social justice and music education diversity articles from the second-year coursepack. I added short sections from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1057083712450029">Spradlin and Parson’s (2008)</xref> new book, <italic>Diversity matters: Understanding Diversity in Schools</italic>, primarily stories as told by members of the following marginalized groups: Native Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/a Americans, African Americans, White Working-Class, Women, and Gay and Lesbian Students. A story by an anonymous music teacher titled “Searching for Diversity” was the lead article in this section of the coursepack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712450029">Anonymous Teacher, 2003</xref>). This beginning teacher taught music, and she patiently taught her students to stop using two stereotypic words in music classes “that adults routinely ignore and that kids persist in using . . . faggot and retard” (p. 176).</p>
<p>The following skit is described in this section because it was created in Methods during Fall 2007 and was based on books by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1057083712450029">Spradlin and Parsons (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712450029">Delpit (2006)</xref> as previously described. The handout description for Understanding African Americans at the 61st MENC National Biennial In-Service Conference reads as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Many of the scenarios and topics covered in this presentation come from my real-life experiences. As a third year urban music educator, I have dealt with many African- American students and parents. My initial classroom preparations did not include understanding the variety of behaviors and strategies to deal with them found in other cultures. In Dr. Kindall-Smith’s class, I appreciated her taking the time to discuss such matters and relate them to the classroom. Her focus not on just the culture of African-Americans, but on other non-dominant cultural groups has helped prepare all her students to better understand and reach the students and parents of those cultural groups. This prepares and equips us for better teaching methodology, management, and personal relationships, both in and out of the classroom. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, McCoy, &amp; Mills, 2011</xref>, pp. 379-380)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sarah Plamann, the author of the handout description, was certified in another discipline and was completing her music education certification. This African-American skit included two students alternately portraying middle-school students/parents/teachers in brief, poignant vignettes, interspersed with a narrator providing explanations about cultural behaviors. The students felt that the music teacher favored “the lighter skinned ones,” that is, colorism refers to favoring people who look similar to the dominant culture. The parents complained about the music teacher’s ridiculous rules; the teacher communicated indirect statements for direct commands. The music teachers compassionately lamented about the impact of most students living with extended families for financial resources and of student musical leaders missing after-school rehearsals because of jobs to help support families, up to 30 hours a week.</p>

<title>Year 3 Instructional Focus: Learner-Centered Teaching/Learning Logs</title>
<p>The significant umbrella strategy contributing to the total revision of Introduction in 2006 was learner-centered teaching when “the action focuses on what students (not teachers) are doing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1057083712450029">Weimer, 2002</xref>, p. xvi). Weimer influenced my development of optional assignments including learning logs. Three required assignments included three cooperative-group presentations of social justice readings. Three optional assignments gave students opportunities to decide conditions of their learning. Since the learning log questions were primarily based on music education readings, I considered weekly learning logs as “one” optional assignment, in which students were motivated to construct their own knowledge. In 2006, of the 17 students in Introduction, 3 completed all 13 optional learning logs and 9 students completed 12. Of the 8 students enrolled in 2007, 3 completed all logs and 3 completed 12. Learning logs averaged three or four questions, word-processed answers were due at the next class, late logs were not accepted, and some logs included social justice questions. Occasionally, each student evaluated objective questions on his or her word-processed log during the class discussion. To save time, I always evaluated analytical questions.</p>
<p>Because of my elation about the successful student learning in Introduction, in 2007 I added learning logs in Methods. I empathized with 4 students who were simultaneously enrolled in both courses because they were inundated with learning logs, but 3 of them completed all the logs in both courses, and the other student had only one less log. Learning logs in Methods averaged 10 questions, including 2 social justice questions at the end. Since Methods students had difficulty processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712450029">Delpit’s (2006)</xref> book, I guided their learning over several weeks with questions. Of the 11 students in Methods, 6 completed all 12 logs and 1 completed 11. One Methods student expressed a sentiment followed by most students in both courses: “This idea of choosing how much you put in, and consequentially get out, is representative of the real working world. I plan to do all required and optional assignments with focus and insight.” Learning logs was my assurance that students were processing required and supplementary curricula.</p>
<p>An example of a learning log question in Methods was “What are two major ideas that you will think about as you begin to teach? Explain.” The question referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith’s (2006)</xref> chapter, and the following response was evident of critical thinking to support social change:
<disp-quote>
<p>Two ideas . . . are the achievement gap and multicultural education . . . The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712450029">Anderson and Campbell [1989]</xref> definition includes teaching about tolerance and incorporating other cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712450029">Banks [2004]</xref> discusses this but also includes teaching a positive attitude about diversity, or prejudice reduction. One seems neutral, where the other seems positive . . . My goal is to teach music to my students, but simply transferring content is not the answer; it is a complex balance of who I am as a person, how I think, who my students are, and how they learn. Understanding all four will help me to help the achievement gap, and help me effectively teach multiculturally. Reading books like this is one way I can reach my goal. (This is a difficult question to answer.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I genuinely praised his insight and reminded him that attitudes are “caught” not “taught.” Later, he revealed that the autobiography assignment was also valuable preparation toward his goal.</p>

<title>Middle School Instruction/Materials and Respect</title>
<p>Social justice is one of three core values at an urban elementary/middle school next door to UWM, and the music teacher, Martha Albers, was an excellent cooperating teacher who designed social justice projects for her middle school students. Their creativity deserved praise; it was beneficial for my students to observe her classes. After studying protest songs, Grade 8 students found appropriate songs and created music videos with social justice themes. Grade 6 students designed posters to compare/contrast social justice issues in a musical with contemporary urban issues, especially violence.</p>
<p>Albers and her students presented the projects during my aforementioned biennial conference session. In describing her social justice orientation for the conference handout, she wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Social justice in one word for me is respect. By educating students through music and social justice, the important values of community, fairness, tolerance, cooperation, and respect will develop our students into highly educated young people who lead from the heart as well as the mind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith, 2008b</xref>, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the conference one Latina, one White, and three Black students discussed their video with horrific issues relevant to many students, specifically drugs, violence, and teen pregnancy. Two Grade 6 Black students suggested how to avoid the pervasive violence in their neighborhoods, including the emotional admission: “This affects my life because my auntie died from someone shooting her for no good reason” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith et al., 2011</xref>, p. 380). Albers indicated that social justice content engaged middle school students and contributed to classroom management, especially with technology.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057083712450029">Nieto and Bode (2008)</xref> included respect in their conceptualization of social justice, as did Albers and most teachers I have encountered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712450029">Beaudoin’s (2011)</xref> article, “Respect–Where Do We Start?” is in a focus journal promoting respectful schools. Stressing that teachers’ socioemotional skills are critical parts of the web of relationships in schools, Beaudoin, an educational psychologist, articulated that “<italic>Respected</italic> adults engage in <italic>respect-full</italic> interactions in which <italic>respect-full</italic> students can blossom” (p. 44). She did not address social justice, but her examples of compassion and understanding for each member of the school community were affirmations of my instruction. As a result of my foray into teaching social justice, my socioemotional consciousness was raised, and feedback from more than 100 future music teachers indicated that theirs was as well. How and what did I learn in 3 years?</p>

<sec id="section11-1057083712450029">
<title>What I Learned</title>
<p>Most music teacher-educators did not take diversity courses during teacher preparation, nor did we take 21st-century technology courses—but we are learning. I learned about social justice in education by studying resources and interacting with authors at several conferences, including annual meetings of the American Educational Research Association, Division G, the Social Context of Education, and UWM conferences sponsored by the Cultures and Communities Program and the School of Education.</p>
<p>Learning opportunities in music education include social justice articles in an online journal published by the Mayday Group, <italic>Action for Change in Music Education</italic>, and recent conferences, including “Race, Erasure, and Equity in Music Education” at The University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Cultural Diversity and Social Justice ASPA (Area of Strategic Planning and Action) group convenes at biennial Symposia on Music Teacher Education at The University of North Carolina–Greensboro. Three Social Justice ASPA members examined a conceptual understanding of music teaching and learning, historically and pedagogically, and posited that
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . once music teacher educators are committed to social justice through their own pedagogies and practices, the inclusion of culturally-diverse voices and perspectives in music education can become an established and expected curricular goal benefiting both learners and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083712450029">Kindall-Smith et al., 2011</xref>, p. 382).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this article, I have revealed personal and professional perspectives, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712450029">Campbell (2002)</xref> reminds us that Socrates’ advice to “‘know thyself’ . . . is the launch for us all in determining our course” (2002, p. 240). Following is a recent response from a music teacher-educator who supports social justice content:
<disp-quote>
<p>I fear that we are sometimes going backwards! Many of my students do not understand why there is a problem with a majority of America’s children and youth having little or no access to music instruction—or that the academic content of music education may represent perpetuation of a stereotypical and idealistic view of our culture. We have much work to do!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Colleagues asked, “How did you have time to teach social justice?” I made time because of my mission, goals, and values. Colleagues have similar commitments.</p>
<p>I learned that there were insignificant differences between instrumental and choral/general music education students enrolled in Introduction when the course preceded Methods. It is not surprising that the most compassionate responses were from students who enrolled in two or three courses, regardless of their majors. Reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712450029">Delpit’s (2006)</xref> book in two courses, the second time from perspectives of student teachers, resulted in reflections that were similar to the following in Seminar, Spring 2007:
<disp-quote>
<p>People of all cultures and backgrounds are different in ways that are more than skin-deep . . . Certain body language and nonverbals mean one thing to me but mean something completely different to most students at my school . . . The school children are predominantly African American, many Hmong, some Caucasian, some Hispanic, and several hearing-impaired . . . most of them behave similarly and seem to have the same experiences, which differ greatly from what I experienced . . . I have learned to wait to judge someone’s actions and/or words, . . . in the past I may have been too quick to reprimand . . . there are times when I’m just too unsure about someone’s behavior or words, and I <italic>don’t</italic> say anything when I should, because I don’t want to offend the student. I am learning a lot about our cultural differences and quickly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This reflection is a synthesis of the student teacher’s preparation by the cooperating teacher, courses in music education and education, and the social justice content.</p>
<p>I learned that, when initiating social justice content, music teacher-educators must provide a firm foundation for students with the assurance that the supplementary material is a curriculum asset. It is important to establish trust in each class whereby everyone shares opinions without fear of ridicule or a lower grade. Through trial and error, I implemented learner-centered strategies that were effective for teaching sensitive topics. Cooperative-group learning was especially useful in teaching supplementary social justice reading. Learner-centered instruction was the capstone of my university teaching career. Occasionally students voiced concerns about not having enough time to process social justice content; I agree that the program was not ideal. I structured the curriculum to enable students to think and learn in preparation for music student teaching, future teaching, and lifelong learning. The instructional emphasis was R&amp;R plus R&amp;R, that is, respect and rigor plus realism resulting in retention.</p>
<p>I learned that the advantages of teaching social justice outweighed the risks when the supplementary materials were balanced in relation to music education requirements. The program followed NASM parameters and student comments pertained to NASM attributes and NCATE standards. Instead of being a blueprint, this narrative provides curriculum initiatives as examples of the possible, and the final destination might involve others in teaching these topics. I taught future music teachers, and many are currently teaching diverse students, or will do so, in a variety of schools and colleges nationally and internationally. I am proud of their insight, sincerity, compassion, curiosity, and perseverance. What a difference for the students (and professor!) during our mutual 3-year, on-task, social justice journey in required, undergraduate music education curricula.</p>
