<abstract>
<p>It is, generally, argued that we can attribute the rise and fall of stock market to the flow of funds and investment by Foreign Institutional Investors (FII). The Indian stock market is visited by three major players—FIIs, Mutual Funds (MF) and Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs). This article lays down the analytical framework for comparing the nature and role of the three players. It uses a framework for empirically testing the impact of each player on the stock market. Through a set of Granger causality tests, it verifies the popular hypothesis that FIIs dominate the Indian stock market. The results are quite startling. Our results show that FIIs are not the only active players who have an influence in Indian stock market even DIIs have an influence, whereas Mutual funds are the passive players. FIIs are essentially opportunistic agents who do not cause any fundamental change in the market but themselves opportunistically gain from the market.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the early phase of economic transition in since 1991 there have been several waves of policy change. The economy was opened up to foreign investment in September 1992. India has been receiving investments in the form of foreign institutional investments. Initially, there were many terms and conditions which restricted many FIIs to invest in India. In course of time, in order to attract more investors, SEBI has simplified many terms and conditions.</p>

<title>Foreign Institution Investors</title>
<p>FIIs refer to outside companies that invest in the financial markets of India. FII is used to denote an investor, who invests money in the financial markets of a country different from the one in which that investor is incorporated. FIIs need to register with the Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to participate in the market. If an Indian institution decides to invest in the US stock markets, it would be out-bound foreign institutional investment. Similarly, suppose an American bank invests in the Indian Stock Markets, it would be termed as in-ward FII.</p>
<p>The popular opinion is that Indian stock markets were inarguably driven by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). Here is a list published by Money Control of such stocks where FII’s have biggest percentage share.</p>

<p>No one questions the fact that FIIs have significant influence on the movements of the stock market indexes in India. If one looks at the total FII trade in equity in India and the stock market turnover, it may appear to it show a steadily growing influence of FIIs in the domestic stock markets. In this article we are interested in questioning this premise. If we look at the FII trade, it consists of equities bought and sold. A question that arises is as to whether we should treat these decisions to buy and sell independently or to look at the net impact, in terms of net investment.</p>
<sec id="section3-2319510X13483510">
<title>History of FIIs</title>
<p>India opened its stock market to foreign investors in September 1992. We received portfolio investment from foreigners in the form of foreign institutional investment in equities. This has become one of the main channels of FII in India for foreigners. Initially, there were many terms and conditions which restricted many FIIs to invest in India.</p>
<p>But in the course of time, in order to attract more investors, SEBI has simplified many terms such as:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483510" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The ceiling for overall investments of FIIs was increased to 24 per cent of the paid up capital of the Indian Company.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allowed foreign individuals and hedge funds to directly register as FIIs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Investment in government securities was increased to US$ 5 Billion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Simplified registration norms were implemented.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2319510X13483510">
<title>FII Categories</title>
<p>Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) includes the following based categories:
<list id="list2-2319510X13483510" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pension Funds</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mutual Funds</p></list-item>

<title>Influence of FIIS on Indian Stock Market</title>
<p>In common parlance, market pundits often attribute the rally of the stock market and fall of stock market to the flow of funds by FIIs. We often hear the terms ‘FIIs Fuel the Market Run’. Truly speaking, if they were to drive the Indian stock market, then the major impacts should be:
<list id="list3-2319510X13483510" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased depth and breadth of the market;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An expansion of securities business; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If their policy is to focus on fundamentals of the share they should cause efficient pricing of shares.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>While in this article it is not possible to go into all these aspects, we wish to point out that the FIIs flows are likely to make the Indian stock market more attractive to domestic institutional investors and the other major player like MF (Mutual Funds). It is felt that the impact of FIIs is so high that whenever FIIs tend to withdraw the money from market, the domestic investors also follow suit. This leads to herding behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2319510X13483510">
<title>Role of FII in Indian Stock Market</title>
<p>The growth of institutional investors in the market has its own advantages as well as its own share of problems on the brighter side almost always purchase stocks on the basis of fundamentals. And this means that it is essential to have information to evaluate, so research becomes important and this leads to increasing demands on companies to become more transparent and more disclosures.</p>
<p>On the flip side the increase of foreign investors in particular will bring a very welcome inflow of foreign capital, but there are always some dangers if certain limits are exceeded. Firstly, the foreign capital is free and unpredictable and is always on the lookout for profit. FIIs frequently move investments and those swings can be expected to bring severe price fluctuations resulting in increasing volatility. Here we analyse the comparative trend of Sensex and FII, how it affected the market.</p>

<title>Mutual Funds</title>
<p>Most of the common investors who wish to invest their funds in corporate securities lack knowledge of analysing profiles of companies or do not have adequate time to study the fundamentals of the company. Such investors have an alternative mechanism to invest their funds in corporate securities through Mutual Funds. Under Mutual Funds scheme, savings of investors’ desire to invest their funds in corporate securities are pooled by portfolio managers. The pooled funds are then invested in securities of different companies after making proper study of their profiles. The returns generally out of such investments are distributed among the investors after charging the fees of portfolio managers. Thus, in simple terms, we may understand mutual funds as alternative source of investment for such investors who have funds and wish to invest their funds in corporate securities they are unable to do so because of constraints listed below:
<list id="list4-2319510X13483510" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The funds possessed by each investor are not adequate enough to purchase securities of blue chip companies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The investors do not have skills to assess the risk–reward ratio of securities being traded in the securities market.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The investors do not have knowledge of accounting and finance to analyse the financial statements of the company.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The investors do not have time to analyse fundamentals of the companies and the market movements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The investors lack knowledge of portfolio management and portfolio churning.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<sec id="section8-2319510X13483510">
<title>Growth of Mutual Funds in India</title>
<p>The concept of Mutual Funds in India started in 1964 with the setting up of Unit Trust of India (UTI). The growth of Mutual funds in India can be studied under following four phases:
<list id="list5-2319510X13483510" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Phase 1: 1964 to 1987</italic></bold>: During this period, UTI enjoyed the monopoly of being the only Mutual Fund in India. UTI launched its first scheme US-64 which gained lot of popularity. Gradually, UTI came with other schemes such as Unit Linked Insurance Plan, etc. Later on UTI diversified its business in banking, securities trading, investor servicing, etc. by setting up its associates companies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Phase 2: 1987 to 1993</italic></bold>: During this period, other players such as SBI, LIC, Canara Bank, etc. also entered in the field of Mutual Funds. The period experienced lots of competition and improvement in terms and conditions to the investors in Mutual fund in India.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Phase 3: 1993 to 1996</italic></bold>: During this period, private sector mutual funds and foreign mutual funds were allowed to operate in India which further increased competition in the industry. SEBI came out with Mutual funds regulations during this period to ensure investor protection and smooth functioning of the mutual fund industry in India.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Phase 4: 1996 Onwards</italic></bold>: During this period, SEBI felt need for modifying the regulations issued in 1996 and a consultative paper “Mutual Fund-2000” was circulated. The contents of the paper were deliberated among the players of Mutual fund and a new set of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 was released so to bring private sector mutual funds at par with public sector mutual funds.</p></list-item>

<title>Domestic Institutional Investors (DII)/Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor</title>
<p>Domestic Institutional Investors or DII refers to the institutional investors of the home country, who are investing in the financial markets of the same country, that is, Home Country (Stock Market for example), whereas Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII are institutional investor of the Home Country that has met necessary requirements to invest in securities of country the Host Country (abroad). In such cases regulatory agencies of country Home Country facilitates such domestic investors to invest in foreign-based securities or companies.</p>
<p>QDII is a scheme relating to the capital market set up to allow financial institutions to invest in offshore markets such as securities and bonds. Similar to QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor), it is a transitional arrangement which provides limited opportunities for domestic investors to access foreign markets at a stage where a country/territory’s currency is not traded or floated completely freely and where capital is not able to move completely freely in and out of the country.</p>
<p>There have been many instances of domestic institutional investors (DIIs) pouring money into stock markets at a time when FIIs are rushing for the exit. It is felt that the Indian stock markets are frequently left at the mercy of the FIIs, who tend to exhibit drastic shifts in behaviour. But does that mean that FIIs take accurate calls on the markets when compared to their domestic counterparts?</p>
<p>Moneylife carried out a study to identify the behaviour patterns of both FIIs and DIIs at any given point of time between 2 April 2007 and 25 June 2010. The results were startling. They found that, during this period, there have been several instances when domestic investors have poured in money by the buckets into the markets at a time when FII interest was waning dramatically. By their study there have been 23 instances when DIIs have stepped in to buy when the FIIs were eager to jump the ship. Out of these 23 occasions, the Sensex has posted negative growth 19 times when FIIs were continuously withdrawing from the market.</p>
<p>During this period, the Sensex fell by 3 per cent. The index has registered positive growth only on four occasions in such times. This means that DIIs have been investing in a falling market, trying to take advantage of a reduction in valuations and FIIs were dumping stocks. Has this strategy helped the DIIs?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2319510X13483510">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Review of Literature</title>
<p>Various studies have examined the impact of FII investments on the Indian stock market.</p>
<p><bold>SSS Kumar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483510">2002</xref>)</bold> examines the changes in volatility of the stock market before and after the arrivals of FIIs in the Indian stock market. Data has been taken for the period Jan 1990 to March 1998. It was found that mean volatility prior to opening up of stock market is 41.05 per cent with a standard error of 5.05 per cent whereas volatility after opening up is 22.56 per cent with a standard error of 2.01 per cent. F test further showed that the volatility of the Indian stock market has reduced after the arrival of FIIs.</p>
<p><bold>Sivakumar, S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483510">2003</xref>)</bold> in his paper entitled, ‘FIIs: Bane or boon?’ has analysed the net flows of foreign institutional investment over the years, in his paper also discusses the nature of FII flows based on research, explores some determinants of FII flows and examines if the overall experience has been stabilising or destabilising for the Indian capital market.</p>
<p><bold>Kulwant Rai and N.R. Bhanumurthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483510">2003</xref>)</bold> examine the determinants of FIIs in India where they attempt to analyze the effect of risk, return and inflation by making a model that combines uncovered interest parity and purchasing power parity. Monthly data from January 1994 to November 2002 has been taken into study to determine whether return and risk in the real factors have any impact in the FII inflow in the country. TARCH procedure has been used to find out whether there is a symmetry between good and bad news whose results revealed that there is a positive association of FII with return on BSE, inflation in US and negative association with inflation in India. Moreover it was found that FII react more to bad news than to good news that is buy with caution while investing than while with drawing.</p>
<p><bold>Ananthanarayanan, S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483510">2004</xref>)</bold> in his paper—‘Foreign Institutional Investors and Security Returns: Evidence from Indian Stock Exchanges’, held that as part of its initiative to liberalise it’s financial markets, India opened her doors to foreign institutional investors in September, 1992. This event represents a landmark event since it resulted in effectively globalising its financial services industry. We study the impact of trading of Foreign Institutional Investors on the major stock indices of India. Our major findings are as follows. First, they found that unexpected flows have a greater impact than expected flows on stock indices. Second, they find strong evidence consistent with the base broadening hypothesis. Third, they do not detect any evidence regarding momentum or contrarian strategies being employed by foreign institutional investors. Fourth, their findings support the price pressure hypothesis. Finally, they do not find any substantiation to the claim that foreigners ‘destabilize’ the market.</p>
<p><bold>Lakshmi Sharma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483510">2004</xref>)</bold> analyses the determinants of FII investment. Various parameters have been considered by FIIs while choosing to investment in a company. Data of 50 companies has been taken included in the S&amp;P CNX Nifty. A Regression model is used. FII investment is taken as dependent variable and determinants of FII investment that is impact cost, market return and shareholding pattern of non promoter category of shareholders to total outstanding shares as independent variable. Regression results show that impact cost of trading and non-promoter share holding are found to be significant variable while market return and volatility are not found to be significant. Impact cost has a negative sign which shows higher impact cost, the lower FII investment in the company and vice-versa. Non-promoter shareholding as a percentage of total outstanding shares is having a positive sign with the value of coefficient being 0.327 that is 1 per cent change in shareholding of non parameter category of shareholder would cause a 0.327 per cent change in FII investment. The coefficient in the case of impact cost being –102.94, it has emerged as most important variable explaining FII investment in a company.</p>
<p><bold>Rajput and Thaker (2005)</bold> examine causal relationship between exchange rate, FII investment and stock market index along with performing a regression analysis to develop a model to find prediction power of the relationship between the variables. Daily data has been taken from January 2000 to December 2005. The study found that there is no long run positive correlation between the exchange rate and Nifty. A negative trend was found over the six years leaving aside year 2002 and 2005 that provided a positive correlation between the two variables whereas a continuous positive correlation was found between FII investment and NIFTY showing that the FII significantly affects the nifty performance and is one of the moist important driving force of the stock market. However, FII flows failed to predict the future value of Nifty thereby providing evidence that FII is one of the important factors but only one significant factor affecting nifty.</p>
<p><bold>Lin, A. and Chen, C.Y. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483510">2006</xref>)</bold> in his paper entitled,—‘The Impact of Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors on Taiwan’s Stock Market’ has explored the relationship between qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs) and Taiwan‘s stock market and evaluates the effect of QFIIs’ investment transactions on Taiwan’s stock market. By taking the date of easing regulatory restrictions on foreigners’ stock investment holdings as a cutoff point, the research uses the highest and lowest 10 stocks of QFII holdings in three industry sectors as sample portfolios to study the prior- and post event returns.</p>
<p><bold>Soumyen, S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483510">2006</xref>)</bold> in his paper entitled,—‘Foreign Capital Inflow into India: Determinants and Management’, held that the surge in inflows has not been matched by a corresponding growth in the absorptive capacity of the Indian economy. The major reason is the persistent slowdown of industrial activity since 1997. At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been reluctant to let the rupee find its market-clearing level under the circumstances. This has resulted in steady accretion to our foreign exchange reserves (FER) over the last few years.</p>
<p><bold>Dhade and Kulshreshth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483510">2007</xref>)</bold> try to find the association between the BSE Sensex and Net FII flows. They used correlation coefficient along with finding out the periods in which FIIs prefer heavy fund deployment and the impact of FIIs on Indian stock market using the historical volatility of the market. Period of the study was from January 1993 to December 2004. Karl Pearson Coeffient’s of correlation is used. Results revealed that there is moderate degree of positive correlation between BSE Sensex and FIIs with the mean coefficient being 0.4999. For the entire period (Jan 1993 to Dec 2004) last quarterly results have shown a heavy investment buy international funds, which is measured by quarterly statistical mean of net FIIs. Lastly volatility of BSE Sensex is measured as standard deviation of monthly closings of the Sensex which carries out to be in the range of 6.27 to 7.89 per cent for the ten year period except 5.8 per cent in the year 1995. Results signify the existence of a partial correlation between the BSE Sensex and FII.</p>
<p><bold>Prasanna, P.K.</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483510">2008</xref>) in his paper entitled—‘Foreign Institutional Investors: Investment Preferences in India’ has examined the contribution of foreign institutional investment particularly among companies included in sensitivity index (Sensex) of Bombay Stock Exchange. In this study he also examined the relationship between foreign institutional investment and firm specific characteristics in terms of ownership structure, financial performance and stock performance. It is observed that foreign investors invested more in companies with a higher volume of shares owned by the general public. The promoters’ holdings and the foreign investments are inversely related. Foreign investors choose the companies where family shareholding of promoters is not substantial. Among the financial performance variables the share returns and earnings per share are significant factors influencing their investment decision.</p>
<p><bold>Thenmozhi M. and Manish Kumar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483510">2009</xref>)</bold> examine whether the information on mutual funds flows can be used to predict the changes in market returns and volatility by testing the causal relationship between market returns and mutual funds flows in presence of market fundamental. EGARCH (1, 1) model has been used while causality has been tested using VAR model. Results failed to provide any significant impact of MF flows (purchases, sales and net) on the market return.</p>

The author used monthly data on Sensex based stock return and net FII flows over a period of 17 years spanning from January 1993 to May 2009, provides the evidence of positive correlation between FII net flows into India and stock market return and author also found that the movements in the Indian capital market are fairly explained by the FII net inflows.</p>

<title>Impact of FIIs, DIIs and MFs</title>
<p>Indian Stock market has two main Stock Exchanges. First is Bombay Stock Exchange and other is National Stock Exchange. Bombay Stock Exchange represents Sensex and NSE represents Nifty. In this article we tried to find the impact of FIIs, DIIs and Mutual Funds on the Indian Stock Market. The Extant literature broadly supports the view that FIIs run the Indian Stock market. They are the one who basically play a vital role in influencing the Indian Stock market. Investor has perception that whenever the market goes up, it is because that FIIs buying the stocks and if the market comes down then it shows that FIIs selling the stock. But our thoughts are different. It is not only the FIIs who run the market but Mutual Funds and Domestic Institutional Investors also have an impact on Indian Stock market.</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>The broad methodology is to set up relationships between buying and selling patterns of FIIs, DIIs and MFs, which can be called the three main institutional segments of participants that may be driving the market. There could be three possibilities:
<list id="list7-2319510X13483510" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The buying and selling patterns of the particular ‘institutional segment’ cause the market in terms of volume, turnover, price and return;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The volume, turnover, price and return in the market cause the buying and selling patterns of the ‘institutional segment’; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both the market and the ‘institutional segment’ cause each other (bi-way causality).</p>
<p>It is evident that only the first case merits the label ‘drives the market’.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The study has been done with the help of secondary data obtained from various sources like official websites of BSE, NSE, SEBI, RBI and Money Control. Microsoft Excel has been used for processing the data which has been further analysed by using SPSS (Version 16.0). There are two steps in our procedure of methodology:

<title>Testing for Units Roots</title>
<p>The properties of a time series depend on its order of integration, d, that is on the presence of unit roots. It is important to have techniques available to determine the actual form of non-stationarity and to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic trends if possible. There are two kinds of statistical tests: one group is based on the unit root hypothesis while the other is on the stationary null hypothesis.</p>
<p>We consider an <bold>AR (1)</bold> model:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-2319510X13483510">
y<sub>t </sub>= <italic>ρ</italic> y<sub>t–1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where y<sub>0</sub> = 0 and εt is a white noise sequence with constant variance. This model has been widely used to describe the behaviour of finance time series such as stock prices, exchange rates, etc. A unit root is present if ρ = 1. The model would be non-stationary in this case.</p>
<p>The regression model can be written as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-2319510X13483510">
Δy<sub>t </sub>= (<italic>ρ–1)</italic> y<sub>t–1</sub> + ε<sub>t </sub>= <italic>δ</italic> y<sub>t–1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where Δ is the first order difference. In this model we test for a unit root by testing δ = 0 (where δ = ρ − 1). Since the test is done over the residual term, rather than raw data, we cannot use the ordinary t-statistic. Therefore, we use τ that has a distribution called Dickey Fuller table.</p>
<p>There are three main versions of the test:
<list id="list8-2319510X13483510" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Test for a unit root:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-2319510X13483510">
Δy<sub>t </sub>= <italic>δ</italic> y<sub>t–1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
</disp-formula></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Test for a unit root with drift:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-2319510X13483510">
Δy<sub>t </sub>= α<sub>0 </sub>+<italic>δ</italic> y<sub>t–1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
</disp-formula></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Test for a unit root with drift and deterministic time trend:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-2319510X13483510">
Δy<sub>t </sub>= α<sub>0 </sub>+ <italic>δ</italic> y<sub>t–1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
</disp-formula></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The critical value depends on sample size. The null hypothesis is that there is a unit root, δ = 0. For a larger and more complicated set of time series models. The augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) statistic is used. It yields a negative number. The more negative it is the stronger is the rejection of the hypothesis that there is a unit root at some level of confidence. Both the DF and the ADF tests assume that the errors are statistically independent and have a constant variance. Thus, an error term should be uncorrelated with the others and has constant variance.</p>
<p>The unit root test is then carried out under the null hypothesis δ = 0 against the alternative hypothesis of δ &lt; 0. The Dickey-Fuller test statistic is:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-2319510X13483510">DFT (τ) = Estimated (δ)/Std. Error of (Estimated).</disp-formula></p>
<p>is computed it can be compared to the relevant critical value for the Dickey–Fuller Test. If the test statistic is less (this test is non symmetrical so we do not consider an absolute value) than (a larger negative) the critical value, then the null hypothesis of δ = 0 is rejected and no unit root is present. For simple model of Unit Root testing that we are using there would be no difference between DF and ADF.</p>

<title>Granger Causality Test</title>
<p>The Granger causality test is a technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. A time series X is said to Granger-cause Y if it can be shown, usually through a series of F-tests on lagged values of X (and with lagged values of Y also known), that those X values provide statistically significant information about future values of Y. Granger causality is a statistical concept of causality that is based on prediction. According to Granger causality, if a signal X1 ‘Granger-causes’ (or ‘G-causes’) a signal X2, then past values of X1 should contain information that helps predict X2 above and beyond the information contained in past values of X2 alone. Its mathematical formulation is based on linear regression modelling of stochastic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483510">Granger, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>G-causality is normally tested in the context of linear regression models. Consider a bivariate linear autoregressive model of two variables X1(t) and X2(t):

<p>Where p is the maximum number of lagged observations included in the model (the model order), the matrix A contains the coefficients of the model (i.e., the contributions of each lagged observation to the predicted values of X1(t) and X2(t) and E1 (t) and E2 (t) are residuals (prediction errors) for each time series. If the variance of E1 (t) or E2 (t) is reduced by the inclusion of X1(t) or X2(t) terms in the first (or second) equation, then it is said that X1(t) or X2(t) Granger-(G)-causes X1(t) or X2(t), respectively. In other words, X2(t) G-causes X1(t) if the coefficients in A12 are jointly significantly different from zero. This can be tested by performing an F-test of the null hypothesis that A12 =0, given assumptions of covariance stationarity on X1(t) and X2(t). The magnitude of a G-causality interaction can be estimated by the logarithm of the corresponding F-statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483510">Geweke 1982</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2319510X13483510">2</xref></sup> We have used on one period lag length because in the case of the stock markets we do not expect the lag to be more than one month because it is a dynamic market.</p>

<p>It is known that FIIs come for short term return. It is therefore, assumed that they would go to stock markets that have a high degree of volatility. However, it is equally likely that they would be interested in causing volatility without which they cannot hope to gain such speculative returns. Once such volatility exists FIIs would like to take advantage of it for return. Return cannot be had without constantly buying and selling. Therefore, it is important to test for relationship between buying selling decisions and trading indicators like volume and turnover and not just return which is obvious. They just wish and assume that markets are related in terms of return.</p>

<p>It is both our belief and understanding that markets and participants are related not only through return but also through other factors as mentioned—volume, turnover and so on. Even if return is the objective and the net result of efficient markets, to ignore these variables would mean to ignore the dynamics of the market.</p>
<p>Coming back to causality the institutions could cause the market or the market cause the institution, or both could cause each other. The calculus is as follows. There are six institutional market transactions (2(buy and sell) x3 segments) and eight market factors (4(volume, turnover, index and log return) x 2 markets—NSE and BSE). This makes it a total of 48 cases. In a completely endogenous market model all relations would be bi-way causal. Hence, if we find that all 48 relations are bi-way causal then it implies that no institutional investor exclusively ‘drives’ the market. If we find that there is a particular bi-way causal relationship, especially with the index return, then we can, at the best say that the institution is both driven and yet drives the market. In the case of FIIs such behaviour is expected that is how they ‘play’ with markets. ‘Whip up volatility and gain from it’ is the most apt slogan for FIIs. Driving markets is a positive phenomenon while ‘milching’ a market is destabilising. It leads to dumping the ‘cow’ when it is exhausted.</p>
<p>On testing for Unit Roots we found that all variables are I (1) s. We then differenced the variable and made them I (0) s. In this form Log Sensex and Log Nifty represent log returns (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483510">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Case1: FII buy causes Nifty turnover. Nifty turnover causes FII Buy (bi-way causality).</p>
<p>Case 2: FII Sell causes Sensex Turnover, Nifty and LogNifty.</p>
<p>Case 3: Sensex Turnover causes DII buy. DIIbuy causes Nifty and Log Nifty</p>
<p>Case4: Sensex causes DII sell. Log Sensex causes DII sell. Nifty turnover causes DII Sell</p>
<p>Case 5: Mutual Funds buy causes Sensex turnover</p>
<p>Case6: Mutual Funds sell causes Nifty turnover</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Out of the possible 48 bi-way outcomes only FIIs have the dubious distinction of having bi-way causality. The other two institutional segments have only one-way causal relations with market variables (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2319510X13483510">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Above cases reflect that it is not only FII who has influence on the Indian stock market. DII and Mutual Funds also have an impact on Indian stock market. FII buying of equity has positive influence on nifty turnover and at the same time nifty turnover also has positive impact on FII. The increase in Nifty turnover shows that investors had bought the stock and had perceived that the market would rise in the future. But at the same time selling pressure of FII caused Sensex turnover, Nifty and Log nifty to fall in the future. The FII sale meant that FIIs were withdrawing their money from the market. This herding behaviour of FII shows that they do not invest their money in the market for growth of a particular country but they look of their own profits and they try to earn on volatility of the market.</p>
<p>Domestic investors purchase stock because they want growth of the country and that is why DII buy influence nifty and log nifty. Sensex turnover also has shown an on impact on DII buy, but a fall in Sensex causes worry for DIIs. This is shown from above results that Sensex log Sensex and Nifty influence DII to sell their stock.</p>
<p>Mutual funds also had some impact on stock market. Bulk buying of stock by mutual funds shows that investors are investing their money in stock market. That is why mutual funds buy has positive impact on stock turnover and on the contrary mutual funds influence Nifty turnover.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Indian stock market is visited by three major players—FIIs, Mutual Funds (MFs) and Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs). This article lays down the analytical framework for comparing the nature and role of the three players. It uses a framework for empirically testing the impact of each player on the stock market. Through a set of Granger causality tests, it verifies the popular hypothesis that FIIs dominate the Indian stock market.</p>
<p>The results are quite startling. FIIs are the only institutional investors who have dubious distinction of having bi-way causality with stock market in respect of nifty turnover. This shows that FIIs are able to manipulate the market. FIIs sell effects nifty return. On the other hand, DIIs buy effect nifty return. This clearly shows that DIIs are surviving on the stocks dumped by FIIs. Hence, all the expected gains from the FIIs are not found such as increasing the liquidity of the market and bringing depth to the market. If this works to happen, then other institutional investors will benefit. Our results show that FIIs are not the only active players who have an influence in Indian stock market even DIIs have an influence, whereas Mutual funds are the passive players. FIIs are essentially opportunistic agents who do not cause any fundamental change in the market but themselves opportunistically gain from the market.</p>
