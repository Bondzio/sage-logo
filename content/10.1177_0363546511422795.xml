<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Massive irreparable rotator cuff tears in patients without advanced glenohumeral arthritis can pose a challenge to surgeons. Numerous management strategies have been utilized, and studies have shown varied results with regard to shoulder pain, range of motion, strength, and overall function.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: Patients undergoing repair of massive irreparable rotator cuff tears through a mini-open approach with the use of human dermal tissue matrix allograft would demonstrate an improvement in pain, range of motion, strength, and subjective functional outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: We performed a prospective observational study of 24 patients who underwent interposition repair of massive rotator cuff tears using human dermal allograft. All patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively by the treating surgeon. Data were collected preoperatively and postoperatively for an average 3-year follow-up period (range, 29-40 months). Active range of motion as well as supraspinatus and infraspinatus strength was assessed. Subjective outcome measures included pain level (visual analog scale of 0-10, with 10 = severe pain), American Shoulder and Elbow Score (ASES), and Short-Form 12 (SF-12) score. Imaging evaluation to assess for repair integrity was performed using static and dynamic ultrasonography at final follow-up.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Mean pain level decreased from 5.4 to 0.9 (<italic>P</italic> = .0002). Mean active forward flexion and external rotation motion improved from 111.7° to 157.3° (<italic>P</italic> = .0002) and from 46.2° to 65.1° (<italic>P</italic> = .001), respectively. Mean shoulder abduction improved from 105.0° to 151.7° (<italic>P</italic> = .0001). Supraspinatus and infraspinatus strength improved from 7.2 to 9.4 (<italic>P</italic> = .0003) and from 7.8 to 9.3 (<italic>P</italic> = .002), respectively. Mean ASES improved from 66.6 to 88.7 (<italic>P</italic> = .0003). Mean SF-12 scores improved from 48.8 to 56.8 (<italic>P</italic> = .03). One partial graft retear occurred because of patient noncompliance during postoperative rehabilitation. However, this patient still demonstrated improvement in pain, motion, and subjective outcomes at final follow-up. Ultrasonography demonstrated “fully intact” repairs in 76% of patients. All remaining patients had “partially intact” repairs. There were no complete tears.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: In our series of carefully selected candidates, all patients demonstrated a significant improvement in pain, range of motion, and strength. Subjective outcome measures, including mean ASES and SF-12 scores, also demonstrated significant improvement at an average 3-year follow-up.</p>

<body>
<p>The rotator cuff plays key roles during static and dynamic motion of the glenohumeral joint. It functions to compress the humeral head into the glenoid to resist translation and provides stabilization throughout all axes of motion. When a patient acquires a rotator cuff tear, whether it is acute or chronic, the mechanics of the glenohumeral joint are altered. This can lead to pain, loss of motion, and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422795">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511422795">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The definition of a massive rotator cuff tear varies in the literature. Commonly accepted definitions include a full-thickness tear with the length of the greatest diameter of the tear greater than 5 cm or a full-thickness tear involving at least 2 tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511422795">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511422795">13</xref></sup> Management of massive rotator cuff tears can be challenging, with failure rates ranging from 20% to 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511422795">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511422795">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511422795">12</xref></sup> Treatment of chronic massive irreparable cuff tears includes nonoperative management, debridement, debridement with partial repair (open or arthroscopic), muscle transfers, arthroplasty, tissue interposition, and extracellular matrix augmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422795">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511422795">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422795">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422795">18</xref></sup> Poor pain relief and functional outcomes have led to the need for new repair and/or reconstructive strategies. We describe a technique via a mini-open approach to address chronic irreparable rotator cuff tears using human dermal tissue matrix allograft.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511422795" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study. Informed consent was obtained on all patients. From June 2007 to October 2008, 24 patients (24 shoulders) underwent interposition repair of massive irreparable rotator cuff tears using GraftJacket allograft (Wright Medical Technology Inc, Arlington, Tennessee) through a mini-open approach. The use of this graft as an interposition to fill the void created by severe retraction of the native cuff is “off label” according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (please refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov">www.fda.gov</ext-link> for further details on regulations regarding the use of extracellular tissue matrices for rotator cuff repair). Twelve men and 12 women, average age of 63 years (range, 45-83 years), composed the cohort. The senior author (A.P.T.) in the study performed all surgeries and postoperative physical examinations.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that patients undergoing repair of massive irreparable rotator cuff tears would demonstrate improvements in pain, range of motion, strength, and subjective functional outcomes. Inclusion criteria included a full-thickness rotator cuff tear with tear retraction greater than 5 cm based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), failure of a minimum 6 months’ nonoperative management (including physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication), inability to reduce the residual cuff to the anatomic footprint after full mobilization of the tendon, and the ability to fully participate in the postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Exclusion criteria included glenohumeral arthritis and/or rotator cuff tear arthropathy based on preoperative radiographs and MRI, greater than 50% fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus muscle based on the T1-weighted oblique sagittal MRI view,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511422795">14</xref></sup> prior rotator cuff repair, rotator cuff that is reducible to the lateral footprint during arthroscopy (no interposition needed), and an inability to participate in the postoperative rehabilitation protocol.</p>
<p>Data were collected prospectively at an average 3-year follow-up (range, 29-42 months). Objective outcome measures consisted of active range of motion including forward flexion, glenohumeral abduction, external rotation at 0° of shoulder abduction, and supraspinatus and infraspinatus strength. Strength assessment was evaluated based on the Modified Medical Research Council Scale for strength assessment. These values were then converted to a 10-point scale based on the strength scale defined by Kendall et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511422795">16</xref></sup> (see the Appendix, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>) for statistical analysis purposes. If the patient had a pain-free shoulder on the contralateral side, then this was added as a reference for strength comparison as well. Subjective outcome measures included pain determined by visual analog scale (VAS) (range of 0-10, 10 = severe pain), American Shoulder and Elbow Score (ASES), and Short-Form 12 (SF-12) score. Data were collected preoperatively and postoperatively for an average 3-year follow-up period (range, 29-40 months).</p>
<p>Imaging of the rotator cuff using ultrasonography was performed at a mean 3-year follow-up (minimum, 2 years). Ultrasounds were performed and interpreted by 2 independent physicians with expertise in musculoskeletal ultrasonography. Each physician has more than 3 years’ experience in musculoskeletal ultrasonography, has performed a minimum of 2000 shoulder sonograms, and is a continuing medical education (CME) instructor on musculoskeletal ultrasonography. Images were obtained using a GE Logic E (General Electric, Fairfield, Connecticut) gray-scale ultrasound machine and a 12-MHz probe. Dynamic and static images were taken of the complete shoulder using standard shoulder imaging protocols. The ultrasonographer identified both the native rotator cuff tendon and the graft. The repairs were classified as “fully intact,” “partially intact,” and “not intact” based on the appearance of the graft-tendon interface as well as the tendon at the anatomic footprint on the humeral head. A “fully intact” construct indicated that there were no visible defects in the graft-tendon interface and the graft was fully attached to the humerus. “Partially intact” indicated that there was a defect detected in either the graft-tendon interface or graft-humerus interface. The defect, however, did not extend the full thickness of the graft-tendon or graft-humeral interface. “Not intact” meant that there was a full-thickness defect with no rotator cuff attached to the graft or no graft remaining on the humeral footprint.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare 3 or more means because data were collected on all patients under repeated conditions. Standard deviation was calculated on all data sets. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 indicated statistical significance.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511422795">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The patient was positioned in the standard 60° beach-chair position. A diagnostic arthroscopic procedure was performed through posterior and anterior portals, and a lateral instrumentation portal was created. The glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints were evaluated for any arthritic changes and debrided as necessary. Biceps tenotomy or tenodesis was performed if there was evidence of biceps tear, subluxation into the joint, or severe tendinopathy due to the high incidence of biceps injury in patients with massive cuff tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511422795">8</xref></sup> Tenotomy was performed in patients older than 65 years who were unconcerned about supination torque power or cosmesis or if tendon quality was so poor that the surgeon anticipated that it would not be secure with fixation. An arthroscopic procedure was performed to achieve complete visualization of the rotator cuff tear pattern and severity, especially the extent of retraction, mobility, and thickness of the rotator cuff. The subacromial bursa was resected using a shaver to fully visualize the rotator cuff, and any residual unhealthy-appearing rotator cuff tissue was debrided. A formal acromioplasty was never performed. Hypertrophic subacromial spurring or soft tissue (coracoacromial ligament thickening and fraying) was debrided if it impinged on the rotator cuff when the shoulder was brought into 90° of abduction and external rotation. Otherwise, the coracoacromial ligament was preserved. A distal clavicle excision was performed if there was severe acromioclavicular arthropathy. Adhesions superficial and deep to the rotator cuff were then released, and a grasper was used to mobilize the residual tendon. If the rotator cuff could not be reduced to cover the anatomic footprint, the allograft was used to reconstruct the tendon to fill this void.</p>
<p>To begin the repair technique, sutures were passed into the native rotator cuff arthroscopically in an incline mattress fashion using the Opus Smart Stitch device (Arthrocare, Sunnyvale, California) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511422795">Figure 1</xref>). A mini-open approach to the rotator cuff was then utilized. A 4-cm incision was made along the lateral acromion and carried down sharply to the superficial deltoid fascia. The raphe between the anterior and lateral deltoid was incised longitudinally with electrocautery. A Cobb elevator was placed under the tendon to release any additional adhesions to the underlying humeral head to ensure complete mobilization of the cuff that may have not been achieved arthroscopically. The dermal allograft was rehydrated in normal saline according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The defect was drawn to size on the operative field and imprinted onto a paper template. The paper template was then used to size the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511422795">Figure 2</xref>). Sclerotic bone or osteophytes on the greater tuberosity were removed with a shaver on bur mode to create a flat, bleeding, bony bed to encourage healing of the graft to the tuberosity. Two or 3 Biocryl Rapide 4.5-mm suture anchors (DePuy Mitek Inc, Raynham, Massachusetts) were placed at the articular margin for medial row fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511422795">Figure 3</xref>). The No. 2 Orthocord (DePuy Mitek Inc) sutures emanating from these anchors were passed through the native rotator cuff if it could be reduced to the articular margin or through the graft if the native tendon could not be reduced to the articular margin. The horizontal mattress sutures, if already passed through the native rotator cuff, were then passed in a horizontal mattress fashion through the graft tissue using a free-hand technique or with a MultiFire Scorpion (Arthrex Inc, Naples, Florida). The graft was then “zip-lined” down to fill the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511422795">Figure 4</xref>). The medial articular margin sutures were tied, and the graft was then placed over the rotator cuff footprint. Three to 4 incline horizontal mattress sutures were passed into the lateral aspect of the graft. The free suture limbs in the lateral graft were then anchored to the greater tuberosity 10 to 15 mm distally with Opus Magnum (Arthrocare) knotless anchors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511422795">Figure 5</xref>). This provided double-row fixation. The construct was then secured circumferentially to the surrounding infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons with No. 2 Ethibond figure-of-8 sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey). We aimed to achieve a watertight seal between the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space with the graft.</p>

<p>Physical therapy was initiated on postoperative day 3. Phase I comprised the first 12 weeks and allowed pain-free passive range of motion exercises with scapular stabilization. Weeks 8 to 12 focused on progressive active-assisted range of motion. Active range of motion in all planes started at week 12. Phase II comprised progressive isometric strengthening exercises and began at 12 weeks postoperatively. Phase III was initiated at 4 months with goals of progression to full activities of daily living.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All patients were satisfied with their outcome and would have the surgery again. There were no infections or evidence of inflammatory reaction or tissue rejection. In all 24 cases, this human dermal allograft was utilized to bridge the void between the irreducible retracted cuff and its native anatomic footprint. Average tear size in its longest dimension before mobilization of the native rotator cuff was 5.4 cm (range, 5.0-5.8 cm). A 5 × 5-cm graft that was 1.5 mm thick was utilized in each case following full mobilization of the rotator cuff. All 24 patients returned for clinical examination follow-up. Mean pain level decreased from 5.4 to 0.9 (<italic>P</italic> = .0002). Mean active forward flexion and external rotation motion improved from 111.7° to 157.3° (<italic>P</italic> = .0002) and from 46.2° to 65.1° (<italic>P</italic> = .001), respectively. Mean shoulder abduction improved from 105.0° to 151.7° (<italic>P</italic> = .0001). Supraspinatus and infraspinatus strength improved from 7.2 to 9.4 (<italic>P</italic> = .0003) and from 7.8 to 9.3 (<italic>P</italic> = .002), respectively. Mean ASES improved from 66.6 to 88.7 (<italic>P</italic> = .0003). Mean SF-12 scores improved from 48.8 to 56.8 (<italic>P</italic> = .03). Refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511422795">Table 1</xref> for a summary of results. For the first 10 procedures, the average operative time was 3 hours. This decreased to 2 hours subsequently. Of note, this operative time includes the time required to address additional intra-articular injury (ie, biceps tenotomy or tenodesis, distal clavicle excision, and subacromial decompression) if warranted. Refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511422795">Table 2</xref> for a summary of associated intraoperative procedures. A margin convergence repair of the native cuff was not performed in any cases.</p>

<p>All 3 cases were partial articular-sided tears. These were repaired primarily to the graft using No. 2 Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey) after securing the graft to the lateral footprint.</p>

<p>One partial graft retear occurred because of patient noncompliance with postoperative rehabilitation. This patient began weightlifting and swimming with his operative extremity at 2 weeks postoperatively. Despite the tear, this patient demonstrated an overall improvement in pain, range of motion, and subjective outcomes at final follow-up, with his only complaint being an occasional mechanical clicking sensation deep in the shoulder with no associated pain. Nineteen of the patients (80%) returned for follow-up ultrasound. Three patients could not attend this appointment because of illness. The other 2 patients could not attend because of lack of transportation. Fourteen of 19 (74%) patients demonstrated “fully intact” repairs. The remaining 5 patients (26%) had “partially intact” repairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546511422795">Figure 6</xref>). There were no complete tears.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Massive irreparable rotator cuff tear management continues to challenge surgeons. Numerous treatment strategies have been utilized, and various studies have shown improved results with shoulder pain, range of motion, and function. Rockwood et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511422795">19</xref></sup> reported 83% satisfactory results with debridement, subacromial decompression, and acromioplasty of massive degenerative irreparable rotator cuff tears. Burkhart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511422795">6</xref></sup> reported significant functional improvement with arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears with stage 3 and 4 fatty degeneration. Nove-Josserand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422795">18</xref></sup> reported improved pain, range of motion, and strength with latissimus dorsi transfer for irreparable tears with loss of external rotation.</p>
<p>Overall outcome and rotator cuff healing ability, however, can be correlated inversely to the size and amount of retraction of tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511422795">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511422795">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422795">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511422795">22</xref></sup> In a recent prospective, randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of debridement or partial repair of massive cuff tears, patients demonstrated improvements in pain, Constant scores, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores. The partial repair group demonstrated improved outcomes versus the debridement group. The retear rate for partial repair, however, was 52% based on ultrasonography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422795">4</xref></sup> Galatz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511422795">12</xref></sup> reported a 94% retear rate at 2-year follow-up on patients undergoing all-arthroscopic repair of large rotator cuff tears. Sugaya et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511422795">21</xref></sup> reported a 5% retear rate for small to medium-sized tears and a 40% retear rate for large and massive tears after arthroscopic double-row repair. The shoulders with larger repair defects also demonstrated inferior functional outcomes.</p>
<p>With the advent of extracellular matrix scaffolds, new treatment strategies have evolved to address both the technical, mechanical, and biological healing difficulty associated with primary repair of massive rotator cuff tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511422795">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511422795">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422795">17</xref></sup> GraftJacket (Wright Medical Technology Inc) is an acellular, noncrosslinked human dermal allograft. It functions as a regenerative tissue matrix to promote tendon healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422795">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511422795">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511422795">21</xref></sup> It is FDA approved for use in rotator cuff augmentation, not as an interposition graft. Therefore, its use in our technique is “off label” (please refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov">www.fda.gov</ext-link> for further details on regulations regarding the use of extracellular tissue matrices for rotator cuff repair). When used to augment rotator cuff tears, it has demonstrated improved failure strength compared with primary rotator cuff repair alone. In a recent cadaveric model undergoing load to failure of primary repair versus human dermal allograft augmented repair, the augmented samples demonstrated significantly improved failure loads compared with the primary repair group. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511422795">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The in vivo behavior of human dermal allograft used in rotator cuff repairs in humans is not known, but animal studies have shown promising results. In a canine model, full-thickness infraspinatus tears were created, and either human dermal allograft or the autologous tendon was used to bridge the defect. At time 0, strength of control and experimental repairs was similar. At 6 weeks, the strength of the allograft repair was half that of the autologous repair, but by 12 weeks, the strength of the 2 groups was the same. Histologically, cells infiltrated both groups by 6 weeks. At 6 months, both groups had normal tendon structure both grossly and histologically. This study suggests that this human dermal allograft has the potential to behave like native tendon both biomechanically and histologically in the early postoperative period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511422795">1</xref></sup> In a recent biopsy specimen obtained from a 62-year-old patient with a massive rotator cuff tear augmented with human dermal allograft, there was evidence of incorporation of the allograft demonstrated by cellular infiltration, alignment of collagen fibers, and blood vessel ingrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511422795">20</xref></sup> These findings suggest that this allograft can play a relevant role in rotator cuff healing at the cellular level.</p>
<p>Clinical results of human dermal allograft repair of the rotator cuff have also been promising.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422795">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511422795">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511422795">23</xref></sup> Bond et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422795">5</xref></sup> recently described the results of a technique of staged arthroscopic reconstruction with the use of human dermal allograft that demonstrated improved overall functional outcomes at a mean 26-month follow-up. In addition, 13 of 16 patients demonstrated full incorporation of the graft into native tissue on MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422795">5</xref></sup> This technique, albeit successful, is technically challenging and requires a highly skilled arthroscopist. We believe that our mini-open technique is easily reproducible for most surgeons given direct visualization of the tear pattern and ease of suture management. In addition, a staged approach involving 2 surgeries is not necessary. We also have not found it necessary to detach the deltoid via a formal open approach for visualization during matrix implantation as described by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511422795">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511422795">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511422795">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422795">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to recognize that our patient population had good preoperative active range of motion without evidence of glenohumeral arthritis. In addition, they did not have high-grade fatty infiltration of the tendon based on oblique sagittal T1-weighed MRI. These factors facilitate a robust repair of the native cuff to the graft. Performing this procedure in patients with glenohumeral arthritis, pseudoparalysis, or high-grade fatty infiltration may lead to inferior results. In a prospective evaluation of chronic rotator cuff tears repaired primarily, Thomazeau et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511422795">22</xref></sup> demonstrated that the grade of supraspinatus atrophy on MRI oblique sagittal views directly correlated with the sagittal and coronal extent of the tear and represented a strong predictive factor of postoperative retearing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, human dermal allograft interposition repair of massive rotator cuff tears through a mini-open approach is a reproducible technique that leads to significant improvement in pain, range of motion, strength, and subjective outcome measures. Ultrasound imaging at an average 3 years postoperatively demonstrated fully intact repairs in the majority of patients. In addition, it has proven to be safe in our patient cohort, with no incidence of infection or tissue rejection. Future studies comparing rotator cuff interposition allograft repair to partial repair (open or arthroscopic) are indicated to assess if one technique yields better long-term outcomes. In addition, a cost-effective analysis of extracellular tissue matrix versus arthroscopic repair, while taking into consideration long-term outcomes and quality-adjusted life years, would also help guide treatment intervention in the new health- care environment.</p>
