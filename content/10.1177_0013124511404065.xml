<abstract>
<p>The promise of the charter public school model offers flexibility and autonomy for leaders to enable them to experiment and innovate when running their school. This study examined the leadership of four Boston charter public high schools with predominantly Black and Hispanic, low-income populations that have shown progress narrowing the achievement gap. In-depth semistructured interviews explored the leadership’s success to improve student outcomes compared with the sending district and the state. Findings suggest that leadership is instrumental to the success of each charter public school in this study. Many common characteristics emerge among all four schools, however, the distinctiveness and success of each school is the result of leadership’s ability to orchestrate the characteristics and decisions that culminate to create each educational community. Three dimensions particularly emerged as essential to each school’s success according to leadership: (a) high expectations for student outcome as measured by college completion; (b) safe and orderly learning environment; and (c) an all-school adherence to leadership’s vision in the context of the school’s mission. Each dimension is interpreted and implemented differently depending on the school mission and the leader’s particular vision, experience, and personality resulting in distinct organizational cultures at each school.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The achievement gap indicates disparities in access, expectation, and outcomes in education. Specifically, the achievement gap refers to disparities between low-income and non-low-income populations and among Whites, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics. The gap between classes and races does not begin in school. Rather, the socioeconomic and cultural factors that affect the learning of low-income Black and Hispanic students begins long before school age. Identified 40 years ago, local, state, and federal agencies have implemented programs and passed legislation aimed at closing the achievement gap since the 1960s. Despite initial progress in the early 1970s, the gap persists. Since the 1980s, most state- and national-level efforts aimed at reducing the achievement gap between low-income and non-low-income and African American and White students have had little effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511404065">Dillon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511404065">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124511404065">Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013124511404065">Tonn, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Charter public schools are publicly funded, nonsectarian, independently managed schools of choice almost entirely supported by federal and state taxpayer funds. The origin of charter public schools stems from a belief that parents and guardians should be empowered to choose what educational program their students may attend and a belief that to reform public education, significant changes had to occur in the way schools are run. Thus, they were created as a choice to traditional district public schools. Legislation creating the first charter public schools was passed in Minnesota in 1991, and as of October 2009, 4,578 charter public schools serve 1,407,421 students in 40 states and the District of Columbia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511404065">Edreform, 2008</xref>). Nationally, charters serve a larger proportion of Black and Hispanic and low-income students than traditional public schools, a characteristic due largely to the disproportionate number of charter public schools in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013124511404065">U.S. Department of Education, Office of Innovation and Improvement, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The demonstrated effectiveness of charter public schools at raising student achievement on a national level has been mixed. However, when specific groups of students are analyzed, recent studies have found that charter public schools outperform noncharter public schools with similar student demographics in standardized state reading and math assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511404065">Ellis, Gaudet, Hoover, Kaufman, &amp; Mader, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511404065">Hoxby, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511404065">2004</xref>) including in Boston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511404065">Fullerton &amp; Kane, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Education, 2006</xref>). Four high-poverty charter public high schools with high Black and Hispanic populations reside in Boston, Massachusetts. These four schools serve a total of approximately 800 students. Findings suggest that these small, intensive, college-prep public schools have been successful at raising the academic achievement of their students and narrowing the academic achievement gap when compared with their sending district and the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Education, 2007</xref>). This study applied qualitative data collection and analysis to explore the success of four urban charter public high schools with high-poverty and high-minority<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013124511404065">1</xref></sup> populations and the reasons for that success according to school leaders. Though each Massachusetts charter public school is evaluated annually by the Massachusetts Department of Education and studies on the academic achievement of individual Massachusetts charter public schools has been conducted, no known substantive analysis, description, and comparison of the leadership of multiple successful charter public high schools in Boston has been conducted.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>This study examines how the leaders of four charter public schools in Boston with high concentrations of low-income Black and Hispanic populations explained their student achievement.</p>
<p>The research questions were as follows:</p>

<title>Significance of This Research</title>
<p>This study occurs during a new era of accountability in public education in the United States. The charter public schools in this study are evaluated by the state every 5 years and can be closed as the result of poor student performance or lack of fiscal viability. No Child Left Behind legislation, in theory, applies similar school-level accountability to all public schools both charter and traditional district. Therefore, effective school-level practices and characteristics deserve widespread consideration, as all public schools face increased accountability. More importantly, the characteristics of schools effective at raising student achievement have been identified for decades yet a gap between demographic groups persists. Closely analyzing four successful schools may shed light on how the leaders brought all characteristics together to transform the schools and make them effective and can provide insight for policy makers and administrators into what stands between (often expensive) education reform efforts and actual, quantifiable student success. Finally, identifying strategies successful at addressing the achievement gap may contribute to the effort to enable Black, Hispanic, and low-income students to perform better academically, complete high school, and, with the opportunity of postsecondary education, be afforded more opportunities for educational, economic, and social mobility.</p>

<title>Review of Literature</title>
<p>School leadership is an essential element in catalyzing the characteristics of a school for a dramatic transformation; leaders have the knowledge and skill to raise the achievement of all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511404065">Edmonds, 1979</xref>). The cumulative effect of individual characteristics of effective schools is considerably greater than the effect of any of the individual factors on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013124511404065">Rutter, Maughan, Mortimore, &amp; Ouston, 1979</xref>). The cumulative effect of positive characteristics of a school contribute to its effectiveness and enable a school to overcome the social, psychological, and economic challenges that are associated with the achievement gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013124511404065">Rutter et al., 1979</xref>). The effective characteristics of a school are the product of school-based leadership rather than outside forces. The individual actions and policies of a school leader combine to create a particular ethos or set of values, attitudes, and culture making their school distinctive. Often, leadership of effective schools are empowered to make decisions that affect the academic curriculum, teaching, and school culture. Research on effective schools identifies common characteristics in each school.</p>
<p>This study shares the premise that leadership at the individual school level can raise the academic achievement of low-income Black and Hispanic students. The creation of charter public schools, and the resulting emphasis on school-level leadership, is one approach to the effort to raise the performance of Black and Hispanic students from low-income families. The creation of charter public schools was an attempt to empower individual school leaders to create effective schools, free from district constraints, while holding them accountable according to explicit, measurable student outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section5-0013124511404065">
<title>School Leadership and Raising Student Outcomes</title>
<p>School leaders cannot control prior academic preparation and performance, family income, family education, race, or dynamics of the home or community environment in which the students live. However, leadership can control their schools’ values, policies, and programs. Some school leaders are more effective than others at orchestrating the multiple dimensions of their school environments to raise student outcomes. Although there is only so much affect a leader of a school can have on their students’ cognitive development and skill acquisition, student achievement can be raised at the school level, even the achievement of students who arrive to school far behind their peers. The Black–White achievement gap, after all, has narrowed some over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>To identify effective leadership, one must identify effective schools. When schools with similar demographics and different outcomes are compared, definitions emerge of successful or effective schools. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013124511404065">Mortimore, Sammons, Stoll, Lewis, and Ecob (1988)</xref> define an effective school as one in which the leadership enacts changes that raises the academic outcomes of all students, regardless of family background. If all pupils who attend the school are successful, even those who are at an initial educational disadvantage because of their particular background characteristics, then the school should be considered effective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511404065">Edmonds (1979)</xref> defines two examples of an effective school: (a) when changes raise the outcomes of children from low-income families to match the minimal masteries of basic school skills of children from non-low-income families or (b) when changes in schools serving children from low-income families result in student outcomes at or above the district average grade equivalent in math or reading. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013124511404065">Sammons, Hillman, and Mortimore (1995)</xref> defines an effective school as one that has “value add” to students’ education after a year of schooling compared with assessments administered at the beginning of the year. This progress should then be compared with the “value add” of other district schools with the same demographics. (It is important to note in these definitions the emphasis is on students’ outcomes rather than the particular policies or methods in the day-to-day operation of the school.)</p>
<p>Once a school is determined effective, the leadership can be analyzed. The literature reviewed revealed patterns in the leadership of effective schools.</p>
<p>In successful schools, leadership established:</p>
<list id="list2-0013124511404065" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>a clearly articulated mission and vision;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>high standards of achievement;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>clearly articulated curriculum and pedagogical methodology;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a safe and orderly school environment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>collegiality among teachers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a practice of analyzing data to inform instruction; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>engagement of parents and guardians in the school community.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Though patterns emerge, how leadership implemented each approach at their school differed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124511404065">Table 1</xref>). Each of the seven characteristics above has multiple dimensions and meaning according to how a leader chooses to emphasize and integrate them into the school environment.</p>

<p>A public school, if well led, can raise student outcomes of Black and Hispanic students from low-income families even without also supporting investments in health, social, early childhood, after-school, and summer programs. However, achieving this feat, during short school days of a 180-day school year is very difficult without a significant increase in public school budgets on a large scale (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124511404065">Rothstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013124511404065">Tough, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The interrelation of multiple dimensions of the school environment are crucial to facilitate effective teaching and learning. To effectively combine characteristics of effective leadership to narrow the achievement gap requires flexibility, creativity, and autonomy. These characteristics are intended to be afforded charter public school leaders. The choices leaders must make to enable characteristics to complement one another and catch students up who arrive academically behind are difficult. If low-income Black and Hispanic students are going to catch up to their non-low-income peers, leadership must not just provide the same education that middle-class children receive but one that is considerably better. They need more time learning than middle-class students, better trained teachers, and a curriculum that prepares them psychologically and emotionally, as well as intellectually, for the challenges ahead of them.</p>
<p>To achieve this, school leaders cannot assemble their schools in some out-of-the box fashion or according to top-down mandates to narrow the achievement gap (see discussion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013124511404065">Sammons et al., 1995</xref>). School leaders can, if permitted, develop their schools over time as their knowledge, experience, and the unique needs of their students dictate. Sustained and effective leadership in each school is key to raising student performance and narrowing the achievement gap. Choice, accountability, and autonomy at the school level—items all found in charter public schools—may be a way to foster such reform.</p>

<sec id="section6-0013124511404065">
<title>The Achievement Gap and the Urban School Leader</title>
<p>Variables associated with low student outcomes are complex and multidimensional. “The achievement gap” most commonly discussed facing urban public school leaders is the consistent difference in educational outcomes among demographic groups. There are two types of achievement gaps: (a) the difference between the academic outcomes of low-income students and non-low-income students and (b) the difference between Black and Hispanic and non-Hispanic White and Asian students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511404065">Ferguson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511404065">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013124511404065">McCall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124511404065">Rothstein, 2004</xref>). The implications of this geographically widespread gap include large portions of entire demographic groups dropping out of high school; those that do complete high school have insufficient knowledge and skill to attend and complete college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511404065">Hall &amp; Schouten, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124511404065">Laird, Debell, &amp; Chapman, 2006</xref>). Citizens of the United States require a high school diploma to enable them to earn a living wage and to be productive members of our democracy. The consequences of not completing high school are deleterious to individuals, family units, communities, and our national economy. When large numbers of demographic groups are not graduating from high school and college, entire segments of our society are being underdeveloped and marginalized. The gap has narrowed during the past 30 years. However, in the late 1980s, progress of Black students suddenly stopped—the Black–White test score gap persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511404065">The Education Trust, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511404065">Epps, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511404065">Ferguson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511404065">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013124511404065">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intersection of income and race (i.e., students who are low income <italic>and</italic> Black) creates a complex landscape of variables that school leaders need to address in an effort to create transformative school environments that can change student outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511404065">Ferguson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511404065">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124511404065">Rothstein, 2004</xref>). Family income and race are strong predictors of student outcome; however, neither do they determine student outcome nor does genetic variation or the environment explain the existence or persistence of the Black–White test score gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511404065">Ferguson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511404065">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>). The results of studies on the achievement gap since the 1960s suggest that the differences in academic outcomes of Americans were rooted in socioeconomic status, not students’ public schools. However, public schools across the nation have been unable to successfully mitigate factors inherent to the lives of Black and Hispanic students from low-income families. Indeed, schools with high proportions of Black and Hispanic students from low-income families continue to have the lowest student outcomes in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511404065">Coleman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511404065">The Education Trust, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511404065">Epps, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511404065">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>). Moreover, Black and Hispanic students are 10 times more likely to attend schools where 75% of students come from families that are low income; the higher the percentage of low-income students in a school, the lower their NAEP scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013124511404065">Orfield, Losen, Wald, &amp; Swanson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0013124511404065">U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0013124511404065">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0013124511404065">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0013124511404065">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of research on factors associated with low minority achievement in America emphasizes that the multidimensional factors urban school leaders must orchestrate to transform their schools to mitigate student family income and race is a sophisticated and arduous task rarely achieving success. Urban public school leaders must foster environments that enable minority students to choose to engage positively in their learning process. Leaders of schools with high percentages of minority students must take into consideration the socioeconomic status and race of their students and the effect these characteristics have on their achievement. Leaders must effectively strategize how all dimensions of their school, teaching and learning, curriculum, student and teacher culture, and enrichment activities combine synergistically to create transformative schools—schools that overcome the inherent obstacles that still exist due to socioeconomics and past societal discrimination. The values and priorities school-level leaders establish in their school are integral to this process.</p>
<p>A school or organization’s values are defined by its leadership. Clear and established values are essential for leadership to establish the priorities and goals of an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511404065">Bolman &amp; Deal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511404065">Collins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511404065">Collins &amp; Porras, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511404065">Glenn, 1994</xref>). Values must have easily understood qualities that foster commitment from all teachers and administrators; they are intangible, unlike goals, which are measurable and achievable. School leadership exemplifies, prioritizes, and guides their school’s values. A school’s values define it and distinguish it from other schools while also defining a school’s vision, the image of what the school will become over time. Having a mission and vision and creating values is only an initial step for a leader. To lead a transformative school, a leader must develop commitment from all administrators and teachers who are aligned according to the values of the school. Values inform the culture that all teachers and administrators share responsibility for fostering. A school leader has autonomy to develop the values and vision of a school and the climate that results. A positive school climate that is conducive to teaching and learning is more likely to result when a leader intentionally establishes a culture that is value and moral based. Leaders can be intentional about their school’s values but may be limited by the district’s framework and inherent bureaucracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511404065">Glenn, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Charter public schools offer school leaders the opportunity and flexibility to set a school’s priorities and values. Charter public schools are publicly funded, nonsectarian, independently managed schools of choice almost entirely supported by federal and state taxpayer funds. Students pay no tuition and are chosen by lottery. Every state’s requirements are different, but in most states, teachers and administrators usually do not have to be licensed and the founders of the school are free to choose their own mission and focus, for example, technology, civics and community service, health care, and the like and as a result established each school’s values. A charter is a time-bound license issued by the state to be renewed provided the school meets the minimum academic and fiscal standards established by the state. Each charter is overseen by an elected, appointed, or volunteer board of trustees that ensures the school is true to the charter and meets the standards set by the state; students are chosen by lottery. Charter schools intend to combine four powerful educational reform concepts: (a) The granting of choice of public schools for families; (b) entrepreneurial opportunities for citizens to create and run a school they believe is best for children; (c) explicit accountability for improved student outcomes as measured by standardized tests and other measures; and (d) carefully designed competition in public education (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511404065">Finn, 2001</xref>; Institute of Education Sciences, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013124511404065">Nathan, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1991, Minnesota passed the first legislation creating charter public schools statewide. The spirit of the law included the belief in increasing student achievement, expanding choice for families, expanding opportunities for educators, and stimulating change across the state’s public education system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013124511404065">Nathan, 1996</xref>). National attention in favor of charter public schools increased soon after and states began drafting and passing their own versions of charter legislation, including Massachusetts in 1993. In 2009, only about 3.5% of all public schools in the nation are charter public schools enrolling about 2.7% of the overall student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511404065">Edreform, 2008</xref>; U.S. Charter, 2008). Though the growth of new charter public schools was exponential between 1995 and 2001, the number of new schools opened has decreased and the overall number has held steady at below 4% since 2006 (U.S. Charter, 2008).</p>
<p>The school leaders granted full access to observe and informally interview students and teachers to triangulate findings among the leaders, Massachusetts Department of Education evaluation reports, and first-hand field site visits.</p>

<title>Standardized Assessments</title>
<p>Massachusetts has a standardized system for measuring and reporting student outcomes. All Massachusetts public schools administer the criterion-based MCAS, aligned with the state curriculum framework. Students must pass this test to earn a high school diploma from the state. The MCAS provides a standardized tool that allows Massachusetts school comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013124511404065">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124511404065">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013124511404065">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013124511404065">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013124511404065">2006a</xref>). The SAT test scores of students of these four public charter high schools were also examined to analyze the achievement gap but was not included as charter scores did not differ from national scores when demographics were compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511404065">College Board, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511404065">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As a whole, the success of charter public schools as an educational initiative is mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511404065">Hoxby, 2004</xref>; Institute of Education Sciences, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013124511404065">Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013124511404065">Schemo, 2004</xref>). The longer a charter public school has been in operation, the more likely it is for its students to outperform peers in demographically similar traditional public school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0013124511404065">U.S. Department of Education, Office of Innovation and Improvement, 2006</xref>). However, urban charter public schools with high Black and Hispanic populations from low-income families are more successful than suburban and rural charter school when compared with their sending district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511404065">Hoxby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013124511404065">U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2006</xref>). Nationally, charters serve a larger proportion of Black and Hispanic and low-income students than found in traditional public schools, a characteristic due largely to the disproportionate number of charter public schools located in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0013124511404065">U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Charter public school students are admitted by lottery. One claim against charter public schools is that they select the best and most motivated students from the sending district. However, often charter public schools disproportionately attract students who were performing badly in their regular public schools. Successful students rarely leave a system that is basically meeting their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511404065">Hoxby, 2003</xref>). When the academic results of all students who enter a charter lottery are analyzed, those who are admitted and attend a charter public school out perform their peers who were not admitted and, as a result, attended traditional public school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124511404065">Hoxby &amp; Rockoff, 2004</xref>). Studies comparing results of Boston charter public school students results with district public school results show charter students have performed significantly higher than students enrolled in Boston Public Schools each year from 2001 to 2005; Among the African American, Hispanic, low-income, and special education subgroups, charter school performance was significantly higher than Boston in each year since 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Education, 2006</xref>). Even when controlling for the randomized lottery, charter student outcomes compared with those of Boston district pilot schools, which were intended to compete with charter public schools, have been found to be significantly higher at both the middle school and high school levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511404065">Fullerton &amp; Kane, 2009</xref>). In addition, Massachusetts’s charters have mixed results on student retention, an outcome worthy of longitudinal study. Students can choose to leave a charter school and return to their sending district at any time, a luxury not afforded by the district schools.</p>
<p>Charter public schools were created from a belief that change would not occur from within the school systems as they currently function. Change would not stem from the PTA or a new superintendent because most attempts at school-level change are rarely systemic. Advocates of choice in public education maintain that without competition and real alternatives, efforts to implement wide-ranging improvements in public education will not succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511404065">Finn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124511404065">Glenn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511404065">Hoxby, 2001</xref>). Anticharter and antichoice groups warn that granting administrators and teachers more decision-making authority is no guarantee of success. If teachers and principals do not have the knowledge and skill to change the school by making effective decisions, student performance will not improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511404065">Darling-Hammond, 1997</xref>). Charter public schools emphasize individual teacher leadership and deemphasize the collective bargaining power of large union organizations. As a result, individual teachers must represent themselves when they negotiate their individual contracts. Without collective bargaining, salaries and benefits may not be as strong for teachers. Unions worry that charter public schools will erode the quality of compensation for teachers.</p>
<p>The opening of charter public schools is also often described as the privatization of public schools. Charters are not private schools or part of the voucher movement. Though in some states, private organizations can apply for a charter, a central objective of the charter school movement is to empower classroom teachers, administrators, and parents to create the school that best fits the needs of their students. Though not privatization, the charter approach creates entrepreneurial opportunity and competition. The charter school movement attempts to promote improvement of all public schools by allowing anyone to open a new school and encouraging existing school systems to improve to compete with new schools.</p>
<p>Research suggests that many state authorizers have been willing to close underperforming charter public schools and that most of the renewals were justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511404065">The Brookings Institution, 2004</xref>). Though the rules that create and monitor charter public schools varies widely from state to state, the following characteristics of charter public schools are consistently adopted: (a) there is a rigorous process to apply for and open a charter; (b) once granted, charters are closely monitored and evaluated—if a charter performs poorly, the charter will be revoked and the school will be closed; (c) students are admitted by lottery; and (d) charter public schools have more freedom in the hiring and firing of teachers than traditional public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511404065">The Brookings Institution, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used qualitative methods of data collection and analysis to explore the success of four charter public high schools and the reasons for that success according to school leaders.</p>
<p>The four charter public schools in this study were chosen because all four enroll predominantly Black and Hispanic student populations from low-income families who demonstrated high levels of student achievement compared with their sending district, Boston Public Schools. This study examined four charter public high schools in Boston, serving a total of 800 students in Boston. These schools were identified as high achieving because they scored greater than 30% proficient and advanced and less than 30% failing between the 2004 and 2006 school years on the MCAS.</p>
<p>As a founding charter public school teacher and former charter public school leader, I knew and had worked with all of the leaders before this study began. Although my relationships with the leaders present some validity threats to this research, these relationships gave me unique access to the schools and to candid reflections by their leaders that I may not have gained otherwise. SAT data was analyzed, however, SAT comparisons are not a focus of this study because of small cohort size, limited number of cohorts, and all students in the charters in this study sit to the exam, not a selective group as is the case nationally. In addition, data on dropouts and college completion, important factors in evaluating the effectiveness of public education, cannot easily be analyzed, compared, or even taken at face value on a national or state level in Massachusetts. There is no national standard for determining and reporting enrollment, graduation rates, or college completion rates. The Massachusetts Department of Education began reporting on graduation rates in 2006. Even within Massachusetts, there is no standardized method to track college-completion rates. Because of these challenges, this study considered the claims made by the school leadership primarily in the context of the standardized MCAS test scores published annually by the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistical analysis of each school’s student achievement was conducted in addition to a descriptive statistical analysis of each school’s operational characteristics, such as schedule, calendar, and discipline policies. Operational characteristics were gathered via school annual reports, Department of Education site visit reports, school student and personnel handbooks, and school Web sites and were confirmed during field observations. The quantitative variables included class size of core academic classes, student-to-adult ratios, student-to-core academic teacher ratios, school size, teacher load, time on learning, and administration-to-student ratio.</p>
<p>To explore why each school was successful, semistructured, open-ended interviews allowed exploration of the views and beliefs of each school leader. Informal interviews with faculty, staff, and students were conducted on site; interviewees were selected by me and the school leader at random according to their availability and were chosen to ensure a mix of perspectives from the school to contribute to the comprehensive description of the school that I sought. With each leader, I conducted one semistructured, initial, 60-min, one-on-one interview. These interview data were transcribed, coded, analyzed, and triangulated with informal field observations; informal interviews of faculty, staff, and students; published Department of Education reports; published school materials and reports in spring 2007; and third-party published articles (e.g. <italic>The Boston Globe</italic> and <italic>Education Week</italic>). A draft of the findings section was shared with each school leader, providing each with the opportunity to correct or refute any finding.</p>
<p>Efforts were made to ensure validity of the data gathered. In addition to the expected and inevitable “reflexivity” of the participants in my study to me, the researcher, validity threats were addressed such as (a) I am a charter educator and administrator; (b) I have professional relationships with the leaders of the four schools in the study; and (c) the schools in the study were selected on the basis of each school outperforming their students’ sending district, and this assumption may have shaped the way that leaders described their schools and their leadership.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The characteristics of the charter public schools in Boston, named, for this study, Charter Public School (CPS) 1 through CPS 4, are the product of school-based leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124511404065">2006c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013124511404065">2006d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124511404065">2006e</xref>). The findings resulting from school-based leadership include student outcomes, general school characteristics, and dimensions of the school identified by leadership as essential to each school’s success. The demographics of all four schools do not reflect the demographics of the city of Boston where all students reside or the sending district where all students would attend if they did not attend the charter public schools. A higher percentage of Black and Hispanic students attend CPS 1 through CPS 4 than attend the schools in the sending district.</p>
<sec id="section10-0013124511404065">
<title>CPS 1</title>
<p>Founded in 1995, CPS 1 is the oldest school in this study. A 280-student school, located in downtown Boston, CPS 1’s mission emphasizes citizenship, academic achievement, public accountability, and teacher leadership. It is a schoolwide Title I school, where 63% students are Black and 33% are Hispanic, with the remaining percentage being White, Asian, and Other. State standardized test results and graduation rates suggest CPS 1 has created a successful academic program (Renewal Inspection Report, 2004, p. 2; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). CPS 1 students have outperformed students from the sending district in the categories of Advanced and Proficient for 3 years in math and 5 years in English language arts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511404065">CPS 1 Charter Public School, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511404065">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). CPS 1 was awarded a 2006 Mass Compass award as an exemplary school in Massachusetts by the Department of Education. CPS 1 has also outperformed the state and Boston when comparing test scores according to income level.</p>
<p>All 255 graduates of CPS 1 have been accepted to a 2- or 4-year college or university since 1999. Many CPS 1 students who graduated more than 4 years ago self-report that they are still attending college full- or part-time. Finally, in addition to MCAS scores and college acceptance rates, CPS 1 has a graduation rate at 74% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). CPS 1’s graduation rate is just below the state, 80%, although it surpasses the sending district, Boston Public Schools, at 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The leadership of CPS 1 has created a distinct school culture and environment consisting of four distinct primary characteristics. They are (a) a moral imperative held by all community members; (b) community-wide commitment to the school’s mission and vision; (c) high academic expectations for all students with the goal of college acceptance; and (d) strict standards for behavior and consequences that maintain a physically and emotionally safe school community. These value-driven characteristics, emphasizing teacher engagement with decision making and the “moral imperative” to prepare students for college, seem to foster significant intrinsic motivation among CPS 1 community members to maintain the institution and achieve the school’s mission.</p>

<sec id="section11-0013124511404065">
<title>CPS 2</title>
<p>CPS 2 opened in the fall of 2000. Located in the heart of a major university’s campus, though not part of the university, CPS 2 serves 210 students in Grades 9 through 12. The school’s mission is to prepare students for success in college and beyond. It was founded to provide a college-preparatory education to urban students, the majority of whom have parents who did not attend college. Its students are predominantly Black and Hispanic (67% and 24%, respectively) and from low-income families (more than 70%). Courage, discipline, and perseverance are CPS 2’s core values. CPS 2 offers students a full 4-year college-preparatory curriculum, accepting incoming students only through December of their ninth-grade year. CPS 2 has demonstrated both success in narrowing the achievement gap between its Black and Hispanic students and White and Asian students in Massachusetts standardized test results and a gap between its low-income Black and Hispanic students and White and Asian students in Boston and in the state of Massachusetts (Renewal Inspection Report, 2004, p. 2; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511404065">Charter Schools, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511404065">CPS 2 Charter Public School, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511404065">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511404065">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). For four consecutive years, CPS 2 students have outperformed their peers in CPS 2’s sending district in the categories of Advanced and Proficient on MCAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511404065">CPS 2 Charter Public School, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, all CPS 2 graduates earned acceptance to college with 95% gaining entry into 4-year colleges and universities such as Dartmouth, Boston College, Notre Dame, Centre College, Northeastern, and the University of Massachusetts–Amherst. However, CPS 2 had graduated only three cohorts at the time of this study. Consequently, data documenting CPS 2 graduates’ college completion rates are not yet available. Finally, in contrast to their high-standardized test results, CPS 2 has a low graduation rate of only 50% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511404065">2006</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). This is below the state, 80%, and the sending district, 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). High standards are met at CPS 2 within the structure of a strict, safe, and clearly defined school culture. The CPS 2 community identifies a relentless work ethic by all students, tutors, and teachers as an essential element to that culture. Overall, the organization is driven by a top-down leadership structure unified in its mission to graduate underserved students from college. Leadership identifies the salient characteristics in the school as the result of specific choices leadership has made and the strict adherence of all members of the CPS 2 community to carry out the school’s vision. With a “do whatever it takes” relentless work ethic by all members of the community, CPS 2 pushes students through “life altering experiences” to attain high academic achievement. Adults do so by emphasizing caring support for students who report being supported and having strong relationships with their adult teachers and tutors. Tutoring is an integral element of the academic support students receive.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen regarding the characteristics at CPS 2 is whether the low graduation rates persist or whether the low rate is an anomaly resulting from CPS 2 completing its building phase. In addition, the resources CPS 2 allocates to the learning process are significant and call into question replication.</p>

<title>CPS 3</title>
<p>Founded in 2001, CPS 3 is the smallest high school in this study with an enrollment of only 110 students in Grades 9 through 12. Located in a residential neighborhood of Boston, CPS 3’s mission is to “prepare students for full participation in the intellectual, economic and civic life of our society, by ensuring their preparation for access to further education.” Of all CPS 3’s students, 85% are Black and 13% are Hispanic; it is a schoolwide Title I school. CPS 3’s achievement on the MCAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511404065">CPS 3 Charter Public School, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511404065">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>), as well as the school’s graduation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2006f</xref>), indicate a narrowing of the achievement gap. Since 2003, CPS 3 has outperformed both its sending district and the state on standardized state assessments in the categories of Advanced and Proficient during some years, but not all. A strength of CPS 3 is retaining students who enter in 9th grade and seeing them to graduation as it has an 82% graduation rate, which is higher than the 80% Massachusetts rate, and significantly higher than the sending district’s 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). All CPS 3 graduates (100%) have been accepted to college since the school has opened. CPS 3 was founded to develop the human capital of CPS 3’s neighborhood in an effort to invest in the future of the community. Its passionate and committed leader is its founder who has embraced the autonomy that CPS 3’s charter public school status affords her by uncompromisingly creating a school in her own image. Her strong leadership dictates the culture and vision of the school, which emphasizes safety and social development, followed by student-centered, experiential, academic development. The academic, curricular, and student culture reflects the high value placed by leadership on nonacademic development of students. Faculty and students develop together individual students’ needs and goals in the context of self-directed learning. Although leadership at CPS 3 deemphasizes standardized assessment as an integral facet of a students’ academic experience, it does so due to leadership’s strong emphasis on what it believes are more important characteristics. At CPS 3, leadership’s belief in the emotional and physical safety of the learning environment for students to be successful academically is paramount. Safety at CPS 3 is a central, organizing concept in the organizational culture. By first “building for safety,” all members of the CPS 3 community are responsible for choices that make CPS 3 a safe environment for all. Although standardized assessment is deemphasized at CPS 3, there are high expectations present as all students are expected to earn acceptance and matriculate to college. CPS 3 is the only school in the study that emphasizes postsecondary education and support beyond high school in its mission.</p>

CPS 4 has the highest graduation rates of the four charter public schools in this study at 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>) outperforming both the state, 80%, and the sending district, 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>). Moreover, all of CPS 4’s graduates (100%) have been accepted to a 2- or 4-year college since 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511404065">CPS 4 Charter Public School, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511404065">2007</xref>). In addition to MCAS scores, CPS 4 has been very successful at keeping the students who enter in 9th grade at CPS 4; on graduation, students matriculate to college as the 112 alumni report a 90% enrollment rate in postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511404065">CPS 4 Charter Public School, 2007</xref>). CPS 4 was founded with the intent to demonstrate that a public school can have a very differently academic program than a traditional district high school while still operating on the same per-pupil expenditure as a district public school. The choices leadership can make to run CPS 4, the founders believed, can be the difference in the school’s success regardless of the per-pupil expenditure. CPS 4 seeks to raise the achievement of its urban students by melding creativity and individualism with an emphasis on effort.</p>
<p>Leadership explains CPS 4’s success as the result of a strong schoolwide communal values such as respect, working together, and concern for community while students unrelentingly endeavor to continually improve academically. Implementation of CPS 4’s school culture relies on a shared set of professional practices and collegiality. Leadership’s emphasis on the three <italic>R</italic>s—relevance, relationship, and rigor—are three strongly interdependent facets of the organization that combine to foster a strong student and adult culture. A schoolwide spirit for students and teachers to always give their best effort and never give up, supported by a system of rituals and routines, is shared and practiced by all. The cohesiveness of CPS 4’s culture results in a school where very few students are allowed to fall through the cracks. The rigor of CPS 4’s school and professional culture requires significant professional commitment that may be too grueling for some faculty and staff and, therefore, not easily replicable.</p>

<title>Student results of all four charter public schools</title>
<p>All four schools demonstrated success compared with their sending district and the state according to either MCAS results, graduation rates, or both. All four schools outperform their peers in their sending district on MCAS; CPS 4 and CPS 2 not only outperform their sending district but also White and Asian student averages across the state some years; CPS 3 inconsistently outperformed the sending district. When the mean results of all four charter public schools are compared with both the district and the state, not only do the charter public school students outperform peers of the same demographic group in both the city and state but also does their achievement approach results of Asian, White, and non-low-income students, at times outperforming this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124511404065">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013124511404065">2</xref>).

<p>Data from 2006 indicate that the average advanced and proficient ELA and MATH MCAS scores of all races attending the four charter public schools not only outperform district and state averages for low-income students but also score significantly closer to non-low-income populations (66%) than the sending district and the state (76%). In the case of math MCAS, low-income students attending the four charters (70%) nearly match the score of non-low-income students across the state (72%). Finally, when district and charter schools are compared, three of the four charter public schools in this study are among the seven top-ranked schools in the city of Boston. It is important to note that the top-three ranked district schools in Boston not only have entry examination requirements and a selective admissions process but also have a disproportionately high population of White, Asian, and non-low-income students. CPS 2, CPS 4, and CPS 1 are, therefore, the top-three ranking open enrollment, predominantly Black and Hispanic, low-income high schools in Boston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Education, 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013124511404065">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Graduation rates</title>
<p>In addition to standardized test results, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education began tracking individual students from 9th grade through their graduation to determine the graduation rate of each school in the commonwealth in 2006. The average percentage of students who graduate in 4 years from the four charter public schools in this study exceeds state averages for Hispanics, Blacks, urban students, and low-income students. In addition, the average of the four charter schools outperforms the sending district and almost matches the state average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0013124511404065">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511404065">Massachusetts Department of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education, 2007</xref>).

In addition to MCAS scores, the 4-year mean graduation rate of all four charter schools surpasses the sending district and the state average (inclusive of all races and income levels) in 2006; all four schools individually surpass the sending district in graduation rates except one, CPS 2.</p>

<title>College matriculation and completion</title>
<p>All four charter public schools report 100% acceptance of all their graduates to 2- or 4-year universities every year they have had graduates. Despite this claim, there is no standardized method of independently confirming college acceptances or college matriculation. Given the young age of the four charters, resulting in few students having reached college-graduation age, there is insufficient data to analyze college completion and, thus, conclude effectiveness of narrowing the achievement gap using this measure.</p>

<title>Three Key Dimensions of Site-Based Leadership Models of Four Charter Public Schools</title>
<p>The site-based leadership of each of the four charter public schools in this study was instrumental and transformational in the development of each school’s learning environment. Leaders, interviewees, and Department of Education documents referred to an intersection of many practices and characteristics that culminate to achieve each school’s unique community. Although these four charter public schools work independently from each other and are physically located far from each other, and each has an unique mission and vision, the characteristics of all four schools were strikingly similar. Although similar, the conceptual and organizational reasoning driving the leadership to build and maintain each community and the schools that result were quite different. These practices and characteristics combine to constitute each school’s unique program. For the sake of this discussion, a school program includes academics—teaching and learning in the classroom; enrichment—art, music, and extracurricular activities; and culture—the daily comportment and interaction of students and adult educators. However, and most importantly, the descriptions by leadership of how and why they think the characteristics of their school culminate to create their distinct learning environment are the significant findings of this study that may indicate what enables these schools above others to raise student outcomes.</p>
<p>Eighteen basic or elemental characteristics common to all four schools were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013124511404065">Table 3</xref>) that result from each school’s site-based leadership conceptual model. These characteristics reflect the values of each leader and includes examples such as small learning communities, a disciplined and structured student culture, and an emphasis on academics, teaching, and learning.</p>

<p>In addition to these elemental characteristics, this study identified specific resource allocation characteristics, specifically the allocation of personnel and time in each school (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013124511404065">Table 4</xref>). This list of resource characteristics also reflects the values of leadership such as smaller teaching loads for teachers, a low student-to-teacher ratio, and a low adult-to-student ratio, significant common planning time, and significant time dedicated to time-on-learning. Nevertheless, according to the leaders, a simple list of elements or resources are not the reason their schools are effective. Nor does identifying school characteristics and inferring what a leader values explain how a leader creates a learning community or an organizational culture that fosters learning for high-poverty, high-minority students. Lists do not capture the distinctiveness of leadership or the dynamics of how leadership orchestrates the interaction between these many characteristics to construct a cohesive whole. How these leaders described the intersection or relationships between these key dimensions of their organizational culture helped provide a context to explain each school’s success.</p>

<p>As a result of leaderships’ descriptions of their schools, the ingredients used to build their schools, and the values driving leadership decisions, three conceptual models of leadership emerge. The elements that combined to create the site-based leadership model at each charter are (a) high expectations for student achievement as measured by college success; (b) high expectations for student behavior in the context of a safe and orderly school environment; and (c) the shared understanding and implementation of the school’s mission, vision, and goals by all faculty and staff.</p>
<p>The intersection or relationships between these key organizational dimensions enable them to effectively interact and create an effective learning environment. Although all four schools share the same elements and focused on the same three key dimensions, the leaders varied in how they understood the three elements. By analyzing how the charter school leaders described the interplay of these dimensions, this study captured a sense of how the leaders create an organizational culture that fosters student learning. Given the complexities of each school, the interplay of these three key dimensions shape each school’s organizational culture in starkly different ways.</p>
<sec id="section18-0013124511404065">
<title>First dimension: High expectations for student performance</title>
<p>The leaders of all four charter public school emphasize a belief that every student in their building can achieve high academic standards. All four leaders claim that their school is not truly successful until all their students matriculate to and graduate from college. How and why this is the case is distinct at each school, leading to a definitive conceptual model. For example, at CPS 1, college is expected as a step to becoming an informed, skilled, and thereby active democratic citizen; CPS 2 school expects college to be a continuation of the life-altering experience begun in high school; at CPS 3, college is the next step after high school to gain the knowledge and skill necessary to return to the CPS 3 neighborhood as a local leader to help improve it; CPS 4 intends for students to strive to reach their potential in college and have productive lives.</p>
<p>The leader of CPS 1 emphasizes high academic achievement in the context of citizenship as an integral element to CPS 1’s conceptual model. Leadership believes today’s students are future leaders of our democracy and must be prepared to sit at the table of decision making. A college education, and its subsequent knowledge and skill, is the ticket to the decision-making table. Citizens of a democracy must be well educated for the democracy to remain strong, and, therefore, all students must have some postsecondary education to be effective leaders. Leadership believes CPS 1 has not closed the achievement gap until all graduates have matriculated to and graduated from college. The habits and mind of an effective citizen must be practiced before they can be effectively employed. CPS 1 practices the rituals and systems of a democracy in preparation for college and future active engagement in the democratic system. Achieving academic excellence and productive civic engagement is intricately interwoven.</p>
<p>CPS 2’s conceptual model of high academic standards, according to leadership, is strongly linked to CPS 2’s rigorous academic experience. This experience is considered very difficult from the students’ perspective, which suits leadership who believe that such a grueling academic experience is necessary to prepare each student for college and life. Students need a transformational academic experience to prepare them for college and for the rigors of life and attending CPS 2 intends to be that transformational experience. The foundation for this experience are uncompromising college-prep standards and a rigorous college-prep curriculum. CPS 2 standards and professional, business-like environment are not intended to weed out weaker students; all students are expected to reach CPS 2 standards. To support each student according to their individual needs to achieve CPS 2’s high goals, the school offers an extended school day, extended school week, and a tutor. “Rigor with support” is the culture at CPS 2. To prepare students for college, under no circumstances will standards be lowered or waived. Thus, high standards will be maintained even if it means attrition of students, though this is not the intent of leadership. All CPS 2 community members, including faculty, staff, students, and parents/guardians, must share CPS 2’s high academic standards to enable their students to reach their potential. Though the CPS 2 experience is intended to be transformational for its students, it is just the beginning of their transformational journey and attending college after CPS 2 is considered a continuation of the transformational experience.</p>
<p>Leadership of CPS 3 emphasizes student-centered, rigorous, expeditionary learning in the National Outdoor Leadership style for all students to reach high academic standards. All students who enter CPS 3 as 9th graders are expected to graduate with an acceptance to college in 4 or 5 years. CPS 3’s style of teaching and learning includes a rigorous college-prep curriculum in an exploratory project-based style, with a de-emphasis on standardized testing. The support and experience that students receive at CPS 3 will prepare them for college and continue once in college because of CPS 3’s emphasis on active, engaging, exploratory skills. When a CPS 3 student struggles to understand or is interested in an academic topic, they are expected to actively pursue an answer or understanding. Though CPS 3 students sit to standardized assessments (and leadership acknowledges the importance of standardized tests to gain entrance to college), it is not a focus of the program and never will be.</p>
<p>CPS 4’s conceptual model emphasizes unyielding effort. Effort is a central organizing principle of CPS 4 leadership to attain the goal of college for every graduate. At CPS 4, all students can achieve the goal of earning acceptance to and graduating from college if they put forth effective effort. Student success at CPS 4 is measured by matriculation to and graduation from college, a schoolwide goal. To enable all students to reach their potential and intrinsically motivate them to focus on their studies and raise their achievement, leadership emphasizes the three <italic>R</italic>s—rigor, relevance, and relationship. The college-prep curriculum must be rigorous and have a strong and clear connection to each student’s life. Teacher–student and teacher–teacher relationships are essential at CPS 4 to supporting students through their rigorous academic experience.</p>
<p>High expectations for student achievement as measured by matriculating to and graduating from college is a goal of all four charter public schools in this study. The similarities between the four schools end there as each school’s leadership has created school milieus according to their leadership style, strengths, and priorities. However, the charter schools diverged in the leaders’ rationale for the goal of college success and how each charter school’s program fosters student achievement. On one hand, CPS 4 and CPS 2 emphasize the student’s learning process in the context of their unique cultures. On the other hand, CPS 3 and CPS 1 emphasize the student’s learning in the context of civic engagement to give back to their community on completion of college. All four schools believe every enrolled student can reach the goal of college if they are willing to put forth the effort. None track any students, scheduling some, for example, in college-prep classes and others not; all heterogeneously group their students and encourages students to put forth their best effort in distinct ways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0013124511404065">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Second dimension: Safe learning environment</title>
<p>The leaders of all four charter public schools emphasize a belief that school learning environments must be safe for students to be successful academically. All four leaders believe students cannot engage in their rigorous academic programs and be sufficiently prepared for college if there are distractions within the learning environment, and students feeling unsafe is considered a primary distraction by all four leaders. However, the definition of safety and the resulting conceptual model to foster a safe learning environment differs at each school according to the perspective of leadership.</p>
<p>CPS 1’s leadership emphasizes safety in the context of citizenship, coupling safety with its academic high expectations. A school environment cannot be civil unless it is truly safe. For students to live safely in their democracy once they are adults, they must practice the habits of mind of being civil during high school. CPS 1’s leadership describes safety at the school as a hierarchy of needs, a la Maslow; having a physically safe environment is a foundation to academic success. Leadership acknowledges the physical and emotional violence students experience directly and indirectly in their neighborhoods and on their way to school. Feeling secure and belonging to a clearly defined culture is a foundational concept; administration can control the level of safety in school. Once students feel comfortable with this hierarchy, then they are expected to engage in their education. As a college-prep school with an emphasis on higher order self-actualizing academic engagement, safety, therefore, is an integral element to effective learning at CPS 1. To maintain safety consistently throughout the school year, administration has developed a comprehensive behavior management system consisting of a strict merit and demerit program that must be enforced by all faculty and staff. Though CPS 1 has this system in place, the emphasis on safety is less on the context of the systems that maintain it and rather on the behavior or comportment. Students receive feedback on undesirable behavior in the context of working toward the desirable behavior. Proper behavior has a purpose at CPS 1; it is not for the sake of following rules. Student comportment, or civility, is emphasized in the context of the school’s civic mission to teach the habits and mind of members of a democratic society. Leadership wants students to comport themselves according to a high standard to access the college-prep curriculum and acquire the social skills necessary to be an effective democratic citizens and leaders. Creating a safe environment at CPS 1 therefore is intended to be the product of having taught students the importance of civility.</p>
<p>At CPS 2, a safe learning environment is one of many priorities. CPS 2 was the only school in the study that lost a student to violence since it opened, murdered on the way home from school while riding city transit. A safe environment at CPS 2 is one free from violence or threatening behavior. However, safety is treated as a fact, not a focus. The focus of the school is its rigorous academic program and a safe learning environment must be in place to enable students to engage in their academics undisturbed. To maintain safety, leadership emphasizes clear rules and consequences, uniform enforcement of rules and consequences by faculty and staff, and an uncompromising belief in no tolerance for violent, threatening, harassing, or repetitive disruptive behavior. That said, leadership at CPS 2 acknowledges the violence that its students experience in their community and is wary of it creeping into the learning environment. Thus, the strict culture at CPS 2 is established to prevent any negative or disruptive behaviors to develop on school grounds during school time. By doing so, no harassing or threatening behavior ever has the opportunity to manifest itself. The CPS 2 environment is a safe one, free from any of the distractions often associated with urban public high schools. In turn, students practice and internalize the habits and behaviors of college-bound students as part of their “life-altering” CPS 2 experience. CPS 2 leadership emphasizes the importance of maintaining behavioral and cultural standards to contribute to the quality of the relationships between adults during the learning process. Its defined and consistently enforced culture enables adults to hold students accountable for poor behavior or breaking rules without creating animosity or mistrust while striving to ensure a safe and orderly environment focused on learning.</p>
<p>At CPS 3, leadership emphasized safety as the primary focus of the school’s vision. The school is needed as a place for students to be and feel safe—maybe the only safe place they experience in their daily lives. As a neighborhood school dedicated to being a change agent to the community, CPS 3 addresses the violence in the neighborhood directly as it occurs. Since its opening, students are consistently the victims of violence going to and from school. Leadership created CPS 3 as a safe zone where students could escape from and process the violence they personally experience. An emphasis on safety at CPS 3 education is both a short- and long-term investment in the human capital of CPS 3’s neighborhood. Leadership intended to create a culture and community that functions similar to a family unit by constructing systems of support for both physical and emotional safety including creation of daily home room meetings and weekly community meetings called <italic>Talking Circles</italic> and <italic>Community Circles</italic>. The school is organized to processes difficult issues on a personal and community level on a daily and weekly basis both individually and as a whole community. The Talking Circles are organized by gender to purposefully afford male students time in their day to process the experiences of living in an urban environment in a way they may not do so in the presence of female peers. By having such a strong focus on safety, combined with its distinct form of expeditionary learning, CPS 3’s leadership believes it will give its students a better chance to process the trials of urban life and a college-prep curriculum and thus have a better chance to earn acceptance to and matriculate into college.</p>
<p>CPS 4’s conceptual model of safety emphasizes both the physical safety and intellectual safety of each of its students. Safety at CPS 4 closely melds with the school’s mission and vision. However, leadership’s emphasis on safety at CPS 4 is less on physical safety and more on intellectual safety. The emphasis to put forth the best effort, to be actively engaged in learning, to expect setbacks, and to relentlessly persist forward depends on an open and honest academic culture between students and teachers. At CPS 4, the effort concept, that is, the belief that one is not born smart but becomes smart through effective effort is primary. For this concept to be genuine at the school, students must overcome any fear of failure or fear of mistakes. The school must be intellectually safe to enable students to risk their ideas and foster a capacity for debate and deeper intellectual development. The spirit of effort is one of active engagement and a constant grappling with the academic task at hand. Students must learn that making mistakes is normal part of the learning process. Leadership believes this will not develop if there is a culture of name-calling, ridicule, or intimidation. Safety at CPS 4 is an element of the school culture that all students share and are responsible for. Safety is also strongly interdependent with leadership’s emphasis on the three <italic>R</italic>s—rigor, relevance, and relationship—discussed in the conceptual model of high expectations. Understanding safety must have clear connection to each student’s academic life for it to be relevant. Teacher–student relationships are essential for the fostering and maintaining a safe learning environment. Consistent enforcement of the code of conduct and strong relationships between faculty and students are essential to foster and maintain intellectual safety at CPS 4.</p>
<p>All four leaders share the belief that school safety is a fundamental requirement for students to be successful academically. This is especially true as the majority of students must undergo remediation for lagging skills while engaged in the rigorous college-prep curricula. They define what a safe school is, why a school should be safe differently and distinctly. All four leaders explain how they create a safe learning environment in very different ways. Leaders of all four charter public schools acknowledge, the threat of violence outside of school, stemming from the urban environment in which all the students live. All four schools attract students from economically depressed areas in Boston who know the pain of sudden random violent acts, many often fatal. Most of the students live in or have to pass through city housing and barren industrial zones that are cites of violence in order to get to school. The leaders of each of the four schools in this study acknowledge the high levels of crime and violence and cite it as a potential obstacle to their students’ emotional and intellectual development. They acknowledge specifically the experiences that their students have as young Black and Hispanic men and women from low-income families and have chosen to explicitly build in structures to keep the learning environments of their schools both physically and emotionally safe.</p>
<p>The models of CPS 2 and CPS 4 aim to ensure their learning environments are free from any threat of violence or anti-intellectual harassment to enable students reach their academic potential distraction free as the engage in their college-prep curricula. At CPS 2, a lack of physical violence constitutes safety, whereas at CPS 4, a culture of safety includes both physical and emotional safety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013124511404065">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>CPS 1’s conceptual model emphasizes the creation and maintenance of a safe learning environment through civil engagement and an emphasis on citizenship. At CPS 1, a safe school environment is essential for students not only to focus on academics (like CPS 2 and CPS 4) but also to enable students to openly and civilly participate in their learning community as a future citizen in a democratic society. Like CPS 4, at CPS 3, safety is a primary focus of the organization as it is assumed the school is one of the safest places in its students’ lives. The school serves as an extended family center for each student to aid in the processing of the violence they experience as residents of the most violent neighborhoods in Boston. Only then can students access the expeditionary learning curriculum.</p>

<title>Third dimension: Shared mission and vision by all faculty and staff</title>
<p>The third and final common dimension identified by leadership pertains to the mission and vision of the school and the dedication of all members of the community to the school’s success. In all four schools, leadership underscored the importance of the school’s mission—and its pervasiveness throughout the school community—as a key element of the school’s success. Despite the differences among the schools’ missions, each school community has a distinctive organizational culture resulting from a clear emphasized mission and vision that combines elements to create an environment that engages students and teachers alike. Each leader described the mission of their schools as a central focus of theirs, were personally connected to the mission, and were passionate about it. They emphasized ownership of the organization’s mission and vision by all faculty and staff to enable the mission and vision to achieve fruition. Leadership describes being able to lead efficiently and effectively because the mission and vision of their schools are defined, purposeful, and shared. All four leaders have established the expectation that all members of the community are to be integral members of the community while embodying the mission and philosophy of the organization. Faculty and staff members, who do not engage in the community according to the mission or subscribe to cultural standards, do not remain employed at any of the charter public schools for very long. Although all four leaders emphasize a school community driven by a shared mission, each school’s mission is distinct. The strengths, experience, and priorities of each school’s leadership shapes the professional culture differently (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0013124511404065">Table 7</xref>).</p>

<p>CPS 1’s conceptual model of a vision enforced by all adult community members emphasizes the combination of academic excellence and civic engagement by increasing the interdependence between academic standards and citizenship across the curriculum. Leadership did so by particularly emphasizing everyone in the community speaking a “shared language” emphasizing college for all students, the ultimate goal of an education at CPS 1.</p>
<p>According CPS 2 leadership, the shared school vision is the foundation to maintaining behavioral and cultural standards by all faculty and staff, which in turn contributes to the school’s safety and quality of the relationships between adults and students. CPS 2’s strong and consistent culture enables adults to hold students accountable for poor behavior or breaking rules without creating animosity or mistrust. Leadership emphasized this vision to implement the mission at CPS 2 by creating core values for the whole community centered on an urgent and tireless work ethic. All stakeholders, from teachers and tutors to students, are expected to embody a “relentless” work ethic. Those who are unable to achieve the community’s work ethic do not remain as community members for long.</p>
<p>CPS 3’s conceptual model of schoolwide buy-in emphasizes an urgency by all faculty and staff in the service to the students regarding issues of physical and emotional safety and academic development. Teachers are to embody the school’s motto, which is “to learn, to lead, and to serve,” by modeling service in support of students. For CPS 3 to be a safe environment that functions like a supportive family, all teachers are expected to engage in the policies and systems of support for the students. The explicit nature of CPS 3’s mission and vision attracts many of the faculty and staff with strong buy-in to the school making the policies and programs more effectively implemented. To have all community members embody the mission of CPS 4, leadership emphasized intense, detailed, and daily attention to the culture of the school. All faculty and staff must openly conduct the many rituals that are part of the culture to achieve a safe and supportive environment for the students.</p>

<title>The Interdependence Between the Three Dimensions</title>
<p>Each of the four leaders in this study specifically and pointedly emphasized three dimensions essential to their school’s success: the high expectation of college for all students, student safety, and a mission shared by the whole school community. That four school leaders with disparate experiences, backgrounds, and credentials independently integrated these values into their schools and achieved student results that outperform the sending district suggests that these characteristics are more than idiosyncratic preferences. Each leader had the leeway to create a unique organizational culture shaped by their understanding and interpretation of these three dimensions. They oversee a wide range of common programmatic characteristics in contexts of differing school missions, while managing to achieve positive outcomes among demographic groups most public schools poorly serve.</p>
<p>To say being the leader of an urban school is difficult certainly is an understatement. Though difficult, the findings of this study suggest that to be a leader of an urban public school that raises the outcomes of Black and Hispanic students from low-income families requires leadership that combines key characteristics or ingredients in just the right way. The three key dimensions in the conceptual models distilled from interviews with the leaders of these four urban charter high schools in Boston emphasize how interdependent (and interrelated) all aspects of the school are. For any one of the three dimensions to be effective, the leadership has to determine how to align each dimension in the context of the school’s mission and values. It seems each dimension must interact with the other models in a balanced and complementary way. For example, to help students meet high expectations, a school must emphasize emotional and physical safety for students at the school. For safety to be established and well maintained, all faculty and staff must embrace and enforce the school’s standards for behavior and academic rigor, the school’s mission, and values. This is no small task. The four leaders of this study seem able to align these dimensions in particular ways within each unique organizational culture. They are able to achieve effective interdependence of sophisticated parameters as the result of a strong conviction and belief in their school’s mission and vision. It seems that the parameters resulting from being charter public schools enable the four leaders in this study to accomplish this delicate balance.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>The achievement gap in the United States persists. The findings of this study help identify dimensions of site-based leadership that can interact to raise the academic achievement of low-income Black and Hispanic students while also acknowledging the difficulty of implementing the right combination of school characteristics to form an effective conceptual model. In Massachusetts, charter public school legislation was created with the intention of empowering school-site leadership to create school environments that would be transformative for all students regardless of race or socioeconomic background. The promise of the charter public school model offers flexibility and autonomy for leaders to enable them to experiment and be innovative. Although Massachusetts charter public schools, like charters nationwide, have had mixed success, this study explored the views of leaders of four successful charter public schools with Black and Hispanic populations and from low-income families in an effort to capture the elements of each conceptual model.</p>
<p>The findings of this study support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013124511404065">Rutter et al.’s (1979)</xref> findings that the cumulative effect of the specific characteristics of effective schools is considerably greater than the effect of any individual factors on their own. Though all four schools in this study have very similar characteristics, the leadership and the schools are very different. Neither does implementing a list of characteristics make an effective school nor can a blueprint useful for running one school be applied to another hoping for similar positive results. Replicating a laundry list of programmatic characteristics may only lead to limited success without strong underlying values and site-based leadership passionately developing and implementing those characteristics. The characteristics that leaders in this study chose are not “out of the box” or “off the shelf.” Making classes small, extending the school day, or requiring uniforms may not improve student outcomes unless directly connected to a strong mission and vision. The choice of a simple characteristic, like the wearing of school uniforms, should stem from the implementation of leadership’s conceptual model. Within all four schools, leaders placed an emphasis on school safety; for example, uniforms were chosen to contribute to maintaining a safe school environment. However, no leader would point to uniforms as being the primary cause for student success. All four leaders interviewed in this study acknowledge the centrality of these three key dimensions while emphasizing how they implement them differently, depending on their school mission, school values, and the leader’s particular vision and personality. As a result, the organizational culture at each school significantly varies. It is the cumulative effect of these dimensions that makes each school effective and allows each to seemingly overcome the social, psychological, and economic challenges that face urban students and are associated with the achievement gap.</p>
<p>The creation of charter public schools was an attempt to empower individual school leaders, free from district constraints, while holding them strictly accountable for student outcomes. They were created from a belief that large-scale reform would not occur from within the school systems as they currently function. The findings of this study suggest that the four site-based leaders were able to find productive combinations of characteristics within the autonomy that their charter public school legislation allowed. Most importantly, the leaders of the four schools in this study seem to be moving in a direction that could effectively mitigate race-related obstacles to learning. As Black students make up the largest demographic in all four schools in this study, the academic achievement of the four schools suggests the leadership addressed what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013124511404065">Tatum (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013124511404065">Ogbu (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511404065">Ferguson (2008)</xref> identify as one of the most daunting challenges to the achievement gap: the racial identity and motivation of minorities. It is noteworthy that all of the charter public school founders and all four leaders interviewed for this study were White or Asian and the majority of the faculty and staff of each charter public school also did <italic>not</italic> reflect the racial or ethnic background of the students. This suggests that leadership and the resulting school organizational culture and policies may be more important than the demographics of those leading and implementing each program.</p>
<p>Schools effective at raising the achievement of low-income students often have similar characteristics. This study supports that finding and suggests how the charter model holds promise by offering leadership the flexibility to create different organizational cultures that combine the key dimensions of effective schools especially those with high-poverty, high-minority students. All four charter high schools in this study had dedicated, invested, and passionate leaders who not only believed in but also embodied the values and vision of their school. Each school leader determined the values, procedures, and structures of the organization. The individual characteristics of each school in this study are similar, and the leaders acknowledged the centrality of three key dimensions. However, the leaders diverged in how they understood, implemented, and aligned elements of these dimensions with the organizational cultures and values of each school.</p>
<p>One of the main elements of charter school legislation in Massachusetts was that charter public schools were created to be free from bureaucratic requirements. However, charter public schools have more layers of accountability than any other public school. Specifically, the charter public schools in this study are held accountable to the standards of all public schools: federal adequate yearly progress (AYP) goals as articulated by No Child Left Behind, federal civil rights, and special education requirements and optional accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (CPS 1 is accredited, the only charter in the study). In addition, to these universal public school accountability requirements, charter public schools are subject to evaluation by the Massachusetts Department of Education Charter School Office for renewal every 5 years. Thus, charter public schools are required to succeed or face the consequence of closure. No other public school faces such high and rigorous standards.</p>
<p>Although charter public schools are subject to the most regulations in Massachusetts, they have more autonomy than any other public school in the state to choose their curriculum, program, schedule, calendar, and staff. Each charter leader in this study specifically cited qualities such as flexibility and autonomy to hire and fire staff, set budget priorities, set academic goals, and create school culture. These characteristics are driven by the value-based decisions that leaders are free to make in a school environment of paired autonomy and accountability. It seems that a significant amount (if not most) of what leadership was able to accomplish in the running of their schools would not be possible without their charter status. For example, each leader has the ability to hire and fire faculty and staff (all employees in the charters in this study sign 1-year contracts). Leaders in this study emphasized attracting individuals who desire to be part of the mission-driven professional community and strenuous working conditions that each school offers. This combination of accountability and autonomy required the leadership of the schools in this study to remain focused on student achievement while possessing the authority to lead their schools as they thought best. Focusing on results within a strict time frame fosters urgency to attain the goal of raising student performance. All the leaders in this study were urgent in their quest to raise the achievement of their students, and the decisions they made were in the context of high-stakes accountability and autonomy, not in spite of it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that all fours schools struggled at times to post student outcomes that surpassed the district (since completion of this study, some continue to do so on some indices). Certain years saw low scores on MCAS and low graduation rates. Tracking student outcomes over a longer period of time is an area that deserves further study. Also, the history of the schools in this study illustrates that poor leadership can quickly have deleterious effects to the outcomes of a school. This was the case with CPS 1, which faced closure by the State Board of Education, due to teacher attrition, a dip in scores, and budgetary issues. New leadership stepped in and righted the ship, narrowly avoiding closure.</p>
<p>Though there is evidence of narrowing the gap on state tests, the leaders of all four schools modestly and sincerely stated that any claim of narrowing the achievement gap by them or their school would be premature. Leaders were quick to point out that they had not achieved success all the time on all indices. However, they all achieved success much of the time (and since completion of this study, continue to do so). Leaders all emphasized the presence of an achievement gap and believe their charge is to significantly raise student performance to narrow the gap and that the gap can be narrowed by decisions made at the school level to mitigate factors beyond their control outside of school. All leaders acknowledge success in outperforming their sending district and state averages for their school’s demographics according to some indices, but all leaders emphasize that their organizations will not be successful in closing the achievement gap until their schools have demonstrated consistent success in matriculating their graduates to and graduating from college. This long-term view and value may be a contributing factor to the professional culture of the school, further motivating faculty and staff to diligently work with students on the short-term goals to achieve the school’s long-term goals.</p>
<p>The overarching finding of this study is that four charter public schools are successful because of their leadership. The leadership of each school demonstrated success to some extent raising student achievement of students who arrive behind academically. Thus, the findings of this study further support the claim that, though demography may be a strong predictor of student outcomes, demography is not destiny—school-based leadership can catch students up academically interdependent of their race or socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>Despite the findings of this study, the finding of the Coleman report 40 years ago cannot be dismissed. Policy makers, educators, and school leaders must understand the influence of demography on the achievement of low-income and minority students to raise the outcomes of those students. The Coleman Report’s findings that families have a more significant influence than school quality on achievement is too easily misinterpreted as the notion that schools do not make a difference in the lives of young people. Schools have the most influence on a student’s academic development than anything outside the home. However, the strongest predictor of which children will do better in math and which will do worse is not what school they attend but their family income. As most Black and Hispanic and low-income citizens live in the same neighborhoods and most school enrollment is determined by area of residence, Black and Hispanic students attend schools with student populations that predictors say will do poorly. This begs the question that is the foundation of this study. If student outcomes can be predicted based on race and family, what are leaders of schools whose student demographics will predict poor performance doing differently to positively affect their academic outcomes? A final reflection of how well public school administrators serve their low-income Black and Hispanic students who arrive at high school academically behind their White, Asian, and non-low-income peers is the number of students who graduate from college. At worst, it seems that most urban schools in the United States, and the administrators who make the day-to-day decisions in these urban schools, continue to implement the same program hoping for different results; at best, the deliberate actions of urban public school leaders consistently fail despite sincere effort. The outcome, however, remains unacceptably the same.</p>
<p>The leaders of the four charter public schools in this study seem to recognize that their school has limited impact on external factors, that low-income, Black, and Hispanic students will most likely come to school with academic deficits, and that their schools can accelerate the rate at which their students progress, enabling those who enter school behind to catch up to their peers. Thus, the Coleman report’s conclusions are not at all counterintuitive; indeed, it makes perfect sense that the economic, educational, and cultural characteristics of families have powerful effects on learning. The leaders studied here seem to understand that socioeconomic differences are not <italic>determinative</italic> but are <italic>evidence</italic> of inequity of school readiness. They seem to sincerely believe that if their students are willing to work, then they can go to and graduate from college. This readiness is not a fact of nature but is mostly because of differences in life experience. Though leaders cannot change past-life experience, they can affect current and future school experience. Leaders of schools with low-income Black and Hispanic populations must be sure that their leadership takes into account the nuances of the Coleman report and the research on the Black–White test score gap in the running of their schools (see discussions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511404065">Epps, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511404065">Ferguson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124511404065">Rothstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013124511404065">Tough, 2006</xref>). When orchestrating the multidimensional elements of their schools, the leaders of the schools in this study seem to capture the correct balance to mitigate the complex deleterious factors of race and income.</p>
<p>Persistence of an academic achievement gap in 2010 across all public schools in the United States has to be connected, at some level, to the leadership at the school level. Leaders are in a position to change their school environments and transform conditions that have contributed to the persistent achievement gap, particularly along dimensions such as academic expectations and whether the learning environment is safe, orderly, and aligned with school mission and values. Whether the academic deficiencies of today’s Black and Hispanic low-income students are the result of underdeveloped cognitive skills, inadequate motivation, conflicting cultural styles and values, or stressful community and family environments, school-site leadership can prudently take action to offset these factors. Leaders hold within their grasp the potential to shape the organizational cultures of their schools in ways that can foster learning and will lead to better academic performance, improve self-images, and build stronger motivation for academic achievement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe, if present parameters continue to exist for leadership in public schools, any future dramatic education reform in urban public high schools that serve low-income Black and Hispanic teens will only result from the actions of exceptional, dedicated, and disciplined individuals willing to remain committed to the schools they work in for a long period of time. Such leaders are not common, and worse, I fear, the conditions to attract such leaders to urban public education are not common enough, either, making any large-scale reform unlikely. For additional public school leaders to achieve what the leaders in this study achieved, they must be granted more autonomy balanced with fair accountability and increased resources. To be flexible in the leadership of their school environment, principals must have the power to hire and fire their employees, set cultural standards and consequences, set curriculum goals, and drive the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom. Such steps suggest addressing the status of tenure in all public schools, something nowhere being seriously considered in present education reform.</p>
<p>The findings of this study, and my own experience as a 17-year urban public school teacher and leader, corroborate the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013124511404065">Tough (2006)</xref>, who asserts that to raise the outcomes of low-income Black and Hispanic students, school leaders and their faculty and staff must invariably use methods that are radically different and set higher, more rigorous expectations than those employed in most traditional district public schools. However, conditions required to implement such strategies may be too far from traditional schooling or contrary to union collective bargaining agreements (such as lengthening the school day, week, and year) and, therefore, difficult to implement by a leader devoid of local autonomy.</p>
<p>The autonomy afforded to and accountability applied to the site-based charter public school leaders in this study warrant the consideration of policy makers, district officials, and elected officials to enable school leaders to develop their schools according to their beliefs, vision, training, and expertise. The rules governing charter public schools vary as much state-to-state as success varies from charter school–to–charter school. This study makes no assertion as to which rules governing charter schools are most effective, although, arguably, the granting of significant autonomy for these leaders seemed to be an aspect of their ability to accelerate student achievement. The number of charter public schools in the nation constitutes less than 5% of all public schools, and the number of new charters opening annually is decreasing. This is most likely the result of opposition to charters and a reluctance to raise cap numbers, as has been the case in Massachusetts (though it was recently raised in response to incentives put forth by the Obama administration). Therefore, I would recommend granting more leaders site-based autonomy (like that found in charter public schools), not necessarily opening more charter public schools.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the data in Boston indicate charter public high schools are narrowing the achievement gap (albeit, some more so than others and some more consistently than others). These four charter public schools are not only outperforming their sending district but also approaching, meeting, and in many cases surpassing the state average for all races and family income levels. This success is a result of high-stakes site-based accountability, not in spite of it. The high-stakes accountability and the accompanying autonomy that the charter school model offers are worth consideration by leaders at all public schools.</p>
<p>Our nation remains at risk as long as the achievement gap persists, signifying a public school system inconsistently meeting the needs of the citizens it is intended to develop. To raise student performance and narrow the achievement gap, we must attract, retain, and motivate leaders who will improve the teaching and learning in our nation’s public schools. They must be afforded the responsibility to construct conceptual models in the running of their school as the leaders of this study were permitted to do. As an administrator dedicated to the success of our nation’s urban high-poverty, high-minority public schools, I am committing my career to serving in urban public high schools—so long as there is a public school district to work in that will grant me site-based autonomy.</p>

<p>On the SAT, a gap exists according to race, too. However, this was not a focus of this study. On the SAT, Black and Hispanic students have performed, on average during the last decade, consistently lower than White and Asian students. This is notable because the SAT is not a representative sample of all high school students like the NAEP. As it is the test used by most colleges and universities as part of their admissions process, students who take the SAT self-select, having already achieved academic outcomes that would merit their admission to college. That is to say, a gap exists even when the scores of Black and Hispanic students who perform strongly in high school and plan to go to college are compared with the scores of college-bound Whites and Asian peers on a national scale.</p>
