<abstract>
<p>This paper takes the position that the best way to identify figures of children participating in scenes of early Christian ritual is through a comparison of child figures in Roman art and ritual. For the purpose of this comparison we refer to Roman scenes showing children in processions, offerings/sacrifices and banquets. Early Christian scenes of offerings which continued the representation of children but omitted the priest and musicians may have aided the identification of the scene as a gift or donation rather than a Roman sacrifice. While there is no ambiguity as to the figures in many of the early Christian baptism scenes being children, there is a long standing debate whether the child figures symbolically represent Jesus’ immersion in the Jordan river or actual baptizands. Possible similarities between Roman purification rituals by immersion in water and early Christian baptism, especially with regard to the visual representation of these rituals, remain a fruitful area for future research.</p>
<p>Cet article propose que la meilleure façon d’identifier les images d’enfants qui participaient aux scènes d’anciens rituels chrétiens est par une comparaison des images d’enfants représentés dans l’art et le rituel romains. Aux fins de cette comparaison nous nous référons à des scènes montrant des enfants romains dans les processions, les offrandes/sacrifices et les banquets. Les anciennes scènes chrétiennes de l’offrande qui ont inclus la représentation des enfants, mais qui ne représentent ni le prêtre ni les musiciens, ont pu avoir aidé à l’identification de la scène comme un cadeau ou un don chrétien plutôt que d’un sacrifice romain. Bien qu’il n’y ait aucune ambiguïté que les images dans la plupart des scènes d’ancien baptême chrétien sont des enfants, il y a un débat de longue date de savoir si les images d’enfants représentent symboliquement l’immersion de Jésus dans le fleuve Jourdain ou bien de baptisés réels. Il est possible qu’il y ait des similarités entre les rituels de purification romain par immersion dans l’eau et l’ancien baptême chrétien, en particulier à l’égard de la représentation visuelle de ces rituels, ce qui mérite davantage de recherche.</p>

<p>In recent years increased interest in the subject of children in antiquity and their place within the family has focused attention on the role of children as participants in religious activities. Research in this area has examined the subjects of: how religious knowledge was transmitted to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2003</xref>; Osiek and MacDonald, 2006;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008429812441343">Prescendi, 2010</xref>; and see Osiek’s contribution in this volume); children’s participation in domestic rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429812441343">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008429812441343">Prescendi, 2010</xref>); children’s participation in divinatory rites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008429812441343">Johnston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008429812441343">Prescendi, 2010</xref>); children’s participation in non-imperial cults in the larger Greco-Roman world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0008429812441343">Uzzi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441343">Green, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812441343">Backe-Dahmen, 2008</xref>); abject ritual practices involving children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441343">Frankfurter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429812441343">D’Ambra, 2007</xref>) and the Romanization of children as participants in imperial rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0008429812441343">Mantle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0008429812441343">Uzzi, 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0008429812441343">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441343">Kleiner and Buxton, 2008</xref>). Compared with the early Christian sources, evidence for children as participants in religious rites in the Roman imperial period is abundant. One of the best sources, visual representations, shows children as participants in sacred processions, sacrifices, offerings, and banquet scenes from the early Roman empire. With regard to Christian children, Carolyn Osiek has stated that outside of the gospels, there are few references to actual children in the New Testament (see Osiek’s contribution in this volume; cf. 1 Cor 7:14; Acts 21:5; Acts 1:14 [manuscript variation]; Col 3:20–21; Eph 6:1–4).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429812441343">1</xref>
</sup> In early Christian art, unmistakable child-size figures show up in early Christian banquet and baptismal scenes – although in banquet scenes, based on the extant evidence, their presence is less frequent. Within baptismal scenes, their identification as actual children is a matter of debate – more will be said about this scene type below. However, even within the area of commemorative art, a genre that is associated with actual individuals and death rituals, and is well represented in early Christian art, Beryl Rawson has found that in comparison with representations of Roman pagan children, “Roman Christian children are less often memorialized as members of a biological family and less often represented iconographically in specifically child-related contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0008429812441343">Rawson, 2003b</xref>: 296). Given the overall infrequency of children in our early Christian sources and the problem of identification, the purpose of this paper is to examine three important visual genres of Roman art (processions; offerings/sacrifices; and banquets<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812441343">2</xref>
</sup>) that show children as participants in ritual for their possible relationship to the representation of children in early Christian ritual scenes. A comparison of similar visual genres in which figures of children are abundant may help to recover overlooked young figures in early Christian art and their possible connection to ritual. As part of this investigation I revisit some questionable identifications of figures in three ritually significant scenes in early Christian art for their possible misinterpretation in earlier scholarship.</p>
<p>Studies of early Christian art have shown that by the end of the second century, the iconography and media of Roman art were the cultural apparati used by early Christians to express their growing religious identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0008429812441343">Mathews, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>; Synder, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429812441343">Jensen, 2001</xref>). As we will see in our discussion of early Christian examples, Christians adapted and modified the Roman cultural forms of procession, offering/sacrifice and banquets to accommodate the representation of their own ritual practices or beliefs. It is indisputable that there are similarities between the early Christian rite of baptism and Jewish purification rituals by total immersion in water. With regard to Roman religion, Albert Schachter claims that “the waters of springs served as a means of purification at the critical points of life: birth, initiation, marriage, and death, but this function was shared by rivers, that is, by any source of fresh, running water.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812441343">3</xref>
</sup> While this is a fruitful area for comparison with the ritual of early Christian baptism, Robin Jensen states that “nothing quite like it [the representation of early Christian baptism] exists in pagan iconography. ...”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812441343">4</xref>
</sup> While there is little or no ambiguity as to  the figures in many of the baptism scenes (from the Roman catacombs, for example) being children, there is a longstanding debate whether these child figures symbolically represent Jesus’ immersion in the Jordan river or whether they are a motif designed to show the viewer that the deceased was a baptizand (or both), since the earliest baptismal imagery occurs in funerary chambers and on sarcophagi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008429812441343">Jensen, 2011</xref>: 26–29, 72–75). The possible similarities between Roman purification rituals through immersion in water and early Christian baptism, especially with regard to the representation of child figures, is a topic worthy of a separate article and therefore will not be treated here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812441343">5</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>While it is acknowledged that cultural variations exist with regard to subject matter, region, and presentation among the Roman examples discussed below, for the purpose of this paper it is the influence of the three Roman visual genres on depictions of children in early Christian art that is of particular interest. In our attempt to identify certain figures as children and then analyze their function within an early Christian scene and context, we first present some of the problems associated with conventions of Roman scenes of ritual and their relationship to actual children performing rites. This is followed by a discussion of four key criteria<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429812441343">6</xref>
</sup> that can aid viewers in identifying figures of children in either type of ritual scene. In the next section, each category (processions, offerings/sacrifices, and banquets) is introduced by describing the religious activity and the representation of the ritual category in Roman art. A discussion of some visual examples showing figures of children participating in the ritual category ensues. This is followed by the presentation and discussion of a scene from early Christian art related to the Roman genre, depicting a figure of questionable identification. The discussion then shifts to the question of whether early Christian representations offer any possible insights for the role of children in early Christian ritual practice.</p>
<sec id="section1-0008429812441343">
<title>Identification of Children in Roman Art and its Relationship to Actual Children and the Performance of Rites</title>
<p>The ability to identify children in Roman art, as in early Christian art, is a critical, interpretive issue – get the identification wrong and the entire significance of the scene suffers. As we will see in our discussion below, the topic of children and their function in art is a highly contested area among modern interpreters. Variation in genre styles, artistic conventions, cultural differences in dress, and regional variations in art across time, place and context all combine to complicate the identification process. As Roman art historian Janet Huskinson reports: “Art operates according to conventions that can produce some confusing effects (such as symbolic sizing, which represents low-status figures as child-size), while particular genres (such as ritual) determine that some aspects of the scene are appropriate to represent but not others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441343">Huskinson, 2007</xref>: 323). In Roman religions, processions, offerings/sacrifices and banquets are not really separate since the ritual function of each action is part of a continuous religious matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008429812441343">Prescendi, 2010</xref>: 75–76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0008429812441343">Moede, 2011</xref>: 168–172; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008429812441343">Scheid, 2011</xref>: 263–269). However, according to Katja Moede, “The peculiarities of visual art made it necessary to amalgamate non-synchronous moments of a coherent [ritual] sequence into one unified scene. ... Unlike modern viewers, [the ancient viewer] was not tempted to view these images as documentation of the actual event of the ritual, because he very well knew the sequences of the ritual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0008429812441343">Moede, 2011</xref>: 168). While realistic, Roman art is not necessarily documentary, since in order to fit a subject onto a small visual field, the narrative has been collapsed. Huskinson warns against viewing funerary reliefs of Roman families with children as documentary rather than as emblematic of a Roman family since not all family members may be present in the finished relief. Images, like texts, are edited documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441343">Huskinson, 2007</xref>: 328). By the late third century, compositions on sarcophagi were becoming formulaic, making it more difficult to attribute reality to imagery. Figures were generally becoming less important, thus reducing the capacity for individual identification within a decorative scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812441343">Huskinson, 1996</xref>: 59; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0008429812441343">Rawson, 2003b</xref>: 290). While we cannot make direct correlations between images of children in ritual scenes and actual children performing rites, we can make the assumption, based on the amount and type of visual evidence, that children performing rituals in Roman religions were culturally significant enough for both patrons and viewers to include them in the most universal scenes of Roman ritual.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above methodological problems, the criteria for identifying children in Roman art can be seen to follow four basic guidelines. First, small children can be identified through their different anatomy from that of adults. Both young boys and girls have round faces, as can be seen in the terracotta pair of girl and boy musicians found in the Roman east (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0008429812441343">figure 1</xref>). Infants and toddlers can be identified through their chubby arms, thick thighs and ankles, and lack of muscle tone in their limbs, shown especially clearly on the back of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0008429812441343">figure 2</xref>, a terracotta figure of a toddler using a walking aid.</p>

</fig>
<p>Three physical features also useful for identifying very young children include the shape and contour of a figure’s head (somewhat oval-shaped), nose size (small), and thickness of neck (short and stocky).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429812441343">7</xref>
</sup> Our next criterion in identifying figures of children in Roman art relates to hairstyles, since boys’ and girls’ coiffures are an important marker of gender, ethnicity and status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0008429812441343">8</xref>
</sup> Roman girls (i.e. non-slaves) tend to be shown wearing their hair pulled back and braided at the crown or back of the head, sometimes with a parting in the middle. Busts of male infants from the third century CE show boys wearing the so-called Horus lock or a long “youth-lock” of hair on the right that identifies them as children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429812441343">Backe-Dahmen, 2006</xref>: plates 90, 91a, 91b; 2008: fig. 64; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0008429812441343">figure 2</xref> in this article). Older Roman boys wear their hair combed forward in a Caesar-like style, cropped about an inch above the eyes. Non-Roman male children tend to be shown with longer, unkempt hair as on the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0008429812441343">figure 3</xref>) and in Scene XCI from Trajan’s column, 113 CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0008429812441343">Uzzi, 2007</xref>: fig. 3.7). Third, as with hairstyles, clothing or costume is an important identifier of Roman identity. As Jeannine Diddle Uzzi states, “costume is the key to determining ethnicity in art” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0008429812441343">Uzzi, 2007</xref>: 70). Roman male children with high status or whose parents aspired to high status are frequently shown fully togated, as the imperial male and female children are on the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> and on the funerary altar dedicated by Publicia Glypte to her infant son and a slave infant born and raised in her household (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0008429812441343">Rawson, 2003b</xref>: 286–287, fig. 2). This guideline on costume is especially helpful for identifying figures when Romans and non-Romans appear in the same image. In the procession Scene XCI on Trajan’s column, Roman males and children closest to the emperor are dressed similarly in tunic and <italic>pallium</italic> (a type of folded cloak) like the emperor, or in a toga like the senatorial class. At the back of the procession line, non-Roman men (the conquered barbarians) have long unkempt hair and beards, with tunics belted at the waist. The non-Roman boys have long unkempt hair like the adult males. The non-Roman women and their daughters wear costumes fastened with a twisted knot at a high waist and a <italic>stola</italic> (long robe) underneath with loose caps or kerchiefs over their hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0008429812441343">Uzzi, 2007</xref>: 70–71, fig. 3.7). Male slave children frequently appear only in a loincloth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0008429812441343">Ryberg, 1955</xref>: figs 32, 51) whereas female slave children are difficult to identify in scenes by clothing. They may wear short or long tunics, and their hair can be loose or coiffed. Fourth, the placement of the figures in a scene can be an important factor in identifying children. In triumphal processions, barbarian children were shown at the back as discussed above. Though this is not a triumphal procession, the displacement of barbarian children, shown in front of the imperial children in the processions on the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0008429812441343">figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0008429812441343">5a</xref>), signals an important political narrative to the viewer (see discussion below). In Roman sacrifice scenes which depict the emperor as high priest, young children stand next to him as his assistant (<italic>camillus</italic> or <italic>camilla</italic>) holding an incense box. Wreathed youths who play the flute also stand close by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441343">Fless and Moede, 2011:</xref> figs 18.1 and 18.2). Children as participants in banquet scenes are frequently placed at the end or edge of a couch. In Roman kline (single person couch) scenes as late as 300 CE, young children are relegated to the edge of a couch<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0008429812441343">9</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441343">Dunbabin, 2003</xref>: fig. 57). In sigma meal scenes (those featuring a C-shaped couch), older children, especially beardless youths, can be shown reclining casually at either end of a long cushion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812441343">Amedick, 1991</xref>: plate 26.1, cat. 260, on viewer’s right; plate 31.3, cat. 279; plate 33.2, cat. 158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441343">Dunbabin, 2003</xref>: plate VIII). On rare occasions, young children can be shown reclining among adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441343">Dunbabin, 2003</xref>: plate XII). After reviewing these guidelines we arrive at our first examples showing children participating in sacred processions.</p>

<title>Children and Sacred Processions </title>
<p>A sacred procession (<italic>pompa</italic>) was typically the first stage of the larger ritual complex of Roman sacrifice with its six stages of rites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441343">Beard, North and Price, 1998</xref>: 148). In the Roman world, the sacred procession had a different religious meaning depending on the event celebrated (e.g. military triumph, festival day of a god or goddess, marriage, funeral, imperial cult or games). For Romans in the early empire, a ritual procession was more than simply walking or marching; rather, it had sacred qualities which were believed to protect and sanctify an area as well as focus the attention of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429812441343">Davies, 1997</xref>: 54–56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0008429812441343">Moede, 2011</xref>: 170–171).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0008429812441343">10</xref>
</sup> In the procession’s representation in Roman art, it is not always possible to distinguish the various types although the triumph is usually recognizable through scenes depicting the carriage of the <italic>triumphator</italic>, subjugated enemies in chains, decorated sacrificial animals, soldiers in military formation, and musicians who separate the different sections of the procession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441343">Fless and Moede, 2011</xref>: 260). Children and youths in sacred processions are depicted in a variety of types.

<p>In this section, we discuss two examples of Roman processions involving child participants, those featured on the first-century BCE <italic>Ara Pacis</italic>, originally built on the Campus Martius in Rome, and a late second- or early third-century fresco from a house in Ostia. We then discuss the material evidence for early Christian processions. As the first monument under the new empire to unequivocally acknowledge the importance of children as key participants in religious ritual, the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> serves as a prototype for comparing all later representations of children as participants in religious activities in the imperial period.</p>
<p>Vowed by the Senate in 13 BCE upon Augustus’ triumphant return from campaigns in Spain and Gallia (France), the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic>, or Augustan altar of Peace, was dedicated in 9 BCE. Magistrates, priests, and Vestal virgins were ordered by the Senate to offer a sacrifice once every year in honor of the end of Roman civil and military strife. As Jas Elsner has argued, the primary function of the religious art on the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> was to map the sacred elements of the imperial cult at its beginnings in the 1st century BCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812441343">Elsner, 1995</xref>: 192–196). However, as Paul Zanker and others have argued, its political function, especially with regard to children, cannot be separated from its religious function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0008429812441343">Zanker, 1990</xref>: 121–123; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0008429812441343">Kleiner, 1993</xref>: 29, 44–46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0008429812441343">Rose, 1993</xref>: 54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441343">Kleiner and Buxton, 2008</xref>: 57). The monument shows two processions, which move in parallel lines depicted on the north and south friezes of the precinct walls which protect and demarcate the actual altar. Some scholars hold the view that the visual presentation of the procession on the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> is not symbolic; rather, it represents an actual religious procession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0008429812441343">Kleiner, 1993</xref>: 28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812441343">Elsner, 1995</xref>: 200 n21). On the south frieze, where Augustus leads the procession, there are three children, two boys and a girl, fully togated. They are dressed in the attire they will wear as adults. They have round faces and thick, stocky necks. The tallest figure wears her hair pulled back and rolled into a bun at the back of her head; a protective <italic>bulla</italic> is barely visible around her neck. The smaller figure beside her wears a laurel wreath on his head; a longer <italic>bulla</italic> is visible over his <italic>pallium</italic>. Judging by his oval-shaped head, the small figure to the viewer’s far left holding the hand of an adult female appears to be a toddler; he, too, wears a <italic>bulla</italic>. Based on their formal dress and the adult figures who accompany them, these children are clearly members of Rome’s Imperial family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0008429812441343">12</xref>
</sup> Ahead of the togated children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0008429812441343">figure 4</xref>), a child figure who is sometimes identified as Gaius Caesar, biological son of Agrippa and adopted son of Augustus, clings to the toga of Agrippa, Augustus' closest friend and trusted general. His placement beside Agrippa near the front of the procession suggests his high status, yet the boy appears in non-Roman dress. As scholars have argued, the short tunic, long curly hair, cap and torque (wreath) around his neck are reminiscent of children from the eastern part of the empire<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0008429812441343">13</xref>
</sup> rather than the Roman west (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0008429812441343">Rose, 1993</xref>: 55–56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0008429812441343">Uzzi, 2007</xref>: 70–78; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441343">Kleiner and Buxton, 2008</xref>: 59–60). On the north side of the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> frieze, there are three figures which, using the criteria outlined above, can be identified as children, a togated girl and two small boys. While the girl is clearly a member of the imperial family, the identity of the boys is less certain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0008429812441343">figure 5a</xref>). Like the boy on the south side, their hair and costume are non-Roman. The boy closest to the girl (taller boy–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0008429812441343">figure 5a</xref>; girl not shown) wears a short tunic and a <italic>mappa</italic> (or fringed cloth) over his left shoulder. The <italic>mappa </italic>could identify him as an apprentice <italic>camillus</italic>, a noble youth who assisted the <italic>Flamen Dialis </italic>with the sacrifice. An older <italic>camillus</italic> towards the front of the procession on the north frieze carries a <italic>mappa</italic>, and carries an <italic>accera</italic> (incense box), as well as an <italic>urceus</italic> (a small pitcher) used in sacrifices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0008429812441343">figure 5b</xref>). In “Pledges of Empire,” Kleiner and Buxton focus on the disputed identity of the non-Roman-looking boys in both the north and south ritual processions. The authors’ identification of these boys as foreign princes who represent the sons of Augustus’ allies or conquered enemies is crucial to their interpretation of the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> as “... a brave new Augustan world as it was envisioned in 13 BCE” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441343">Kleiner and Buxton, 2008</xref>: 59). They maintain that the young boys represent highly prized <italic>pignora</italic> or “pledges of empire” in Augustus’ plan for a peaceful, harmonious and decidedly Roman global empire. This identification is backed by textual evidence which reveals that real foreign children of conquered elites could be found among the retinue of Augustus’ household and his circle of aristocratic friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441343">Kleiner and Buxton, 2008</xref>: 64–66). If the authors are correct in their interpretation, then the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> frieze is a work of visual rhetoric which interweaves its religious function – the mapping of the imperial cult onto the bodies of known children and their parents – with a political function, the integration and social elevation of the youngest elite members of the empire, including those from conquered territories. At the very least, as John Clarke has suggested, the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> provided a lasting visual example for all ancient viewers who lived or visited Rome, in how to raise their own children as future citizens of the empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2003</xref>: 256).</p>
<p>Our next example in this category (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0008429812441343">figure 6</xref>) is a fresco which shows children holding torches up high and gesturing towards the statue of Diana on the left. On the right, there is a procession of girls, some who hold baskets of grapes or other fruit in their hands, while two small figures hold poles with busts affixed at the top. Bunches of grapes hang from the ends of the pole. This fresco, from a house in Ostia, is dated from the late second to the early third century CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429812441343">Andreae, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0008429812441343">Stern, 1981</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0008429812441343">14</xref>
</sup> It is likely part of a much larger representation depicting important festivals in the Roman year, of which only one other fresco now survives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0008429812441343">Stern, 1981</xref>: plate 8). There is some debate as to whether this fresco represents two different festival days in the Roman year as signalled by the two groups of children. The small figures on the left clearly honor the goddess Diana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0008429812441343">Stern, 1981</xref>: 440; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0008429812441343">Scullard, 1981</xref>: fig. 32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441343">Green, 2007</xref>: 140), whose festival was celebrated on 13 August in Rome, and most likely in Ostia since it was a nearby Roman colony. There is a tradition of argumentation that claims the figures on the right of the fresco are part of a procession in a separate Roman festival of wine that took place on 19 August (the second <italic>Vinalia</italic> in the Roman year) or, according to Stern, on 5 September.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0008429812441343">15</xref>
</sup> Whether the fresco depicts one or two different festivals in the Roman year is less important to my argument than the point that the visual record shows children as participants in sacred processions in the larger context of the performance of Roman rites. Indeed, the surviving companion fresco to the one above also shows male and female children as part of a ritual procession.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0008429812441343">16</xref>
</sup> I will discuss the left side of the fresco first – the association between the Italian goddess Diana and children, especially girls.</p>
<p>The cult of Diana, while popular with the inhabitants of the Latium region, was not part of civic religion. As the left portion of this domestic fresco shows, a small cult statue of Diana stands on a high pedestal flanked by two burning torches. Four small figures hold up burning torches at the side of the statue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0008429812441343">17</xref>
</sup> As discussed below, the torches may reference a night-time sacred procession carried out by women at Diana’s temple at Lake Nemi. The figures appear to be a mixture of girls and boys coiffed and dressed as adults. The remaining figures are young girls, coiffed as adult women. They wear mantles and shoes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0008429812441343">18</xref>
</sup> In her 2007 study of the Italic goddess, C.M.C. Green has suggested that as well as being the guardian of women in childbirth, “Diana was the <italic>tutela</italic> of the young” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441343">Green, 2007</xref>: 140). One of Diana’s key roles included the teaching and training of the young, since they were “prone to error, to wandering off the path.” As Green states, Roman first-century BCE poets Horace and Catullus wrote hymns to be sung by girls and “chaste” boys together during worship of the goddess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441343">Green, 2007</xref>: 138). Selected lines from Catullus’ poem XXXIV give us some indication of the role of children in the worship of the goddess:<disp-quote>
<p>We girls and chaste boys are lieges of Diana. Diana let us sing, chaste boys and girls. O child of Latona, great offspring of greatest Jove, whom thy mother bore by the Delian olive-tree, that thou mightest be the lady of mountains and green woods, and sequestered glens and sounding rivers. ... Thou, goddess, measurest out by monthly course the circuit of the year, thou fillest full with goodly fruits the rustic home of the husbandman.<sup>

</fig>
<p>The poet Statius (ca 45–ca 96 CE) tells us that in Aricia near Rome, Diana’s rites were performed at night by women carrying torches, who, after the rites, returned to the city in a torchlight procession (<italic>Silvae</italic> 3.1.55–60). Ovid and Propertius also mention these rites performed by women at Aricia in Roman antiquity (<italic>Fasti</italic> 3.269; Propertius 3.24.9f).</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence confirms worship of Diana at Lake Nemi near Aricia in the 3rd–2nd centuries BCE. Examples of two bronze statuettes from this period found at Diana’s temple at Lake Nemi show an adult female and a young girl in the identical pose of sacrifice, with a tilted <italic>patera</italic> (small offering dish) held in the outstretched right hand. An incense box is held in the left.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0008429812441343">20</xref>
</sup> These votive figurines suggest a strong association between female adults and their daughters at Diana’s temple at Lake Nemi. Whether or not the left section of the above fresco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0008429812441343">figure 6</xref>) depicts a real or an imaginary rite of worship of Diana, possibly from Roman antiquity or even first-century Rome, cannot be known for certain. What we can say is that Diana’s festival, and children’s participation in it, were not incongruent events to viewers living in the early third century CE. The rites which marked this festival still recognizably stood for the representation of the 13th August, Diana’s festival day, as part of a larger wall painting that may have represented the Roman year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0008429812441343">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>On the right-hand portion of the fresco, five children are shown in what may be a different festival. Like the figures on the left they are well coiffed and wear mantles and shoes. As mentioned above, there is a tradition of argumentation that claims these figures are part of a procession called the <italic>Vinalia</italic>, a Roman festival of wine which occurred twice a year. Rather than a representation of a calendar of distinct months as Stern argues, I would suggest that this fresco (and its companion surviving representation) may have been part of a larger wall painting that marked the important festivals of the Roman sacred year, with the group of children on the right above, representing the festival for the second <italic>Vinalia</italic>, which took place on 19 August.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0008429812441343">22</xref>
</sup> If the right-hand section of the fresco does indeed show the second <italic>Vinalia</italic>, then 19 August and not 5 September, as Stern argues, makes the most sense since the point of this sacred festival was to gain protection for the growing grapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0008429812441343">Scullard, 1981</xref>: 177). By depicting the anticipated positive result of a mature and healthy crop of grapes through the proper worship of the deity(ies) involved, Romans hoped to create favorable conditions for success.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0008429812441343">23</xref>
</sup> It must be acknowledged that the representation of children in the above fresco (and its surviving companion, not shown here) could be a visual convention of the calendar series. It could equally index sacred processions and rites in which children participated – for Diana on the left section of the above fresco in thanks for her protection over the lives of the young, and to Jupiter and Venus<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0008429812441343">24</xref>
</sup> on the right portion of the fresco in thanks for their protection that will culminate in a mature harvest. For both groups of children, the theme of protection until maturity seems to be shared. Jupiter and Venus protect and guide the forthcoming harvest of grapes much in the same way, I suggest, that the invocation of Diana’s protection guides children to mature adulthood.</p>
<p>We are told by their detractors that early Christians did not participate in state processions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441343">Benko, 1984</xref>: 55–57). When it came to weddings or funerals, however, it seems reasonable to assume that both early Christians and Jews would have included elements of procession in their rites similar to those of pagans, in which entire families participated, including children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0008429812441343">25</xref>
</sup> Our earliest material evidence of Christians practicing a type of sacred procession in the form of circumambulation can be found in the architecture of round-shaped <italic>martyria</italic>, mausolea which at one time held the body or relics of a martyr or high-ranking Christian. The sarcophagus, placed at the center of the space, was encircled by an arched ambulatory around which pilgrims walked. A highly decorated example of such an ambulatory can be found inside the mid-fourth-century mausoleum, Santa Costanza in Rome, originally built for the daughters of Constantine I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0008429812441343">Krautheimer, 1986</xref>: 67, fig. 28). It is likely that early Christian pilgrims also practiced a form of sacred procession in their pilgrimage from martyr’s shrine to martyr’s shrine in the catacombs outside the eternal city.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0008429812441343">26</xref>
</sup> Elsewhere, I have argued on the basis of the placement of frescoes in relation to a stone <italic>mensa</italic> (table) within an individual funerary chamber, that early Christians may have practiced a type of circumambulation within certain household funerary chambers in the catacomb of Saints Marcellino and Pietro, a large fourth-century cemetery known for its original burial sites of early Christian martyrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0008429812441343">Tulloch, 2011</xref>: 548–551). One particular funerary chamber in this catacomb is particularly suggestive. It contains two frescoes: a larger banquet scene consisting of seven figures painted in the lunette of an <italic>arcosolium</italic> (grave) across from the entrance, and a fresco of a seated figure who gestures towards a plate of food on top of a <italic>mensa</italic> or small table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0008429812441343">Tulloch, 2011</xref>: fig. 32.5). This smaller fresco is square in shape and, according to one archaeological report, takes up the space of two children’s <italic>loculi</italic> as measured against the size of other children’s graves dug out above this fresco on the same wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441343">Deckers, Mietke and Weiland, 1987</xref>: 269, “Beschreibung” RCLau 45).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0008429812441343">27</xref>
</sup> This smaller fresco is located directly across from a real <italic>mensa </italic>made of masonry in the same chamber. In the banquet scene consisting of seven figures, two small figures can be clearly identified as children by their smaller size, placement among adults and, in the case of one figure, by the oval-shaped head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0008429812441343">Tulloch, 2006</xref>: fig. 8.2; 2011: fig. 32.3). Above the fresco of the banquet scene is a <italic>loculus</italic> for an adult and above this one is a <italic>loculus</italic> for a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441343">Deckers, Mietke and Weiland, 1987</xref>: 267, “Beschreibung” RCLau 45). The smallest <italic>loculus</italic> on this wall is dug out of the lunette of the <italic>arcosolium</italic> which destroys the lower part of the banquet scene.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0008429812441343">28</xref>
</sup> Given it is smaller than the <italic>loculus</italic> for the child found on the same wall, it probably held an infant or toddler.</p>
<p>Although the age of the seated figure in the smaller fresco is difficult to assess, in the same 1987 archaeological report, Deckers, Mietke and Weiland describe the figure as a “young, beardless man with short, curly, brown hair” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441343">Deckers, Mietke and Weiland, 1987</xref>: 269, “Beschreibung” RCLau 45). Of the three male figures in the banquet scene on the adjacent wall, one appears to be a beardless youth and may be the same figure depicted in the small fresco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441343">Deckers, Mietke and Weiland, 1987</xref>: chamber 45, color-plate 21a). The figure’s identity as a male youth could have an important bearing on the role of youths and children in early Christian funerary rites and commemorative practices held on the feast days of saints at popular catacombs. Given that this fresco is located directly across from an actual <italic>mensa</italic> made of masonry, upon entering, a visitor to the funerary chamber, perhaps a family member or pilgrim,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0008429812441343">29</xref>
</sup> would have been visually directed by the two frescoes in the chamber to walk in a clockwise direction around the small room, ending with a plate of food (the host?) that was left on the real <italic>mensa</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0008429812441343">30</xref>
</sup> before leaving by the same door from which he or she had entered. Thanks to the fifth-century Spanish poet Prudentius, we know that young children accompanied families on their pilgrimages to the tombs of martyrs in early fifth-century Rome but did not, in his experience, assemble with the adults waiting their turn to “do reverence” at the shrine of a martyr (Prudentius II “Crowns of Martyrs”, XI, 319). If the seated figure in chamber 45 of Saints Marcellino and Pietro is indeed a youth, then within the context of the burial chamber which held the remains of a number of children and the catacomb of Saints Marcellino and Pietro as a popular destination for early Christian pilgrims, this image might have functioned symbolically in the role of “host,” in the absence of a real host, directing a family visitor or pilgrim toward the offered food on the real table.</p>
<p>In summary, while we do not have any visual evidence of early Christians and their children shown in sacred processions, we do have early to mid-fourth-century architectural, archaeological and documentary evidence that supports the view that Christians performed some type of circumambulation rite associated with death and the commemoration of martyrs and high-ranking Christians.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0008429812441343">31</xref>
</sup> Based on the visual evidence in chamber 45, and the household tomb’s location in a catacomb well-known to fourth-century pilgrims for its famous martyrs’ shrines, we might speculate that on crowded feast days enterprising youths associated with families buried in the cemetery and who knew their way around the underground galleries may have assisted guests to the family funerary chamber or eager pilgrims anxious to find an alternative route to the tomb of their beloved saints to avoid the long wait in lines.</p>

<p>Shall I offer to god sacrifices and victims which he provided for my use, and so throw his generosity back at him? That is a mark of ingratitude, since the offering that is acceptable to god is a good heart, a pure mind and innocent thoughts. So, to cherish innocence is to pray to god: to cherish justice is to make a libation to god; to refrain from deceit is to propitiate god; to save another man from danger is to slay the best victim. These are our sacrifices, these our holy rites of the Lord.<sup>

</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Like processions, there were different forms of Roman sacrifice and offerings. Their meaning and the types of gifts offered depended on many factors: the purpose of the sacrifice (e.g. vow or thanksgiving), the status of the divine power or ancestor being propitiated, the site of the sacrifice, and the public, professional or domestic nature of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008429812441343">Scheid, 2011</xref>: 269–270). There were also rules pertaining to which order of priests or priestesses performed the sacrifice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0008429812441343">33</xref>
</sup> From the above excerpt, it is clear that Minucius Felix had no appreciation for the nuanced meaning of Roman sacrifice. In examples of Roman art showing children as participants in sacrifice rituals, the most common roles include: male or female assistants (<italic>camilli </italic> or <italic>camillae</italic>) who refill the <italic>patera</italic> or hold the incense box for priests, or emperors acting as priests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0008429812441343">Ryberg, 1955</xref>: figs. 17b, 54a, 67, 83, 93; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441343">Fless and Moede, 2011</xref>: figs. 18.1, 18.2); loin-clothed figures (<italic>victimarii</italic>) who lead the sacrificial animals to the altar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0008429812441343">Ryberg, 1955</xref>: figs. 32, 51); and flute players (<italic>tibicines</italic>) who play the double flute in scenes of formal imperial sacrifice as well as in domestic scenes showing sacrifice to the household gods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0008429812441343">Ryberg, 1955</xref>: fig. 38a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2003</xref>: fig. 40). We also find child musicians playing percussion instruments during an offering or sacrifice in scenes of foreign cults (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0008429812441343">figure 8</xref> in this article).</p>

<p>The following two representations show the tamer side of children’s roles in sacrifice in the early imperial period. Fless and Moede state that together, an “altar, sacrificing <italic>togatus capite velato </italic>[veiled and wearing the toga], and <italic>tibicen</italic> [flute player] are therefore the most basic, universally valid image of ritual action” in Roman art (italics in original text: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441343">Fless and Moede, 2011</xref>: 258). The first image we examine is a fresco from Herculaneum showing a young girl participating in the cult of Isis, a favorite of Roman sub-elites who lived in nearby Pompeii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0008429812441343">figure 8</xref>). Our second example is a relief found on an altar from the temple of Vespasian in Pompeii showing <italic>camilli </italic>and a <italic>camilla </italic>assisting the emperor in a sacrifice scene. After discussing these two scenes we turn our attention to an early Christian fresco from the so-called crypt of sacraments from the catacomb of Callixtus in Rome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0008429812441343">figure 10</xref>).</p>

<p>A fresco from Herculaneum now in the Museo Archeologico in Naples shows a sacrifice taking place in an <italic>Iseum</italic>, a temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Isis. Though the fresco was found in Herculaneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2007</xref>: 39), a similar sacrificial performance may have taken place in Pompeii, about seven kilometres south-east of Herculaneum, where a nearly intact temple of Isis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0008429812441343">figure 7</xref>) was one of the first sites to be excavated, in 1764 CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0008429812441343">Peterson, 2006</xref>: 22–23).</p>
<p>The focal point of the Isis cult scene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0008429812441343">figure 8</xref>) seems to be the black male dancer, who is at the apex of a triangle of musicians and worshipping figures, many of whom shake a <italic>sistra</italic>. Of special interest to us is the young girl who plays the cymbals. She wears a full-length dark (blue?) robe and stands behind the dancer and the tall figure on the temple podium. Others on the podium appear to clap or play drums or tambourines while a fire burns on the altar below. In the fresco, both adults and children participate in the musical accompaniment to the sacrifice, a cacophony of percussion instruments celebrating the possible resurrection of Osiris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2007</xref>: fig. 24).As the Egyptian cult of Isis was one of the many oriental religions seeking to gain broader public legitimacy in the Roman empire,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0008429812441343">34</xref>
</sup> the positive presentation of sacrifice, in which children were welcome and could safely participate in a respectful ceremony, was not lost on the people of Pompeii, who, like many Roman sub-elites, were interested in finding ways to increase the status of their family through the promotion of the next generation. After the earthquake of 62 CE, the temple of Isis was one of the few temples to be rebuilt – all with private funds, as the temple’s dedicatory inscription attests. Further, all of this beneficence was thanks to Numerius Popidius Celsinus, a six-year-old boy, who reportedly used his own money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0008429812441343">Peterson, 2006</xref>: 24–25).</p>
<p>Our second example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0008429812441343">figure 9</xref>), known as “Sacrifice to the Genius Augusti, Altar of Vespasian,” is from Pompeii. According to Ryberg, it is an “Augustan type,” a Roman altar to the Lares and Genius Augusti, one of many similar examples that could be found in the courtyard of a temple in any number of Roman cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0008429812441343">Ryberg, 1955</xref>: 81, plate XXV, fig. 38a). Whether it was dedicated to the genius of a living emperor (Vespasian?) or to Augustus is a matter of some debate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0008429812441343">35</xref>
</sup> Of interest to us are the figures of the youth in profile, who plays the double flute, and the young <italic>camilla</italic> (a female sacrificial assistant) on the far left, who carries an <italic>urceus</italic> (a small pitcher) and a <italic>simpuvium</italic> (a libation bowl shaped like a ladle). According to Fless and Moede, later records suggest that cult flute playing at sacrifices was originally introduced during the Roman royal period (753–509 BCE), so that by the first century CE, its function may have been no more significant than announcing the beginning of the ritual by drowning out all other noises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441343">Fless and Moede, 2011</xref>: 258). Writing in the third century CE, Roman scholar Censorinus maintained that the purpose of flute players was to please the gods with their music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0008429812441343">Parker, 2007</xref>: 24–25).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0008429812441343">36</xref>
</sup> With regard to the small figure on the left, it is the style of her hair – tied back in a bun like the figure of the young girl on the <italic>Ara Pacis</italic> frieze above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0008429812441343">figure 3</xref>) – that suggests her identity as a female child.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0008429812441343">37</xref>
</sup> A <italic>mantele </italic>(cloth for the hand, considered as part of the <italic>instrumenta sacra</italic> or utensils of sacrifice) hangs around the figure’s neck.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0008429812441343">38</xref>
</sup> While Ryberg considers this figure to be a young male assistant and calls the coiffure “girlish,” the style does not conform to any statues or reliefs of boys discussed above in our identification criteria. While the pitcher and ladled libation bowl held by the figure may be used to refresh the wine used by the sacrificer, the presence of the <italic>mantele</italic> around the figure’s neck suggests that the contents of the pitcher could be water, used either as one of the libations or for the ritual washing of the priest’s hands.</p>
<p>In the final example for this category, we examine a small fresco that comes from the north wall in chamber A3, from the so-called “Crypt of the Sacraments” in the catacomb of Callixtus, the earliest Christian cemetery in Rome. Scholars generally agree that the date range of the earliest frescoes in this catacomb is around 200 CE, plus or minus 10–15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: 146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429812441343">Jensen, 2001</xref>:15). The fresco is part of a series of wall paintings which decorate a funerary chamber (walls and ceiling). Some scenes in the chamber are enclosed by painted frames, which may be intended to give the scene added significance. The scene shown in figure 10 occurs as one of three found on the middle register of images on the north wall of the chamber. Flanking the three scenes are figures of a standing <italic>fossor</italic> (grave digger), who faces front and holds a pick. The <italic>fossor </italic>on the viewer’s left gestures towards the three scenes with his left hand while the <italic>fossor </italic>on the right gestures towards the same three scenes with his right hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: figs 6.30, 6.43, 6.44). The three center scenes on the north wall (from the viewer’s left to right) are: the scene shown in figure 10; a scene of seven banqueters reclining on a sigma or <italic>stibadium</italic> couch; and a scene which is probably meant to represent the sacrifice of Isaac. In this representation, Isaac is shown as a small child standing beside his much taller father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: fig. 6.48). Both figures have their arms raised in the same gesture as the female figure below (see figure 10). Figures of a fisherman, a child baptizand, and his baptizer occur within a painted frame on the middle register of the adjacent west wall in the same funerary chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: fig. 6.50). To the immediate right of the baptism scene is a single standing figure carrying a four-legged pallet (bed).</p>
<p>The scene in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0008429812441343">figure 10</xref> is the only fresco of its type to survive in early Christian art. As such, its interpretation has puzzled scholars since the catacomb of Callixtus was rediscovered in the nineteenth century by Giovanni Battista de Rossi. Most scholars agree that a male and female figure flank a tripod table with food on its surface (bread and fish?). Finney is unsure of the identity of the figures but states that the scene represents the cultic display of bread and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: 216). Jensen reads the figures from left to right as “... Jesus performing the miracle of loaves and fishes, a veiled orante” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008429812441343">Jensen, 2011</xref>: 15). Given the representations of Isaac and a baptizand as small children in this particular funerary chamber, as well as the presence of smaller <italic>loculi </italic>(graves cut from <italic>tufa</italic>), I suggest that the two figures in this scene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0008429812441343">figure 10</xref>) are both children. Their round faces and lack of muscle tone suggest their young age. Even Finney refers to the female figure’s arms in the fresco as “stubby” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: 214). Further, a comparison of the girl figure in the fresco with the girl figure from the baked clay group depicting the girl–boy pair of musicians (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0008429812441343">figure 1</xref> above) shows some iconographical similarities. The round face, collar, the A-line fold in the tunic, and foot stance are all suggestively similar. Like the girl in the clay group, the female figure in the fresco stands in a <italic>contrapposto</italic> position and wears a short-sleeved tunic with vertical folds on the front and a round, bordered neckline. The girl in the clay group plays a lyre while the female figure in the fresco raises her arms in a possible prayer or song position. The male figure, on the other hand (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0008429812441343">figure 10</xref>), is almost the same height as the female figure, suggesting that he too is a child, given that the girl–boy pair in the clay group are approximately the same height. Perhaps, given that his right hand is held over the food in a blessing gesture, the male figure is a representation of a child lector whose sacred duties, later sacramentaries inform us, were “to bless the bread and new fruits brought by the congregation as offerings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0008429812441343">Wiedemann, 1989</xref>: 186–187). If these two figures are indeed children, then the absence of a priest is telling. It announces to the viewer that the scene is not a Roman sacrifice. Even though there is the presence of a tripod table with an offering, there is no <italic>togatus capite velato</italic> and <italic>tibicen </italic>– “... the most basic, universally valid image of ritual action” in Roman art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441343">Fless and Moede, 2011</xref>: 258). When read together, the three scenes on the middle register of the wall in the catacomb of Callixtus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0008429812441343">figure 10</xref>, the banquet scene with seven figures, and the Abraham–Isaac scene showing Isaac as a young child safe from sacrifice) could represent an anti-pagan polemic through the demonstration of the positive participation of children in early Christian rites, especially those related to offerings, funerary banquets and sacrifice. Such scenes may have served to mitigate charges, made by second-century Christian detractors, of infant cannibalism and the corruption of child novices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441343">Benko, 1984</xref>: 55–56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008429812441343">Macdonald, 1996</xref>: 59–67, 110–111, 119–120) especially since, according to John Scheid, “... Roman sacrifice was, to ancient eyes, first and foremost, a banquet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008429812441343">Scheid, 2011</xref>: 270).</p>

<sec id="section4-0008429812441343">
<title>Banquets</title>
<p>Ritual banquets were a common practice in the Roman empire and took place during religious festivals, imperial <italic>feriae</italic>, family birthdays, weddings, funerals and anniversaries. Even the domestic daily meal included a ritual performed by a child, which took place at the beginning or just after the first course of the meal. A propitiation to Vesta and other gods (Lares and Penates) consisting of incense and wine along with a part of the banquet was offered at the family hearth. The remaining banqueters had to wait for the pronouncement of the gods’ satisfaction with the sacrifice before continuing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008429812441343">Prescendi, 2010</xref>: 85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008429812441343">Scheid, 2011</xref>: 268). Proclamations of the host’s hospitality through offering a share of the banquet to non-family members, especially the god they wished to thank, was a key element of Roman sacrificial banquets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008429812441343">Scheid, 2011</xref>: 268). According to Scheid, “a sacrifice was a banquet, which offered men the opportunity to become familiar with their divine counterparts, to define their respective qualities and status, and, together, to address the matters in hand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008429812441343">Scheid, 2011</xref>: 270). As such, Roman formal dinners had very special seating arrangements according to one’s rank or social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441343">Dunbabin, 2003</xref>: fig. 21). As mentioned above, the placement of children as participants in Roman banquet scenes is typically at the end of a couch or cushion. However, it is just as likely that the viewer will find children represented in front of the banqueting couch as slaves cleaning up after an overzealous banquet participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441343">Clarke, 2003</xref>: plate 21) or as participants invited to share in the sacrificial meal (see Clarke – same image).</p>
<p>Like their Roman counterparts, hospitality and the sharing of food were of equal importance to early Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0008429812441343">Smith, 2003</xref>: 244–245; Osiek and MacDonald, 2006: 31–32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0008429812441343">Tulloch, 2006</xref>: 191–192). It was certainly part of Mediterranean table hospitality to fête strangers. As well, the care of widows and orphans was part of a Christian’s duty towards believers in accordance with the ethical duties outlined in some early Christian texts (James 1:27; Herm. <italic>Man.</italic> 8.10; Barn. 20.2; Ign. <italic>Smyrn</italic>. 6.2; Herm. <italic>Vis.</italic> 2.4.3),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0008429812441343">39</xref>
</sup> and so it was an ethical priority in early Christian communities (Osiek and MacDonald, 2006: 75). How this priority might have been rendered in early Christian art is the subject of some debate. Some scholars have suggested that the baskets of bread visible in the earliest banquet scenes from the Roman catacombs of Callixtus and Priscilla refer to the charitable donations that typically accompanied Roman funerary banquets, a practice that was continued by early Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441343">Dunbabin, 2003</xref>: 177 n8 and n9). There are few Roman pagan funerary scenes, however, that depict this donation in art, with which we can compare.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0008429812441343">40</xref>
</sup> If early Christian banqueters did continue this tradition, and there is no reason to think that they didn’t, they may have chosen to represent the charitable distribution of food as part of a funerary banquet scene. In this way the household who owned the funerary chamber were able to communicate to others that they had fulfilled their ethical duties as laid down in early Christian texts. Earlier commentators have interpreted these earliest banquet scenes in various ways, including as an illustration of the Multiplication of Loaves and Fishes story from the New Testament or as an illustration of the Eucharist or Christian <italic>agape</italic>. Finney views these scenes, first and foremost, as funerary banquets, given their funereal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441343">Finney, 1994</xref>: 203). With regard to these early Christian scenes in Callixtus and Priscilla, Dunbabin notes the absence of slaves bearing food and drink as well as “a greater sense of decorum and sobriety ... than in many comparable scenes. The baskets full of loaves are also an exceptional feature, whose prominence suggests they were intended to bear particular significance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441343">Dunbabin, 2003</xref>: figs. 102–103, 176–177). In the catacomb of Priscilla, a famous banquet scene known as “Fractio Panis” (the breaking of the bread) shows seven figures flanked by seven baskets of bread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0008429812441343">figure 12a</xref>). Two pieces of evidence suggest that the figure on the viewer’s far left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0008429812441343">figure 12b</xref>), whose legs drape over the cushion, is a youth and not a priest who presides at the banquet. The first is the number of similar extant banquet scenes which show youthful figures casually reclining on the ends of cushions, as discussed in the section above on identification of children. As we have seen, in informal banquets, children may have perched on the edges of couches, or reclined at the ends of sigma cushions if they were youths. When one examines the figure known as “the presider” on the viewer’s far left, the diminutive size of the figure along with its posture, balanced on the edge of a cushion, suggests a youth of about ten years of age. The figure extends a plate to the banqueters, the contents of which are now unclear but were read by earlier interpreters as bread. In the context of the Roman visual genre of banquets, the identity of the figure at the end of a cushion as a youth is not uncommon. The second piece of evidence which suggests the figure may be a youth is the New Testament instruction to early Christians to care for widows and orphans. Perhaps in this banquet scene, the deceased, who was once buried near the fresco, is visually attesting her care of this group by showing women and a youth as the participants who enjoy a banquet as part of her patronage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0008429812441343">41</xref>
</sup> The deceased or her heirs may be further illustrating her support of the early Christian community who congregated around the catacomb of Priscilla, through the visual reference to the baskets of bread that are to be distributed, flanking the banqueters.</p>

<title>Early Christian Art and the Role of Children in Early Christian Ritual Practice</title>
<p>The question of correlation between the visual representation of a subject, in this case the role of children in ancient religious ritual, and actual religious practice is admittedly a problematic one. In the case of Roman religions, there are at least a number of contemporary texts with which to test and compare scholars’ hypotheses about children in ritual art. It must be kept in mind, however, that both images and texts are “edited documents” of a historical reality that, at best, can only be partially recovered. In the above discussion, all three questionable figures in scenes of early Christian art share the visual genre of “offering,” closely associated with a representation of a funerary “banquet” scene, in common. Unfortunately, we have no early Christian texts that can help clarify the identity of the figures in question as children. Even if we could confirm this identity, we are confronted with interpreting the function of these figures within the unstable visual conventions of a nascent religion struggling to express its identity.</p>
<p>Perhaps what we can say is that if these figures are indeed children or even youths, we have found a visual pattern of religious practice involving children and offerings not visible in early Christian texts. Without the availability of the dominant Roman culture’s representations of children in processions, offerings/sacrifices, and banquets, with which to compare our images, this pattern would not have been visible.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The above analysis of representations of children participating in three categories of Roman ritual has sensitized us to the difficulties of identifying children in ritual scenes, whether Roman pagan or early Christian. Beyond identification, there is the question of how much historical authenticity can be read into a work of ancient art, even those works which appear to be “documentary.” Through a comparison with images in each of the three categories of Roman art: processions, offerings/sacrifices, and banquets, it might be possible to identify child figures in similar early Christian scenes. If the interpretation of questionable figures as children in the above discussion of early Christian examples is correct, then some important differences between Roman and early Christian scenes can be determined among the categories. Within the category of offerings/sacrifices, we find the absence of a priest and musician in the early Christian scene interpreted here as two children presiding over or blessing an offering. It is interesting to speculate that the continuation of this scene without the priest (or musician) was a visual strategy used by early Christians for identifying offering scenes as Christian gifts or donations and not as a pagan sacrifice. The use of a youth in presenting a plate of bread to banqueters (as in the scene from the catacomb of Priscilla) or to visitors to household tombs (as in the fresco from the catacomb of Saints Marcellino and Pietro) may be an early Christian visual expression of the practice of hospitality; within the category of banquets, the absence of slaves and the addition of baskets in the earliest Christian banquet scenes may show a household’s commitment to the care of community and children in accordance with the ethical duties outlined in some early Christian texts.<sup>

</sup> Finally, within Roman art the child assistant (<italic>camillus </italic>and <italic>camilla</italic>) to the veiled priest was a familiar figure in sacrifice scenes from the imperial period. That our questionable figures in scenes of early Christian art related to the visual genres of offerings and banquets might be children does not appear to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Penelope Davies has suggested that the spiral direction of the frieze on Trajan’s column, which was added when it became the emperor’s mausoleum during Hadrian’s reign, dictated a ritual direction which viewers were expected to follow. As such, the route taken by the viewer re-enacted the funerary rite of circumambulation through the movement of a circular procession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429812441343">Davies, 1997</xref>: 52–59).</p>

<p>For the history of this argumentation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0008429812441343">Stern (1981</xref>: 440–441). As his source for this date Stern refers to the calendar of Filocalus, a 4th-century Christian, as documented by A. Degrassi, <italic>Inscriptiones Italiae XIII, ii, Fasti Anni Numani et Iuliani</italic>, 1963: 508. However, Pierre Brind’Amour states that Degrassi’s table is not useful from a chronological point of view since the table refers to the same festivals with varying dates, especially under the Republican calendar. See <italic>Le calendrier romain: Recherches chronologiques</italic> (1983: 342–343). On p. 441 of Stern’s article he conflates the (second) <italic>Vinalia</italic>, the festival of wine, “<italic>au mois de septembre</italic>.” Other sources, however, clearly date the second <italic>Vinalia</italic> to 19 August. See, for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0008429812441343">Scullard (1981</xref>: 177, 263); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008429812441343">Brind’Amour (1983</xref>: 228–229); and D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429812441343">Feeney (2007</xref>: 199–200, 296 n146).</p>

<p>I concur with Stern that the two remaining frescoes probably do represent a calendar of sorts – but one that marks the important festivals in the Roman sacred year, not necessarily distinct months. Whether or not they fell on separate months does not seem important to the patron. There are no inscriptions giving the name of the month as in Stern’s other examples of calendars. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0008429812441343">Stern (1981</xref>: plates 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 29, 30, 36 and 38).</p>

<p>Stern argues against the August 19th date for the festival on the basis of the representation of mature grapes that hang from the poles in the fresco – a very literal interpretation of the scene. He does this in order to make the frescoes fit his argument that they represent a calendar showing distinct months, rather than a series of festivals important in the Roman (sacred) year, which may or may not have marked distinct months. Further, on the difference between a vintage festival date and the actual harvest, Feeney quotes Suetonius who wrote: “the harvest festivals did not coincide with the summer nor the vintage festivals with the autumn” (Suet. <italic>Jul.</italic> 40.I).</p>

<p>Creating favorable conditions for success through ritual is central to Roman religious practices. As for other festivals related to the harvest, Bernstein suggests that the <italic>ludi Florales </italic>celebrated in May (Ovid, <italic>Fasti</italic> 5.295–330) was to ward off a bad harvest and pestilence.

<p>According to Judith Grubbs, early Christians generally followed local pagan wedding rites but omitted customs involving sacrifice. While some weddings were blessed by a priest, there was no required church ceremony until the Middle Ages. See Judith Evans Grubbs, “‘Pagan’ and ‘Christian’ marriage: The state of the question,” <italic>Journal of Early Christian Studies</italic> 2(4) (1994): 389.  As for wedding processions as part of first- and second-century Jewish weddings, Susan Marks argues that there is “little evidence of involvement in wedding ritual in Tannaitic sources.” What there is shows evidence of compromise in wedding rites, perhaps based on a vision of an imminent eschaton, where some rabbis forbade wedding litters whereas other rabbis allowed them. See Susan Marks, “History vs. ritual in time and end-time: The case of early Rabbinic weddings in light of Catherine Bell,” <italic>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</italic> 79(3) (2011): 587–613. Deborah Green states that for Jewish funerals in Palestine in the Roman period, the body was carried on a bed “in a funeral procession from the home of the deceased through the community to the outskirts of town and then to the burial site. During the procession, stops might be made for the hired wailers, often women, to sing or lament and clap their hands loudly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429812441343">Green, 2008</xref>: 159).</p>

<p>Barker suggests that pilgrims started from the north near the Via Flaminia and passed from shrine to shrine around Rome in a clockwise direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812441343">Barker, 1913</xref>: 19). The earliest Christian martyrology occurs in section XII of the Codex-Calendar of 354 CE also known as the Filocalian calendar. Appended to the Roman calendar was a “Depositio Martyrum” listing the anniversaries of martyrs by month and cemetery location. Such lists served as pilgrims’ itineraries in locating martyrs’ shrines. With some exceptions, the “Depositio Martyrum” provides names and locations of locally known martyrs from the Roman area.

According to Guyon, there were five renovations made to the chamber where the two saints were buried, throughout the fourth century, the first occurring sometime around 315 CE and the final expansion taking place around 400 CE. The erection of an above-ground funerary basilica sometime during the papacy of Bishop Sylvester (314–335 CE) was also for the purpose of accommodating the overflow of pilgrims to the martyrs’ tombs.</p>

<p>We know from an early 5th-century hymn by Prudentius, who visited the shrine of Hippolytus in Rome, that the site contained an altar which had been set by the saint’s body and both provided sustenance that “feeds the dwellers on Tiber’s banks with the holy food” and, from the point of view of Prudentius, guarded the martyr. See Prudentius II, “Crowns of Martyrs,” XI, 317. Gabriel Bertonière understands this passage as meaning that the relics of the saint were kept in an altar also used for the Eucharist.

<p>The <italic>mantele</italic> around the young figure’s neck is suggestive of an early Christian scene painted above the entrance of chamber 14 in the catacomb of SS Marcellino and Pietro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441343">Deckers et al., 1987</xref>: plate 8a). The fragment may have at one time been part of a larger banquet scene (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441343">Deckers et al., 1987</xref>: plate 7a), suggesting a relationship, among the figures, to food or liquids as offerings or gifts. The fragment shows a girl standing barefoot wearing a long tunic with <italic>clavi</italic> (stripes) on the front and sleeves. Around her neck is a <italic>mantele</italic>, which she grasps with one hand while with the other she reaches toward the tunic of the adult female figure standing beside her. According to the remainder of the scene, which exists only as a drawing, the girl and the adult female stand some distance on the viewer’s left, apart from the couple who are the banquet scene’s two participants. A servant brings food while another female figure looks on from the viewer’s right.</p>

<p>On the interpretation of this banquet scene, see Nicola Denzey, <italic>The Bone Gatherers: The Lost Worlds of Early Christian Women.</italic> Boston: Beacon Press, 2007, 91–100. Denzey interprets the small figure as a slave (p. 99).</p>

<p>In the ancient world, there were a number of important people who reclined at the meal, including a host and at least one guest of honor. Places were assigned according to rank and status. Children may have perched on the edges of furniture or on small masonry shelves built into outdoor couches like the type we see at Isola Sacra. How much this system of social ranking at meals was changed by early Christians is not clear. Other scholars, myself included, have argued that at sigma meals, the guest of honor was shifted to the center of the couch. The presider or host was then relocated to the right end of the sigma formation where he or she could give directions to those serving the food. Carolyn Osiek and Margaret Y. MacDonald argue that, in the 1st and 2nd century of early Christianity, one of the criticisms leveled at Christians had to do with the indiscriminate mixing of both sexes and social ranks with regard to reclining arrangements at official gatherings. See Osiek and MacDonald (2006:11).</p>
