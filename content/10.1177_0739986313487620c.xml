<p>“For the first time in its history, it was forced into the role of country of first asylum for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing repressive conditions” (p. 46).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on the immigration policies focusing on undocumented “aliens” entering the United States, people may think this quotation describes the United States’ first experience with immigrants and refugees. However, the excerpt actually describes Mexico, known traditionally as an emigrant-producing nation, but less known for its accommodation of exiles and immigrants from all over the world. In <italic>Seeking Refuge: Central American Migration to Mexico, the United States, and Canada</italic>, Maria Cristina Garcia analyzes how these three countries each handled the influx of immigrants and refugees as a result of political wars and upheavals in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In my review, I will discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of the book and conclude by applying Garcia’s research to today’s current national security debate.</p>
<p>In <italic>Seeking Refuge</italic>, Garcia excellently highlights the important role that churches, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and refugee advocacy groups played in impacting immigration, refugee, and asylum policies in all three countries. For example, Garcia discusses how in 1980, the Canadian government, pressured by NGOs, supported legislation that “condemned human rights abuses in El Salvador and called upon all governments to refrain from providing military assistance” (p. 126). In addition, in Mexico and the United States, there were international, national, and grassroots organizations that advocated on behalf of refugees and aided refugees through volunteers or financial and material contributions.</p>
<p>Across all three countries, the most active of these groups was the church. In Mexico, clergy, nuns, and lay church workers organized networks of parishioners and volunteers to provide refugees with medical care, food, and clothing. In Canada, church groups played a central role in scrutinizing and challenging policies by “publishing information on military maneuvers, death squad activities, human rights abuses, refugees, and displaced persons” (p. 148). And finally, in the United Sates, there were individual churches that transported refugees across the U.S.–Canada border, hid them in safe houses, and secured legal and material assistance for them. By illustrating how churches, NGOs, and advocacy groups assisted immigrants and refugees, Garcia drives home the idea that legislation couldn’t have been enacted had such groups not pushed for policy reform, essentially providing a voice for immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>Garcia also illustrates how pressure from neighboring countries influenced the policies across borders. For example, she details how the United States pressured Mexico to strengthen immigration and deportation policies and “firmly commit to the detention and expulsion of undocumented workers” (p. 69). Furthermore, the Mexican government received a lot of pressure from the Reagan and Bush administrations to step up the control of its southern border “to stem the flow of undocumented Central Americans who transited through Mexico” (p. 158).</p>
<p>Garcia also details the influence the United States had on Canadian policy. Originally, the United States’ strict policy pushed Canada to do what was <italic>ethically right</italic> (p. 137) because the United States was doing what was ethically wrong. However, once a new regime ascended to power, Canada shifted toward stricter immigration and refugee policy because of what advocates blamed on the government’s “close ties to the Reagan administration and its desire to fall more in line with U.S. policy in Central America” (p. 137). However, the one positive that came from their interaction, Garcia argues, was increased cooperation regarding immigration matters among the North American countries. For example, migration experts from Central and North America met several times over the next decade to “discuss issues of mutual concern, including the root causes of migration, the trafficking of immigrants, the protection of human rights, and the accommodation and repatriation of refugees” (p. 167). However, when reflecting on the current state of immigration and refugee policy, there is still much work to do.</p>
<p>The one challenge I pose to Maria Cristina Garcia after reading her book is a recommendation of what solution(s) is available for immigration and refugee policy in Mexico, the United States, and Canada. I think she does a great job of identifying past and current problems in these countries (e.g., human rights violations, violence from authorities, unlawful behavior, etc.), but she fails to offer what can be done in the future to prevent these past wrongs from reoccurring. She concludes her research by elaborating on immigration policy today, but as a reader I leave the book without an idea of what should or can be done to better the lives of immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>Garcia’s book <italic>Seeking Refuge: Central American Migration to Mexico, the United States, and Canada</italic> emphasizes the larger issue of foreigners entering the three largest countries in North America. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the United States, as well as Mexico and Canada, “revamped their immigration bureaucracies, increased security personnel at airports and border checkpoints, and enacted new—and highly controversial—detention and deportation procedures” (p. 161). For example, the USA-PATRIOT act gave law enforcement agencies the power to “search, monitor, and detain suspected criminals and terrorists; allowed the indefinite detention of noncitizens suspected of a crime; and facilitated their deportation for a number of activities” (p. 161). However, with the act, the United States inaccurately equates immigrants with terrorists. While these stricter immigration measures may momentarily decrease the number of immigrants and refugees entering the United States, sooner or later, new points of entry, transportation networks, and legal loopholes will be discovered (p. 167). Furthermore, she argues that rather than more restrictive immigration measures, the goal of these three countries “should be to create and reinforce procedural safeguards that respect the safety and human rights of migrants” (p. 168). Regrettably, especially since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, strengthening public confidence in the elusive goal of national security has become more important to the United States than treating refugees humanely and benevolently, something that will hopefully change in the near future.</p>
