<p>Each year <italic>Research on Aging</italic> receives more manuscripts than can be published in the allotted 768 pages. As Editor in Chief it is my responsibility to make the final decision. I thought it would be helpful to outline the many considerations that go into the process.</p>
<p>Following an initial screening, each manuscript is assigned to three peer reviewers; an attempt is made to match professional expertise and experience with the aims of the paper and methodology utilized. The reviewers provide the majority of the feedback, reviewing for theoretical context, scientific rigor, and significance. This process provides an author detailed feedback and provides the Editor in Chief with a recommendation for publication. When reviewers agree on a recommendation for publication, revision, or not to publish, the decision is clear; however, when there is a difference in opinion, the Editor in Chief must decide the fate of the paper. The individual peer-reviews, journal priorities, and guidelines for publication play an important role in the final decision.</p>
<p>The most common reason for rejection of manuscripts involves submission of poorly written papers. When English is not the first language of the author(s), and there are problems in verb tense and spelling, upon initial review these papers are returned to the author including advice to resubmit after editing by a person skilled in the proper use of English. Papers that are not well written are difficult for reviewers, they detract from the main focus and science of the paper, and often the aims and purposes are not clear.</p>
<p>A lack of a strong theoretical foundation justifying the methods and variables in the research is another common problem. Ideally, a specific theoretical perspective drives the hypothesis or research question and leads to the methodology, selected variables, and operational definitions. Without such a framework, the rationale for the research approach is not clear and thus not justified.</p>
<p>Given the competitive nature of papers with solid scientific approaches, it is also very important that authors clearly articulate the significance or innovative nature of the research. The paper should clearly outline why the study is important and what it adds to science. After reading the paper, the reader should be able to clearly understand why this problem and research is important. And furthermore, the most scientifically sound research is not valuable if it is not answering a significant research question.</p>
<p>Finally, given the page limitation per issue, the Editor in Chief must prioritize the selection of papers to be published. The journal receives nearly 150 papers each year, requiring even the most well-written and scientifically sound papers to compete against one another for a place in the journal. In the end, the Editor in Chief must compare all the reviewed manuscripts on their significance to gerontology, the interest of the research topic for journal readers, and the innovative nature of the approach. For <italic>Research on Aging</italic>, the highest priority for publication is research that adds to evidence for various approaches to working with older adults or intervention research improving the lives of this population. Additionally, systematic reviews of existing evidence to demonstrate best practices or applied social research contributing to the understanding of problems in this population is also viewed as valuable. Finally, reporting of innovations in methodological approaches or unique findings that demonstrate the need for additional research is valued.</p>
<p>As submissions continue to increase each year, the decision on studies that are most worthy of publication becomes more difficult. Authors can increase their chances for success by careful consideration of the remarks presented here. <italic>Research on Aging</italic> welcomes your research and our reviewers look forward to providing helpful feedback. The goal is to advance gerontological research while at the same time enriching the professional careers of those committed to it.</p>
