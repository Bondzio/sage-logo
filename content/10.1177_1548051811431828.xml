<abstract>
<p>The present study extended previous research on fun in the workplace by examining the influence of workplace fun in the context of applicant attraction. Specifically, this research examined the impact of workplace fun relative to other key predictors of applicant attraction. Furthermore, this research examined the impact of different sources of workplace fun—fun coworker interactions, fun job responsibilities, and formal fun activities. With a sample of collegiate job seekers, the results demonstrated that workplace fun was a stronger predictor of applicant attraction than compensation and opportunities for advancement. Moreover, the results demonstrated that fun coworker interactions and fun job responsibilities were stronger predictors of applicant attraction than formal fun activities.</p>

<p>In today’s competitive business environment, organizations continue to emphasize the deployment of human capital as a key source of competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811431828">Ployhart &amp; Moliterno, 2011</xref>). As a fundamental first step toward ensuring a productive workforce, attracting high-quality applicants is important. In the absence of a highly qualified applicant pool from which to select potential employees, job vacancies may be left unfilled, selection standards may be compromised, more time and resources may need to be allocated toward training, and job and organizational performance may ultimately suffer. Conversely, drawing from a highly qualified applicant pool provides the foundation for an effective human resource management system and effective organizational performance. As such, it is important for organizations to find ways to attract the best and the brightest applicants in hopes of winning the war for talent.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that individuals largely make job choice decisions based on their perceptions of job and vacancy characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051811431828">Behling, Labovitz, &amp; Gainer, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811431828">Chapman, Uggerslev, Carroll, Piasentin, &amp; Jones, 2005</xref>). These perceptions may relate to the specific job or the organization as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811431828">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811431828">Chapman et al. (2005)</xref> demonstrated that compensation, opportunities for advancement, the type of work, the work environment, and organizational image were among the strongest predictors in their meta-analysis on the antecedents of applicant attraction to jobs and organizations.</p>
<p>One underresearched job and organizational characteristic that may have a significant impact on applicant attraction is workplace fun. Workplace fun generally refers to “any social, interpersonal, or task activities at work of a playful or humorous nature which provide an individual with amusement, enjoyment, or pleasure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811431828">Fluegge, 2008</xref>, p. 5). A growing body of empirical research has demonstrated that workplace fun may have positive outcomes for organizations, yet research on workplace fun in a recruiting context has been limited. Perceptions of workplace fun may be particularly important with respect to applicant attraction as individuals may not want “all work and no play” and seek intrinsic satisfaction in addition to tangible rewards through their work. As such, individuals’ perceptions of workplace fun represent a potentially strong predictor of applicant attraction.</p>
<p>The goals of the present study are twofold. The first goal is to examine the impact of workplace fun relative to other key predictors of applicant attraction. The second goal is to examine the impact of different sources of workplace fun on applicant attraction. Workplace fun is a multifaceted construct, and some aspects of fun may have a stronger impact on applicant attraction than others. Specifically, this research will assess the impact of fun coworker interactions, fun job responsibilities, and formal fun activities. These issues will be examined with a sample of collegiate job seekers, mostly Millennials, who may particularly value fun when making job choice decisions. The results from this study will help validate the importance of fun in the workplace in a recruiting context and provide guidance for marketing job vacancies to prospective employees.</p>
<sec id="section1-1548051811431828">
<title>Research on Workplace Fun</title>
<p>Fun in the workplace has long been promoted as a key mechanism for enhancing organizational effectiveness. The roots of the modern workplace fun movement can be found in the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051811431828">Peters and Waterman (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051811431828">Deal and Kennedy (1982)</xref>, who encouraged managers to develop corporate cultures that promoted play, humor, and fun. More recently, in popular press publications the philosophy of fun at work has been promoted widely as a key ingredient for energized and productive work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051811431828">Lundin, Paul, &amp; Christensen, 2000</xref>). In fact, a number of organizations, such as Pike Place Fish Market, Google, IBM, and Southwest Airlines, have incorporated fun into their corporate cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811431828">Collinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811431828">Karl, Peluchette, Hall, &amp; Harland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051811431828">Sunoo, 1995</xref>). It has been argued that fun may affect a host of favorable organizational outcomes, such as higher job satisfaction, employee morale, pride in work, creativity, customer service, and retention, as well as reduced tardiness, absenteeism, anxiety, and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051811431828">Abner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051811431828">Abramis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051811431828">Lundin et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A small but growing body of empirical research provides support for the popular claim that fun has positive outcomes for organizations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811431828">McDowell (2004)</xref> provided evidence that fun is positively related to job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment and negatively related to turnover intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051811431828">Karl and Peluchette (2006a)</xref> found that fun was positively related to job satisfaction and negatively related to emotional exhaustion. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051811431828">Karl, Peluchette, and Harland (2007)</xref> demonstrated that fun was positively related to job satisfaction, as well as negatively related to emotional exhaustion and emotional dissonance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811431828">Karl and Peluchette (2006b)</xref> found that fun was positively related to job satisfaction and employees’ perceptions of customer service quality, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811431828">Karl, Peluchette, and Hall (2008)</xref> demonstrated that fun was positively related to job satisfaction and negatively related to turnover intentions. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811431828">Fluegge (2008)</xref> found that fun was positively related to work engagement, positive affect, task performance, creative performance, and organizational citizenship behavior.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811431828">Karl et al.’s (2008)</xref> research represents the one extant study that discussed workplace fun in a recruiting context. Karl et al. had the volunteers in their study rank order the importance of various job and organizational characteristics. The authors argued that the resulting rankings could be used to determine how best to market volunteer opportunities to individuals. Of the 10 items that were ranked, “interesting work” and “helping others” were the two most highly rated items. However, “a fun workplace” was the second to last lowest rated item. Furthermore, “the opportunity to socialize,” which can be subsumed within the workplace fun construct, was the lowest rated item. Despite the low ranking for fun, Karl et al. argued that fun could still be used to attract individuals to volunteer opportunities. One possible reason noted by the authors is that self-report ratings are susceptible to social desirability bias. As such, the volunteers may have underestimated the importance of fun in volunteer activities. Furthermore, fun may be more important in less altruistic organizational contexts as compared with a volunteer environment.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Given that fun has been demonstrated to affect other favorable workplace outcomes, fun likely has a positive impact on applicant attraction to jobs and organizations. That said, research is necessary to empirically assess the impact of perceptions of workplace fun in an applicant attraction context. Research is also necessary to determine what aspects of fun most strongly affect applicant attraction. Thus, in addition to examining the impact of fun in general, the present study will examine the relative impact of three aspects of workplace fun—fun coworker interactions, fun job responsibilities, and formal fun activities.</p>
<p>The environment processing and interactionalist models are two dominant metatheories of applicant attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811431828">Ehrhart &amp; Ziegert, 2005</xref>) that can be used to explain the potential influence of workplace fun on applicant attraction. According to the environment processing perspective, applicants search for information about various characteristics about the work environment (e.g., organizational policies, coworker characteristics, and benefits) throughout the recruiting process. They then use such perceptions of the work environment as signals to determine how well they believe they will fit with the organization and make job choice decisions accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051811431828">Turban, 2001</xref>). Similarly, the interactionist perspective suggests that applicants are attracted to organizations when they perceive a fit between their needs and values and those espoused by the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051811431828">Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). The interactionist perspective is founded in the similarity-attraction paradigm, which suggests that applicants are more attracted to organizations when specific organizational characteristics match their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051811431828">Schneider, Goldstein, &amp; Smith, 1995</xref>). As such, the applicants are more attracted to an organization when it provides something important that the applicant wants or needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811431828">Ehrhart &amp; Ziegert, 2005</xref>). The common element between these two perspectives is that individuals seek out work environments where they perceive the best fit.</p>
<p>Workplace fun may meet individuals’ needs and values in several respects, and therefore, perceptions of workplace fun may have a significant impact on applicant attraction. Certainly one of the primary reasons why individuals work is for the compensation and benefits that a paycheck provides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051811431828">Williams, McDaniel, &amp; Nguyen, 2006</xref>). That said, individuals work for more than just a paycheck and seek intrinsic satisfaction, enjoyment in their work, and quality relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811431828">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, perceptions of workplace fun may affect applicant attraction given the large portion of time individuals spend on the job. Given the vast amount of time spent on the job, clearly individuals would prefer the experience to be enjoyable and to “have fun.” Fun may be particularly relevant during difficult economic times such as these, where employees are being asked to do more for less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051811431828">White, 2008</xref>). Similarly, given the significant amount of stress often experienced by individuals in today’s workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051811431828">Podsakoff, LePine, &amp; LePine, 2007</xref>), perceptions of workplace fun may signal a higher quality of work life and thus enhance applicant attraction during the recruiting process.</p>
<p>Workplace fun may be particularly important for younger job seekers, the job seekers that are the focus of the present study. In one respect, workplace fun may be important for younger job seekers in general. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811431828">Erikson’s (1968)</xref> lifespan theory suggests that young adults particularly value the development of friendships and socialization as they establish their adult identities. The workplace may provide younger individuals with sources of friendship and socialization. Thus, to the extent that friendships and socialization can be construed as workplace fun, fun may be particularly important for younger job seekers. Moreover, workplace fun may be particularly important for younger workers today, namely, the Millennials, the generational cohort of those individuals born in 1980 onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051811431828">Parker &amp; Chusmir, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051811431828">Wey Smola &amp; Sutton, 2002</xref>). Such individuals grew up in a period of relative prosperity, have experienced relatively comfortable lifestyles, and were raised by highly involved parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811431828">Raines, 2003</xref>). In the workplace, the Millennials desire a work–life balance that will allow them to balance play with work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051811431828">Carless &amp; Wintle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811431828">Cennamo &amp; Gardner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051811431828">Loughlin &amp; Barling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051811431828">Wey Smola &amp; Sutton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811431828">Zemke, Raines, &amp; Filipczak., 1999</xref>), and they value close personal relationships over a career per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811431828">Raines, 2003</xref>). It has been argued that the Millennials prefer work environments that emphasize freedom, status, and social involvement, and they may be prepared to leave the organization if these needs are not met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051811431828">Crumpacker &amp; Crumpacker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811431828">Dries, Pepermans, &amp; De Kerpel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051811431828">Loughlin &amp; Barling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051811431828">Wey Smola &amp; Sutton, 2002</xref>). As such, workplace fun may be particularly important to younger job seekers with respect to attraction to jobs and organizations.</p>
<p>Based on the arguments above, two hypotheses are proposed. First, workplace fun will have a positive impact on applicant attraction. Second, workplace fun will have a stronger impact on applicant attraction than other key predictors of applicant attraction, namely, compensation and opportunities for advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811431828">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>). Although compensation and opportunities for advancement likely influence applicant attraction, workplace fun is argued to have a stronger impact given the high priority placed on fun among Millennials.</p>

</list>
<p>Heretofore, fun has been discussed in general terms. It should be emphasized, however, that fun is a multidimensional construct that has been operationalized differently across studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051811431828">Ford, McLaughlin, and Newstrom (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811431828">Karl et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811431828">Karl et al. (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051811431828">Peluchette and Karl (2005)</xref> focused on <italic>formal fun activities</italic>, such as contests, gift exchanges, games, awards, sharing food and refreshments, and company-wide outings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051811431828">Karl and Peluchette (2006a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811431828">Karl and Peluchette (2006b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051811431828">Karl et al. (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051811431828">Peluchette and Karl (2005)</xref> focused on <italic>experienced fun</italic>, which reflects whether individuals actually experience fun on the job. Sample items from the scale used in these studies include “This is a fun place to work” and “We laugh a lot at my workplace.” Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811431828">Fluegge (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811431828">McDowell (2004)</xref> conceptualized fun as a multidimensional construct, encompassing <italic>socializing, celebrating, personal freedoms</italic>, and <italic>global fun</italic>. Socializing reflects fun interactions with others at work, celebrating includes formal fun activities, personal freedoms represent freedom to have fun on the job, and global fun reflects whether the workplace in general is a fun place to work. It should be noted that while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811431828">Fluegge (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811431828">McDowell (2004)</xref> conceptualized fun as encompassing different dimensions, the dimensions were aggregated into an overall construct in their studies.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the validity of previous research and focusing on fun as an aggregate construct, we contend it is necessary to examine the impact of different aspects of fun on applicant attraction. Focusing on different aspects of fun will help delineate what matters most for applicants. Three aspects of workplace fun will serve as the focus of the present study—formal fun activities, fun coworker interactions, and fun–job responsibilities. Formal fun activities include parties and picnics, theme days at work, and company outings. Such activities have been a common focus of popularized accounts of fun at work and several empirical investigations. Because coworkers are central to most employees’ experiences on the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051811431828">Chiaburu &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>), fun coworker interactions are examined herein. Fun coworker interactions are characterized as being friendly, outgoing, and socializing with each other. Finally, fun job responsibilities are included in the current framework as the job reflects the core of the applicants’ potential work. These are characterized as those that are personally enjoyable, meaningful, and a solid fit with one’s personal interests.</p>
<p>While all three dimensions may have a significant positive impact on applicant attraction, some dimensions of fun may have a stronger influence than others. Specifically, we argue that fun formal activities will be less important than fun coworker interactions and fun job responsibilities. As noted above, formal fun activities have been the focus of much of the popular fun literature and several empirical investigations. The popular press has advocated implementing a variety of ways to create a fun work climate, and the empirical investigations in this area have largely focused on which activities are actually considered fun and which are not. With respect to applicant attraction, formal fun activities may not necessarily have the strongest impact because they are by definition “formal activities.” While they may be perceived as enjoyable, formal activities do not necessarily permeate the day-to-day experiences for employees. As such, formal fun activities may have less of an influence on applicant attraction than other aspects of workplace fun. In contrast, fun coworker interactions and fun job responsibilities are believed to have a stronger impact. Simply put, because coworker interactions and one’s job responsibilities are constant and regular features of one’s experiences, they likely have a greater opportunity to affect one’s experienced fun at work. Accordingly, fun coworker interactions and fun job responsibilities are argued to have a stronger impact on applicant attraction than formal fun activities.</p>

<sec id="section4-1548051811431828">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>The sample for this research included 374 undergraduate students from two large universities who were in their final semester of school and actively seeking full-time employment upon graduation. The sample was 56% female and 77% Caucasian. The average age was 22 years. The job seekers were presented with two different written recruiting scenarios to assess the impact of fun and the other variables on attraction. The participants read each scenario and then answered a series of questions related to applicant attraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1548051811431828">
<title>Scenario 1—Fun, Compensation, and Opportunities for Advancement</title>
<p>The participants were presented with a recruiting advertisement for a management trainee position for a fictitious organization to assess the overall impact of fun on applicant attraction and its impact relative to compensation and opportunities for advancement. The participants were randomly assigned to read and evaluate one of eight different advertisements. The eight advertisements were created following a 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design in which a fun–work environment was present or not, competitive compensation was present or not, and extensive opportunities for advancement was present or not. The advertisements included a favorable description or the absence of a favorable description of the three variables, rather than presenting either a favorable or unfavorable description, because organizations likely omit an unfavorable description in their formal recruiting materials. After reading the advertisement, the participants responded to a series of questions regarding their attraction to the job and the organization. Approximately 47 individuals were assigned to each scenario. The descriptions of the three variables are presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1548051811431828">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section6-1548051811431828">
<title>Manipulation check</title>
<p>The goal of the first scenario was to determine the relative impact of high levels of fun, compensation, and opportunities for advancement on applicant attraction. Thus, prior to presenting the scenarios to the participants, a manipulation check was conducted to verify that the descriptions of the variables were perceived as relatively high and that the perceptions of the descriptions were approximately equivalent. Thirty-two industrial and organizational psychology graduate students rated the extent to which they agreed that each description was favorable with a 5-point scale with anchors ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The mean ratings for the fun, compensation, and opportunities for advancement were 4.44, 4.53, and 4.34, respectively. These ratings were relatively high, as they were all more than 4.00. There were no significant differences in the ratings for the three descriptions.</p>

<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Three variables were used to assess applicant attraction—<italic>perceived fun, perceived person–organization fit</italic>, and <italic>job pursuit intentions</italic>. Three items, developed specifically for this study, were used to assess perceived fun. A sample item includes “This would be a fun place to work.” The participants responded using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Three items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051811431828">Cable and Judge (1996)</xref> were used to assess perceived person–organization fit. A sample item includes “To what extent do you feel your values fit this organization?” The participants responded using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>completely</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051811431828">Saks, Leck, and Saunders’s (1995)</xref> two-item scale was used to measure job pursuit intentions.

The internal consistency reliability estimates for the perceived fun, perceived person–organization fit, and job pursuit intentions scales were .86, .87, and .94, respectively.</p>

<title>Scenario 2—Dimensions of Workplace Fun</title>
<p>To examine the impact of different aspects of workplace fun (i.e., fun coworker interactions, fun job responsibilities, and formal fun activities), the participants evaluated scenarios that described various events that transpired during an on-site job interview for a desirable management trainee position. The participants were randomly assigned to read and evaluate one of eight different scenarios. The eight scenarios were created following a 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design in which coworker interactions were presented as fun or not fun, job responsibilities were presented as fun or not fun, and formal fun activities were presented or were absent. Formal fun activities were presented or not presented, as opposed to presenting them either as fun or not, because it was deemed that organizations either generally institute such activities or not. After reading the scenario, the participants responded to a series of questions regarding their attraction to the job and the organization. Approximately 47 individuals were assigned to each scenario. The descriptions of the three variables are presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1548051811431828">Appendix B</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section9-1548051811431828">
<title>Manipulation check</title>
<p>A manipulation check was conducted with the same individuals as the first scenario. The manipulation check for the second scenario focused on validating high and low differences in perceptions of fun for each variable. The respondents were presented with the descriptions for the high and low fun conditions for each variable and were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed that each condition reflected a fun work environment with a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The mean differences in the high and low conditions for each variable were statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="section10-1548051811431828">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Three variables were used to assess applicant attraction: <italic>perceived fun, perceived person–organization fit</italic>, and <italic>offer acceptance intentions</italic>. The items described before were used to assess perceived fun and perceived person–organization fit. Two items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051811431828">Saks et al. (1995)</xref> were used to assess offer acceptance intentions. A sample item includes “If I were offered a job at this organization, I would accept it.” The participants indicated the extent to which they agreed with each statement on a 5-point scale with anchors ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The internal consistency reliability estimates for the perceived fun, perceived person–organization fit, and offer acceptance intentions scales were .91, .91, and .72, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section11-1548051811431828">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>Multiple regression was used to test the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variables. For Scenario 1, each of the dependent variables was regressed on the recruiting advertisement descriptions. The presence of descriptions of fun, compensation, or opportunities for advancement was coded 1, and the absence of such a description was coded 0. For Scenario 2, each of the dependent variables was regressed on the three dimensions of workplace fun. The presence of a high fun description of job responsibilities, coworker interactions, or formal fun activities was coded 1, and the presence of a low fun description was coded 0. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811431828">Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, and Piquero’s (1998)</xref> formula for testing the equality of regression coefficients was used to assess which of the resulting regression coefficients was larger than the other. In the case where one regression coefficient was significant and one was not, the significant coefficient was deemed to be larger.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1, which proposed that workplace fun would have a positive impact on applicant attraction, was supported for all three dependent outcomes. Workplace fun was significantly related to job perceived fun (β = .48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), perceived person–organization fit (β = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and job pursuit intentions (β = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 was supported. Workplace fun had a stronger impact on perceived fun than did compensation (<italic>t</italic> = 5.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and opportunities for advancement (<italic>t</italic> = 5.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, workplace fun had a stronger impact on perceived person–organization fit than did compensation (<italic>t</italic> = 3.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and opportunities for advancement (<italic>t</italic> = 1.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Finally, workplace fun was also demonstrated to be a stronger predictor of job pursuit intentions than compensation and opportunities for advancement because the latter two variables were not significant predictors of job pursuit intentions, whereas workplace fun was.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3, which proposed that fun coworker interactions would have a stronger positive impact on applicant attraction than would formal fun activities, was supported. Fun coworker interactions was a stronger predictor of perceived fun than formal fun activities (<italic>t</italic> = 6.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, fun coworker interactions was a stronger predictor of perceived person–organization fit than formal fun activities (<italic>t</italic> = 6.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Finally, fun coworker interactions was a stronger predictor of offer acceptance intentions than formal fun activities as the regression coefficient for formal fun activities was nonsignificant.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4, which proposed that fun job responsibilities would have a stronger positive impact on applicant attraction than would formal fun activities, was partially supported. There was no significant difference between the effects of fun job responsibilities and formal fun activities on perceived fun (<italic>t</italic> = 0.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). However, fun job responsibilities had a stronger impact on perceived person–organization fit than did formal fun activities (<italic>t</italic> =2.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, fun job responsibilities was a stronger predictor of offer acceptance intentions than was formal fun activities as the regression coefficient for formal fun activities was nonsignificant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study extended previous research on fun in the workplace by examining the impact of fun in an applicant attraction recruiting context. Overall, the findings demonstrated that fun is fundamental. The results demonstrated that fun does have a positive impact on applicant attraction and that fun is more important than compensation and opportunities for advancement when evaluating recruiting advertisements during the early stages of the recruiting process. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that not all aspects of workplace fun are valued equally. In the later stages of the recruiting process, fun coworker interactions and fun job responsibilities had a stronger impact on applicant attraction than formal fun activities. Thus, fun should not necessarily be examined as a unitary construct. Rather, research should treat workplace fun as a multidimensional construct in order to more fully understand the workplace fun phenomenon.</p>
<p>The key practical implication of this study is that workplace fun should be a central focus of recruiting efforts. Moreover, to the extent brevity is desired in recruiting media, a greater emphasis should be placed on fun relative to other job and organization characteristics. Moreover, given that fun coworker interactions and fun job responsibilities were demonstrated to be more important than formal fun activities in the context of on-site job interviews, such aspects of fun should be emphasized by interviewers during this phase of recruiting. While the results of this study suggest that fun be a focus of recruiting efforts, such a focus is not advocated if, in fact, the workplace is not “fun.” In such instances, management should focus on means to enhance fun in the workplace and then market job vacancies accordingly. If applicants’ prehire perceptions of the workplace are not congruent with their subsequent experiences on the job, they may become dissatisfied and ultimately leave the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051811431828">Phillips, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One limitation of the present study was that the study participants evaluated hypothetical recruiting advertisements and hypothetical on-site job interview experiences. While research designs such as that employed in the present study have been used in numerous recruiting studies and other studies of decision making in organizational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811431828">Karren &amp; Barringer, 2002</xref>), it would be useful to conduct additional research using other methodologies to validate the generalizability of the results herein. One approach would be to conduct a field experiment with actual recruiting advertisements placed in media outlets. The influence of fun could then be determined by assessing the quantity and quality of applicants that responded to the advertisements based on the content. Furthermore, another approach to assess the impact of fun on job offer acceptance would be to have individuals with multiple job offers evaluate the offers based on fun and other job and organizational characteristics.</p>
<p>A second limitation, which may limit the generalizability of the results to a degree, was using younger job seekers to assess the impact of workplace fun on applicant attraction. It was argued throughout that today’s younger job seekers (i.e., the Millennials) would particularly value workplace fun. Future research is warranted to examine the degree to which older workers also value fun. While Millennials may value workplace fun more than older workers, workplace fun may nonetheless be important for older individuals. Research is warranted to substantiate this claim. Research is also necessary to examine the impact of workplace fun on applicant attraction for Millennials in their future job pursuit endeavors. Such work will help determine the degree of temporal stability of the value placed on fun by Millennials. Do Millennials particularly value fun because they are relatively younger today, or is the value placed on fun relatively stable irrespective of their age?</p>
<p>One additional opportunity for future research is examining the impact of the different sources of workplace fun on applicant attraction in the context of recruiting advertisements. In the present study, fun coworker interactions, fun job responsibilities, and formal fun activities were described together relative to compensation and opportunities for advancement in the recruiting advertisements. In the on-site job interview scenario, however, the dimensions of workplace fun were experimentally manipulated separately, and the different dimensions were demonstrated to have different relationships with applicant attraction. Similarly, the different dimensions may also have different influences in recruiting advertisements. Moreover, some of the dimensions may matter more in the context of recruiting advertisements than during the on-site job interview process. For example, while formal fun activities were not related to offer acceptance intentions in the context of the on-site job interview, they may have a stronger impact on initial applicant attraction.</p>
<p>Another opportunity for future research is examining the impact of workplace fun on applicant attraction for low-skill/low-pay job vacancies. While the present study demonstrated that fun was important for management vacancies, fun may be even more important in the context of low-skill/low-pay work given that the other terms and conditions of employment such as compensation and benefits and opportunities for advancement may be quite limited. In low-skill/low-pay work, workplace fun may serve as a means to compensate for otherwise relatively unfavorable terms and conditions of employment and thus be critically important to attracting individuals to such job vacancies.</p>
<p>A final research opportunity is examining the impact of workplace fun on employee turnover and retention. This study examined the role of workplace fun on applicant attraction, and other research has examined the influence of fun on a host of other important workplace outcomes. What remains untested, however, is the impact of fun on employees’ actual staying and leaving behavior, thus representing a fruitful area for future inquiry. Specifically, research should examine the impact of different sources of workplace fun on turnover and retention for different types of employees in different organizational contexts. Moreover, research should examine the impact of fun relative to other terms and conditions of employment and organizational characteristics.</p>
<p>Workplace fun has long been argued to have a positive impact on organizational effectiveness, and empirical research has begun to validate such claims. The present study demonstrated that workplace fun has a significant impact on applicant attraction in a recruiting context and illustrated that different aspects of fun may be more important than others. Additional research is warranted, however, to obtain a fuller understanding of the extent to which fun in the workplace has favorable organizational outcomes and under what specific circumstances fun matters most. Such work will advance our theoretical knowledge base and serve as a foundation for providing sound prescriptions for applied practice.</p>
