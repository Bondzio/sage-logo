<abstract>
<p>This article examines medieval and early modern theologies of habit (those of Augustine, Aquinas and Luther), and traces a theme of appropriation through the discourse on habit and grace. It is argued that the question of habit is central to theological debates about human freedom, and about the nature of the God-relationship. Continuities are then highlighted with modern philosophical accounts of habit, in particular those of Ravaisson and Hegel. The article ends by considering some of the philosophical and political implications of the preceding analysis of habit.</p>

<p>In her 2004 book <italic>What Should We Do with Our Brain?</italic>, Cathérine Malabou explores questions of freedom and empowerment in response to contemporary neuroscience. What especially interests Malabou is the way in which the concept of plasticity suggests a non-mechanistic form of materialism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X12474475">Malabou, 2008</xref>: 33–8). If our actions and thoughts shape our brains by forging and strengthening neural pathways, then we are free to constitute our own materiality. And, of course, this freedom brings with it responsibility, as the title of Malabou’s book implies. If ‘our brain is in part essentially <italic>what we do with it</italic>’, this has ethical and political implications: ‘responsibility in the double movement of the receiving and the giving of form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X12474475">Malabou, 2008</xref>: 30). This idea challenges the mind–body dualism that runs through our philosophical tradition. If we are responsible for our embodiment, we should not, like Plato, Descartes or Kant, regard our thinking, willing selves as confined by our bodies, nor as separate from them. Likewise, we cannot separate the natural from the cultural: ‘if the brain is in some way a self-cultivating organ, which culture would correspond to it, which culture could no longer be a culture of biological determinism, could no longer be, in other words, a culture against nature?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X12474475">Malabou, 2008</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>For Malabou, raising these questions involves ‘an ideological critique of fundamental concepts of the neurosciences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X12474475">2008</xref>: 82). In particular, she argues that the concept of plasticity is mistaken for an idea of flexibility that is by no means politically neutral: this is, in fact, a requirement of capitalism, which demands a docile workforce that is endlessly pliable and adaptable to the fluctuating conditions of the market. Asserting that ‘many descriptions of plasticity are in fact unconscious justifications of a flexibility without limits’ (2008: 13), Malabou draws attention to a neglected aspect of plasticity: resistance to change as well as receptivity; the power to create and impose form as well as the capacity to be formed. While flexibility is predominantly passive, plasticity combines both passivity and activity, adaptability and determination.</p>
<p>However, the idea of plasticity that has become central to neuroscience over the last few decades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1357034X12474475">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1357034X12474475">Konorski, 1948</xref>) echoes a much older and more everyday notion: habit. Plasticity is not habit, but it is a condition of habit. And a long tradition of philosophical reflection on habit suggests that it exhibits the supposedly radical properties that Malabou attributes to her own concept of plasticity. Our capacity to acquire habits testifies to this plasticity insofar as it rests on the twin conditions of receptivity and resistance to change. If we could not be modified by our actions, by others’ actions, and by our environment, then these could not produce habits in us. And if we were not to some degree resistant to change, we would be affected and modified continually: we would not repeat ourselves, as we do through our habits. The fact that we, both as individuals and collectively, are creatures of habit at once explains why it can be hard to change, and indicates that it is always possible to do things differently.</p>
<p>This ambivalence concerning habit has provoked extended philosophical debate about the relationship between habit and freedom, and, concomitantly, about the ethical significance of habit. As many philosophers have recognized, habit is central to our embodiment. For some, such as Kant, this places habit on one side of a dualism between the mind and the body, and between freedom and necessity. Several post-Kantian thinkers, including Hegel and the French spiritualists and phenomenologists, such as Ravaisson and Merleau-Ponty, have challenged this view by arguing that the phenomenon of habit demonstrates that freedom and intelligence <italic>inhabit</italic> the body.</p>
<p>These philosophical debates provide an important background not only to the more explicitly political questions raised by Malabou, but also to the deployment of conceptions of habit and <italic>habitus</italic> in the social sciences. In this article, however, I want to take this historical contextualization a further step back, by surveying some pre-modern discussions about the role and significance of habit in human life. For thinkers such as Augustine, Aquinas and Luther, philosophy was inseparable from theology – and here the problem of habit concerned the limitation of our freedom not simply by our own bodies but by the divine power on which all finite things depend. Thus the debate about habit and freedom has been transformed as conceptions of human autonomy have shifted from a primarily religious cultural context to a primarily philosophical and scientific one. This means that we have forged new, and specifically modern, habits of thinking. In order to reflect on such habits, and gain some critical purchase on assumptions that normally lie hidden from view and condition reflection itself, these theoretical transitions – and their practical implications – need to be brought explicitly into focus. And, as we shall see when we consider this history of habit, a theme that persistently re-emerges is ‘having’ and ‘holding’: temporal relations of ownership and belonging that underpin individual and collective identities.</p>
<sec id="section1-1357034X12474475">
<title>Theologies of Habit: from Aquinas to Luther</title>
<p>The question of what is at stake, theologically as well as philosophically, in the question of habit may be approached through reflection on the different accounts of habit offered by the 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas and the 16th-century theologian Martin Luther. These accounts represent contrasting responses to the Aristotelian moral tradition, which centres on the idea that virtue consists in habit, understood as a disposition to choose, to act and to feel in certain ways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1357034X12474475">1</xref>
</sup> For Aristotle, moral virtue can be defined as ‘a state (<italic>hexis</italic>) involving rational choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12474475">Aristotle, 2000</xref>: 31/<italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> 1106b), and here <italic>hexis</italic> denotes a stable, relatively long-lasting quality, in contrast to a more transient state (<italic>diathesis</italic>) such as being hot or cold (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12474475">Aristotle, 1963</xref>: 24/<italic>Categories</italic> 8b26–9). More than this, however, a <italic>hexis</italic> is constitutive of the person, insofar as it has ‘become through length of time part of a man’s nature and irremediable or exceedingly hard to change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12474475">Aristotle, 1963</xref>: 24/<italic>Categories</italic> 8b26–9). The noun <italic>hexis</italic> derives from the verb <italic>ekhein</italic>, ‘to have’: as an enduring ‘having’, the process by which a <italic>hexis</italic> develops is one of acquisition, appropriation, assimilation. As Claudia Baracchi explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>a certain activity is transferred from the outside to the inside, as it were. Someone learning takes something in and makes it [her] own … in the case of habituation or education, acting in a certain way is not enough: a certain inner modality or awareness accompanying the outward action is needed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X12474475">Baracchi, 2008</xref>: 117)</p>
</disp-quote> This Aristotelian conception of virtue as <italic>hexis</italic>, and thus as an acquired nature, or a ‘second nature’, was taken up by Roman thinkers, who translated <italic>hexis</italic> as <italic>habitus</italic> – from the verb <italic>habere</italic>, ‘to have’. Cicero, for example, offers a much-quoted definition of virtue as ‘a habit of the soul conforming to the mode of nature and of reason’.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas’ discussion of virtue and habit in the <italic>Summa theologiae</italic> reflects his effort to synthesize Christian theology and pagan – and especially Aristotelian – philosophy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1357034X12474475">2</xref>
</sup> On the question of habit, this meant reconciling a classical tradition in which habit was foundational and constitutive for the good life, with a Christian tradition that had a largely negative view of the role of habit. The most influential thinker within this latter tradition was Augustine, who criticized the classical account of virtue as habit for several reasons. First, Augustine thought that virtues acquired by the person’s own efforts would always be attended by pride in this accomplishment, and thus would be inherently sinful even though they appeared, more superficially, to be virtuous. His own view was that genuine virtue depends on divine grace, since all the virtues are forms of <italic>caritas</italic>, the love of God that human beings can share in only if it is given as a divine gift. In <italic>The City of God Against the Pagans</italic>, Augustine argues that classical philosophers such as Cicero display a ‘wondrous vanity’ in seeking ‘to achieve blessedness by their own efforts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1357034X12474475">Augustine, 1998</xref>: 919). Second, from a more psychological perspective, Augustine regarded habit as a bondage of the will, a force by which old desires persist even after the radical changes brought about through conversion and repentance – processes which, it should be noted, themselves require divine grace. He offers a vivid description of habit’s fearful power in his <italic>Confessions</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The rule of sin is the force of habit (<italic>consuetudo</italic>), by which the mind is swept along and held fast even against its will.… I was held fast, not in fetters clamped upon me by another, but by my own will, which had the strength of iron chains.… [For desire had grown from my will] and when I gave in to desire habit was born, and when I did not resist the habit it became a necessity.… These two wills within me, one old, one new, one the servant of the flesh, the other of the spirit, were in conflict and between them they tore my soul apart. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6a-1357034X12474475">Augustine, 1961</xref>: 164)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1357034X12474475">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> For Augustine, then, habit represented not the form of the good life, but, on the contrary, an obstacle to the kind of virtue to which Christians aspire. Using the concept of habit to explain human sinfulness enabled Augustine to correct the dualism of Manichean theology, according to which all material things – i.e. bodies – are evil, and all spiritual things – i.e. souls – are good.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1357034X12474475">4</xref>
</sup> This dualistic view undermines the Christian belief in a good God as the source of all life. Augustine argues that the soul is ensnared and degraded not by its body but by habit. Even though this process is described in the <italic>Confessions</italic> as a kind of bondage, the origin of evil has nevertheless been attributed to human agency and desire. Thus, in place of the Manichees’ cosmic battle between matter and spirit, Augustine envisages a psychological battle between ‘two wills’, two forces of desire – one of the flesh and the other of the spirit.</p>
<p>Aquinas retains Augustine’s insistence that, for every Christian, the good life is dependent on divine grace, and he follows Augustine in according the central role to the God-given virtue of charity. However, he also retains the classical concept of <italic>habitus</italic>, albeit in a modified form. In the <italic>Summa theologiae</italic> his discussion of virtue is prefaced by a discussion of <italic>habitus</italic>, and this section of the text (Ia2ae – hereafter ST – qq.49–54) is now known as ‘the treatise on habits’. Here, in defining habit Aquinas makes a very strong link between habit and the will, citing the commentary on Aristotle’s <italic>De anima</italic> by the 12th-century Islamic scholar Averroes: ‘a disposition (<italic>habitus</italic>) is <italic>something which a man can exercise in action at will</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12474475">Aquinas, 1964</xref>: 16–17/STq.49a.3). There is, of course, a continuity here with Aristotle’s definition of virtue as a habit of choosing in the right way, but whereas Aristotle mentions choice to invoke a certain kind or class of habits, Aquinas qualifies the concept of habit as such with reference to the will. This makes habit a specifically human category: Aquinas insists that animals cannot acquire habits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12474475">Aquinas, 1964</xref>: 32–5/STq.50a.3). Similarly, within the human being, habits belong to the soul and not to the body, and moreover habit is confined to certain powers of the soul. In this way, Aquinas distances himself from Cicero’s conception of habit as a ‘second nature’: those characteristics acquired from frequent usage (<italic>consuetudo</italic>), by mere repetition, should not properly be called habits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12474475">Aquinas, 1969</xref>: 33/STq.56a.5).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1357034X12474475">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, just as it is important to note that Aquinas’ conception of habit is qualified by his emphasis on the will, so we should appreciate that his conception of the will is qualified by his emphasis on habit. This means that Aquinas would reject the modern idea, often implicit in utilitarian, existentialist and ‘decision-based’ ethical theories, that each choice can be conceived as a distinct rational calculation (or as a distinct non-rational ‘leap’). As Simon Oliver argues, for Aquinas:
<disp-quote>
<p>human acts form a ‘life’ which is not a succession of discrete states: it is a continuous motion towards the universal end in being, truth and goodness.… The motions of man’s soul may be collected to form what Aquinas calls ‘habits’, [which] are qualities and accidents of a special kind which lie at the heart of the nature of a being and therefore come closest to entering into [its] essence and definition. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X12474475">Oliver, 2005</xref>: 58)</p>
</disp-quote> In habit, the common-sense (and perhaps specifically modern) distinction between an agent and her acts begins to break down. Habit is constitutive of both person and work, unifying these in what Oliver here calls ‘a life’: a thoroughly temporal existence that, at least for Aquinas – following Aristotle – is oriented to a determinate end. That is to say, human lives are oriented diachronically towards concrete goals, and oriented morally by a conception of the good.</p>
<p>Having insisted that habit – and, consequently, virtue – is essentially related to the human will, Aquinas goes on to emphasize that the kind of virtue to which Christians aspire depends on a <italic>habitus</italic> that is bestowed by God. This is known as an ‘infused virtue’, as opposed to the ‘acquired virtue’ of which the pagan philosophers write. In defining virtue, Aquinas appeals not to Aristotle’s <italic>Ethics</italic>, but to Peter Lombard’s <italic>Sentences</italic>, then the standard textbook of Christian theology: ‘Virtue is a good quality of the mind, by which we live rightly, of which no one makes bad use, which God works in us without us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12474475">Aquinas, 1969</xref>: 11/STq.55a.4). But having cited with approval this Augustinian formulation, Aquinas indicates that it would be more appropriate to replace ‘quality’ with ‘<italic>habitus</italic>’. What is at stake in this substitution? As we have seen, Aristotle distinguishes the category of <italic>hexis</italic> from that of <italic>diathesis</italic>insofar as the former is longer-lasting and more stable, and, crucially, has become ‘natural’ – that is, through a process of appropriation has become constitutive of a person’s way of being. Aquinas wants the God-given virtue of charity, from which all other genuine virtues follow, to be understood as a habit in precisely this sense – because the alternative is Lombard’s view, which Aquinas regarded as ‘ridiculous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X12474475">Kent, 2002</xref>: 120), that human acts of charity arise from the soul’s being moved directly by the Holy Spirit. This latter doctrine implies that a person’s charitable acts may be entirely contrary to her own nature and inclinations, and thus may bear no relation to her character, will, state of mind and so on. As Kent explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>If charity is not something created in the soul – if it is not a habit inclining the human agent to act from the love of God, not a ‘second nature,’ albeit divinely produced, so that acts of charity continue to run counter to the individual’s inclinations – how could such acts ever be done easily, promptly, and with pleasure? How could acts of charity even be considered ‘voluntary’? If the person experiences no internal alteration but instead is moved by God to act contrary to her nature, how is she any more the cause of her own behaviour than a rock is the cause of its own ‘behaviour’ when God snatches it from its natural descent towards the sewer and sends it shooting towards the heavens? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X12474475">Kent, 2002</xref>: 120)</p>
</disp-quote> While Augustine invoked the concept of habit to attribute sinfulness to human freedom, Aquinas invokes it to secure the link between virtue and freedom. But in understanding Christian virtue in terms of habit, Aquinas tries to navigate two ideas that are in tension throughout the history of theology: the preservation of human freedom, on the one hand, and the denial of human self-sufficiency, on the other. By attributing habit to grace – and, in so doing, radically transforming the pagan notion of habit as a ‘second nature’ acquired through the individual’s own actions and efforts – Aquinas maintains a delicate balance between these two aspects of Christian doctrine. At the same time, he is more generous than Augustine to the classical Greek and Roman accounts of virtue. In distinguishing between acquired and infused virtues, he expresses his recognition that the former do indeed deserve to be classed as virtues, albeit ones relative to an end – the attainment of happiness within this life – that is surpassed by the Christian vision of the ultimate good, and the highest happiness, as eternal communion with God.</p>
<p>In retaining something of the classical conception of ‘second nature’, then, Aquinas seeks to secure some continuity between the natural and supernatural orders – between nature and grace. This is an important feature of his theology, and one that distinguishes it from the Christian teachings of both Augustine and Luther. His use of the concept of habit is pivotal here, as Simon Oliver suggests:
<disp-quote>
<p>If God were simply to move humanity to the beatific vision, this would constitute a violent motion because humanity would be destined for an end for which its nature was not prepared.… In addition to God moving humanity to its appropriate end, grace is also given as what Aquinas calls an ‘habitual gift’, namely a form or nature by which humanity can move and be moved to the supernatural end appointed by God. Just as God provides for creatures not only by moving them to their appropriate ends, but also in bestowing forms and powers by which they make that motion their own, so too God provides his grace by which humanity may make its motion to <italic>beatitudo</italic> its own. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X12474475">Oliver, 2005</xref>: 63)</p>
</disp-quote> This idea of appropriation – of ‘making one’s own’ a movement that originally lay beyond one’s power – is thus crucial both to the concept of habit in general, and to Aquinas’ theology of grace in particular. For Aquinas, it is through such appropriation that the continuity between nature and grace is maintained: the divine gift crosses between and unifies the natural and supernatural orders. Indeed, gift and habit share precisely the sense of making-inward or making-one’s-own, of becoming-natural or becoming-mine that is expressed in the idea of appropriation. And, in spite of Aquinas’ reluctance to recognize a connection between habit and the body in his ‘treatise on habits’, in the Christian tradition to which he belongs, and which he has shaped, this appropriation takes the form of incorporation: divine grace is given in the sacraments of the church. According to Aquinas:
<disp-quote>
<p>it is fitting that the grace which overflows from the incarnate Word should be carried to us by external perceptible realities; and also that certain external perceptible works should be brought forth from this interior grace, by which flesh is made subject to spirit. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12474475">Aquinas, 1971</xref>: 43/STq.108a.1)</p>
</disp-quote> In the sacrament of the Eucharist in particular, the link between grace and habit is clear: the divine gift is appropriated bodily, repeatedly, frequently and regularly.</p>
<p>Luther’s theology challenges this account of appropriation, although his interpreters disagree about how far his doctrine of grace marks a radical break with Thomism. For Luther, although divine grace is certainly given and received, it does not thereby become a person’s own in the same way as for Aquinas. In rejecting the scholastic theologians’ adoption of the Aristotelian concept of <italic>habitus</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X12474475">Lohse, 2006</xref>: 47, 59–60, 72, 261), Luther expresses concerns both psychological and ontological, and he proposes a new way of thinking about the transformations involved in becoming a Christian.</p>
<p>In order to illuminate the significance of the concept of <italic>habitus</italic> for Luther, however, we may begin with something rather less radical. He was critical of Aristotelian ethics for the same reasons as Augustine, Aquinas and other Christian thinkers: he found the pagan idea that we acquire virtues and attain our human <italic>telos</italic> merely through our own efforts to be in conflict with the Christian emphasis on the need for divine grace. While Aquinas sought to adapt and reconcile Aristotle’s philosophy to his own tradition, Luther was more straightforwardly hostile to it. His critique of both Aristotelian and scholastic thought was not simply a reversion to Augustine’s position, for it reflected his theological training at the University of Erfurt, which was dominated by the nominalism of William of Ockham. The late medieval school of Ockham was known as the <italic>via moderna</italic>, in distinction to the <italic>via antiqua</italic> of Aquinas and Duns Scotus, and this ‘modern way’ placed greater emphasis on the difference between theology and philosophy, and between faith and reason, to the point that these often came into tension with one another. One symptom of this development was a more critical relationship to Aristotelian thought, and this is clearly evident throughout Luther’s writings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X12474475">Lohse, 2006</xref>: 48–50). And at times, his polemic focuses on Aristotle’s moral psychology: in 1516, he wrote that ‘We are not, as Aristotle believes, made righteous by the doing of just deeds … but rather in becoming and being righteous people we do just deeds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1357034X12474475">Luther, 1963</xref>: 25).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1357034X12474475">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing in this remark to conflict with Aquinas’ view that virtuous action is caused by a <italic>habitus</italic> infused by God. However, Luther detected a problem in this interpretation of grace according to the concept of <italic>habitus</italic>. Although a divinely infused <italic>habitus</italic> is not acquired by a person’s own efforts, there is still a gap between the <italic>habitus</italic> and its exercise, between the capacity and its realization. And this gap makes it possible to reintroduce a notion of merit: a person only becomes righteous insofar as she actualizes her <italic>habitus</italic> through good works (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12474475">Ebeling, 1970</xref>: 70–1). In this way, for Luther, the scholastic doctrine of grace permitted a connection between works and justification that would be open to the problem that Augustine had identified several centuries earlier: the danger of pride infecting virtue, and thereby corrupting the Christian life at its very core. Whereas Aquinas could explain the exercise of a divinely infused <italic>habitus</italic> by appealing to a natural desire for the good which, when empowered by grace, facilitates the Christian life, Luther makes a much stronger contrast between grace and nature, whereby even the desire for God does not come from ourselves: ‘Those who seek God, do good freely and gladly, purely for the sake of God alone.… But this is the work not of our nature but of grace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474475">Luther, 1972</xref>: 227). Our righteousness, he suggests, ‘comes completely from the outside’ and is ‘foreign’ to our nature: ‘God does not want to redeem us through our own, but through external, righteousness and wisdom; not through one that comes from us and grows in us, but through one that comes to us from the outside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474475">Luther, 1972</xref>: 136).</p>
<p>In rejecting the idea that grace is given in the form of a <italic>habitus</italic>, Luther seems to suggest that even when we receive the gift of grace, it never properly belongs to us. In his lectures on Paul’s Letter to the Romans, he contrasts a proud, boastful ‘person of the law’ who is ‘confident in the righteousness which he already possesses’ with the ‘humble’ person of faith who ‘prays for the righteousness which he hopes to acquire’. According to Luther, the ‘whole life’ of faith ‘is nothing else but prayer, seeking and begging … always seeking and striving to be made righteous … never standing still, never possessing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474475">Luther, 1972</xref>: 251–2). He does appear to qualify this statement in claiming that ‘our righteousness is not something in us or in our own power’ because the grace imputed by God ‘is not ours by virtue of anything in us, or in our own power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474475">Luther, 1972</xref>: 257). This question of ownership is a matter of debate among Luther scholars. According to Bernhard Lohse:
<disp-quote>
<p>in a fundamental way Luther’s interpretation [of grace] exceeds the bounds of the scholastic doctrine. The point of his exposition is that one cannot speak of a continuous growth of the grace one is given, as if that grace became a possession that could not be lost. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X12474475">Lohse, 2006</xref>: 73)</p>
</disp-quote> Heiko Oberman distinguishes between the concepts of property and possession, suggesting that property implies a rightful claim, and arguing that in Lutheran theology ‘the righteousness granted is not one’s property but one’s possession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1357034X12474475">Oberman, 1986</xref>: 121). Gerhard Ebeling argues more strongly, however, that Luther’s denial that the gifts of grace become our own was decisive in his break with the Church:
<disp-quote>
<p>What was of vital importance was his bewilderment at what the Church’s teaching and scholastic theology in general asserted as self-evident: that the grace infused in the first place in baptism, and renewed after each mortal sin in the sacrament of penance, inhered in the person who received it as a new supernatural faculty enabling him to live a saintly life, even though still imperfectly.… It was on this issue, the scholastic interpretation of which raises many subtle problems, that there took place … what we might call the hidden atomic fission which set up a chain reaction leading to the events of the Reformation. The grace of the Holy Spirit never becomes our own <italic>virtus</italic> but is always effective as the <italic>virtus</italic> of God. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12474475">Ebeling, 1970</xref>: 70–1)</p>
</disp-quote> Ebeling notes that, unlike his scholastic predecessors, Luther confined the use of the word <italic>virtus</italic> to God’s power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12474475">1970</xref>: 272). This indicates a more radical departure from the Aristotelian tradition than that attempted by Aquinas. At the heart of Luther’s thought is the idea that, once the process of justification has been completely separated from works and merit, the love that flows from God through human beings remains pure: a person is free to love without this becoming ensnared in a self-interested striving for reward, nor becoming tainted by pride. In Luther’s view, the gift of grace is most purely a gift when it is entirely detached from any notion of merit. However, the consequence of this interpretation of the gift is that, as Ebeling suggests, it ‘never becomes our own’.</p>
<p>In Luther’s thought, then, we find a movement from the view that a person is constituted by her faculties, dispositions and tendencies – however these are acquired – to the view that she is constituted by her relationship to God. This shift does not primarily concern the extent of the human being’s dependence on God’s creative and restorative power – as we have seen, an insistence on this dependence is at the root of both Augustinian and Thomist theologies. Rather, it is a question of the kind of being that a person is, or has. In other words, the issue is ontological rather than theological. According to Luther, the change that is brought about when divine grace is bestowed is not the infusion of a new capacity or inclination. Instead, what changes is the individual’s <italic>being before God</italic>(<italic>corum Deo</italic>). Luther distinguishes between the inward aspect of a person, which is how she sees herself, and an outward aspect, which is how she is viewed by God: ‘The saints are always sinners in their own sight, and therefore always justified outwardly. But the hypocrites are always righteous in their own sight, and thus always sinners outwardly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474475">Luther, 1972</xref>: 257). Both ‘saints’ and ‘hypocrites’ are thus ‘at the same time both righteous and unrighteous’, but in opposite senses; the person of faith is ‘a sinner inwardly and yet righteous in the sight of God’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1357034X12474475">McGrath, 1985</xref>: 133). According to this new logic of grace, the divine gift is not appropriated as the person’s own nature or essence. Instead, it always remains <italic>between</italic> the individual and God – and, as such, it is the very substance of this relationship. For this reason, claims Ebeling, the Latin preposition <italic>corum</italic> ‘characterises the very basis of Luther’s thought’, for it expresses the way in which the human condition is constituted by a person’s relationships – fundamentally, but not only, to God; also to oneself, to other people, to the world (<italic>corum meipso</italic>, <italic>corum hominibus</italic>, <italic>corum mundo</italic>). 
<disp-quote>
<p>This<italic> corum</italic>-relationship, in which man always finds himself, is in fact the characteristic human situation, without which he would not be man at all. In it the way in which he encounters others, others encounter him, and he encounters himself are interwoven.… It is because man exists in this <italic>corum</italic>-relationship that he only truly exists in being recognised. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12474475">Ebeling, 1970</xref>: 196–7)</p>
</disp-quote> It seems that this Lutheran ontology, according to which human beings are constituted by their relationships rather than by their inherent qualities, transforms the very terms of the theological debate that provides the context for Aquinas’ account of virtue and grace. Luther’s doctrine comes closer to Lombard’s ‘ridiculous’ view that human acts of virtue arise from direct intervention by the Holy Spirit (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1357034X12474475">McGrath, 1985</xref>: 85). As we have seen, the problem with such a view – a problem perhaps shared by Augustinian theology – is that it can so easily accommodate not only a tension but an outright conflict <italic>within the individual herself</italic> between nature and grace, between a law of the flesh and a law of the spirit, between old and new habits, which, we read in the <italic>Confessions</italic>, ‘tore [Augustine’s] soul apart’. Aquinas tried to solve this problem by employing the concept of <italic>habitus</italic>. But one impetus for Luther’s reformation of theology was an urgent need for liberation from the psychic conflict that marked the culmination, within his own person, of centuries of theological tradition.</p>

<title>Modern Philosophies of Habit: Responding to the Theological Tradition</title>
<p>In modern European philosophy, as in the medieval and early modern theology that precedes it, the question of habit opens up debates about the constitution of the human being. For philosophy as for theology, these debates concern the nature of human freedom. From the 17th century onwards the challenge was to accommodate freedom not in the face of dependence on divine power, but in the face of a mechanistic conception of the natural world as subject to necessary physical laws. One response to this challenge was to develop a dualistic ontology, which sought to preserve human freedom by excluding it from the domain of natural law – and this response perhaps reaches its fullest articulation in the late 18th century, in Kant’s philosophy. The legacy of Bacon, Galileo and Newton is evident in Kant’s understanding of nature as operating according to mechanistic principles. However, in Kant’s account of the domain of human freedom, where order is founded on moral rather than physical laws, Luther’s influence is also apparent. Kant’s emphasis on purity of motivation – a moral standard that, like Luther, he regarded as effectively impossible to achieve – epitomizes the austere Protestant impulse, albeit in a philosophically refined form that elevates the authority of reason above that of scripture. On the other hand, while Luther found that the Aristotelian emphasis on habit ultimately compromises the human being’s dependence on God – and thus, it seems, allows too much scope for human freedom – for Kant the identification of moral virtue with habit undermines the freedom that makes morality possible.</p>
<p>Kant echoes Luther in his criticism of Aristotelian moral psychology. It is well known that while Aristotle’s ethics focuses on the development of character and the virtues, and assesses actions according to the doctrine of the mean, Kant advocates a deontological ethics that focuses more on the question of the legitimacy of the moral law than on the practical question of how one actually lives a good life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1357034X12474475">7</xref>
</sup> Kant’s dualistic framework means that moral psychology, with its empirical perspective, needs to be excluded from the <italic>a priori</italic> project of establishing the ground of morality (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1357034X12474475">Kant, 1964a</xref>: 410–12). However, even when, in his later writings, he discusses virtue from the perspective of moral anthropology, Kant is critical of Aristotle’s ethics – and he rejects not only the doctrine of the mean (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12474475">Kant, 1964b</xref>), but the definition of virtue in terms of a concept of habit. In his <italic>Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View</italic> he describes habit as ‘a physical inner necessitation to proceed in the same manner that one has proceeded until now’, which, as such, ‘deprives even good actions of their moral value because it impairs the freedom of the mind and, moreover, leads to thoughtless repetition of the very same act (<italic>monotony</italic>) and so becomes ridiculous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X12474475">Kant, 2007</xref>: 261). This modern view of habit as ‘thoughtless’ or ‘mechanical’ repetition has little in common with earlier conceptions of habitual virtue as essentially connected with choice and practical reason (Aristotle), or with the will (Aquinas). Has Kant simply misunderstood Aristotle on this issue?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1357034X12474475">8</xref>
</sup> Or is it rather that his dualistic philosophy, following from the principles of 18th-century science, simply cannot accommodate the idea that freedom may be instantiated in the empirical realm to which habit belongs, and thus has to rule out any continuity between physical nature and free, intelligent, rational action?</p>
<p>This question concerning human freedom and natural law set the agenda for post-Kantian philosophy, and in the first half of the 19th century both German idealism and French spiritualism sought to move beyond the dichotomies posited by Kant. This project focuses most particularly on the concept of habit in the work of Félix Ravaisson, who in his 1838 essay <italic>De l’habitude</italic> argues that habit not only traverses the opposition between ‘mechanical Fatality and reflective Freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">Ravaisson, 2008</xref>: 55) but also thereby discloses an underlying continuity from inert matter to intelligent, purposive, ‘spiritual’ activity. This is demonstrated, claims Ravaisson, by the process of habit acquisition in human beings. Actions that are originally consciously chosen and directed to a goal come, by degrees, to be incorporated into the body as natural, spontaneous, quasi-instinctive movements: ‘habit transforms voluntary movements into instinctive movements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">2008</xref>: 59).</p>
<p>While in Aquinas’ thought the appropriation accomplished by habit is confined to the rational powers of the human soul, for Ravaisson this appropriation modifies both mind and body. As habits develop, consciously posited goals or ‘ideas’ increasingly become ‘the form, the way of being, even the very being of [the body’s] organs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">2008</xref>: 57). Furthermore, habits constitute a ‘desire’ for the objects and experiences to which one has become accustomed, and this desire is analogous to biological need. So the ‘second nature’ born of habit is just like our original nature, and yet this new, acquired nature is imbued with freedom and intelligence. The force of habit is ‘an inclination that follows from the will … a law of the limbs, which follows on from the freedom of the spirit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">2008</xref>: 55–7). Ravaisson’s reflection on habit helps him to articulate a philosophy of nature and of life animated by a concept of ‘tendency’, which unites need and desire. 
<disp-quote>
<p>The disposition of which habit consists, and the principle endangering it, are one and the same thing: this is the primordial law and the most general form of being, the tendency to persevere in the very actuality that constitutes being. (2008: 77)</p>
</disp-quote> Ravaisson’s <italic>Of Habit</italic> gathers a wide variety of sources that combine to subvert the project of modern science, and its accompanying dualistic philosophy. These sources include Aristotelian ethics and metaphysics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12474475">Mauve, 1999</xref>); the vitalism and animism of early modern scientists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12474475">Cazeneuve, 1958</xref>); Leibnizian conceptions of force and inertia; and Schelling’s philosophy of nature. Ravaisson also develops existing accounts of habit, in particular that of the 18th-century English moralist Bishop Joseph Butler, whose Christian version of Aristotelian moral psychology offers an influential formulation of a ‘double law of habit’ (see Ravaisoon, 2008: 8–12, 121, 123; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12474475">Butler, 1857</xref>: 108; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1357034X12474475">Carlisle, 2010a</xref>). Although Ravaisson does not mention Thomas Aquinas, his own Christian Aristotelianism clearly situates him within this Catholic tradition. Whereas the Augustinian-Lutheran tendency is to regard the religious life as an ongoing struggle against one’s own corrupt nature, which is only entrenched by force of habit – a view which seems to be shared by Kant – Ravaisson, like Aquinas, finds in habit much more cause for optimism. As virtuous responses become habitual, they become increasingly effective, require less effort, and produce more pleasure:
<disp-quote>
<p>Repetition or continuity makes moral activity easier and more assured. It develops within the soul not only the disposition, but also the inclination and tendency to act, just as in the organs it develops the inclination for movement. In the end, it gradually brings the pleasure of action to replace the more transient pleasure of passive sensibility. In this way … the helpful activity and the inner joys of charity develop more and more in the heart of the one who does good. In this way, love is augmented by its own expressions.… Virtue is first of all an effort and wearisome; it becomes something attractive and a pleasure only through practice, as a desire that forgets itself or is unaware of itself, and gradually it draws near to the holiness of innocence.… In this way a <italic>second nature</italic> is formed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">Ravaisson, 2008</xref>: 69)</p>
</disp-quote> Quoting the 17th-century Catholic thinker François Fénelon, Ravaisson offers an explicitly theological interpretation of this account of habit. If, as Aquinas suggests, divine grace helps the individual by ‘infusing’ virtues that surpass her natural capacities, then, for Ravaisson, God also offers within nature itself a ‘prevenient grace’ (2008: 71) – a kind of grace that enables the will, despite its fallen condition, to seek the good. Departing from Aquinas, Ravaisson regards habit as a principle of nature that is shared by all living beings, from the simplest organisms to the most highly developed human beings. He argues that habit is itself a ‘law of grace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">2008</xref>: 57) insofar as it facilitates each organism’s movement towards the good. In this way, the French philosopher seems to move a step further than Aquinas, positing not just continuity between nature and grace but their ultimate unity: ‘In every thing, the necessity of Nature is the chain on which Freedom unfolds itself. But this is a moving and living chain; it is the necessity of desire, love and grace’ (2008: 75).</p>
<p>A rather different but complementary account of the relationship between habit and freedom can be found in Hegel’s philosophy. Like Ravaisson, Hegel challenges the restricted interpretation of freedom arising from Kantian dualism, and draws on Aristotelian thought to formulate a positive conception of ‘second nature’. In the <italic>Philosophy of Right</italic> he suggests that communal ethical life (<italic>Sittlichkeit</italic>) is ‘the realm of freedom made actual’: when ‘mind’ or ‘spirit’ becomes a ‘second nature’, its freedom is actualized, expressed concretely out in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1357034X12474475">Hegel, 1942</xref>: 20). While Kant sets natural laws in opposition to the moral law, Hegel posits an analogy between these two forms of law, reinforcing this by appealing to the idea of a second nature:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just as nature has its laws, and as animals, trees and the sun fulfil their law, so custom (<italic>Sitte</italic>) is the law appropriate to free mind…. Education is the art of making men ethical. It begins with pupils whose life is at the instinctive level and shows them the way to a second birth, the way to change their instinctive nature into a second, spiritual nature, and makes this spiritual level habitual to them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1357034X12474475">Hegel, 1942</xref>: 260)</p>
</disp-quote> Here, as in Ravaisson’s <italic>De l’habitude</italic>, habit traverses the difference between nature and spirit, between nature and freedom, between nature and culture.</p>
<p>In his <italic>Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences</italic>, Hegel offers an extended and more complex discussion of this idea. In this text he focuses on habit within the individual, rather than on social customs and institutions: 
<disp-quote>
<p>Habit is rightly called a second nature; nature, because it is an immediate being of the soul; a second nature, because it is an immediacy created by the soul, impressing and moulding the corporeality which enters into the modes of feeling as such and into the representations and volitions so far as they have taken corporeal form. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X12474475">Hegel, 1971</xref>: 141)</p>
</disp-quote> Although he here highlights an ambiguity regarding habit and freedom, Hegel seems to conclude that, in principle, habit promotes freedom rather than inhibits it:
<disp-quote>
<p>In habit the human being’s mode of existence is ‘natural’, and for that reason not free; but still free, so far as the merely natural phase of feeling is by habit reduced to a mere being of <italic>his</italic>, and he is no longer involuntarily attracted or repelled by it, and so no longer interested, occupied or dependent with regard to it. The want of freedom in habit is in part merely formal, as habit merely attaches to the being of the soul; partly only relative, so far as it strictly speaking arises only in the case of bad habits, or so far as habit is opposed by another purpose: whereas the habit of right and goodness is an embodiment of liberty. The main point about Habit is that by its means man gets emancipated from the feelings, even in being affected by them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X12474475">Hegel, 1971</xref>: 141)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1357034X12474475">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> Like his analysis of habit, Hegel’s relationship to the Christian theological tradition is also more ambiguous than Ravaisson’s. (Perhaps his ambivalent view of habit reflects the extension of his reconciliatory impulse to the Catholic and Protestant traditions.) Hegel was strongly influenced by Luther, and critical of Catholicism, but on the other hand he was very receptive to Aristotelian thought.</p>
<p>One aspect of Hegel’s reflection on habit resonates strongly with that of Thomas Aquinas, and this is his conception of appropriation, of making-one’s-own. In this respect, Hegel is true to the origins of the Greek <italic>hexis</italic> and the Latin <italic>habitus</italic> in the verb ‘to have’: he argues that it is through habit that a person comes to ‘have’ or to ‘possess’ his experiences and actions as his own, for he comes to relate ‘not to a contingent single sensation, idea, appetite, etc. but to himself, to a universal mode of action which constitutes his individuality, which is posited by himself and has become his own and for that very reason appears as free’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X12474475">Hegel, 1971</xref>: 144). Hegel aptly describes habit as a ‘being-at-home-with-oneself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X12474475">1971</xref>: 144). He suggests that the soul’s possession and domestication of itself by means of habit accomplishes its liberation:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this manner the soul has the contents in possession, and contains them in such a manner that in these features it is not sentient, nor does it stand in relationship with them as distinguishing itself from them, nor is absorbed in them, but has them and moves in them, without feeling or consciousness of the fact. The soul is freed from them, so far as it is not interested in or occupied with them: and whilst existing in these forms as its possession, it is at the same time open to be otherwise occupied and engaged.… [H]abit is indispensable for the <italic>existence</italic> of all intellectual life in the individual, enabling the subject to be a concrete immediacy, an ‘ideality’ of soul – enabling the matter of consciousness, religious, moral, etc. to be his as <italic>this</italic> self, <italic>this</italic> soul, and … part and parcel of his being. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X12474475">Hegel, 1971</xref>: 140, 143)</p>
</disp-quote> Here, Hegel offers a philosophical interpretation of the everyday phenomenon of habituation. Because so much of our activity is taken care of by habit – moving around our home or our workplace, driving a car, using a pen or a keyboard – our energies and attention are free for other things, including creative thought. Without this effect of habit, indeed, it is difficult to imagine the development of a culture beyond the basic elements of survival.</p>
<p>Luther’s criticism of the idea of appropriation implicit in the scholastic teaching that divine grace is imparted in the form of a <italic>habitus</italic> is echoed in Søren Kierkegaard’s hostility to the Hegelian view that human freedom can be embodied in a second nature – both as habit within the individual and as custom on a larger, social scale. Kierkegaard’s attitude to the question of habit and freedom also seems to be indebted to a Kantian legacy: it is probable that his resistance to the Hegelian ideas championed by Danish contemporaries in the 1830s and 1840s made him unwilling to engage in the project of overcoming the dichotomies and antinomies of Kant’s thought. In any case, this philosophical project was not Kierkegaard’s main concern, for his own work was dedicated to reinvigorating the Christian life at a time when, he believed, widespread religious complacency veiled a decline in genuine religious commitment. Kierkegaard regarded this spiritual malaise as due in part to the naturalization or domestication, over many centuries, of Christian teachings which were originally scandalous, paradoxical and existentially challenging (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12474475">Carlisle, 2010b</xref>). On this issue, then, he opposes an ethic of radical decision to the Hegelian idea of second nature: the task of faith is accomplished by a repeated leap, rather than by steady development and incorporation of the qualities essential to the Christian life. For Kierkegaard, the ‘task of becoming a Christian’ involves repeatedly willing and striving to fulfil this task, and he opposes this free, spiritual movement to the repetitions of habit, which he regards as mere physical necessity.</p>
<p>Because Kierkegaard is concerned to oppose modern philosophy’s commitment to human autonomy – a development he attributes to both Kant and Hegel – the conception of freedom at stake in his account of repetition is qualified by a theological emphasis on divine grace. Thus it is not just that individuals must choose repeatedly, but that they must – if they are to embrace the task of becoming a Christian – repeatedly open themselves to the gift of God’s grace that is the source of all human power. For Kierkegaard, the person of faith performs a continuous ‘double movement’ that oscillates between receiving this gift, and losing or renouncing it. Here, then, we find echoes of the Lutheran understanding of grace as a gift that can never be possessed – that can never become appropriated as a <italic>habitus</italic> – but must always be given and received anew. Concomitantly, Kierkegaard follows Luther in regarding the religious life as shaped by a continuous striving, rather than by a progressive improvement in virtue. However, in later, atheistic versions of ‘existentialist’ philosophy, only Kierkegaard’s emphasis on the repetition of radical choice is retained. In Sartre’s thought, for example, this decisionism entails a rejection of habit as a cover for ‘bad faith’, a flight from freedom, and therefore a rejection of the very category of ‘hexis’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1357034X12474475">Sartre, 1969</xref>: xxii–xxiii).<sup>

<title>Conclusion: The Question of Habit</title>
<p>The preceding discussion has necessarily been brief and, of course, highly selective in its survey of Christian theology and modern philosophy. However, this has enabled us to trace two distinct responses to the question of the value of habit. The Augustinian-Lutheran tradition develops a negative assessment of habit: this is sustained in Kant’s rejection of habit as opposed to human freedom and intelligence, and seems to persist in the very different ‘existentialisms’ of Kierkegaard and Sartre. On the other hand, a much more positive evaluation of habit characterizes the Catholic and Aristotelian tradition spanning the centuries from Aquinas to Ravaisson. And Ravaisson’s work has inspired several 20th-century philosophers to look to habit in developing new currents of thought: in France, his influence is evident in the phenomenology of Paul Ricoeur and Maurice Merleau-Ponty (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474475">Ravaisson, 2008</xref>: 19–20),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1357034X12474475">11</xref>
</sup> and in the new vitalism of Bergson (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X12474475">Sinclair, 2011</xref>) and Deleuze (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1357034X12474475">Marin, 2004</xref>); in America, in the pragmatism of William James and John Dewey.</p>
<p>Habit, it seems, has been central to the issues that have occupied such thinkers over many centuries, and in particular to questions about the nature of human freedom and responsibility. As I suggested in the introduction to this article, this aspect of the discourse on habit illuminates contemporary notions of plasticity, and keeps open the kind of critical reflection on how we understand our own materiality that Malabou proposes in asking ‘What should we do with our brains?’ For the medieval and early modern theologians, the question of freedom is addressed in the context of belief in the human being’s profound dependence on divine power; for the philosophers, the context is rather that of the modern sciences and their deterministic conception of nature. It is possible, however, to see in the dualisms of modern thought, and in the attempts to overcome them, continuities with pre-modern theological debates concerning the relationship between nature and grace.</p>
<p>Although Hegel, with his emphasis on the ambiguity of habit, brings together the two divergent traditions – the ‘Catholic’ and the ‘Protestant’ – his inclination is more towards the view that habit is essential to human freedom. It seems to me that this positive conception of habit is more productive in understanding the human being in its concrete existence, for it allows us to think of human freedom as situated in communal forms of life, as embodied in routines and rituals and practices, as continuous with the natural world, as embedded in history. It is perhaps no coincidence that the use of the concept of ‘habitus’ in the social sciences, pioneered by Pierre Bourdieu, can be traced directly back to scholastic theology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1357034X12474475">12</xref>
</sup> In his ‘postface’ to his French translation of Erwin Panofsky’s classic work <italic>Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism</italic>, Bourdieu develops for the first time the theoretical category that would become central to his mature thought:
<disp-quote>
<p>To contrast individuality with community so as better to safeguard the rights of creative individuality and the mystery of individual creation is to forego discovering community at the very heart of individuality in the form of culture – in the subjective sense of <italic>cultivation</italic> or <italic>Bildung</italic> – or, to speak the language used by Panofsky, in the form of the <italic>habitus</italic> through which the creator partakes of his community and time, and that guides and directs, unbeknownst to him, his apparently most unique creative acts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X12474475">Bourdieu, 2005</xref>: 226)</p>
</disp-quote> Here, Bourdieu’s concern is to overcome a dichotomy between individual and community – and, as for the philosophical heirs of the ‘Catholic’ tradition, it is a concept of habit that unifies what modern theory has separated. We have seen that, while Augustine sees the ‘force of habit’ as a ‘rule of sin’, Ravaisson finds in habit a ‘law of grace’. And Ravaisson’s view has a social dimension that he does not himself accentuate. When we contract habits from others by sharing spaces, practices, routines and rhythms, and a language, communication and interaction become easier and less effortful, and communal life becomes more harmonious.</p>
<p>Appreciating the rich conceptual resources within a tradition of thought that is prepared to recognize the value of habit, and thus to explore it in greater depth, should not, however, lead us to dismiss habit’s detractors. It should not be a question of choosing sides in the debate concerning habit, of deciding which tradition, and which interpretation of habit, we prefer – even if current fashion, led by French philosophy, makes habit more seductive in the guise of a ‘new vitalism’ or a neo-Hegelian ‘new materialism’ than it appeared when confined to the dusty corners of Aristotelian ethics, scholastic theology or British pragmatism. Rather, the ambivalent response to habit that is expressed both in Hegel’s philosophy, and within the history of European thought as a whole, reflects the nature of the phenomenon itself. Habit <italic>is</italic> both a blessing and a curse. As Slavoj Žižek puts it in his reading of Hegel’s analysis of habit, it is ‘unexpectedly close to what Derrida called <italic>pharmakon</italic> [i.e. at once a poison and a cure], the ambiguous supplement which is simultaneously a force of death and a force for life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12474475">Gabriel and Žižek, 2009</xref>: 100). Žižek means that, for Hegel, habit on the one hand dulls life and makes it mechanical, and on the other hand facilitates every exercise of freedom. But there is more to habit’s ambivalence than this. Habit gives order and stability to life, but it also entrenches ways of being in a manner indifferent to their value. That is to say, habit empowers the bad as much as the good, the unhealthy as much as the healthy, the unjust as much as the just, the ignorant as much as (if not more than) the enlightened. The attachment and even dependence produced by deep habits can be a source of great suffering when conditions change. Moreover, habit conceals its patterns as it reinforces them, making critical reflection more difficult and also leading us to take for granted what might more appropriately be a cause for wonder or for protest.</p>
<p>These effects of habit apply as much to cultures and to social institutions as to individuals: the psychological ‘bondage’ wrought by the ‘force of habit’ that Augustine describes so vividly can also be a political phenomenon. And indeed, we can transpose to the political domain Augustine’s theological insight that, since sin is due to our habits rather than to our natures, it is rooted in free will and remains our responsibility. This Augustinian conception of habit anticipates the interpretation of plasticity that Malabou advances in response to contemporary notions of plasticity as passive flexibility. (It is perhaps indicative of our modern ways of reflecting on the human being that, while the medieval discourse on habit was explicitly and unequivocally engaged with questions about virtue and value, Malabou has to draw attention to the normative implications of neuroscientific concepts.) In exposing the political force of a scientific discourse that purports to be objective and morally neutral, Malabou echoes a call to responsibility for habit that is centuries old.</p>
<p>To put it another way: if habit is the means by which we make our materiality – that of our life, and that of our world – our own, and is thus the ground of our identity, then the strength and endurance through time of these identities – whether personal or collective, private or public, if indeed such distinctions can be made – is profoundly ambivalent. What kind of power does the force of habit generate? Is it a power of liberation or of bondage, of creativity or of domination, of freedom or of servitude? Whether or not we agree with Aquinas that the capacity to develop habits is uniquely human, it is no doubt true that, as human beings, we have a special ability to question habit – and this is how we should interrogate it. <italic>What kind of power does the force of habit generate?</italic> This question can be asked not only of habit as such, but also of the particular habits that distinguish us as individuals and that bind us as communities.</p>

<p>Bonnie Kent elucidates this passage as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The skilful movements of the body, caused by its disposition to function in a skilful way, should be seen mainly as residual effects of the soul’s control.… Insofar as a power [of the soul] acts from natural instinct, it cannot acquire habits in the strict sense.… In downgrading the [powers of memory and imagination, Thomas] appeals to their connection with the body, to the force of sheer repetition in conditioning them to operate in certain ways, how they tend to influence, instead of being influenced by, our intellectual judgement … and just how far removed they are from the control of the will.
