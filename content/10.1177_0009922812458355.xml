<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To assess the predictors of attrition from a clinical pediatric obesity treatment program. <italic>Methods</italic>. We evaluated 2- through 20-year-old patients first seen at the Duke University Healthy Lifestyles Program between October 2006 and December 2008. We assessed the predictors of early dropout (not returning for any follow-up visits within 1 year) and of noncompletion (not attending at least 6 visits within 1 year after entry). <italic>Results</italic>. The sample included 983 patients. In adjusted analyses, non-white non-Hispanic children were more likely to be early dropouts than white non-Hispanic children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-2.07). Non-white non-Hispanic children were more likely to be noncompleters than white non-Hispanic (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.03-2.36) and Hispanic children (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.34-4.90). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Race/ethnicity predicted patient attrition. Investigation into this association and program modification are needed to reduce attrition in certain racial/ethnic groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Overweight and obesity affect one third of all children and adolescents in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812458355">1</xref></sup> These children are at an increased risk for the development of many obesity-related health conditions both as children and adults, such as abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812458355">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812458355">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In response to the large number of children affected and the known health risks associated with overweight and obesity in childhood, numerous pediatric obesity treatment programs have been developed to treat both obesity and associated health conditions. These programs can yield improvements in the severity of overweight and obesity in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812458355">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812458355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812458355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812458355">9</xref></sup> However, attrition from such programs is common and is frequently cited to be barrier to effective obesity treatment. Clinical obesity treatment programs for children report dropout rates of more than 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812458355">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458355">12</xref></sup> To improve attrition from clinical obesity treatment programs, understanding which children are most likely to drop out is necessary. To date, limited studies exist examining this topic in clinical programs.</p>
<p>The studies that have examined the patient characteristics predictive of attrition in clinical outpatient programs have mostly consisted of small sample sizes and have found that insurance type,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458355">12</xref></sup> race,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812458355">13</xref></sup> age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> psychological symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> and initial severity of overweight or obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812458355">8</xref></sup> are related to attrition although the results are inconsistent between studies. Other studies have assessed attrition during child obesity treatment and, in addition to some of the above factors, have also found relationships with parental motivation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812458355">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812458355">15</xref></sup> family structure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458355">16</xref></sup> breakfast consumption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458355">16</xref></sup> measures of social desirability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458355">16</xref></sup> measures of child delinquency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458355">16</xref></sup> evidence of child social problems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458355">16</xref></sup> and parental weight status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812458355">17</xref></sup> However, these other studies included research populations, which are likely to be different from a clinic population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812458355">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812458355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812458355">17</xref></sup> It is also notable that there is no clearly agreed on standard for the terms <italic>attrition, noncompletion</italic> and <italic>dropout</italic> in such programs. The objective of this study is to assess predictors of patient attrition from the Duke University Healthy Lifestyles Program (HLP), a large clinical pediatric obesity treatment program. Knowledge of such predictors should be valuable in improving pediatric obesity treatment in the clinical setting.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922812458355">
<title>Study Design and Population</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted of overweight and obese children and adolescents (body mass index [BMI] ≥85th percentile for age and gender) 2 through 20 years old at their first visit to the HLP in Durham, North Carolina (October 2006 through December 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812458355">18</xref></sup> All data were extracted from the medical record.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812458355">
<title>The Healthy Lifestyles Program</title>
<p>Physicians can refer their overweight or obese patients ≤22 years old to the HLP. On referral, the referring physician orders screening laboratory studies on all patients 5 years and older (including fasting lipids, fasting glucose, transaminases, thyroid stimulating hormone, and urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio at a minimum). Screening laboratory studies are performed on younger patients at the discretion of the referring physician.</p>
<p>The primary phase of the HLP program includes an initial visit and 5 follow-up visits with a medical provider at 4- to 6-week intervals. At the initial visit, the medical provider obtains a lifestyle, birth, medical, family, and social history; performs a physical exam focused on obesity-related conditions; and discusses psychological and disordered eating concerns. The lifestyle history focuses on assessing fruit and vegetable and sweet drink consumption, meal patterns, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Vital signs obtained at the visit include the child’s height and weight, blood pressure, and body fat percentage. The provider discusses the implications of the patient’s risk for disease in the context of their BMI, family history, and lifestyle behaviors. Medical management of comorbid conditions and pharmacologic management are offered and provided if indicated. Then, the provider uses motivational interviewing to facilitate a family-centered goal for lifestyle change with particular emphasis placed on the behaviors assessed in the lifestyle history.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812458355">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Follow-up visits with the medical provider are similar and include a lifestyle history, vitals, a physical exam, medical management of comorbid conditions if necessary, and the establishment of goals for lifestyle change. At follow-up visits, the medical provider also assesses progress relative to the patient’s previous goals and discusses any difficulties achieving these goals. All patients see dietitians for medical nutritional therapy; the dietitians also encourage lifestyle modification through goal setting. Pediatric physical therapy and mental health professionals are available, with referral as necessary.</p>
<p>The second phase, the maintenance phase, includes a HLP visit with a medical provider every 6 months until the child is 23 years old. Visits with the dietitian, pediatric physical therapy, and mental health are available as necessary during the maintenance phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812458355">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Because the characteristics that predict attrition at different stages of treatment may differ, we examined 2 different measures of patient attrition. The outcomes of the study are patient attrition defined as (<italic>a</italic>) “early dropouts,” that is, patients not returning for any follow-up medical provider HLP visits within 1 year of the first visit and (<italic>b</italic>) “noncompleters” of the program, patients attending less than 6 medical provider visits within 1 year of the first visit.</p>

<title>Potential Predictors</title>
<p>Potential baseline predictors assessed are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458355">Table 1</xref>. Height was measured by a Seca 242 stadiometer (Hamburg, Germany) and weight by the Tanita BC-418 model (Tokyo, Japan). BMI was converted to percentiles to categorize patients as overweight, obese, or severely obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812458355">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812458355">21</xref></sup> Three abnormal measures of obesity-related conditions were defined at program entry. Elevated cholesterol included taking a cholesterol medication or having an elevated low-density lipoprotein or triglycerides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812458355">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812458355">23</xref></sup> Elevated blood pressure included taking an antihypertensive medication or having an elevated blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812458355">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812458355">25</xref></sup> Abnormal glucose metabolism included taking a hypoglycemic medication or having an elevated homeostatic model assessment index of insulin resistance, glucose, or glycohemoglobin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812458355">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812458355">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>A Kaplan–Meier survival curve was constructed to examine patient attrition for each HLP visit. Logistic regression was performed to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios to assess the relationships between each of the potential predictors and each of the 2 outcomes. For the multivariable models, all potential predictors were placed in models and were removed using likelihood ratio tests with <italic>P</italic> ≥ .2 as criterion for removal. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 11.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine patient attrition in a clinical obesity treatment program. We found that patient attrition was high, with approximately one third of patients being early dropouts and 83% of patients being noncompleters. Attrition is also high among other child obesity programs nationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812458355">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458355">12</xref></sup> For example, Zeller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> found that 28% of their patients withdrew after 1 clinic visit and 55% of patients did not complete their 16-week obesity treatment program. A study by Germann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812458355">10</xref></sup> of an obesity treatment program requiring 1 year of participation found that 88% of patients dropped out before 1 year. Another study of attrition from the first phase (initial 12 weeks) of a clinical obesity treatment program found that approximately two thirds of children did not complete the 12-week phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458355">12</xref></sup> Higher participation rates have been found for pediatric obesity treatment programs operated in a research setting. For example, Jelalian et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812458355">17</xref></sup> found that only 17.6% of adolescents did not complete their 4-month research-based weight control program. However, research studies enroll select patient populations, and the populations of such studies are often not comparable with the population of clinical obesity programs.</p>
<p>Of the potential predictors we examined, few predictors of patient attrition were found. The finding that race/ethnicity was a predictor of patient attrition is consistent with other studies that have found that black/African American children are more likely to drop out of pediatric obesity treatment programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812458355">13</xref></sup> This finding may be a result of limited adjustment for socioeconomic factors using only insurance type; however racial/ethnic differences in weight-related perceptions and barriers to weight loss have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812458355">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812458355">30</xref></sup> This may lead to decreased motivation toward continued program participation. For example, West et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812458355">28</xref></sup> found that African American parents are about twice as likely to classify their overweight child as either normal weight or underweight when compared with white parents. In a qualitative study of African American and Caucasian women’s views toward weight loss, African American women reported different barriers to weight loss than Caucasian women. African American women were more likely to report that their culture and ethnicity kept them from losing weight and that family influence was a barrier to weight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812458355">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, a relationship between normal cholesterol and being a noncompleter was found whereas the presence of other obesity-related conditions was not related to patient attrition. To our knowledge, only one other clinically based pediatric study has investigated the relationship between obesity-related conditions and attrition. Zeller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> identified a relationship between insulin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels and attrition although measures of blood pressure did not have a relationship with attrition. These relationships were found in unadjusted analyses, but adjusted analyses including measures of obesity-related conditions were not described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> In a recent systematic review of attrition from adult obesity treatment programs, the presence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension were not consistent predictors of attrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812458355">31</xref></sup> Similar to the study by Zeller et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> our study also found that cholesterol was related to attrition. Perhaps the medical problems associated with cholesterol abnormalities are a motivating factor particularly in pediatric populations. If this relationship is consistent in future studies, perhaps the potential effect on attrition is a reason for encouraging measurement of cholesterol in overweight or obese children.</p>
<p>The child’s severity of overweight or obesity was also not related to patient attrition in this study. This relationship has been inconsistent in other pediatric studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812458355">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> Other studies have found that insurance type and age are related to attrition; however, these results are inconsistent between studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812458355">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812458355">13</xref></sup> and we found no relationship between attrition and insurance type or child’s age in our sample.</p>
<p>Strengths of the study include the large number of patients and evaluation of the relationship between the presence of obesity-related conditions and attrition. Limitations include a lack of information about other potential predictors of attrition. Other studies of attrition from outpatient clinical programs have found that psychological symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458355">11</xref></sup> and rating of quality of care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458355">12</xref></sup> are related to attrition. We did not consistently measure these factors in our patient population. We were also unable to investigate other factors that may be predictive of attrition, some of which have not been assessed in quantitative studies of clinical programs, such as parental and child motivation, parent–child conflict, quality of life, and programmatic factors such as the availability of appointments. In addition our study and most other clinical studies have used only insurance as a measure of financial stability and socioeconomic status. Transportation costs and availability, ability for parents to take time off from work, and actual costs of copayments and coinsurance for appointments are other components of financial stability that may be related to attrition. Another limitation is whether the factors that predict attrition in our program affect attrition in similar programs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Race/ethnicity was the only consistent predictor of patient attrition in this study. Further investigation into the reasons for this relationship and subsequent program modification are needed to reduce attrition in certain high-risk racial/ethnic groups.</p>
