<p>Lieven’s book is a tremendous achievement, all too worthy of the numerous accolades it has received already. His panoramic, richly detailed portrait of two years of epic warfare that determined the course of European geopolitics for half century is all the more remarkable for accomplishing such synthesis while also breaking new ground. As Lieven notes, his is the first account by a Western historian of the Russian Empire’s war against Napoleon from 1812 to 1814. This is partly due to the continuing bias against military history – as Lieven ruefully observes, ‘the surest way to make yourself unappointable in any British, let alone American, university is to say that you wish to study the history of battles, diplomacy and kings’(4). Yet the absence of previous such work is also the result of limited focus. Both Russian and Western scholars have confined their analysis to the events surrounding the French invasion and occupation of Russia in 1812. In contrast, as Lieven notes, there has been little attention given to the Russian army’s subsequent pursuit of the French across Europe over the next two years and the initial defeat of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Lieven’s account moves seamlessly between various levels of focus and analysis: the personalities and intrigues of monarchs, officers, and courtiers, the imperatives and alternatives of grand strategy, the nuances of diplomacy and coalition building, the intricacies of tactics, the influence of both man-made luck and natural geography, and the constraints of logistics, notably the all too important demands of fodder and the care of horses. Lieven’s depiction of the sheer scale and scope of the Russian mobilization effort across time and space might well be the most revealing aspect of the book. For two years the Russian Imperial state fed and supplied armies of tens of thousands of men as they first retreated across a scorched Russian landscape and later fought across the breadth of Europe. A reserve of eventually over 325,000 men supported these active forces. It was a stunning logistical achievement by any measure.</p>
<p>Lieven emphasizes that this was a collaborative process, negotiated from below as well as from above. He describes in detail the strategic, diplomatic, economic, and political planning that evolved throughout the campaign, as well as the mechanisms and institutions employed to implement state policies. Such efforts both preceded and continued long after the actual invasion and occupation of Imperial soil by the French. From below, in addition to the familiar tale of violent peasant resistance, Lieven describes the prodigious work of local officials and administrators, as well as volunteer provincial nobles and town merchant guilds. Yet while illustrating their achievement, Lieven notes that from both above and below these efforts were marked by a fair amount of improvisation and trial and error; moreover, he is careful not to shy away from the ugliness and suffering of war, as well as the intrigues, pettiness, and corruption that bedevilled the larger Russian war effort at all levels.</p>
<p>In an excellent conclusion, Lieven muses upon the war’s consequences, both foreseen and unintended, and the enduring tropes that came to dominate Russians’ understanding of their victory. His most compelling assertion is that ‘the truly bizarre and unique element in Russian mythology about the defeat of Napoleon is … that it radically underestimates the Russian achievement’(525). The demands of ethno-cultural national mythmaking dictated the celebration of the resistance of the Russian <italic>narod</italic> to foreign occupation, while the realities of the dynastic, multi-national empire that actually fought the war, much of it beyond the Empire’s borders, were downplayed. Lieven pointedly contrasts Tolstoy’s evocation of a spontaneous populist uprising with the strategy, preparation, skill, and resolve of Alexander and his chief advisers throughout this extended campaign.</p>
<p>Lieven reiterates without too much further comment the established wisdom that ‘victory legitimized and consolidated the existing regime’ (523), removing any impetus for comprehensive reform of a system rooted in autocracy and serfdom. Yet one might suggest that this was in part precisely because of the complexity and enormity of the Russian achievement. He paints Alexander as a hands-on manager of the overall war effort, even if the bitter experience of Austerlitz had taught him that actual field command was not his place. Throughout the campaign the Tsar maintained regular and private channels of information, command, and control over his army. As such, perhaps no one more than Alexander had a comprehensive picture of the failings and strengths of the autocratic system as it responded to a moment of existential crisis. These included the bitter social divisions, looting, and settling of scores among Russians of various classes, as well as the enormous reservoirs of resiliency, adaptability, and potential that underlay the seemingly rigid surface of the tsarist order. The latter no doubt confirmed Alexander’s belief in the essential viability of that very system as it passed its ultimate test.</p>
<p>In this sense Lieven’s snapshot of the years of war from 1812 to 1814 raises excellent questions regarding the evolution of the Russian military system in the decades leading up to the conflict with Napoleon. This is precisely the subject of Janet Hartley’s <italic>Russia 1762–1825: Military Power, the State, and the People</italic>. Her book has much to recommend it: it is ambitious in scope and depth, exhaustively researched, and filled with a wealth of information on the relationship between the Russian Imperial state, its armed forces, and the society which maintained both. In her introduction Hartley posits a potentially provocative thesis. She proposes to challenge the established interpretation of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Russia as a ‘garrison state’ through her exploration of three key issues: the multi-faceted costs of maintaining the armed forces, the consequences of such upon Russian institutional, legal, and bureaucratic developments, and the influence of warfare in the development of Russian national identity and patriotism.</p>
<p>Within these broad parameters, Hartley explores an impressively wide range of issues concerning the state–military–society interface. These include the impact of military needs upon industrial and agricultural development, the financial demands of continual warfare and the response of the state to meet such costs, and the nature of military service for soldiers and officers, as well as the effects of military occupation. Hartley examines these and other issues from a variety of perspectives, ranging from state officials in the central ministries to provincial administrators, as well as diverse social classes and ethnic communities across the Empire. As a result, in part, Hartley provides additional depth and detail to buttress conventional understandings of the imperial state, such as the influence of military officers in civilian administrative and judicial structures, the diversity and complexity of ethno-cultural exchange along the Empire’s various peripheries, and the centrality of military success for imperial expansion.</p>
<p>However, Hartley also challenges several established interpretations and tropes regarding the impact of military imperatives upon Russian social and political development. She argues that the military burden for much of the peasant populace was less than commonly believed, and that such burdens were disproportionately borne by the inhabitants of border areas. She further asserts that, despite the Russian nobility’s emphasis upon military service and despite the state’s own emphasis upon duty, the nobility was far from a rigidly ‘martial’ caste. Indeed, a central analytical theme of the book is that military needs and practices continually reinforced existing social and political arrangements rather than disrupting them. If Alexander was essentially convinced of the viability and security of the Russian political and social system, Hartley asserts that the near ruinous costs of the Napoleonic wars led him to his one truly innovative policy, the creation of the military colonies. She challenges the prevailing picture of the colonies as laboratories for Arakcheev’s pedantry and brutality, and argues instead that they were ‘an ambitious, even utopian attempt to deal with the strains imposed by the Napoleonic Wars and the need to maintain the armed forces’ (208). The aim was to create both a new breed of soldier and a new type of peasant, and eventually, in effect, an entirely new society in the countryside.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the book falls somewhat short of its more ambitious promises. Part of the problem is one of definitions. Hartley cites John Keep’s criteria for assessing militarism in the Russian case and she observes correctly that there are many potential varieties of militarism and militarization. However, her own ‘broad definition … that priority in a military state is given to military affairs, and the means for achieving victory in war, over all other areas of activity’ (5) is indeed so broad as to be analytically vague. A larger issue is that, having introduced her thesis, Hartley at times neglects to develop it in direct, systematic fashion in subsequent chapters. These chapters are richly descriptive but often provide less of an explicit framework of evaluation and analysis in terms of how the subject matter disproves the existence of a ‘garrison state’. In this sense the book’s virtues become at times problematic; Hartley addresses such a variety of topics that the connective thread between them can become vague. In a larger sense, by emphasizing the tendency of military practices and demands to reinforce existing political and social structures, she argues that ‘the failure to modernize institutions in general is an indication of the limited impact of warfare’(129). The result was that war led to neither a modernized nor a militarized state. However, it could instead be argued that by 1762, the starting point of Hartley’s study, the Empire’s politico-military model was already a ‘mature’ system, largely due to Peter the Great’s genius in harnessing existing social, political, cultural, and military structures while simultaneously incorporating new institutions and practices when and where necessary. As Hartley asserts, in many ways the Russian Empire’s military machine worked extraordinarily well throughout much of the eighteenth century, bringing victories and conquests on a grand scale. It was precisely this foundation that allowed the Empire to pass its ultimate test with Napoleon’s invasion. In short, the system worked; why would it be changed, or ‘modernized’? As Lieven notes, it is clear only in hindsight that at the Empire’s moment of triumph in 1815 the Industrial Revolution was about to profoundly alter the foundations of military power, rendering Russia’s military model, based upon the extensive exploitation of human resources and geo-strategic depth, untenable.</p>
<p>Lastly, an exhaustively researched monograph such as Hartley’s generally provides much of the raw material for a synthesis such as Lieven’s; in particular, Hartley richly documents the structural and institutional foundations upon which the mobilization engineered by Alexander and his commanders was constructed. As such, these two works would appear to be natural complements to each other, chronologically and conceptually. Yet it is ironic that despite being published within a year of each other, neither author explicitly references the other, and apparently they did not consult each other’s work.</p>
