<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this report is to show how our anatomical findings have influenced the design of the dorsal homodigital adipofascial turnover arterial flap to the thumb. Thirty-six thumbs from 18 fresh cadavers were dissected at the Fèr à Moulin Laboratoire (Paris, France) between January 1998 and March 1999. All branches of the proper digital artery (PDA) were identified. During the clinical study, from 2002 to 2008, 12 patients with dorsal thumb skin defects were treated with adipofascial turnover flaps. The dorsal branches of the PDA typically emerge at the level of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, 10 mm apart from the joint line. Based on the anatomical study, the flap could be designed predictably and reliably. The main advantages of dorsal adipofascial turnover flaps include their simplicity; the possibility of a one stage procedure; avoiding the use of tissue from elsewhere on the limb/body; minimal donor-site deformity; and avoidance of damage to the volar digital arteries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rich arterial supply of the dorsum of the hand and digits allows a large number of local flaps. In the thumb, the arterial pattern is different from that of the other digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412439168">Brunelli et al., 1999</xref>). For any pedicled flap based on the collateral palmar arteries, dissection that extends proximal to the metacarpophalangeal flexion crease can result in tension in the princeps pollicis artery, which can lead to devascularization of the flap or thumb. We have assessed the arterial supply of the thumb and designed a local flap based on this information.</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to show how our anatomical findings have influenced the design of the dorsal homodigital adipofascial turnover flap and describe our experience in 12 patients with complicated defects of the dorsum of the thumb.</p>

<title>Anatomical study</title>
<p>After approval from the scientific committee of the Fèr à Moulin Laboratoire (Paris, France), an anatomical study of the vascular system of the thumb was carried out in 18 fresh human cadaver hands. Thirty-six thumbs were dissected between January 1998 and March 1999. This study was performed simultaneously with other anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412439168">Braga Silva et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412439168">2005</xref>). The anatomical dissections were made by the same surgeon (JBS). The arteries were emphasized by slow injection of 35 ml of coloured latex (neoprene) into the brachial artery until the dorsum of the hand had become coloured. The latex was allowed to polymerize for 24 hours. The cadavers were then positioned supine, with the arms abducted to 90<sup>o</sup>, elbows extended, and forearms and hands pronated. A dorsal incision was made from the carpometacarpal joint to the base of the thumbnail, and the dorsal skin was dissected in a palmar direction. Direct visualization of the dorsal arterial branches of the proper palmar digital artery (PDA) was then possible. Dissections and observations were carried out with the aid of loupe magnification.</p>
<p>All branches of the proper digital arteries running to the dorsal skin were then identified. The dissection permitted the following topographic measurements: (1) distance between the origins of the cutaneous dorsal branch of the proper digital palmar arteries to the interphalangeal joint; and (2) diameters of the cutaneous dorsal branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412439168">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412439168">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Clinical study</title>
<p>Over a 6 year period (2002–2008) 12 patients with dorsal thumb soft tissue defects were treated using adipofascial turnover flaps. The full-thickness defects on the dorsum of the thumb included loss of skin, subcutaneous tissue, dorsal joint capsule, and part of the extensor tendon. After debridement, the size of the complex defect, including any exposed bone or tendon, ranged from 4.18 to 9.36 cm<sup>2</sup>. Before surgery all patients were able to actively extend the involved joint using the remaining intact part of the extensor tendon, although some patients had 10–15° extension lag. There were no defects of the sterile or germinal nail matrices.</p>
<p>Surgical technique: The flap was designed based on the anatomical study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412439168">Figure 3</xref>). Under brachial plexus block, the wounds were debrided and irrigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412439168">Figure 4</xref>). The flaps were designed to be 2–4 mm wider and 10 mm longer than the defect due to the length of the pedicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412439168">Figure 5</xref>). The skin was then carefully incised in an H shape. The skin flaps were raised at the level of the subdermal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412439168">Figure 6</xref>). Care was taken to preserve skin thickness on the lateral borders. The adipofascial flap was then dissected free from the underlying paratenon, until approximately 10 mm proximal to the metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joint (depending on the defect location, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193412439168">Figure 7</xref>), at the base of the flap. The base width was comprised by all thumb dorsum width and thickness was comprised of all soft tissues above the paratenon, which may vary according to percentage of patient body fat. The adipofascial flap was then turned back on its attached distal end to cover the defect and a full-thickness skin graft was applied over it. The donor site skin flaps were closed with polypropylene sutures. The hand was immobilized for 5–7 days, when the first dressing change was performed. Physiotherapy exercises were started after complete healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753193412439168">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>In the thumb, there are two main dorsal branches of each PDA, at both the ulnar and radial sides, and they emerge around the interphalangeal joint; one is always proximal and one distal to the joint. These vary unpredictably.

<title>Clinical study</title>
<p>There were 12 patients of a mean age of 29 (range 22–43) years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439168">Table 2</xref>). The adipofascial turnover arterial flap covered wounds on the dorsal aspect of the thumb in all patients. This clinical study was conducted until complete healing in all patients, which ranged between 9 and 16 months, with a mean follow-up of 11 months. All the flaps easily reached the limits of the defects. There were no signs of vascular compromise in any case where the tourniquet was intentionally released before the end of the procedure. The length of the flaps varied according to the size of the defects and donor sites. The use of data from our anatomic study permitted a predictable and reliable flap design. There were no instances of donor site skin necrosis, postoperative infection at donor or recipient sites, or long-term residual oedema of the thumbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1753193412439168">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Ten flaps healed uneventfully. There were two cases of distal margin necrosis, involving 25% of the flap (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439168">Table 2</xref>), with consequent compromise of the overlying skin graft. Complete healing was achieved 3 weeks later with appropriate wound care, without the need for further surgery. Secondary corrective cosmetic surgery was not needed. Patients maintained satisfactory thumb function. The range of motion of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the reconstructed thumb were compared with contralateral counterparts at least 9 months after surgery; the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412439168">Table 2</xref>. Two patients were lost to follow-up and could not be postoperatively tested. One patient had decreased range of motion of the non-operated as well as the operated thumb (due to congenital malformation).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Covering of dorsal or palmar hand, fingers, and thumb defects can be a challenging problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412439168">Braga Silva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412439168">Moschella and Cordova, 2006</xref>). Immediate closure is advantageous to preserve function and avoid complications. Factors that influence the use of flaps include exposure of vital structures such as bone, tendons, and nerves; size of the defect; and need for soft-tissue filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412439168">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412439168">Pelissier et al., 1999</xref>). Several types of flaps can be raised locally or from the forearm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412439168">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412439168">Moschella et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412439168">Brunelli et al. (1991)</xref> studied the dorsal arterial supply of the thumb in fresh cadavers and found a constant and independent vascular axis, especially on the ulnar side, which originates from the radial artery. This axis communicates at the level of the middle third of the proximal phalanx with the arterial palmar circuit, allowing the mobilization of a dorsal metacarpal skin flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412439168">Zancolli et al., 1988</xref>). The flap has a distal pedicle with reversed blood flow that can be used to cover dorsal and palmar tissue loss in the thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412439168">Nystrom et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the findings of the anatomical study, we have confirmed the existence of two constant dorsal branches originating from the PDA, itself, proximal and distal to the interphalangeal thumb joint, on each side. More importantly, we have shown that these branches arise at predictable sites. Our study supports the execution of a dorsal thumb adipofascial reverse flap based only on the subcutaneous tissue pedicle, as arterial branches are reliably found at fixed distances from the interphalangeal joint. According to these findings, avoiding dissection 10 mm proximal and 10 mm distal to the interphalangeal joint will always preserve all the cutaneous dorsal branches. In practice, the zone where the dorsal branches are located has to be marked out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412439168">Figure 6</xref>) and the most suitable vessels then included within the base of the flap, according to the defect.</p>
<p>The flap is drained by small venae concomitants that follow the arterial branches. The thumb is well drained by the palmar venous system, ensuring the venous return when the major dorsal system has been interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412439168">Lucas, 1984</xref>). We did not note any marked venous insufficiency, circulatory deficit at the donor site skin, tendon adhesion, or extension lag in our series. There was reduced sensibility over the flap as would be expected, but this was not of functional consequence.</p>
<p>A major factor that could preclude the use of this technique for a burn injury is its location. When it compromises the flap pedicle, more precisely the dorsal collateral arteries arising near the volar interphalangeal joint, in any burn depth, the vascularization is at risk and it is probably best to choose another type of reconstruction technique. We have used this turnover adipofascial flap for burns that do not reach the flap donor area. It may also be contraindicated in cases of severe circumferential crushing, because the branches may be injured, or partial degloving injuries involving the whole width of the dorsum, as flaps should be 2–4 mm wider than the defect for an optimal covering. The flap is also not appropriate for defects requiring simultaneous vascularized extensor tendon reconstruction, which can be done with other type of flaps.</p>
<p>The main advantages of adipofascial turnover flaps over other local or distant flaps are simplicity, possibility of a one stage surgery with regional anaesthesia, minimal donor site deformity, and sparing of the volar digital arteries with satisfactory cosmetic results.</p>
