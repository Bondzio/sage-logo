<p>In the spring of 1978, the first issue of <italic>Career Development for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (<italic>CDEI</italic>), the official journal of what was then known as the Division on Career Development (DCD), was published. The issue contained four full-length articles. These various articles provided an overview of the field, addressed testing and measurement, outlined methods to promote career development among elementary school students, and described a program fostering career development among children of American servicemen in Germany. The issue also featured a series of short articles providing overviews of various initiatives across the United States, an overview of articles published in other journals, and a review of books related to career development. Although no data-based studies were included in that issue, research was not altogether absent. The fledgling DCD Research Committee issued a call for abstracts describing ongoing research projects.</p>
<p>Thirty-five years later, that once fledgling journal is now known as <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (<italic>CDTEI</italic>) and is the leading journal in our field. This title change reflects the emphasis on transition that is a hallmark of the division, now known as the Division on Career Development and Transition (DCDT). In comparison to the inaugural issue, the most recently published issue featured four data-based articles employing a range of research methodologies, as well as a divisional position paper. Today, articles published in the journal reflect an increased emphasis upon scholarly rigor and a general evolution of the meaning of the term “transition.” No longer is preparation for adult life exclusively about career preparation. Transition now encompasses a broad set of skills, strategies, activities, and linkages that more fully reflect the complexities of being a happy and successful adult. This reality is widely evident in more recent issues of <italic>CDTEI</italic>.</p>
<p>Given the evolution of the journal and the broad brush we now employ when discussing “transition,” it is appropriate to revisit and recognize the work of previous pioneers in the field who initially laid and subsequently built upon this foundation, enabling <italic>CDTEI</italic> to become the premiere journal in the field of secondary transition. Additionally, it is important to look forward to consider needed areas of study and methodological applications that will equip the field to continue enhancing the in- and post-school outcomes for youth and young adults disabilities.</p>
<p>This issue in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the journal provides this unique opportunity. This collection of articles will enable you to gaze into the journal’s rearview mirror while also looking through the window of transition’s future. In this special issue, articles offer both a retrospective and prospective view of the journal, and particularly, the field of transition. The issue begins with three research articles addressing the myriad topics addressed in the journal (Madaus, Gelbar, Dukes, Faggella-Luby, Lalor, &amp; Kowitt, 2013), the contributions of empirical research and diverse methodologies to the transition knowledge base (Carter, Brock, Bottema, Bartholomew, Boehm, &amp; Cook, 2013), and the numerous authors who have contributed—individually and collaboratively—to the scholarly dialogue over these past three-and-a-half decades (Unger &amp; Rumrill, 2013). In each article, the authors describe intriguing trends, identify critical gaps, and offer directions for the future direction of the journal and the broader field.</p>
<p>The remaining articles are penned by prominent leaders in our field, including Michael Bullis, Carolyn Hughes, James Martin, Stan Shaw, and Paul Wehman. We invited each of these distinguished scholars (along with any collaborators) to reflect on several questions about the current state and future of the field: Where has the field of transition research been? Where are we now? Where <italic>might</italic> we be headed? Where <italic>should</italic> we go next? Each was encouraged to write candidly about their chosen topic and to offer reflections based on their own particular vantage point within the field. Each author examines the field through a historical lens and offers compelling recommendations on where our field ought to go next.</p>
<p>The journal—and indeed our field—has come quite a long way since that first issue appeared in mailboxes in the spring of 1978. The breadth of topics considered important in the lives of transition-age students has substantially broadened, the methodological tactics used to address questions that matter to the field have become more diverse, and the scholarship that makes its way into each of issue of the journal is increasingly collaborative. Additionally, the journal now appears in inboxes as well as mailboxes. As the invited authors each affirm in their reflections: we have come quite far, but much more of the journey still lies ahead. As you read this current issue, we encourage you to reflect on the role you might play in shaping the next 35 years of this journal and more broadly, transition as a whole.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
