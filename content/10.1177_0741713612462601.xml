<abstract>
<p>Every aspect of a community’s life and values in indigenous Africa provide the theoretical framework for education. The holistic worldview of the traditional system places a strong emphasis on the centrality of the human element and orature in the symmetrical relationship between life and learning. This article focuses on proverbs and the words that form them as important sources of, and foundation for, indigenous African education. The article analyzes proverbs and the power of the spoken word in indigenous African pedagogy. The analysis is used to argue for an increased articulation of indigenous African knowledge into the dialogue on the inclusion of non-Western traditions in the theoretical frameworks for adult education. The article uses the traditional contexts of Ogu and Yoruba of West Africa but draws examples mostly from Yoruba proverbs to present their epistemological significance in traditional African education.</p>

<p>As I scan the body of literature for related work that provide some theoretical compass for the opening of this article, I read and was fascinated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713612462601">Brookfield’s (2010)</xref> combing of the expanded literature on, and presentation of, “Africentrism” as part of the theoretical framework for understanding the field of adult and continuing education. Although I have reservations about some aspects of his rendering of the Africentric perspective, I agree with some of his observation on the African paradigm. His analysis was correct on the point that the African perspective conceives of education as a process of evolving institutions that “stress community, interdependence, and collective action” (p. 73). Part of my reservation about the Africentric paradigm include the fact that it derives from the copious body of literature that Brookfield cited on one hand and that it is based on racial identity. Although these “theoretical foundations” fit into the historico-cultural experience of the African in diaspora, it dilutes or ignores some core of the lifelong frameworks of indigenous African education. The first and most important “theoretical” frameworks in indigenous African education are the ancestors whose “theories” are passed on to all generations through the power of the spoken word situated in different layers of orality. It is through these “frameworks” from the ancestors that the absolute objective of education—developing good character to be an active citizen (<italic>Ọmọlúàbí</italic>/M<italic>edagbe</italic>)—is achieved. These frameworks from the ancestors are so important that an individual’s opinion on any issue or an answer to any question is validated by reference to the words of ancestors. Indeed, education is often synonymous with good character that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713612462601">Fatunmbi (2006)</xref> connects it with reincarnation of ancestors in <italic>Ifá</italic> theology. The role of the ancestors as the theorists in the educational process is nondebatable so much so that “whenever someone is asked a question, no personal opinion is given until there has been a quote from the wisdom of the ancestors in form of either a proverb or a verse of <italic>Ifá</italic> oral scripture” (p. 18).</p>
<p>This article focuses on proverbs as theoretical frameworks for lifelong learning in indigenous Africa, and it acknowledges the ancestors as the original source of proverbs. The article does not present a “problem” in the typical sense of a research problem. Instead, it attempts to overcome the problem of moving ideas from a periphery and circular worldview to a dominant and linear framework. <italic>The article shares how the medium of proverbs can be used to highlight the power of the spoken word in indigenous African education.</italic> Furthermore, the article argues that the power of words subsists mostly in proverbs and thus analyzes proverbs as important frameworks of indigenous education. The framework provided by proverbs affirms the ancestors as the real theorists of Africentric education. The approach in this article is not a critique of existing literature on theoretical frameworks on indigenous education. Although the line of argument sometimes resembles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713612462601">Newman’s (2012)</xref> “mutinous thought” on transformative learning in its offer of a different (albeit strange) source of theoretical framework for understanding the field, the article does not have the power to affect any intellectual mutiny. The purpose of the article is supported in literature and includes the efforts of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713612462601">Avoseh (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612462601">2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713612462601">Chilisa (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612462601">Freire (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713612462601">1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713612462601">Merriam (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713612462601">Merriam and Associates (2007)</xref>, and several others who have argued for the need to go beyond the dominant framework in discussing 21st-century education. Some of them have also severally offered the indigenous or non-Western perspectives as one source outside the dominant platform. The traditional African perspective is one of those outside the main stream that has received some attention in literature in recent times. This perspective is heavily reliant on the power of the spoken word. Tapping and using the power of words in indigenous African education manifests in several ways including incantation, prayers and divination, curse, and the use of proverbs. The purpose of this article is to present proverbs as important theoretical frameworks within the larger dialogues encouraging contributions from non-Western perspectives.</p>

<title>The Power of Words</title>
<p>My original understanding and rendering of proverb as a concept have always been within its Ogu and Yoruba understandings of <italic>òló</italic> and <italic>òwe</italic>, respectively. I am also aware that the English equivalent of these concepts is the word proverb. Even Yoruba–English and English–Yoruba dictionaries written by a first speaker of Yoruba do not go beyond the <italic>òwe/</italic>proverb definitions. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713612462601">Fakindele (2003)</xref> defines proverb as “<italic>òwe</italic>” (p. 332) and defines <italic>òwe</italic> as “proverb, adage” (p. 623). Almost all English dictionaries have the same pattern of definition of proverb. These definitions range from its Latin etymology to its Biblical root. Common to the many dictionary definitions are wisdom, adage, didactic, and so on. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</ext-link> (2011), for instance, defines the concept, among others, as “a short popular saying, usually of unknown and ancient origin, that expresses effectively some commonplace truth or useful thought; adage; saw.” In biblical terms, it defines proverb as “a profound saying, maxim, or oracular utterance requiring interpretation.”</p>
<p>In addition to dictionary definitions, authors on the subject of proverbs in indigenous African education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612462601">Agbaje, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713612462601">Brookman-Amissah, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713612462601">Mayr, 1912</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713612462601">Mustapha, Adebowale, Alagbe, &amp; Oyerinde, 2009</xref>) generally agree on most of its common characteristics including brevity, wisdom, criticality, abstract nature, and succinctness in addition to being a reservoir of experience. Some scholars of African traditional education and philosophy have used context-dependent figures of speech to define and emphasize the importance of proverbs. In his depiction of the high premium placed on the art of conversation among the Igbo people of Nigeria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713612462601">Achebe (1994)</xref> says that “proverbs are the palm oil with which words are eaten” (p. 7). It must be noted that palm oil is a central ingredient to most food items in West Africa, hence the appropriateness of the palm oil metaphor. For the Yoruba, <italic>òwe lẹsin ọrọ bί ọrọ ba sọnù òwe la fiί wa</italic>. Literarily, proverbs are race horses that words use; and when words are lost, proverbs are used to search and find them. In other words, proverbs go beyond the generic to unearth meaning and provide clarification. No wonder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713612462601">Delano (1979)</xref> aptly titled his classic book on Yoruba proverbs, their meaning, and usage <italic>Owe lẹsin ọrọ.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612462601">Mbiti (1969)</xref> identifies “proverbs and oral traditions” as part of the source of the philosophical systems of many African peoples (p. 2). It is not only Mbiti who connects proverbs to African philosophy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741713612462601">Banjo (1979)</xref> refers to proverbs as “a repository of Yoruba philosophy” (p. v). In addition to its philosophical underpinnings, Mbiti goes further to add a theological significance to proverbs by insisting that “African knowledge of God is expressed in proverbs” (p. 29). Mbiti further establishes the fact that the power of the spoken word is mystical. Again, the mystical dimensions connect to the ancestors who are the closest to humans from the body of the spiritual world. He gives the example of the words of parents carrying mystical power (which may be positive or negative) when addressed to their offspring. He also uses the example of the power of the words of the medicine man/woman, which are considered more important than the medicine they dispense. His exact words are apposite here. “There is mystical power in words, especially those of senior person to a junior one, in terms of age, social status, or office position. . . . The words of the medicine-man (woman) work through the medicine he (she) gives” (p. 197). Proverbs combine the power of words both in their ordinary and mystical dimensions to unearth knowledge or to “stupefy thieves so that they can be caught red-handed; . . . make inanimate objects turn into biologically living creatures” (p. 198). The power of words using the medium of proverbs is especially used to invoke the power of what the Ogu and Yoruba refer to as <italic>òsẹ/orí</italic>, which is the individuality element in Ogu and Yoruba ontology of a person. The power of words is an integral part of reversing a bad <italic>òsẹ/orí</italic>.</p>
<p>The philosophical, linguistic, and religio-theological importance of proverbs is not limited to the Yoruba, Ogu, or indeed the African worldview. Many cultures and peoples of the world have proverbs that serve important socio-epistemological purposes in their world. Hence, it is easy to agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713612462601">D’Angelo’s (1977)</xref> assertion that “almost every nation has its share of proverbs and wise sayings” (p. 366). The Book of Proverbs in the Bible connects with most of our definitions above and especially validates the fact that religious connections of proverbs predate most of human history. In terms of the philosophical roots and importance of the spoken word and by implication, proverbs, one can point to the Socratic dialogues and Socrates’ efforts to use deep words to help the Athenians of his time deliver indubitable and useful knowledge founded on sound logic and objectivity. In his dialogue in the first book of the <italic>Republic</italic>, he engaged Cephalos, Polemarchos, and another individual on the subject of justice. Socrates uses the power of logic and his ability to weave words into abstract patterns to make his companions be more critical in their conception of justice. One of his statements during this dialogue in Book I (332B-333D) has its parallel in a Yoruba proverb. Socrates poses the question “then if a man is a good guardian of anything, he is also a good thief of the same thing?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713612462601">Republic Book I, 1956</xref>, p. 132). The Yoruba will say <italic>olè lo mnọ ẹsẹ olè tọ lórί àpáta</italic> (A thief knows how to trace and lift the footprints of another thief even on a rock). Lines of convergence are possible within the Socratic and the Yoruba examples above. One such connection is that whoever encodes can decode. For the Yoruba and Ogu, proverbs are for encoding and decoding useable knowledge, knowledge that separates <italic>awo</italic> from <italic>ógbẹrì</italic>, that is, separates the deep and critical from the superficial. Proverbs provide foundation for creating objective and useable knowledge, which ensures that individual conduct aligns with community values in line with the dictates of the ancestors.</p>

<title>The Context</title>
<p>The context of this article is within a holistic worldview where everything connects to everything else. It is a setting where there is always a causal link and the people’s reading and naming of the world is based on the inter-play of cause–effect that connects life to ancestors. In spite of its oral nature, the traditional African context is heavily laden in observation, which is used to validate the experience of the ancestors and elders as the indubitable sources of knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713612462601">Chilisa (2012)</xref> expresses the connection to and importance of observation better with the Setswana saying “<italic>Mafoko a mathong</italic>,” literally meaning “words are from what you observe” (p. 79). The pervasive oral nature of life in the context of the average Ogu and Yoruba communities requires individuals to be observant and have reasonable command of language and demonstrate the same through the choice of words in social interactions. Most social interactions, especially at the levels of negotiations and adjudications, require intellectual abilities manifest in the very best use of the spoken word. Typical examples include invoking the spirit of the ancestors, matters of land disputes, resolving tribal conflicts, negotiating bride price, important family and community decisions that come through consensus, presenting one’s case before elders or the king in council (everyone was his/her own “attorney” in the traditional community), and amicable resolution of conflicts. For the Ogu and the Yoruba, proverbs are the intellectual source of encoding and decoding across all strata of human endeavor. For them the process of encoding and decoding involves criticality, observation, and the totality of processed life experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713612462601">Mustapha et al. (2009)</xref> established some sources and definitions (and by implication, uses) of Yoruba proverbs that are connected to the traditional context of Yoruba culture. Their central definition of <italic>òwe</italic> (proverb) is “<italic>Ọrọ tí ó fi ìjìnlẹ ọgbón àwon àgbà àtijọ hàn nίpa ohunkóhun . . . ni à ń pè òwe</italic>” (p. 94). That is, a proverb represents words of critical wisdom based on the tested experience of ancestors. The use of the words <italic>àgbà àtijọ</italic> (elders of ancient times) in this definition of the concept gives the copyright of proverbs to ancestors and, by implication, makes the ancestors the authorities on its use. The fact that the ancestors have intellectual ownership of proverbs makes proverbs educational and instructional resources that are accessible to all. Furthermore, the definition is a reminder that the ancestors still overlook the context, content, and objectives of education in every community. The objectives of education in the community are humanistic and focus on the symmetry between individual and corporate interests. Within the oral nature of indigenous lifelong learning, a proverb well put in perspective may be tantamount to presenting a whole book to a student (young or old). This is the context where proverbs provide theoretical foundations for education, especially for adult and higher education that connects to several levels of cults. Cults, especially secret cults, were the highest institutions of learning and their members served as “professors” and “instructors” at other levels of indigenous “higher education.” It is important to note that proverbs are considered so important to adult and higher education, especially at the level of secret cults, that their uses are “regulated” through cultural etiquette. Part of that etiquette is that children and even young adults are not expected to use proverbs in the presence of elders. For a younger person to employ proverbs in the presence of an elder, without observing the proper social protocol of giving obeisance, is generally considered intellectual pomposity and lack of proper up-bringing or lack of knowledge of the culture. So, whereas proverbs are part of educational foundation and are used to gauge the quality of an individual’s education, especially the ability to combine criticality with other life issues, the improper use of proverbs may also be indicative of poor education. What is true of the Yoruba and the Ogu may not be applicable to other African peoples and cultures, hence the need for contextual clarification.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713612462601">Avoseh (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612462601">2001)</xref> emphasized the fact that one is always compelled to make clarifications (and rightly so) before making any generalizations on concepts or issues with respect to traditional Africa or even on a linguistic or cultural groups within Africa. The tsunamic diversity of indigenous and in fact 21st-century Africa makes such clarifications imperative for discussing and applying any concept <italic>under the huge African sun of diversity</italic>. In terms of proverbs, almost every African people have their set of proverbs. Hence, there are Zulu, Hausa, Kikuyu, Oshiwambo, Herero, Akan, Ashanti, Ebira, Ogu, and Yoruba proverbs among thousands of others. Although each people’s set of proverbs derive from the context of their ancestors, the logic and universal applicability of such proverbs are never in doubt. The reference point of this article is the Ogu and Yoruba contexts of Southwest Nigeria because of their cultural and geographical proximity, in addition to the fact that this author was raised in the combined context of both peoples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612462601">Avoseh (2010)</xref> noted elsewhere that “the Ogu and the Yoruba are deeply traditional people whose holistic worldviews are similar especially in terms of education, religion, morality, governance and social relations” (p. 9). The proverbs I use in this article are mostly Yoruba, because there is more literature (written) on Yoruba proverbs. As mentioned earlier, the oral nature of the traditional context makes proverbs very indispensable in packaging deep knowledge into few words. Orality/Orature bestrides every facet of life in most indigenous societies and especially those of the Yoruba and Ogu.</p>
<p>The term <italic>orature</italic> or <italic>orality</italic> was said to have been first used by East African literary scholars, mainly Pio Zirimu and Ngugi Wa Thiongo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713612462601">Ehusani, 1991</xref>). Orature captures the unwritten nature of most of traditional African body of knowledge, history, and laws and regulations that governed life. Consequently, most literary efforts by African scholars that relate to indigenous African have had to rely on orality as “a theoretical foundation for historical, philosophical, or literary work in Africa” (p. 121). Hence, the concept covers the length and breadth of the African worldview and epistemological frameworks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713612462601">Vambe (2004)</xref> provides a much more comprehensive definition of the concept with his assertion that it is “broad and elastic, including everything from allegory, folktale, spirit possession, fantasy and myth to ancestor veneration, ritual, legends, proverbs, fables and jokes” (p. 235). Orality thus manifests in learning through proverbs. Again, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713612462601">Fatunmbi (2006)</xref> uses the example of <italic>Ifá</italic> to establish the point that proverbs give the copyright of knowledge and wisdom to the ancestors and <italic>Ifá</italic>. In some contexts, where the traditional democratic process was based on consensus, the ability to use appropriate proverbs to push one’s view is an asset. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713612462601">Wiredu (2000)</xref> cites the Ashanti of Ghana as a people that value “rational discussion” in their democratic process hinged mostly on consensus. According to Wiredu, the power of the spoken words is so important among the Ashanti that “the capacity for elegant and persuasive discourse was made one of the most crucial qualifications for high office” (p. 4). In a context, as the example of the Ashanti above, proverbs become part of the evidence of the quality of an individual’s educational attainment necessary for leadership.</p>
<p>What is true of the Ashanti example above is true across Africa irrespective of geo-cultural and other differences. Every indigenous African context relied heavily on the power of the spoken word in all facets of human activity. In fact, a Yoruba historian traces the spoken word and its power to Olodumare (Supreme Being/God). Citing other authorities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713612462601">Ologundudu (2008)</xref> affirmed that “(Họ Rọ) Họ who was a descendant of Olodumare, is what the Yoruba call Ọrò”. Ologundudu goes further to underline the fact that the Yoruba believes that words have powerful “spiritual significance,” which allowed their progenitors to communicate with “the other element of nature.” According to him, “many of the traditional Yoruba believe that knowledgeable people can use invocation and incantations to change the nature of things like mood, feelings of people and different elements” (p. 37). The same is true of the Ogu.</p>
<p>In those days and even in today’s world, the power of the spoken word is still very potent in those areas that Ologundudu refers to in Yoruba culture. Deep words, as those combined in proverbs, are also used in Ọfò, that is incantation, or in ògèdè—mystical language, magical invocation of Olodumare and His ministers (deities/lesser gods) especially before worship. The uses of words in such contexts as these above require specific education and training. Semiformalized training in the use of words in these contexts (i.e., incantations/invocations) goes with the “educational” process in most related professions including hunters, diviners, and traditional medical practitioners. Within the context of the Ogu and the Yoruba, a proverb may condense thousands of powerful words into half a dozen suprapowerful words. In spite of the power and place of proverbs, they do not empower individuals in an a priori way. Only education empowers individuals to attain the purpose of life and living, which is to be <italic>Omolúàbí</italic>—an active citizen. The epistemological powers of proverbs therefore subsist in and are sustained by the powers that education confers. Let us now briefly examine proverbs in indigenous African lifelong education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741713612462601">
<title>Epistemological Framework</title>
<p>The reference to foundations of education varies along geo-contexts and even between institutions in the same geo-zone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713612462601">Jarvis (1990)</xref> makes a distinction between America and the United Kingdom in the study of “foundation courses,” especially in adult education. The use of educational foundations in this article is more along the American and most African uses where educational foundations include the philosophical, psychological, historical, and sociological approaches to the study. The seamless nature of the content of traditional African education makes its foundation a combination of the abstract, the philosophical, the moral, historical, the sociological, as well as the theological. This eclectic nature of lifelong education in traditional Africa also makes it, especially within the context of the Yoruba and the Ogu, receptive to all genres of proverbs as important parts of its epistemological foundations. First, indigenous lifelong education is such that it weaves a web around all areas of human existence. This interconnectedness between education and other areas of life puts education in everything and everything into education. The holistic nature of the African worldview has its advantages, but it also makes certain things very difficult to explain to the outsider of the traditional African mindset. Whereas one can easily pick levels of education from P-12 through graduate education in the Western educational system, doing so within indigenous education is almost impossible. In spite of the complexity, traditional African education has very clear objectives. These objectives may vary from community to community in terms of certain specifics, but they connect to the universal traditional objective of building an active citizen. The criteria for becoming an active citizen are synonymous with those of education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612462601">Avoseh (2001)</xref> noted that it is “difficult to draw a line between the contents of lifelong learning and criteria of active citizenship” because “both run through the life of every citizen, sometimes extending beyond birth and death” (p. 482). Both sets of criteria for lifelong learning and active citizenship however neatly converge in the absolute objective of traditional education, which for the Ogu and the Yoruba is being <italic>Medagbe</italic> or an <italic>Omolúàbí</italic>, respectively. <italic>Ọmọlúàbí</italic> is an individual of model character, one who balances knowledge and vocation and who reinvests the dividends of education in the community. The process of educating an <italic>Omolúàbí</italic> is complex and employs blended content and process within the one-size fits all “classroom” represented by the entire community—from the individual mat room through the market place to the farm of every community. Proverbs are part of the mix content and process that follow every student everywhere. Proverbs and the words that constitute them flow from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713612462601">Freire and Macedo (1987)</xref> refer to as flowing from the people’s “reading of the world.” These words are words of “experts” from a continuum that stretches from the ancestors to elders in the community. They are, to borrow from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713612462601">Freire and Macedo (1987)</xref>, “the people’s words, pregnant with the world, words from the people’s (ancestors’) reading of the world” (p. 35). Consequently, all genres of proverbs are educational in all ramifications because they derive from the holistic world that makes learning a process of living in a community as well as making living a process of learning. This across-board application of proverbs does not however imply that proverbs are thrown around haphazardly. Rather, there is the central criterion of appropriateness to content and context. Hence, used appropriately, even sexual proverbs that are sometimes laced with subtle obscenity are effective moral and educational “books” of orality. The following are a number of proverbs that are used to analyze the epistemological frameworks that proverbs provide in indigenous African education. Our analysis of proverbs as educational foundations aligns with the analytical framework of meanings of proverbs provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713612462601">Penfield and Duru (1988)</xref>. Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713612462601">Nwoga (1975)</xref>, the authors established the fact that the analytical framework combines three levels of meaning of proverbs, namely: the “text or literal, the generalized moral and cultural principles or the philosophical and the meaning defined by specific interactional context or contextual meanings” (p. 121). The advantage of using this method of analyzing proverbs as framework in indigenous education is that it allows the combination of several genres of proverbs and their import.</p>
<p>In his presentation of African sexual proverbs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713612462601">Ojoade (1983)</xref> confirms the educational and moral import of even sexual proverbs. He contends that in spite of the fact that such proverbs are perceived to be obscene, they “express valuable ethical precepts which are fully accepted and esteemed” (p. 202). Our first example is therefore a sexual-related proverb found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612462601">Agbaje’s (2002)</xref> work on proverbs and conflict resolution. Although he uses the proverb “<italic>Inú ni okó ẹyẹ ń ngbé</italic>—A bird’s penis resides inside it” (p. 239) within the context of conflict resolution, its education significance is as important. Agbaje rightly puts this proverb in the allusive bracket and explains that it is narrated “when someone knows a secret and wants to use the knowledge to cause confusion between people” (p. 240). Conflict resolution and peaceful coexistence are integral parts of the traditional education content, especially with emphasis on putting the collective interest over and above one’s selfish interests. Another education aspect of a proverb as the one above is that the ability to keep secrets is imperative at most educational levels, especially at semi-formal age-group initiations and related education and training. Examples in this category are the orò and zangbethọ cults, <italic>thanvotun</italic> priestly training of the Ogu, and up to the adult and higher educational levels of secret cults. In all secret cults and elders councils, the ability to keep secrets is both a criterion of graduation and a measure of education. It is possible to connect this proverb to Knowles’ establishment of experience as the adult learner’s greatest book. The connection is that the ability to process and pronounce experience makes it different from mere bibliography. Processing experience implies, among other things, the ability to recognize when “silence is golden.”</p>
<p>Although the ancestors have copyrights of proverbs and only they are acknowledged when proverbs are used, I have taken some of the proverbs in this article from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713612462601">Delano’s (1979)</xref> list of Yoruba proverbs. I use some proverbs from a published format for ease of reference for readers who might be interested in a further review of proverbs. The meaning and analysis of the proverbs as presented in this article are based on my existential knowledge and understanding of such proverbs. My analysis of the proverbs and the connections made to adult learning are informed by the need to provide some avenue for using them in the content and practice of adult education. The challenges of moving ideas from a holistic worldview to a linear mindset and vice versa make it impossible for anyone to establish any a priori prescriptive steps on how to use proverbs for pedagogical activities. Furthermore, the contextually and flexibility essentials of proverbs negate the idea of a prescriptive use of proverbs. These facts notwithstanding, the presentation in this article makes proverbs available as part of an epistemological process. Proverbs are useful for any content or pedagogical activity that includes learners as coinvestigators of knowledge who are challenged to higher levels of critical thinking. For instance, proverbs are useful in any content or pedagogical activity that involves dialogue. In such a learning environment, proverbs may be used to provide the type of distinction that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713612462601">Freire and Macedo (1995)</xref> draw between dialogue as “a mere technique” (p. 379) and dialogue that leads to conscientization. Proverbs provide the type of intellectual curiosity necessary for criticality and for demonstration of deep understanding. The content, context, and learners will help educators blend their understanding of proverbs into curriculum and pedagogical activities as necessary. I present a couple of proverbs below and make brief connections of their analysis to education, especially adult learning.</p>
<p><italic>Alágbára má mọ èrò baba ọlẹ</italic> (p. 5). Literarily, the thoughtless powerful or strong individual is the chief of lazy people. Beyond the surface meaning is the proverb’s emphasis on the need to connect theory and practice, thought and action. The proverb teaches the propriety of putting smartness into hard work and connecting knowledge to the realities of the community. One can draw a line between this proverb and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612462601">Paulo Freire’s (2004)</xref> analysis of praxis where he emphasizes the imperative of the action and reflection symmetry. For him “action/reflection = word = work = praxis” (p. 87). He proceeds to affirm that human beings are built in “word, in work, in action-reflection” (p. 88). Freire continues in the next couple of pages to explain action/reflection as an existential necessity for transformation and for problem-solving education. What Freire explains with hundreds of words, Yoruba proverbs give the “student” in six words. It is left to the Yoruba or any adult student to do the mental analysis of the proverb and apply it within the specific process.</p>
<p>The next proverb has some link with the previous ones <italic>Alẹ tí kò ti ojú ẹni lẹ a kì ímọ òkùnkùn rẹ rìn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713612462601">Delano, 1979</xref>, p. 6). That is, if night does not fall in one’s presence, it will be difficult to walk in its darkness. Depending on the context, the proverb could be used to warn against making hasty judgments or dabbling into issues over which one does not have the details. Socrates’ axiom “the unexamined life is not worth living” is also another way to render this proverb. It reminds the individual to whom it is addressed of the need to critically analyze and understand situations before taking action. It further stresses the need to make one’s action a clear demonstration of understanding of the issues at stake. Applied to today’s adult learning, the proverb reminds us of the need to understand the adult learner’s context in our program planning efforts. This proverb and related ones will especially sit well with most aspects of the Interactive Model of Program Planning, especially “client analysis” and related issues as espoused in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713612462601">Caffarella’s (2002)</xref> work on program planning. A clear understanding of the context of today’s adult learner is a necessary condition for developing programs that meet the needs of adult learners because adult education is context-dependent.</p>
<p><italic>Ayé l’òkun ènìyàn l’ọsà, àìmọwẹ kò le gbádùn ayé</italic> (p. 43) literally means the world is an ocean and people in it are rivers, knowing how to swim is therefore a necessary condition for living and enjoying life. This proverb can be a lesson plan on several topics ranging from diversity, acknowledging difference, the need for a broadened knowledge and outlook to life, tolerance, including the need to be tactful in dealing with others (political correctness?). Comparing the world to an ocean and humans to rivers puts pressure on the individual(s) to whom the proverb is addressed to think deep and make the connections. In making such connections, the individual is compelled to veer into the domain of geography or oceanography (trying to understand the ocean), psychology (trying to understand human behavior), and the ability to figure it all out to understand the message. The reference to the imperative of the skills of swimming in relation to the ocean and rivers underline the fact that diversity is part of human existence. The individual who ignores difference will live an unfulfilled life. The connection to diversity links up with the need for peaceful coexistence in spite of individual peculiarities.</p>
<p>The proverb ẹ<italic>ni tó yá ẹgbẹfà tí kò san án, ó bẹgi dínà egbejè</italic> literally means “he/she who borrows 1,200 (of any currency) and does not pay back when due forfeits the opportunity to secure a 1,400 loan.” This proverb can be used to teach a lesson in several subject areas but we use it here as a lesson in credits, mathematics, and trust. The mathematical aspect is simple yet requires a mastery of basic multiplication skills. The two numerals in this proverb are 1,200 (<italic>Ẹgbẹfà</italic>) and 1,400 (<italic>Egbejè</italic>). Analyzing these numbers within the Yoruba system of numeration, is, in itself, a mini-lesson in mathematics. The Yoruba system of numeration combines and switches between addition, multiplication, and subtraction. For example, <italic>Ẹgbẹfà</italic> is [<italic>igba mẹfa</italic>: 200 multiplied by 6] = 1,200. <italic>Egbejè</italic> is 200 multiplied by 7 = 1,400. The student to whom this proverb is addressed will need to do a quick math and then decode the message, which includes the need to be trustworthy and reliable, to be creditworthy, and, most important, the moral obligation of fairness to one’s creditor.</p>
<p>The next proverb teaches the importance of dialogue and especially intellectual humility. The Yoruba say <italic>Ọgbọn ọlọgbọn ni a nfi s.ọgbọn, ìmọràn ẹnì kan kò jọ bọrọ</italic>, literally that “we become wiser or smarter through learning from other people. One person’s understanding or perspective does not amount to much in terms of knowledge.” Implicit in this proverb is the imperative of dialogue, especially the ability to listen. Listening to other’s perspective connects to the need to eschew intellectual self-sufficiency similar to the conditions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612462601">Freire (2004)</xref> established for horizontal dialogue in liberating education. This proverb is also invoked to stress the importance of consensus, which was the framework of the traditional African “mango tree or village square” democracy.</p>
<p>Delano also uses the proverb <italic>Bί ará ilé ẹni bá ńjẹ kòkòrò burúkú bí a kò bá tètè sọ fun, hẹrẹhùrù rẹ kò ní jẹ kí a sùn l’óru</italic> (p. 11). In other words, when one’s neighbor is eating all kinds of harmful insects, one should hasten to warn such a neighbor, otherwise when she/he falls sick with cough or other ailments, her/his cough or noises of agony at night will disturb one’s sleep. As an aside, it is important to note that houses in those days were built from natural materials that did not have the noise-proof or prison-like walls that adorn most of today’s houses. In such settings, neighbors were real neighbors who lived close and the slightest noise from one house easily reaches the others. This proverb provides humanistic, moral, political, and civic foundations for education. The moral imperative is the need to be one’s neighbor’s keeper by being interested in her/his well-being. The proverb is also invoked to emphasize the importance of civic responsibility and commitment to corporate interest. When a member of a group involved in a learning or community assignment is lagging behind, the proverb reminds other members of the group that they need to motivate the lazy member lest her/his lack of efforts hamper the group’s success. In the age of globalization, this proverb can be invoked to justify the need for countries, global or regional organizations to intervene in matters in other parts of the globe. If a dictator decides to suffocate freedom and the democratic spirit in a given country, that is, tantamount to “eating harmful” political insects, then other countries must check such dictatorship. In the same vein, it is the entire world’s business to intervene when demonic terrorism is breeding in any part of the world because the damage from terrorism cuts across boundaries. Again, the extent to which the proverbs used as examples in this article, as indeed any proverb, makes sense and provides a theoretical framework depends on the context and the subject matter. The ability to weave proverbs into fitting situations is a special one and belongs to the higher order intellectual domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713612462601">Brookman-Amissah (1986)</xref> puts the point on context and flexibility well and it is worth repeating. It is that “an essential aspect of a proverb is its contextuality” and that there is “considerable flexibility in the application of proverbs to situations” (p. 75).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has attempted to present the power of words couched in proverbs as theoretical frameworks for lifelong learning in indigenous African education. The article has presented a sketch of education in indigenous Africa as a process that is coterminous with life and living in any community. The historical and theoretical foundations of education are traced back to the ancestors who are the de facto “theorists” in education. Words, especially put into proverbs, are important aspects of every activity in the life of a family and that of a community because such activities are almost always educational opportunities. Furthermore, the whole community serves as a huge classroom with everyone serving as a “teacher” or “student” at different points and in different contexts. The process of living as learning and learning as living emphasizes applied education that requires a combination of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612462601">Freire (2004)</xref> calls praxis, that is, putting reflection into action and basing action on reflection. The reflection or intellectual aspect of indigenous education depends solely on Orature. The oral nature of the process makes the ability to weave words into deep patterns and to decode such patterns a necessary condition for criticality in the traditional lifelong learning process.</p>
<p>I adopt the analytic framework to present several proverbs as one aspect of the many frameworks and uses of the power of the spoken word in indigenous African education. Proverbs provide the historical (date back to the ancestors and their deep observations and experience), spiritual, moral, as well as intellectual frameworks of indigenous education. I have tried to highlight the importance of the spoken word in education in indigenous Africa generally. One must admit that the recognition of the use of deep words or proverbs is not an exclusive of traditional Africa because the same is true of most indigenous peoples across the globe. I use the example of the Socratic dialogue in my analysis. However, there are other examples in the early history of adult education. The efforts of W. F. Grundtvig in Denmark at ensuring that the Danish language was used for literacy education for Danish farmers of his time was an example of the power of the people’s language and culture as frameworks for education. Most of the modern and recent process models including andragogy, pragmatism, self-directed learning, and Conscientization, and learning theories including transformative learning and Theory of Margin, for instance, have dialogue as the core of their process and they all acknowledge the power of the spoken word. Any content or pedagogical activity that aligns with any of these models or theories and related ones will find it appropriate to infuse proverbs without diluting content or outcome. For instance, it will be difficult to use any of the dialogic process models, andragogy, for instance, from the Western perspective to float a literacy or related program in most parts of rural Africa today and expect any success without knowledge of the framework advanced in this article. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713612462601">Ọmọlewa, Adeola, Adekanmbi, Avoseh, and Braimoh (1998)</xref> demonstrated the importance and success of using the people’s theoretical framework in their use of proverbs, oral texts, and cultural groups for a literacy program in Southwestern Nigeria. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713612462601">Chilisa’s (2012)</xref> publication on indigenous research methods further supports the conclusion of this article that the indigenous framework provides an integral new look at the idea of theoretical framework in adult education, at least in the Africentric sense. My conclusion supports and is supported by Chilisa’s argument that 21st-century researchers can “draw from indigenous knowledge systems to theorize about methods and research processes” (p. 100).</p>
<p>It is in respect of the foregoing that proverbs, because of their depth and succinctness, provide important epistemological foundations for traditional education. This article has used some Yoruba proverbs to demonstrate that the dexterous use of proverbs puts pressure on the learner’s intellectual ability to think. In trying to decode a proverb, an individual is compelled to analyze, compare, interpret, and draw conclusions. It is in this respect that a six-word proverb can carry the weight of a six-chapter book. The other side of the foundational relevance of Yoruba and Ogu proverbs is that they are not just suitable for indigenous lifelong learning but that they are applicable in most of contemporary education, especially in areas related to Africentric frameworks. It is also hoped that the central arguments of this article provide a little addition to the existing understanding of adult learning in a globalized context.</p>
