<abstract>
<p>This study reports the results of a field experiment that assessed the relationship between free-play coupon value and a player’s slot gaming volume. Selected players in the customer database of a Las Vegas hotel casino received either a $50 or a $100 free-play incentive. Results indicated little effect of coupon value on a player’s slot volume. Indeed, the analysis found that complimentary rooms had a greater effect on coin-in, and complimentary food and beverage had the greatest effect of all. These findings imply that offering a relatively high incentive may not necessarily be more effective than providing a comparable lower incentive value in increasing a player’s slot gaming volume. Instead, casino managers should consider the overall profit picture from a given incentive and assess whether particular players are more responsive to complimentary amenities, such as room, food and beverage.</p>

<p>In an attempt to increase guest traffic to the casino and retain customers, casino marketers frequently employ various marketing programs, particularly those that offer free-plays or other complimentary amenities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965511427699">Kilby, Fox, and Lucas 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511427699">Lucas and Bowen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511427699">Lucas et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511427699">Lucas and Kilby 2008</xref>). By offering monetary incentives, casino marketers hope to attract new customers and “invest” in existing customers, in an effort to generate additional casino visits and higher levels of play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511427699">Lucas 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511427699">Lucas and Kilby 2008</xref>). Despite casinos’ wide use of monetary play incentives, little is known of the impact of these incentives on players’ behavior. While several researchers have examined the effectiveness of play incentives in generating incremental gaming volumes and casino visits, relatively little research has been done to understand players’ responses to different incentive amounts. Some studies of coupons for package goods suggest, for instance, that gaming volumes may not necessarily increase with the face value of a play incentive. Even when gaming volume increases because of a higher incentive value, the incremental costs associated with the high coupon value could erode the coupons’ profitability. Several researchers and industry pundits have pointed out that casino marketers often raise the play incentive values merely to remain on par with competition, and this often damages the profitability of the play incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511427699">Lucas, Kilby, and Santos 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511427699">Lucas and Kilby 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the dearth of research on this topic, this study examined the relationship between free-play coupon face value and a player’s slot gaming volume (coin-in) by tracking the slot gaming volumes of individual players who redeemed free-play coupons with two different face values: $100 and $50. This investigation (1) extends the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> on the short-term effect of free-play offers on slot gaming volume, as well as other casino marketing research; (2) provides a framework for future research on casino customers’ coupon redemption behavior; and (3) provides a basis for understanding the relationship between play-incentive value and a player’s slot gaming volume.</p>

<title>Coupon Face Value and Redemption Behavior</title>
<p>Noting the similarities of retail store “cents-off” coupons and casinos’ free-play offers in terms that they both are employed mainly to generate additional visits and spending from coupon recipients, we can gain an understanding of casino customers’ responses to play incentives from studies of consumers’ coupon redemption behavior, including coupon redemption rates, redemption intentions, and incremental purchases (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511427699">Bawa 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511427699">Bawa and Shoemaker 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511427699">Barat and Paswan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511427699">Chakraborty and Cole 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965511427699">Reibstein and Traver 1982</xref>). For example, Reibstein and Traver found that a higher coupon value was positively associated with a higher redemption rate. Similarly, Bawa and Shoemaker reported that households who received higher value coupons made significantly greater incremental purchases for the coupon-offering brands than those who received lower value coupons. Chakraborty and Cole provided additional evidence of a positive relationship between coupon face value and redemption rates. However, coupon users in their study exhibited a higher tendency to seek promotional deals but less brand loyalty than non-coupon users.</p>
<p>In keeping with other studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511427699">Barat and Paswafn (2005)</xref> found that consumers’ intentions to redeem coupons for common grocery items increased with coupon face value. However, they identified a threshold point above which the consumer’s intention to redeem a coupon became stagnant, despite increases in coupon value. They concluded that the threshold point is associated with inferences regarding the product’s price based on the coupon value, in the absence of actual product price information. Low value coupons imply a low product price but are likely to increase consumers’ perception of proportional monetary savings from coupon redemption. This, in turn, positively affects consumers’ intentions to redeem coupons. Conversely, high value coupons are likely to raise consumers’ expectations about the product’s price, offsetting anticipated monetary savings from coupon redemption. Similar to the threshold point in the coupon literature, the price promotion literature has discussed a saturation point where sales increase up to the saturation point and remain constant or decrease after that point, despite a deeper price cut (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965511427699">Gupta and Cooper 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938965511427699">Marshall and Leng 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to the findings of previous studies on coupon face value, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965511427699">Shoemaker and Tibrewala (1985)</xref> reported a greater likelihood of coupon redemption associated with a higher coupon value, based on the analysis of personal interviews with a sample of 280 shoppers in the greater New York area. Most critically, these authors found a notable increase in the likelihood of high value coupon redemption among the brand’s infrequent patrons. Conversely, a higher coupon value had little effect on increasing the likelihood of coupon redemption among a brand’s regular buyers. More than half of the heavy users of the coupon-offering brands were insensitive to changes in coupon value.</p>
<p>Other researchers have found little impact of coupon face value on redemption rates and product purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511427699">Neslin and Clarke 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511427699">Krishna and Shoemaker 1992</xref>). Krishna and Shoemaker examined three coupon face values (high, medium, and low) in a field experiment using scanner panel data for a consumer product class. They found that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of units or the package size purchased irrespective of the presence or absence of coupons. Furthermore, a high coupon value failed to affect the package size purchased, the number of units purchased, or the total quantity purchased (package size times units).</p>

<title>Coupon Face Value and Profitability</title>
<p>Considering coupon value from the seller’s point of view, several researchers have developed models that demonstrate how changes in the coupon value affect the profitability of a coupon promotion. Shoemaker and Tibrewala’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965511427699">1985</xref>) illustrated the effect of an increase in coupon face value on coupon profitability using a general formula obtained from prior coupon research. They estimated profits from 15-cent and 50-cent coupons using parameter estimates obtained from other coupon studies. The results of their hypothetical example indicated that a lower value coupon generated substantially higher profits than a comparable higher value coupon, which actually lost money. Another study, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511427699">Leone and Srinivasan (1996)</xref> estimated coupon profitability relative to no coupon at different coupon face values based on the household panel and store-level data sets gathered over sixty-five weeks. Their results indicated that although the sales of the coupon-offering brand increased with coupon face value, profitability was affected both by incremental sales and by the associated costs. The authors argued that coupon redeemers who would otherwise have purchased the promoted brand without coupons could lower the profitability of the coupon promotion.</p>
<p>Using mathematical models, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965511427699">Ben-Zion, Hibshoosh, and Spiegel (1999)</xref> addressed profit-maximizing conditions. These researchers proposed that a coupon’s value should be lower when a firm has a high cost of coupon processing, lower profit margins, and a larger share of loyal customers. Conversely, a firm with a lower cost of coupon processing and a higher profit margin can increase a coupon value to attract new and deal-prone customers. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511427699">Neslin and Clarke (1987)</xref> argued that coupon promotion would be more profitable when coupons attract new and occasional users of the coupon-offering brand. They furthermore cautioned about the tradeoff between maximizing redemption rates and attracting redeemers with less favorable brand use profiles—that is, deal seekers.</p>

<sec id="section4-1938965511427699">
<title>Factors Influencing Coupon Redemption</title>
<p>Researchers have listed a number of factors that are known or theorized to affect coupon redemption behavior. In addition to coupon face value, they mentioned coupon characteristics such as coupon design, restrictions on coupon redemption, and distribution timing and methods; consumer characteristics such as brand loyalty, product usage levels, deal proneness, and demographics; and other factors such as product type, other simultaneous marketing activities, competitors’ marketing activities, seasonality, and different geographic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965511427699">Reibstein and Traver 1982</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1938965511427699">
<title>Brand loyalty and deal proneness</title>
<p>In a laboratory panel experiment that involved distributing a candy-bar coupon to university students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511427699">Chakraborty and Cole (1991)</xref> found that subjects who reported deal-prone shopping behavior and less brand loyalty produced a higher coupon redemption rate than those who did not. They also reported that subjects who received higher face value and easy-to-use coupons produced a higher redemption rate than those who did not. However, a higher coupon value and the ease of coupon redemption became insignificant once one accounted for brand loyalty and deal proneness. The authors indicated that a higher probability of coupon redemption was associated with less brand loyalty and more deal proneness. Similarly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511427699">Bawa and Shoemaker (1987)</xref> study found that households with less brand and store loyalty were heavy users of coupons. These results appear to support the general findings of the marketing literature that loyal customers tend to be less price sensitive and deal prone. Examining college students’ purchases at a quick-service restaurant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938965511427699">Taylor and Long-Tolbert (2002)</xref> indicated a positive relationship between prior purchase activity and the likelihood of coupon redemption. They also reported that those who redeemed coupons did not delay their subsequent purchases, but exhibited a higher likelihood of repeat purchasing after the coupon promotion period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938965511427699">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>The general findings of coupon research indicate that younger consumers living in urban areas with higher income and education but lower opportunity cost of time are more likely to use coupons. Several empirical studies support these demographic characteristics of coupon redeemers (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511427699">Bawa and Shoemaker 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511427699">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511427699">Levedahl 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511427699">Narasimhan 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938965511427699">Teel, Williams, and Bearden 1980</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511427699">Bawa and Shoemaker (1989)</xref> found that wife’s education, home ownership, and household size were positively associated with the likelihood of a household making incremental purchases. The authors also found that income was strongly related to the magnitude of incremental sales, which was defined as the difference in an item’s purchase volume per household from twelve weeks before to twelve weeks after coupon delivery.</p>

<title>Monetary Play Incentives and Gaming Volumes</title>
<p>Several researchers have dealt with the effect of monetary play incentives on aggregate daily gaming volumes (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511427699">Lucas 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511427699">Lucas and Bowen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511427699">Lucas and Santos 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511427699">Lucas (2004)</xref> examined a match-play coupon promotion that was designed to increase blackjack table game volumes (cash drop) for a Las Vegas hotel casino. Contrary to prevalent belief, a variable representing the daily dollar-amount of redeemed match-play coupons was negatively associated with cash drop. With respect to play incentives for slots, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> examined a player’s slot gaming volume per trip resulting from $50 and $100 coupons sent by direct mail. After controlling for other influences on slot gaming volumes (such as trip length), their results indicated that neither offer produced a positive and statistically significant model effect on slot volumes. In fact, the $50 free-play offer relative to no coupon had a negative impact, generating a decrease of $335.98 in slot volume. Given that result, Lucas and his colleagues suggested that the coupon effectively became a substitute for the players’ bankroll. They further estimated net cash flow per trip by subtracting relevant expenses from the incremental slot revenues resulting from free-play offers. Contrary to expectations, free-play offers failed to produce positive net cash flows.</p>
<p>A similar study of a Midwestern casino found contrasting findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511427699">Lucas and Santos (2003)</xref> found a statistically significant and positive model effect of a variable representing the dollar amount of redeemed direct-mail play incentives on the aggregate daily slot gaming volumes for that casino. Similar results were observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511427699">Lucas and Bowen (2002)</xref> with regard to the direct-mail premiums offered by a Las Vegas hotel casino. They also found that the dollar amount of cash awards in a drawing-based (lottery-type) promotion was positively associated with slot gaming volumes but not net profits. For every one-dollar increase in cash prize money, slot volume increased by $15.56. However, the incremental slot revenue, or win, associated with cash awards failed to cover prize money expenses. For every dollar of cash prize expense, slot revenue increased only $0.64. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511427699">Lucas and Brewer (2001)</xref> also reported losses resulting from direct-mail play incentives. They estimated that for each dollar of expense, the casino recorded an incremental slot profit of $0.74. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511427699">Lucas, Kilby, and Santos (2002)</xref> pointed out that despite negative coupon economics, intense competition has led to increase in casinos’ play incentive values. They described that high value play incentives to obtain premium players in the table game market have resulted in the failure of the casinos to ensure an acceptable profit margin. Echoing the package goods coupon studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511427699">Lucas and Kilby (2008)</xref> argued that raising incentive values based on competition could draw mainly deal-prone customers who have no brand loyalty.</p>

<sec id="section8-1938965511427699">
<title>Determinants of Gaming Volume</title>
<p>In addition to play incentives, casinos offer other incentives to encourage gaming activity, most notably complimentary rooms, show tickets, or food. Some researchers have identified the predictors of daily gaming volumes in connection with those incentives, while others have focused on predicting gaming volumes at the individual player level.</p>
<sec id="section9-1938965511427699">
<title>Complimentary room awards</title>
<p>Despite the widespread use of complimentary room awards, only a few studies have addressed room comps’ effect on gaming volume. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511427699">Lucas and Brewer (2001)</xref> found little evidence to support the positive room effect, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> found a significant and positive effect of complimentary room-nights on slot volume in one of their two models for predicting a player’s slot volume per trip.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1938965511427699">
<title>Other comps</title>
<p>A growing amount of literature addresses the impact of casino amenities such as restaurants and showroom entertainment on gaming volumes. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965511427699">Tanford and Lucas (2010)</xref> found a significant and positive relationship between daily restaurant and gaming business volumes in two different casino markets. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511427699">Lucas and Santos (2003)</xref> reported positive effects of daily restaurant covers on slot volumes at three different casinos. In contrast to these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511427699">Lucas and Brewer (2001)</xref> reported no evidence of a positive relationship between restaurant and gaming business volumes.</p>
<p>Looking at individual players, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> found a positive association of complimentary awards for food, beverage, and shopping with slot gaming volume per trip. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938965511427699">Richard and Adrian (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511427699">Yi and Busser (2008)</xref> reported that dining was one of important factors affecting casino patrons’ repeat-patronage intentions. A survey of Las Vegas residents regarding their gaming and nongaming activities by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965511427699">Roehl (1996)</xref> found a positive relationship between a player’s patronage of gourmet restaurants and gaming budget. Thus, with the exception of Lucas and Brewer’s work, the findings seem to support a positive relationship between food and beverage operations and gaming activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1938965511427699">
<title>Amount won or lost</title>
<p>It seems reasonable to assume that the dollar amount gained or lost in gaming will affect a player’s gaming volume. In fact, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> found a significant and negative relationship between the amount of actual losses or winnings in slot play and slot gaming volume. However, the same study found no significant relationship between the average dollar amount gained or lost in table games and slot gaming volume. This result appears to indicate that there is little crossover between slot and table games players.</p>

<sec id="section12-1938965511427699">
<title>Slot point redemption</title>
<p>When players redeem points for rewards such as cash, rooms, show tickets, merchandise, and food, some of the redeemed points are used to extend a player’s gaming activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> produced empirical evidence of a strong and positive relationship between the average dollar amount of cash withdrawn by players from their reward program accounts and coin-in level per trip.</p>

<sec id="section13-1938965511427699">
<title>Par and standard deviation</title>
<p>Several studies have investigated the effects of par (the house advantage or expected win) and standard deviation (variation from par) of a slot machine pay table on the game’s coin-in level and time on device (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511427699">Lucas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938965511427699">Lucas and Roehl 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965511427699">Lucas and Singh 2008</xref>). Their findings indicate a general agreement on the significant effect of standard deviation but a limited effect of par on the game’s coin-in and time on device, with an exception of Lucas, Dunn, and Singh’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">2005</xref>). That group found a significant and negative effect of the average par of the games that each customer played on the player’s slot gaming volume per trip.</p>

<title>Modeling the Impact of Free-Play Coupon Value on Slot Volume per Player</title>
<p>Although the overall findings of coupon promotion research indicate a positive effect of coupon value on redemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511427699">Bawa 1996</xref>), little is known about how individual players’ gaming volumes vary with different play incentive values. Furthermore, relatively little work has been done to develop models that can help casino managers predict individual players’ responses to coupon promotions, especially given the mixed results of coupons for package goods. Hence, this study focused on predicting players’ responses in terms of their slot gaming volumes to different play incentive values. Based on the research presented above, the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965511427699">Exhibit 1</xref> was designed to measure the effect of free-play incentive value on a player’s slot volume after accounting for other variables that are known or theorized to affect gaming volume. A distinction, however, has to be made between this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh’s (2005)</xref> work. The focus of this investigation was the relationship between the value of a free-play coupon and a player’s slot gaming volume during the player’s coupon redemption trip, whereas Lucas, Dunn, and Singh aimed at investigating the effect of the presence or absence of a coupon on a player’s slot volume per trip.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section18-1938965511427699">
<title>Data</title>
<p>For this study, a Las Vegas Strip hotel-casino mainly serving a tourist clientele donated data from its player database. While I will not give details that identify the property, this casino offers thousands of hotel rooms, multiple restaurants, convention areas, retail stores, night clubs, and spa facilities. The casino’s player database contains multiple segments, and each segment comprises players with similar levels of historical play. The casino’s management further described the players in the segment selected for this coupon experiment as having high historical play levels. The data contained gaming-related information at the individual player level during the player’s direct-mail free-play coupon redemption trip. According to the property’s management, players in the selected segment, who commonly received $50 coupons, were divided into two groups and randomly assigned to either a $50 offer group or a $100 offer group.</p>
<p>The offer terms, conditions, and graphic designs were exactly the same except for the coupon’s face value. Both coupons were accompanied by identical complimentary awards for hotel rooms and food and beverage. All of these offers were mailed simultaneously and were valid for a period of three consecutive months in 2007. Other than the free-play, room, and food and beverage offers, no other awards were mailed by this property to the players in the selected segment during the three-month promotion period.</p>
<p>In total, the property donated data for 409 slot players, consisting of 168 players who redeemed $50 free-play offers and 241 players who redeemed $100 free-play offers, although the total number of coupons mailed out was not available. The management described response rates to its direct mail free-play incentives as typically being around 5 percent, although they vary slightly by segment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1938965511427699">
<title>Final Model and Variable Operationalization</title>
<p>I was unable to analyze all the variables theorized to influence a player’s slot volume in the proposed model because of the lack of individual player information relating to some variables. The final model’s dependent variable was slot volume (coin-in, or the amount of money wagered) per player who redeemed a free-play coupon during his or her coupon-redemption trip. In total, six independent variables were tested: (1) Free-play Coupon Value (FPV) is a binary variable representing the face value of a free-play offer redeemed by a player. A value of 1 was assigned to the cases associated with the $50 offer redemption and a value of 2 was assigned to the cases associated with the $100 offer redemption. (2) Trip Days represented the number of consecutive days that a player who redeemed a free-play coupon stayed at the subject hotel during his or her coupon redemption trip. (3) Comp Room indicated the sum of retail values of complimentary hotel room-nights for each coupon redeemer during his or her coupon redemption trip. (4) Other Comp refers to the sum of food and beverage awards redeemed by each player during his or her coupon redemption trip. Both Comp Room and Other Comp were expressed in dollars. (5) Slot WL and (6) Table WL represented the actual dollar amount that each coupon redeemer won or lost in slot and table gaming during his or her coupon redemption trip.</p>
<p>Other information such as players’ brand loyalty, demographics, and the characteristics of slot games played by free-play coupon redeemers was not available. Despite the absence of such information, a certain degree of homogeneity exists among the subjects in terms of their historical gaming levels. In addition, random assignment of subject players to different coupon values helps to account for unobserved heterogeneity among the subject players. Finally, the condition where the players in the selected segment received identical offers for complimentary rooms food and beverage helps to better capture any effects on a player’s slot volume that are due to different coupon values.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>The sample contained 155 redeemers of $50 free-play offers and 225 redeemers of $100 free-play offers. Since the response rate for the $100 coupon group was 45 percent higher than that for the $50 coupon group, it appears that increase in coupon value led to a higher redemption rate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965511427699">Exhibit 2</xref> summarizes descriptive statistics for the variables used in the regression model. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965511427699">Exhibit 2</xref>, the average amount of coin-in per player was greater in the $100 offer group than in the $50 offer group ($6,189.34 vs. $5,478.19).</p>

<title>Multiple Regression Analysis</title>
<p>The six-variable regression model explained 64 percent of the variance in coin-in per player. The model <italic>F</italic> statistic of 43.15 was statistically significant (<italic>df</italic> = 373, 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). However, the regression coefficient of the Free-Play Coupon Value (FPV) variable was not significant (<italic>B</italic> = 617.25, <italic>t</italic> = 1.34, <italic>df</italic> = 373, <italic>p</italic> = 0.182, two-tailed). This result failed to support my hypothesis (hypothesis 1) that there is a positive relationship between free-play coupon value and a player’s slot volume. With respect to other variables, the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511427699">Exhibit 4</xref> indicate that the variables representing complimentary awards for rooms, food and beverage, and the dollar amount won or lost on slot games are positively associated with a player’s slot volume. Particularly, there was a strong relationship between food and beverage awards and slot volume. Variables representing trip length and the dollar amount won or lost on table games were not statistically significant in the model.</p>

<p>A histogram of residuals indicated a positive skew. A logarithmic transformation to remove the positive skew, however, did not show significant improvement in distribution. Consequently, for ease in interpretation, the data in their original scale of measurement were used for analysis. Hence, caution is advised in interpreting the regression results. Scatter and residual plots indicated little cause for concern for the departures from the linearity and constant variance assumptions. Examination of Cook’s distance and DfBetas values revealed no observations that lead to significant changes in the regression results. Finally, variance inflation factor values were less than 2.0, indicating no multicollinearity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This investigation found no significant relationship between a free-play coupon’s value and a player’s slot gaming volume. These results are in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511427699">Krishna and Shoemaker (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511427699">Neslin and Clarke (1987)</xref>, who found little effect of coupon face value on incremental sales and redemption rates for package goods. This study’s results, however, are not consistent with the findings of other coupon research (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511427699">Bawa and Shoemaker 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511427699">Barat and Paswan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511427699">Chakraborty and Cole 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965511427699">Reibstein and Traver 1982</xref>). Moreover, the findings of this study differ from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511427699">Lucas and Bowen (2002)</xref>, who found a positive association between cash prize awards and slot volumes. The sources of these inconsistent findings might be related to the type of promotion examined in each study (drawing vs. direct mail) and the type of data used for analysis (aggregate daily coin-in vs. coin-in per player who redeemed a free-play offer).</p>
<p>The observed lack of a significant relationship between free-play coupon value and a player’s slot gaming volume might be an indication of bankroll cannibalization, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref>, who pointed out that players might use free-play incentives as a replacement for all or some of their original gaming budgets. Likewise, some players in this study might have taken advantage of the increased free-play slot credits. In addition, it is possible that play incentives have become the casino’s cost of doing business, as some players tend to perceive them as an entitlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511427699">Lucas and Kilby 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the lack of a significant coupon value effect is that the additional $50 offered on the $100 coupon might be deemed an insufficient incentive for a player to increase gaming volume. Given that casino customers are inundated with monetary play incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511427699">Lucas and Kilby 2008</xref>), a notable increase in incentive value might be required for a casino to differentiate itself from its competitors. On the other hand, players examined here could be insensitive to changes in coupon values possibly because of their high level of brand loyalty. Although this study did not examine players’ brand loyalty, the package-goods coupon literature has indicated that loyal customers are less deal prone. Given that these players are valued customers because of their high historical gaming levels, the results of this study might be associated with these players’ brand loyalty. If the players are loyal and insensitive to coupon values, offering high incentive values may not necessarily increase players’ coin-in. Instead, providing them with nonmonetary awards such as distinctive value-added services and benefits might be more effective in enhancing customers’ emotional attachment to the brand and encourage more frequent casino visits and greater spending. As a side benefit, nonmonetary benefits could help casino marketers avoid price-based competition.</p>
<p>The findings of this study, however, do not necessarily mean that casino marketers should not offer high value coupons. A comparison of redemption rates at the aggregate level indicates that the $100 free-play coupon had a much higher response rate than the $50 coupon did. Although it is difficult to know the extent to which a high coupon value influences the casino patronage decisions of coupon recipients, it could be a compelling reason for some players to make a trip to the coupon-offering casino. As I discuss next, however, considering incremental costs associated with a high coupon value, casino managers should be careful in raising incentive values.</p>
<sec id="section26-1938965511427699">
<title>Incremental Coupon Costs</title>
<p>The determination of an appropriate incentive value may rest on a promotion’s profitability. As noted above in the package-goods coupon studies, casino managers have to be aware of the potential negative effect of higher coupon values on coupon profitability. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965511427699">Exhibit 5</xref> illustrates this point by comparing coupon-related expenses per player between the two coupon groups for the promotion period of three months.</p>

<p>Denotes the product of the variable costs (i.e., housekeeping labor and hotel room amenities) per room night and the number of trip days.

<p>The casino’s free-play coupon cost is reduced by the product of the coupon face value and the house advantage for slots, or ($50.00)(0.068) for a $50 incentive and ($100.00)(0.068) for a $100 incentive. The average house advantage for slots, or the average floor par, for the subject property was not available for analysis. Hence, the slot win percent of 6.80% obtained from the 2007 Gaming Revenue Report published by Nevada Gaming Control Board was used as a proxy for the average floor par. The slot win percent of 6.80% represents the average hold percentage for slots in Las Vegas Strip properties with revenues of $72 million and greater in 2007 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511427699">Nevada Gaming Control Board 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Information regarding the slot department variable costs (i.e., labor for processing coupon redemption) associated with t-win was not available for analysis. Hence, 20% of t-win used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref>, which appears to be a realistic, yet conservative, estimate of slot department variable costs was applied to the current analysis.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As shown in the table, the $50 group is practically identical to the $100 group in terms of the average costs of complimentary room and food and beverage for each player, since both groups were given the same offers for those amenities. The average cost per player for those comps were calculated by dividing the number of coupon redeemers into the total cost for each type of award for the players who redeemed free-play coupons during the coupon promotion period. Needless to say, there is a large cost difference associated with the coupon face value. Taking into account the house advantage, the cost per player for the $50 coupon was $47 and for $100 slot credit, it was $93. Considering the $46 incremental cost of the $100 coupon ($93-$47), the higher value free-play offer should produce additional slot revenue of $46 at a minimum to offset that incremental cost, which did not occur. This illustration suggests that casino marketers should be concerned about coupon profitability at the individual player level as well as at the aggregate level.</p>
<p>Given the incremental cost of a higher value coupon, casino marketers should carefully determine the appropriate incentive value based on a player’s potential worth and propensity to increase slot gaming volumes in response to an increase in coupon value. The casino might offer higher value coupons only to players who are likely to respond with significant increases in their gaming volumes. Although offering relatively low incentive values could decrease response rates, the lower value coupons might well be more profitable than higher-value coupons, depending on the customers’ response. A predictive modeling at the individual player level could help casino marketers identify the most profitable customers and segment players based on their potential values.</p>

<title>The Effects of Other Variables on a Player’s Slot Volume</title>
<sec id="section28-1938965511427699">
<title>Complimentary room awards</title>
<p>Regression results indicated a positive relationship between complimentary room awards and coin-in. This finding is in agreement with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref>, who also found a positive effect of complimentary room awards on a player’s slot volume. I must note, however, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511427699">Lucas and Brewer (2001)</xref> found no evidence of a significant relationship between the number of complimentary room-nights and daily slot volume. This inconsistency may be explained by the fact that two different property types are involved in these studies. My study examined a property that is located in a destination market primarily attracting out-of-town visitors who would need hotel rooms, whereas the property examined by Lucas and Brewer serves mainly a local clientele. Hence, it is possible that complimentary room awards could have motivated out-of-town guests examined in this study to spend more on gaming as they were able to save money or spend less on hotel rooms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1938965511427699">
<title>Other complimentary awards</title>
<p>The significant and positive relationship that I observed between complimentary food and beverage and a player’s slot volume is consistent with the findings of the previous gaming studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511427699">Lucas and Santos 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938965511427699">Richard and Adrian 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965511427699">Roehl 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965511427699">Tanford and Lucas 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511427699">Yi and Busser 2008</xref>). In this study, the variable representing complimentary food and beverage awards was the one that was most strongly associated with coin-in per player. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> found that the effect of complimentary awards for food, beverage, and shopping on a player’s slot volume was stronger than that of complimentary room awards. Although more work is required to establish the effect of food and beverage awards on a player’s gaming volume, it appears that increasing complimentary food and beverage may be more effective than offering complimentary rooms in terms of increasing a player’s gaming volume—at least at this casino.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1938965511427699">
<title>The amount won or lost in slots</title>
<p>This study found a significant and positive relationship between the money that a player gained or lost in slot gaming and coin-in per player. Most likely, players are “reinvesting” their slot winnings back into the machines. This finding is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref> who also showed a significant effect of the average dollar amount gained or lost in slot games on coin-in per trip. However, they found a negative relationship while I found a positive relationship. Further studies which take slot winnings and losses into account will need to be undertaken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1938965511427699">
<title>The amount won or lost in table games</title>
<p>I found no significant relationship between the dollar amount gained or lost in table gaming and a player’s coin-in. The same result was observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref>. This finding makes sense, given that the casino’s management described that the vast majority of those in the study play slots heavily, rather than table games. Because of their gaming preference, the management’s marketing efforts toward these players have been slots oriented. Hence, the result could be attributed to the homogeneity of the subjects in terms their game preference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1938965511427699">
<title>Trip length</title>
<p>Contrary to expectations, this study did not find a significant and positive relationship between trip length and coin-in. This result differs from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511427699">Lucas, Dunn, and Singh (2005)</xref>. A possible explanation for this discrepancy might be related to little variation in the number of trip days taken by coupon redeemers in my study. Another possible explanation is that there is a trip length effect, but it was overshadowed by other variables (e.g., complimentary rooms). Considering that offering complimentary room-nights has a strong effect but trip length shows barely any impact, the casino’s management may want to emphasize the amount of money these slot players can save on hotel rooms through complimentary room-nights rather than encouraging a player’s extended stay. For example, offering discounted or complimentary room-nights may be a more effective marketing strategy than promoting a free night with a certain number of paid nights. A comparison of the effects of extended trip length and complimentary room awards warrants further investigation.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>This study examined the relationship between free play coupon value and slot volume per player and identified the relative importance of various other factors that affect a player’s slot gaming volume. These findings would be helpful for casino managers in improving budget and resource allocations for their marketing programs. However, this study is not without limitations, most notably that the sample was drawn from only one hotel-casino. Results might vary by player segment, target market, and market condition. Hence, any effort to replicate this study with different samples would enhance our understanding of players’ coupon redemption behavior. In addition, I was unable to examine all the variables that are theorized to affect a player’s slot volume. Hence, future research should examine how other unexamined variables, such as players’ brand loyalty, deal proneness, and demographic characteristics, would affect a player’s gaming volume. Findings from such research would provide a better understanding of potential effects of player characteristics on play incentive redemption behavior.</p>
<p>Future studies could test players’ sensitivity to different coupon values and thereby identify the incentive value that generates the highest profit, given the complex relationship between coupon face value, redemption rates, and profit. In addition, researchers should consider conducting a longitudinal study on whether a player’s casino trip frequency and gaming volume gradually changes with free-play coupon value. For example, future research could investigate the effects of different play incentive values on repeat businesses after the coupon redemption period. Such investigation would help casino marketers gain a better understanding of any long-term effect of free-play coupon values on player behavior. Finally, research on the effects of different types of play incentives on a player’s gaming and coupon redeeming behavior would help casino marketers identify the type of coupon that is most likely to generate desirable player profiles and match the right customers with the right offers.</p>
