<abstract>
<p>In this project, the authors examined the relationship trait anxiety has on incarcerated male adolescents’ progression from childhood exposure to violence/victimization to violent behavior. Self-report survey data were analyzed to determine the youth’s levels of trait anxiety, how the degree of childhood trauma was related to their level of anxiety, as well as whether their level of anxiety affected the relationship between trauma and subsequent frequency and severity of their delinquent acts using a moderation analysis. Anxiety significantly decreased the relationship between victimization and the commission of violence (<italic>F</italic> = 15.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-0306624X12448856">
<title>Childhood Exposure to Violence</title>
<p>Information about children’s exposure to violence within their home, school, and community environments from birth to age 17 was provided by the National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X12448856">Finkelhor, Ormrod, Turner, &amp; Hamby, 2005</xref>). The survey (<italic>N</italic> = 2,030) was unique in that it gathered information from typical children and assessed many different types of violence exposures across age and environment. Some of the types of violence surveyed were assault with no weapon or injury, assault with weapon or injury, sexual victimization, dating violence, and witnessing family or community assault. Researchers found that a significant number of children were exposed to violence in their everyday lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X12448856">Finkelhor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Consideration of the number of exposures to violence and other individual factors, such as proximity to and severity of the event, child’s gender and age, how chronic the exposure was, the relationship the child had with the victim and perpetrator, and whether other stressors were also occurring at the time, is important to fully understand factors that could influence the psychological impact of the violence exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X12448856">Kracke &amp; Hahn, 2008</xref>). A meta-analysis of studies exploring the relationship between childhood exposure to violence and delinquent behavior in adolescence found that there was not a straightforward, direct connection between the two, but instead many factors affect the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X12448856">Wilson, Stover, &amp; Berkowitz, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Childhood Exposure to Violence and Delinquency</title>
<p>Children who experience violence in any context, namely, school, home, or community, may develop internalizing and externalizing problems, and are at higher risk for becoming violent offenders as adolescents or adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X12448856">Lansford et al., 2002</xref>). The effects of cross-contextual exposure have also been examined, with results indicating that there is an interactive effect between the experience of violence and the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X12448856">Mrug &amp; Windle, 2010</xref>). Of salient interest are findings that witnessing violence in all contexts predicted anxiety, and in most situations aggression and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X12448856">Mrug &amp; Windle, 2010</xref>). One unexpected finding in the same study was that participants who witnessed violence in their community were less likely to become anxious about violence they witnessed at home, perhaps due to desensitization or the normalizing effect of cross-exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X12448856">Mrug &amp; Windle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For adolescent males, witnessing violence predicts delinquency and aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X12448856">Weaver, Borkowski, &amp; Whitman, 2008</xref>), which is concerning given the high incidence rates of violence exposure for this population, roughly 50% to 68% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X12448856">Macmillan &amp; Hagan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X12448856">Menard, 2002</xref>). Researchers using longitudinal data found that youth with chronic exposure to violence were 31.5 times more likely to become chronic violent offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X12448856">Spano, Rivera, &amp; Bolland, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306624X12448856">
<title>Anxiety in Adolescence</title>
<p>In a recent study, the incidence rate for trait anxiety in typical adolescents was 2.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X12448856">Roberts, Roberts, &amp; Chan, 2009</xref>). Children who have witnessed violence or been a victim to violent behavior are more prone to internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety, than their typical peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X12448856">Mrug &amp; Windle, 2010</xref>). Previous researchers have reported that among incarcerated male juvenile delinquents, the rate of anxiety was much higher, at 26% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X12448856">Karnik et al., 2009</xref>). Research on risks for violent offending among adolescent males found that high anxiety levels predict a higher risk for such behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X12448856">Parker, Morton, Lingfelt, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Higher levels of baseline anxiety also predict higher levels of anxiety post trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X12448856">Larsson, Bäckström, &amp; Johanson, 2008</xref>), and can predict future symptom severity and an extended length of time needed for the victim’s overall distress to decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X12448856">Marshall, Miles, &amp; Stewart, 2010</xref>). As high anxiety predicts high risk of violent offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X12448856">Parker et al., 2005</xref>), an extended period of time with this negative affect could lead to greater overall degree of delinquency.</p>

<sec id="section5-0306624X12448856">
<title>Connection Between Anxiety and Violent Delinquency</title>
<p>Limited research has been conducted to understand the role trait anxiety plays for youth who have experienced violent trauma and subsequently engage in violent delinquent behavior. Much of the research focused on extreme forms of delinquency and stated that adolescents with higher levels of trait anxiety were more likely to become delinquent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X12448856">Kubak &amp; Salekin, 2009</xref>). Other researchers who attempted to understand the youth’s reaction to specific stressors found that different stressors precipitated behavioral and mental health outcomes, including delinquency and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X12448856">Aseltine, Gore, &amp; Gordon, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0306624X12448856">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Therefore, in this study, we utilized a moderation model to understand how trait anxiety changes the relationship between violence exposure in childhood and subsequent violence committed during adolescence for a group of delinquent incarcerated male adolescents.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0306624X12448856" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In this project, we analyzed data collected in 2004, which consisted of 165 male youth incarcerated for nonsexual crimes. Confidential data were collected from these male youth from six different residential facilities in a midwestern state.</p>
<sec id="section8-0306624X12448856">
<title>Social Desirability Reduction</title>
<p>To compensate for potential social desirability, the rules applied to the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) were applied and all youth whose MACI scores did not conform to the validity criteria of the MACI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X12448856">Millon, 1993</xref>) were removed from the participant pool. Therefore, from the 139 participants, 52 were removed for having responded affirmatively to either question 114 or 126 and/or were removed for having raw Scale X (Disclosure) scores less than 202 or greater than 589 (or were missing). These reductions resulted in final sample size of 87.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0306624X12448856">
<title>Description of Sample</title>
<p>On average, the youth were 16.53 years of age (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.18 years) and had completed the ninth grade in high school (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.29 grades). The largest racial groups were Caucasian (<italic>n</italic> = 40, 46%) and African American (<italic>n</italic> = 40, 46%), followed by Hispanic/Latino, Native American, and Other (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 5.8%) and two youth did not report their race (2.2%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0306624X12448856">
<title>Materials Used for Data Collection</title>
<p>Standard demographics were collected from the youth as well as a set of dichotomous questions regarding exposure to violence which included the following questions: Have you witnessed physical abuse of children in your home; have you witnessed slapping, hitting, or punching in your home; have you ever been beat up; have you ever seen a stranger shot, a stranger stabbed, a stranger beat up, a stranger killed, a relative shot, a relative stabbed, a relative beat up, a relative killed; and were you sexually abused as a child? When summed into a violence exposed to scale, interitem reliability for this scale was reasonable with Cronbach’s alpha = .75.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X12448856">Elliot, Huizinga, and Ageton’s (1985)</xref> Self-Reported Delinquency (SRD) measure was used to assess delinquency. The scale has 32 questions using a 7-point frequency scale from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 7 (<italic>2-3 times per day</italic>) on questions ranging from drug use to aggression. Using SRD items, a summative violent scale (attacked someone with the idea of seriously hurting or killing that person, was involved in gang fights, hit or threatened to hit one of their parents, hit or threatened to hit their supervisor or another employee, used force or strong arm methods to get money or things from people) was created with reasonable interitem reliability (Cronbach’s α = .72).</p>
<p>The MACI is based on Millon’s theory of patterns in personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X12448856">Millon &amp; Davis, 1993</xref>) and is devised for youth in treatment or in correctional institutions. It was normed on 579 adolescents in such facilities, with two smaller cross-validation samples. Its scales comprise 160 true–false questions, including one validity and three modifying indices that assist with socially desirable responding. For this project, the MACI social desirability rules were applied (see above) and the Anxious Feelings Scale was used. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was good at .86.</p>

<sec id="section11-0306624X12448856">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>SPSS version 12 was used for data entry and SPSS version 15 was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and then a regression are presented to assess for moderation.</p>

<sec id="section12-0306624X12448856" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In this sample, 94.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 82) of the sample endorsed experiencing at least 1 of the violence items with an average of 4.26 items endorsed (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.72 items) and a range of 0 to 11 out of the 12 items endorsed. In all, 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 41) of the youth admitted to violent crimes. The scales mean responses ranged from 0 to 6 (the scales had 6 items) with a mean of 1.29 items endorsed (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.57 items).</p>
<p>On average, the youth’s MACI Anxious Feelings Scale was a score of 55 (<italic>SD</italic> = 19.86 points). The scale scores ranged from 15 to 109 points. According to the MACI manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X12448856">Millon, 1993</xref>), scores above 65 are concerning and those above 70 require clinical attention in this area. In this sample, 72.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 63) of the youth were 64 or lower, 12.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were above 65 and below 70, and remainder 15.47% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) were above 70.</p>
<p>Starting the moderation analysis with correlation, all three variables in the model were correlated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X12448856">Table 1</xref>). As indicated, the Anxious Feelings Scale was negatively correlated with the Violence Experienced and the Violence Committed Scales.</p>

<p>Using hierarchical regression to assess for moderation, that is, for anxious feelings changing the relationship between exposure and commission of violence, the first and final models were significant and the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change test indicated that anxiety significantly enhances the relationships between these two variables. Notably, the relationship between anxiety and the other variables is negative, that is, the greater the trait anxiety, the lesser the violence committed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Victimization is common among youth. Approximately two thirds of the adolescents in either psychiatric or juvenile justice populations researched have experienced serious victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X12448856">Ford et al., 2000</xref>). Of the incarcerated male youth sampled in this project, the exposure to violence/victimization rate was approximately 10% higher than the estimated rate for nonincarcerated adolescents. This supports prior findings that exposure to violence/victimization in childhood is a contributory factor for some youth to develop externalizing problems, such as violence and delinquency. As exposure to violence and victimization in any context has been found to predict anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X12448856">Mrug &amp; Windle, 2010</xref>), our findings support anxiety assessment and specialized treatment for at-risk male adolescents. It will be important for professionals working with this population to differentiate between state and trait anxiety, and to create treatment plans accordingly. The findings for this project support assessment and treatment for state anxiety, and future longitudinal research projects will be useful to better understand the influence of trait anxiety in these youth.</p>
<p>Rates of anxiety for this sample matched prior research findings for male incarcerated youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X12448856">Karnik et al., 2009</xref>). The result that more than 25% of the sample analyzed were found to have levels of trait anxiety that were above the concerning level for the Millon scale is troubling because less than 10% of juvenile correction facilities provide adequate or specialized mental health assessment or treatment services for childhood maltreatment or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X12448856">Acoca, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X12448856">Bender, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X12448856">Child Welfare League of America, 2002</xref>). Incarceration without these vital intervention services may then create an environment that inadvertently encourages further violent externalizing problems among these traumatized male youth. This could at least partially explain the high recidivism rates this population has for violent offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X12448856">Worling &amp; Curwen, 2000</xref>). Recent research found that an average of 55% of juvenile offenders reengaged with the juvenile justice system within 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X12448856">Snyder &amp; Sickmund, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Trait anxiety decreasing the relationship between early childhood trauma and delinquency appears to indicate that anxiety is a protective factor for these adolescent males, yet this is not necessarily the case for every youth. Prior researchers have suggested that high anxiety levels may have a causal role with violent delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X12448856">Parker et al., 2005</xref>) and conversely that high anxiety levels may prevent adolescent males from engaging in delinquent acts. These opposing findings are perhaps due to various risk and resiliency factors that affect an individual’s reaction to trauma and his or her subsequent degree of anxiety.</p>
<p>One important risk factor to consider for male adolescents with anxiety is substance use/abuse, either by the youth or a parent. Use of substances increases an adolescent’s likelihood of being violent, and being violent increases an adolescent’s likelihood of substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X12448856">Noyori-Corbett &amp; Moon, 2010</xref>). Moreover, ongoing drug use is associated with delinquency recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X12448856">Chang, Chen, &amp; Brownson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X12448856">Hussong, Curran, Moffitt, Caspi, &amp; Carrig, 2004</xref>). In addition, parental substance abuse has been found to be one of many family problems that significantly predict violent recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X12448856">Mulder, Brand, Bullens, &amp; Van Marie, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Some resiliency factors for anxiety, and interestingly for effect on the pathway from trauma to psychopathology, include stability of home life, relationship with parent(s), and development of positive coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X12448856">Rutter, 2007</xref>). Rutter suggested increased consideration of gene–environment interaction when assessing and treating traumatized youth, and recommended the creation or improvement of positive external factors to promote increased resiliency. Moreover, addressing family as well as individual concerns will improve treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X12448856">Curtis, Ronan, &amp; Borduin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X12448856">Nix, Bierman, &amp; McMahon, 2009</xref>). These factors may provide the preventive influence that leads a highly anxious traumatized youth away from the pathway to delinquency.</p>
<p>Finally, considering the psychodynamic concept of identification with the aggressor and the victim–abuser–nonprotective bystander triad of Miller’s trauma theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X12448856">Miller, 2002</xref>) provides insight into how these ego defense mechanisms operate outside of the awareness of abuse victims, protect the victims from becoming psychologically overwhelmed, and theoretically drive the maladaptive behavioral response of delinquent behavior.</p>
<sec id="section14-0306624X12448856">
<title>Research and Treatment Implications</title>
<p>Researchers need to further understand why anxiety is at times preventive and at other times causal, as well as the most appropriate methods for assessment and intervention. Moreover, further research is needed to understand more about the many risk and resiliency factors which may make the difference between a traumatized male youth becoming delinquent or not. Data collected from nonincarcerated male adolescents might provide valuable data about the many youth who become delinquent but never enter the juvenile justice system. Moreover, the role of anxiety for traumatized female adolescents should be considered in future research. Their reaction to trauma and motivations toward delinquency differ from male adolescents’, and recently the rate of violent externalizing behaviors among female trauma victims has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X12448856">Acoca, 1998</xref>). Incarcerated female adolescents have also been found to have higher rates of psychiatric disorders than incarcerated males, with almost 30% higher rate of anxiety in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X12448856">Karnik et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this project did not address family or environmental data, that information would help to define and support treatment strategies for the analyzed sample. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine which treatment strategies are effective for various youth with differing degrees of exposure to violence/victimization and whether any changes in mood and behavior are maintained over time.</p>
<p>The results of this theoretical and data-based study may provide researchers and clinicians with some insight into the role anxiety plays in the progression toward delinquency some traumatized youth experience. With greater awareness of the effects of anxiety, improved interventions may be developed for this population that could result in decreasing the typically high delinquency and recidivism rates, and improving their overall mental health outcomes.</p>
<p>Interventions designed for traumatized male youth should address individual, familial, and community concerns. Individual treatment providers must include a significant focus on anxiety, and should consider the environment and family the child is developing within. Individual therapy using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety could provide male youth with greater insight into their anxiety symptoms, tools to control their anxiety, and coping skills to utilize in their home environments. Moreover, psychodynamic therapy could provide them with greater insight into the unconscious processes that may be occurring for them secondary to their exposure to trauma, and could help them achieve and sustain healthier protective mechanisms through a longer term therapeutic relationship. Family therapy is also indicated based on prior research that reveals the significant role that one’s family relationships and home environment play in their reaction to violent trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X12448856">Quinsey, Skilling, Lalumiere, &amp; Craig, 2004</xref>). Multisystemic therapy (MST), a family-based therapeutic approach, has shown promise in addressing the many risk factors discussed above, which contribute to and maintain delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X12448856">Curtis et al., 2004</xref>). On the community level, better supervision by parents, community leaders, and law enforcement officials would help to decrease the degree of exposure to violence this population is affected by. Creative community programming and better child protective policies would also contribute to minimizing violence exposure, and therefore, its negative impact on these at-risk male youth.</p>

<sec id="section15-0306624X12448856">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study had several limitations, including small sample size and its use of a specialized population (incarcerated male youth). To understand the effect of anxiety on the pathway from trauma to delinquency, a larger number of youth, involved and not involved with the juvenile justice system, needs to be included. Another limitation to these findings is that the exposure to violence and victimization questions were combined into one assessment scale, which did not allow for consideration of the impact of these factors separately. Future research should assess exposure to violence and victimization separately to allow for more detailed findings, and therefore, more refined information about their impact on youth’s commission of violent delinquent acts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0306624X12448856">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, juveniles were involved in an average of 25% of serious violent offenses over the past 25 years. To decrease the rates of violent delinquency and recidivism among male adolescents, accurate information about what contributes to the development of this behavior is needed. This information may help to improve prevention efforts and the early identification of at-risk youth, as well as intervention strategies. Clearly assessing and treating anxiety with this at-risk population is warranted, and as early as possible. Ideally, male youth who have been exposed to violence or victimized during childhood should be identified and treated with combined CBT and psychodynamic treatment modalities to ensure that as many of the psychological factors that contribute to progress on the trauma delinquency trajectory are addressed. Family intervention using MST is also warranted to diminish any negative effects that the home environment and parenting relationships/characteristics are causing.</p>
