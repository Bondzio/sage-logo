<p>This very useful volume offers the most thorough account available of employment in Britain during the 1990s. It is full of fascinating findings and information. The conclusions we should draw from the descriptive accounts are less clear.</p>
<p>The thrust of the book examines whether British employers have moved from long-term employment based on internalized, bureaucratic arrangements toward individualized, market-based arrangements that rely on more nonstandard work. (Readers should know that I am responsible for much of the argument about the erosion of internalized, lifetime employment models and the rise of more market-based approaches, and many of my arguments are taken on explicitly by the authors.)</p>
<p>The authors assemble a range of data, especially their own employee surveys, and conclude that internalized, bureaucratic employment systems remain powerful indeed and may even have strengthened in recent years. Not all evidence looks that way, however. Whether job tenure has declined, for example, is one of the central factors in that overall debate. They rely especially on the work of economists Gregg and Wadsworth to conclude that any erosion in job tenure has been modest at best. Yet the more recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0730888411425337">Gregg &amp; Wadsworth, 2002</xref>) study by those authors, which is unfortunately not cited, points out limitations to earlier work and reaches the opposite conclusion, noting that “we believe our analysis indicates that there is evidence to support the view that jobs are becoming less stable” (p. 132).</p>
<p>The authors are on safer ground with the interesting finding that employers appear to have added pay grades (and presumably promotion levels) over time, the opposite of what the evidence shows for the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0730888411425337">Rajan &amp; Wulf, 2006</xref>). They also note that the percentage of employees who report that their job is part of a recognized promotion ladder increased by 5% from 1984 to 2000. However, only half of those respondents report that they have jobs with prospects for career advancement with their current employer, a surprisingly low level if one believes that internalized, bureaucratic management systems are the norm.</p>
<p>They also find that more than half of employees say that their individualized job performance is captured and reported by a computerized system. The use of formal performance appraisals of individual performance rose over the period for all employees except those in the most routine jobs. Incentive pay increased not only for individuals but also for groups based on job performance.</p>
<p>The authors assert that these findings are consistent with an internalized, bureaucratic approach to managing employees. Yet they seem to be precisely the sort of developments necessary to drive an individualized, market-based approach to managing employees. The authors also argue that because U.K. employers are pursuing functional flexibility (e.g., cross-training, more employee involvement), they either cannot or will not pursue numerical flexibility associated with layoffs and nonstandard work, practices consistent with the market-based approach. We know from U.S. data that this is not true. U.S. employers use the two approaches as complements, not substitutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0730888411425337">Cappelli &amp; Neumark, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguably the most interesting results in the book concern aspects of overwork and the factors that drive employee perceptions of it. They find, for example, that more sophisticated human resource practices increased work demands as much as additional hours of work, and single earners actually experienced more job stress than those in two-income relationships, a result that begs for further analysis.</p>
<p>Among other important results are methodological issues: the usefulness of John Goldthorpe’s social class taxonomy based on transaction cost economics principles (asset specificity and monitoring intensity) in explaining how different occupations are treated, with the lowest level appearing to get worse treatment over time; the creation of a Job Desirability Index to rate jobs and using that to explain job satisfaction.</p>
<p>The authors are to be commended for pulling together all this descriptive information and for being skeptical about journalistic stories of changes in the workplace. Data-driven evidence of the kind presented here is surely better than anecdotes and stories from journalists, but often, as in the United States, the journalists turn out to be right because they are describing what is happening now while the data available to researchers and the subsequent analyses are out of date. Perhaps the authors will revisit the issue with data from the 2000s to see how the story turns out.</p>
