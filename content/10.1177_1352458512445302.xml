<abstract>
<p>Baló’s concentric sclerosis (BCS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease related to multiple sclerosis; its underlying pathology remains unclear. At 7 T MRI in a 19-year-old female BCS patient, microhaemorrhages and ectatic veins were found in T2 hyperintense regions, features which have not been previously reported in conjunction with BCS, and these findings may support the view that vascular pathology plays a role in BCS. MRS data suggest that neuron loss and lipid turnover still took place months after a remission. Plasma exchange was effective in treating a relapse with severe motor deficits, and the off-label use of natalizumab was successful in maintaining remission in this patient.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>A 19-year-old white woman with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) presented with gait ataxia and a mild right-sided hemiparesis in January 2009. Two other relapses had occurred since 2007. She had been taking interferon beta 1a 22µg s.c. since May 2008. The current relapse was treated with i.v. steroids; however, her condition continued to worsen. Ten days later the paresis was almost total in the right arm and severe in the right leg. 1.5 T MRI (Signa, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) revealed an inhomogeneous T2 hyperintense lesion in the left periventricular parietal white matter (PWM) with a well-defined border zone in the anterior part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445302">Figure 1a</xref>). In addition this lesion showed inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. MRI findings were suggestive of B-cell mediated MS (subtype II). Five cycles of plasma separations were administered every other day. Ten days later, only a mild improvement in the weakness was observed. Five cycles of immunoadsorption were then applied every 3 days. Afterwards, a moderate improvement in the weakness was found. At the beginning of April 2009 the patient developed vertigo. The new symptoms were treated with i.v. steroids, and these symptoms almost completely resolved. Subsequently, treatment with natalizumab was initiated. There have been no relapses since April 2009 under this therapy. In the following months neurological functions improved gradually.</p>

<p>A follow-up 1.5 T MRI in April 2010 showed a decrease in lesion volume in the left periventricular PWM with no contrast enhancement. This MRI scan revealed a defined ring structure suggestive of Baló’s concentric sclerosis (BCS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445302">Figure 1b</xref>). After this finding, the diagnosis was revised to BCS. Natalizumab treatment was continued off-label.</p>
<p>Additional high-field MRI and MRS was applied (3T Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). T2-weighted images revealed a well-defined ring structure of the Baló lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445302">Figure 1c</xref>). For MRS, a single-voxel sequence (TR: 2320 ms, TE: 30/135 ms, flip angle: 90°, voxel size: 10 mm<sup>3</sup>, averages: 128, acquisition time: 5:06 minutes) was positioned in healthy PWM, as well as in the Baló lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445302">Figure 1d</xref>). Metabolite concentrations and Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios were defined at the Baló lesion and in the unaffected PWM. MRS exposed a reduced NAA and an increased Cho peak in the lesion. The NAA/Cr ratio was 0.92 and the Cho/Cr ratio was 1.21. Compared with the unaffected region, Cho was 1.63 times higher and NAA 0.59 times lower in the BCS lesion. A pathological lactate peak was found in short echo time MRS.</p>
<p>Ultra-high-field MR imaging was additionally performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445302">Figure 1e</xref>) with a whole-body MRI scanner (Magnetom 7T, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and a 32-channel transmit/receive head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA). The protocol included susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), a 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence after contrast agent (Gadopentetic acid, Magnevist<sup>®</sup>, 0.1 mmol/kg/bw) and a MP2RAGE sequence. The SWI sequence revealed multiple hypointense lesions indicating microhaemorrhages within the T2 hyperintense areas and also showed ectatic veins in these areas. In MPRAGE and MP2RAGE sequences, the lesion borders were depicted with high contrast to the surrounding white matter.</p>
<p>The imaging findings of this case study support the view that vascular pathology contributes to the pathogenesis of BCS. BCS is classically considered to be a demyelinating disease; however, there is evidence for a vascular disease mechanism which may account for the peculiar ring structure. Microvascular damage was initially suggested by Courville.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512445302">1</xref></sup> Stadelmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512445302">2</xref></sup> observed lesion patterns showing structural alterations suggestive of hypoxia-like tissue injury. This group further suggested that ‘ischemic preconditioning’ with subsequent demyelination is present in this disease. Using 7 T MRI SWI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512445302">3</xref></sup> microhaemorrhages and ectatic veins were found to be similar to small developmental venous anomalies. These abnormalities were beyond the resolution of 3 T MRI SWI. Ultra-high-field MRI has been shown to improve visualization of structural abnormalities in the white matter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445302">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512445302">5</xref></sup> and MRI studies at 1.5 T and 7 T in MS have demonstrated a higher number of detectable lesions at the higher field strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445302">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512445302">5</xref></sup> In addition, at 7 T most lesions could be shown to be centred on small parenchymal veins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512445302">5</xref></sup> In the patient presented here, concentric ring patterns characteristic for BCS were detected at all field strengths, but 3 T MRI led to an improved detection of lesion compartments compared with 1.5 T MRI, and at 7 T MRI, the visualization of the inner structure of the lesion with multilobular components was enhanced in T1-weighted images (MPRAGE, MP2RAGE). Finally, the 3 T MRS data suggest that neuron loss and lipid turnover still take place months after the acute event; nevertheless, a single time point does not prove an ongoing pathological process. In addition, the MRS findings were suggestive of impaired aerobic metabolism.</p>
<p>Neuropathology studies on BCS have not yet reported microhaemorrhages or ectatic veins. In contrast, studies of brain samples from MS patients have shown that microvascular injury and subsequent haemorrhages may contribute to the development of MS lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512445302">6</xref></sup> In BCS, microvascular damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512445302">2</xref></sup> caused by inflammation is a possible explanation for perivascular haemorrhages.</p>
<p>The optimum treatment for the disease remains unclear. If relapses are refractory to steroids, mitoxantrone, i.v. immunoglobulins, plasma exchange and immunoadsorption have been applied. In MS, plasma exchange and immunoadsorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512445302">7</xref></sup> are associated with clinical improvement of severe motor deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512445302">8</xref></sup> In the patient presented here, treatment with natalizumab was initiated after the severe relapse, and it was continued after the diagnosis was revised from MS to BCS. The life-threatening event of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated with significant permanent disability and a high mortality has to be taken into account with this decision. Arguments in favour of this decision were that a rare variant of MS was being treated and that there is no established therapy for relapsing–remitting BCS.</p>
<p>In summary, the present case report supports the view that vascular pathology plays a role in the development of the large lesions seen in BCS. Microhaemorrhages found by 7 T MR imaging are likely due to inflammatory microvascular damage. Increasing magnetic field strengths led to an improved detection of lesion compartments, which might allow an earlier diagnosis of BCS. Severe motor deficits may be treated with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption. Monoclonal antibody therapy may be effective in reducing further relapses of BCS.</p>
