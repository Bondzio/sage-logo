<p>As I discuss in my book “The Future of Pharma” (Gower, 2011), one of the implications of the evolution of the life sciences industry is an increase in complexity. When I began my career in the sector, in 1978, the market was, to all intents and purposes, the USA, Western Europe and Japan – about 15% of the world. The customers were doctors and nurses and competitive advantage lay almost purely in clinical efficacy and, occasionally ease of use. How the world has changed. We now operate in a globalising, converging world market where value is increasingly defined in health economic outcomes and the decision is made by a combination of health care professionals, payers and often patients too. Our selection of papers in this issue reflects this changing market.</p>
<p>Our first paper, from a group of Turkish researchers, looks at the area of obesity and weight loss supplements. Clearly, this is a large and growing market for both prescription and non-prescription medicines. The work reveals a large degree of dissatisfaction with products both in terms of efficacy and side-effects. It also suggests heterogeneity amongst users. I suspect these findings are generalisable outside of Turkey and imply a strong, global unmet need. This is an interesting paper for anyone in this therapy area but also in the more general category of lifestyle products.</p>
<p>Our second paper looks at a very different market context – Rheumatoid Arthritis in the USA. In particular, it looks at treatment patterns with biologics. The paper therefore provides some interesting information about the development of this market, which is of course anticipated to grow as our population ages.</p>
<p>Our third paper considers the interesting topic of how physicians perceive promotions in India. This is a useful contribution because, despite the importance of the topic and the market, much of the existing work in this area is based on the very different markets of the USA and Europe. There is of course no guarantee that different markets will react to promotions in the same way and so this work, which provides useful data from a field study, will be valuable to anyone working in the Indian market and perhaps other markets with similar levels of development.</p>
<p>In addition to the rise of the emerging markets, one of the most important developments in our market is the rise of online channels. Our fifth paper looks at the confluence of these two issues by examining the issue of online pharmacies in China. It finds that their marketing mix is gradually developing and changing focus as the market matures, which is as marketing theory would predict but interesting nevertheless. This paper will interest anyone with an interest in either emerging markets or on line channels.</p>
<p>Despite the rise of online channels, the role of the salesperson remains important and their ability to adapt to different contexts has never been more important. Our fifth paper, again based on field work in Turkey, looks at this issue and provides interesting findings. It reveals a fascinating picture of how customer orientation and adaptive behaviour combine to create effective salesperson behaviour. I think this paper will be of value to anyone who works through a sales team.</p>
<p>Our final paper looks at hospital services. In many developed and emerging markets, there is competition between public and private hospitals and this paper researches differences in service quality between these two. It reveals important gaps and differences that represent useful opportunities for health services to develop their value proposition.</p>
<p>I hope you find these papers interesting and valuable. As ever, I invite comment and questions.</p>
