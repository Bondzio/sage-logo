<title>Trimethylaminuria</title>
<p>Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a metabolic condition in which the body is unable to break down an offensively pungent alkaline chemical called trimethylamine (TMA). TMA, which can produce a faecal rotten egg or fishy smell, is therefore emitted through bodily orifices and secretions (hence, why the condition used to be called fish-odour syndrome).</p>
<p>TMAU1 is a genetically inherited disorder, which is very uncommon. TMAU2, however, is an acquired disorder (perhaps triggered by an infection, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or emotional trauma) and is part of a group of systemic breath/body odour conditions some of which are, as yet, unnamed.</p>
<p>TMA is the product of eating normal nutritious foods containing choline. This essential nutrient, however, needs an enzyme (FMO3) to break it down. In the inherited condition (TMAU1), the gene that produced FMO3 is faulty. In some cases, the liver cannot produce FMO3 or the enzyme is dysfunctional. TMA is also excreted by dysbiotic bacteria present in the gut. However, these pathogenic bacteria are yet to be identified and, at least in my case, are extremely resistant to antibiotics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-innovait_ins093">Figure 1</xref> shows the production of TMA in a normal gut and the conversion of TMA to TMA N-Oxide in the liver by the FMO3 enzyme.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of the condition is made by testing urine for an increased ratio of TMA:TMA-N oxide. Further genetic testing, in some cases, can lead to identifying the faulty gene. As the disorder is highly under-diagnosed, there are no accurate figures for the number of people who suffer from it.</p>
<p>It appears that no particular racial group, gender or age group is predisposed towards TMAU; the condition can potentially affect anyone at any time. What is more, people who suffer from these disorders can probably pass on the pathogenic TMA-excreting bacteria to their offspring. Recently, I met somebody (a malodour sufferer since the age of 9 years) who said that the condition had affected three generations of her family. This may mean that ever-increasing numbers of people will inherit these conditions and the conditions will unfortunately manifest themselves in children. It has been suggested that children with autism may be more predisposed to developing TMAU than others. Yet, without research, many questions remain unanswered.</p>

<title>My journey to diagnosis</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>It's unbelievable, isn't it? In this day and age, that someone can smell like that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I overheard this comment about me as one friend spoke to another and, while it may have been hard to hear at the time, I actually agree with it. There are many hundreds of people throughout the world who suffer from a form of blood-borne halitosis and/or systemic body odour. I am one of them. Sometimes, I ask myself why I have to live like this when I live in a society which is scientifically advanced enough to genetically modify DNA and to create life in a test tube.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, when in my early 30s, I developed halitosis that, despite every conceivable effort on my part — meticulous oral hygiene, allergy tests, elimination diets, alternative therapies, visits to specialists—I just could not cure. My GP said: ‘I would just have to live with it’, but, despite this, I remained optimistic that I would find the underlying cause of my condition and, consequently, the solution. It was a lonely, uphill struggle.</p>
<p>After many years of searching for answers, I acquired a consultation with a specialist at the metabolic unit of a London teaching hospital where I carried out a urine test. The sample was sent off to Sheffield Children's Hospital for testing and I was diagnosed as having TMAU.</p>
<p>Without the support of the forums and websites, I finally discovered on the Internet, I may not have been diagnosed at all. The website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.TMAU.org.uk">www.TMAU.org.uk</ext-link> provided all the information necessary for me to test for TMAU. GPs who are faced with a patient suffering from malodour could direct him or her to this website or to an appropriate specialist in metabolic conditions to eliminate TMAU as a possible cause of malodour.</p>

<title>Living with TMAU</title>
<p>Traditional Chinese or Indian medicine aims to unify mind and body in most of its treatments. However, when most people think of ‘illness’ in our Western society, it is physical malaise, which immediately springs to mind. Psychological pain is still rather stigmatized by our society and many odour sufferers are berated for being self-pitying or over-sensitive. For this reason, teenage sufferers particularly may have difficulty expressing the psychological impact of growing up with an odour disorder when they come before a GP.</p>
<p>Most malodour-producing sufferers are subjected to ridicule, bullying or ostracism on a regular basis, as a result of the condition impeding every social interaction. GPs, therefore, need to be aware that the patient suffering from malodour is vulnerable and needs to be taken seriously. A systemic odour condition is a disability because it has a long-term adverse effect on the sufferer's ability to perform day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>Malodour-producing people can become targets for discrimination as the smell they produce can directly encroach upon the wellbeing of other people, potentially causing discomfort and offence. This said: I never cease to be amazed by the compassion and tolerance of some of those people who are aware of my condition. Similarly, I never cease to be amazed by the optimism and stoicism of people living with foul-odour-producing conditions, such as TMAU.</p>
<p>Research into curing TMAU is lacking; a ‘way of managing symptoms’ is offered instead. The problem is: it doesn't work at all for some people. I undergo rigorous diets, fasting (to reduce the choline intake from food) and I have taken neomycin antibiotics to combat the TMA excreted by the gut bacteria. The treatment protocol makes me weak and anaemic and, although I have managed to reduce the level of TMA, my odour persists.</p>
<p>The repeated use of antibiotics, the adherence to a nutritionally deficient diet and a cocktail of probiotics and supplements is the only treatment option available. Sufferers are advised to take these supplements and probiotics regularly but, unlike special foods for people suffering from coeliac disease or phenylketonuria (where foods can be prescribed with ‘ACBS’ endorsement), most are not available on prescription. I am fortunate enough to be in employment (part-time) and so I can afford the monthly £65 cost of supplements. Sadly, some of my fellow sufferers have lost their jobs as a result of their condition and cannot afford to buy them</p>
<p>I spoke to many people with odour disorders after my diagnosis of TMAU in 2010. The majority, like me, had waited years and years for answers. During those searching years of confusion and despair, we all experienced well-intentioned doctors, psychologists and relatives who insisted our problems were exaggerated or even imaginary. To deny the existence of an odour problem is injurious, it further isolates us and actually reinforces the mammoth social taboo surrounding the issue.</p>
<p>Most patients suffering from malodour are resilient and extremely disciplined regarding their diets and lifestyle. However, beyond diagnosis GPs can provide much needed support for them in living with an incurable condition, which is frequently beyond their control. For example, psychological therapies may be helpful to tackle low mood, anxiety or social phobias resulting from malodour syndromes. When depressive thoughts come into my mind, I strive to change my inner dialogue from ‘If I didn't have this condition I could …’ to ‘Because I have this condition I can …’</p>

<title>The GP perspective</title>
<p>It is challenging when faced with a patient that you do not know how to help. The curriculum is vast and reflects the level of knowledge GPs have to acquire, and maintain, over their careers. It is inevitable that you will experience patients from time to time with problems that will stretch your knowledge to its limits. As Karen has alluded to throughout this article, it is important to listen to patient concerns, be open-minded, and be prepared to look things up and/or take advice from both primary care and specialist colleagues if you feel that you are treading on uncertain ground.</p>
