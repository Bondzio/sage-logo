<p>Understanding social relationships – between men and women, children and parents, doctors and patients, employers and employees, or teachers and students – is the key task of all social sciences. The analysis of temporality and time, in turn, opens up an invaluable and irreplaceable main route to complete this task. It is this insight that provides the starting point and justification for the prolonged existence of <italic>Time &amp; Society</italic>. The issue you hold in hand may serve as a paradigm case for the redemption of this claim: it is through a thorough investigation of the temporal structures and patterns, experiences and expectations, that our authors approach the investigation of all of the relationships enumerated just mentioned. Thus, Won explores the temporality of working hours and the Confucian tradition to make sense of the relationships between men and women, family and work in Korea (‘Gendered working-time arrangements and their policy implications: Korean experiences’), while Lynda M Ashbourne and Kerry J. Daly examine the relationship between adolescents and parents in Canadian family life through a discussion of its embattled and changing time-structures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the contributions to our <italic>special section</italic> on <italic>Care Time vs. Service Time</italic> beautifully illustrate, it is precisely the tensions and frictions between the inherent time of (professional) ‘care work’, and its ethics, on the one hand, and the temporal patterns of late-modern, capitalist (public) service work on the other hand, that provide access to an adequate understanding of the changing nature of contemporary welfare services.</p>
<p>Thus, Astrid Pernille Jespersen and Torben Elgaard Jensen discuss the intricate temporalities involved in consultation between doctors and patients (‘Making consultations run smoothly: A science and technology studies perspective on doctors’ skillful use of time’), whereas Helena Hirvonen and Marita Husso tackle the conflicting temporal patterns of (health)care work and public service structures head-on (‘Living on a knife’s edge: Temporal conflicts in welfare service work’). Finally, Colley, Henrieksson, Niemeyer and Seddon convincingly point out that the blatant conflicts and contradictions between the temporality of education and the time-structures of neoliberal capitalism and welfare reforms driven by its logics are, in the end, a matter of political power and negotiation (‘Competing time orders in human service work: Towards a politics of time’).</p>
<p>Taken together, the contributions collected in this issue powerfully hammer home the point that the temporal norms that govern our individual and collective lives are neither naturally given nor culturally invariable: they should be made a key object of public consideration, political debate and democratic will-formation. To establish this point, however, has always been one of the key-objectives of <italic>Time &amp; Society</italic>.</p>
