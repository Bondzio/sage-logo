<abstract>
<p>Long-term care in the United States has been plagued with high turnover among direct care workers (DCWs). Previous qualitative and descriptive studies have suggested that resident-centered job satisfaction deters DCW turnover. Related DCW recruitment strategies have also been promoted. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of resident-centered job satisfaction on DCW turnover intent, a proven predictor of actual turnover. Using content analysis, <italic>t</italic> tests, χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and logistic regression analyses, the author analyzes both qualitative and quantitative data from a survey of 722 DCWs at 108 assisted living facilities. Qualitative analyses indicate that for some DCWs, resident-centered job satisfaction deters turnover intent. The quantitative analyses, however, show that resident-centered job satisfaction has no effect on turnover intent, except that DCWs with high resident-centered job satisfaction are less likely to apply for another job in long-term care. In addition to policy implications, theoretical implications related to psychic income, prisoner of love, and caring labor are discussed.</p>

<p>Direct care workers (DCWs), also referred to as aides or nursing assistants, shoulder the majority of care responsibilities in long-term care (LTC) settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511428456">Institute of Medicine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511428456">Olson, 2003</xref>) and are crucial to the quality of care (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511428456">Greene, Hawes, Wood, &amp; Woodsong, 1997</xref>). High voluntary turnover of DCWs is a prevalent and serious issue. A national study on job turnover of DCWs (nursing assistants) in nursing homes showed an average yearly turnover rate of 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511428456">Donoghue, 2010</xref>). Average annual turnover rates among DCWs in assisted living facilities have been reported to range from 55% to 200% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511428456">Hawes, Rose, &amp; Phillips, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511428456">Konetzka, Stearns, Konrad, Magaziner, &amp; Zimmerman, 2005</xref>). About 80% of DCWs who enter the LTC workforce leave within the first year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0164027511428456">Wike, 2007</xref>). DCW turnover not only is costly to providers, because replacement entails costs in hiring and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0164027511428456">Seavey, 2004</xref>), but also disrupts care continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511428456">Dawson &amp; Surpin, 2001</xref>) and results in poor quality of resident care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511428456">Greene et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511428456">Castle, Engberg, Anderson, and Men (2007)</xref> further showed that turnover reduction in LTC settings increases resident care quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511428456">Larsen (2000)</xref> also indicated that when turnover decreased by 20%, resident satisfaction increased by 30% on average.</p>
<p>LTC literature shows that employee turnover intention and actual turnover are highly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511428456">Castle et al., 2007</xref>) and that turnover intention is a primary precursor of turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0164027511428456">Simons &amp; Roberson, 2003</xref>). A substantial number of studies have investigated the underlying causes of DCW turnover and turnover intention. Factors examined cover a wide range, including workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511428456">Brannon, Zinn, Mor, &amp; Davis, 2002</xref>), work schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511428456">Castle et al., 2007</xref>), supervision and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511428456">Bishop et al., 2008</xref>), autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511428456">Decker, Harris-Kojetin, &amp; Bercovitz, 2009</xref>), opportunities for personal and professional growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511428456">Decker et al., 2009</xref>), advancement opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0164027511428456">Wike, 2007</xref>), recognition and appreciation by employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511428456">Bowers, Esmond, &amp; Jacobson, 2003</xref>), facility proprietary status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511428456">Brannon et al., 2002</xref>), individual sociodemographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027511428456">Parsons, Simmons, Penn, &amp; Furlough, 2003</xref>), and organizational justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511428456">Chou, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these studies share a similar focus with many studies in the general literature, they ignored an important aspect unique to LTC: DCWs’ relationship with residents and their job satisfaction derived from it. Unlike many other types of employment, care work is usually personal in nature and often occurs on a relatively long-term basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027511428456">England &amp; Folbre, 2003</xref>). The long-term and close contact between DCWs and residents provide ample opportunities for the development of affective relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027511428456">Karner, Montgomery, Dobbs, &amp; Wittmaier, 1998</xref>). Reports indicate that many DCWs developed emotional bonds with residents and expressed that such relationships constitute the most satisfying aspect of their jobs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511428456">Eckert, Zimmerman, &amp; Morgan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027511428456">Gass, 2004</xref>). What then is the role of the DCW-resident relationship or, even more broadly, resident-related or resident-centered job satisfaction in DCW turnover?</p>
<p>Although several other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511428456">Berdes &amp; Eckert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027511428456">Foner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511428456">Robertson, Herth, &amp; Cummings, 1994</xref>) have been cited as addressing the retention effects of the DCW-resident bonds or DCWs’ satisfaction from serving residents, a close examination of these studies indicates that these studies do not concern the relation between these two factors. Only a few studies have actually investigated how resident-centered job satisfaction affects DCW turnover. In a qualitative study of 76 nurse aides at seven nursing homes in Oregon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511428456">Monahan and Carthy (1992)</xref> found that nurse aides initially sought work in nursing homes because they enjoyed working with and helping people. A major reason for them to remain in their jobs was their fondness of the residents, as exemplified by the typical comment: “they [residents] wrap around your heart” (p. 14).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027511428456">Garland, Oyabu, and Gipson (1988)</xref> conducted a descriptive study of 114 nursing assistants in Ohio. Among them, 79 had been working in the same nursing homes for 10 years or more, and 35 had voluntarily left their jobs after various lengths of service. On the basis of their ranking of reasons for staying and leaving, the study suggests that “stayers” appeared to assign more importance to the intrinsic or people-oriented rewards of their jobs, such as relationships with patients, feelings about caring for sick people, and relationships with supervisors. The “leavers” were more concerned with extrinsic factors, such as pay, benefits, and opportunities to learn new things.</p>
<p>In a grounded theory–based study of 38 DCWs at two assisted living facilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511428456">Ball, Lepore, Perkins, Hollingsworth, and Sweatman (2009)</xref> discovered that although the DCW-resident relationships ranged from loving to hostile, almost all DCWs had close emotional ties with at least one resident (and typically more). For most DCWs, their positive relationships with residents constituted a primary component of job satisfaction: DCWs derive meaning from the emotional aspect of caregiving through satisfaction embedded in DCW-resident relationships and through the effect of such relationships on care outcomes. Indeed, about a third of the DCWs reported that “the residents” were a crucial factor in their retention.</p>
<p>Although the above three key studies on the effects of resident-centered job satisfaction on retention made important contributions to the nascent literature of this field, they also had limitations. First, the sample sizes and numbers of facilities involved were relatively small. Second, using qualitative or exploratory research methods, these studies were only able to provide descriptive information to support their conclusions; meanwhile, they were not able to tease out the potential effects of other factors on turnover. These constraints prevent the findings from being more representative and the conclusions from being more convincing. Recognizing such limitations, the authors of these studies called for additional research.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to revisit the issue of the effects of resident-centered job satisfaction on turnover intent among DCWs. Specifically, the study intends to examine whether and how resident-entered job satisfaction affects DCW’s turnover. The study is based on a broader conceptual framework and uses both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Although a broader conceptual framework enables placing resident-centered job satisfaction on a larger conceptual or theoretical map of DCW turnover, the mixed-methods approach has two advantages. First, the qualitative method allows identifying and analyzing resident-centered job satisfaction and comparing with previous qualitative studies. Second, the quantitative analysis goes beyond previous studies by rigorously examining the effects of resident-centered job satisfaction on turnover with statistical analyses, accounting for the effects of other potentially significant variables on the basis of theories and previous empirical findings.</p>
<p>The significance of the study is twofold. First, previous studies (both quantitative and qualitative) on DCW turnover have been largely atheoretical; the results of this study will help advance the turnover theory regarding resident-centered job satisfaction. Second, findings from this study will have practical implications. LTC facilities, faced with high DCW turnover and attendant replacement costs, are looking for strategies to curb the high turnover. The idea that affective DCW-resident bonds or resident-centered job satisfaction may help retain DCWs has special appeal to LTC management. Some LTC facilities’ strategies for DCW turnover intervention in fact echo this idea of stressing the importance of recruiting candidates with certain characteristics, such as compassion and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027511428456">Stryker, 1982</xref>; Wagner, 1988). Compared with other essential changes, such as better pay, lesser workload, and adequate staff support, the alternative of recruiting workers who are caring and have the potential to develop affective relationships with residents and resident-centered job satisfaction may be more financially appealing. Findings from this study will shed light on the potential effectiveness of such a recruitment strategy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0164027511428456">
<title>Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Numerous turnover models exist in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0164027511428456">Latham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511428456">Sikorska-Simmons, 2005</xref>), but none seems to fully captures the crucial factors in DCW turnover. To provide a broader theoretical context for the study, the conceptual framework of the study is derived from multiple models and theories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027511428456">Figure 1</xref>). The overarching model is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027511428456">March and Simon (1958)</xref>, who posited that turnover depends on the perceived desirability and ease of movement from the current job. Perceived desirability of movement represents a push to quit the current job with unattractive characteristics. Perceived ease of movement denotes a pull from the job market, in which alternative employment opportunities are available.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0164027511428456-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, under the factor of perceived desirability of movement, the present study incorporates Hertzberg’s two-factor theory of work motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511428456">Herzberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511428456">Herzberg, Mausner, &amp; Snyderman, 2005</xref>). According to this theory, two sets of factors are involved in work settings: extrinsic factors and intrinsic motivators. Extrinsic factors are not directly related to the job itself but involve situations that surround the performance of the job, such as company policies and administration, supervision, pay, benefits, hours of work, working conditions, job security, and work relations. Hertzberg posited that extrinsic factors are not motivators and that satisfaction in extrinsic factors only prevents job dissatisfaction, although his view has been criticized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0164027511428456">Pinder (1998)</xref>, for example, indicates that extrinsic factors, such as salary, benefits, and working conditions also are motivators. This claim is supported by many other studies on DCW turnover, as discussed above, that have looked into satisfaction in extrinsic factors (e.g., workload, supervisor support, career advancement) as predictors of turnover, although they often did not refer to Hertzberg’s conceptual model.</p>
<p>Another dimension of extrinsic job satisfaction concerns the assessment of organizational justice. Simply put, <italic>organizational justice</italic> refers to fairness in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027511428456">Greenberg, 1990</xref>). On the basis of the equity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511428456">Adams, 1965</xref>), employees contribute their efforts, education, and experience to their organizations, and in return, they anticipate reasonable output in pay, awards, supervisory treatment, feedback, performance evaluations, institutional recognition, and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511428456">Lambert, 2003</xref>). In addition to intraperson comparison, organizational justice is also assessed by comparisons within or across organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511428456">Young, 1997</xref>). Perceived organizational justice can be the consequence of comparisons between an individual’s input and outcome and those of other employees in the same organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511428456">Young, 1997</xref>). It can also be the result of comparisons between one’s own input and outcome and those of employees with similar positions in other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511428456">Young, 1997</xref>). In short, organizational justice is achieved when there is consistency between input and output in comparison. When inconsistency arises, psychological distress will follow and result in adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511428456">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0164027511428456">Van Dierendonck, Schaufeli, &amp; Buunk, 2001</xref>), including turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511428456">Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511428456">Chou (2009)</xref> showed that perceived organizational justice on the basis of input-output comparison within organizations predicts intent to leave among DCWs in assisted living facilities. No study has yet investigated the effect of cross-organizational comparison on DCW turnover.</p>
<p>Intrinsic factors include aspects of the job itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511428456">Herzberg et al., 2005</xref>). Intrinsic job satisfaction arises from the experience of performing the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511428456">Decker et al., 2009</xref>). DCWs experience similar aspects of intrinsic job satisfaction as workers in other occupations, aspects such as self-actualization, making full use of one’s knowledge and skills, achievement, recognition for achievement, and personal growth. However, because of the nature of their work, DCWs may also derive intrinsic job satisfaction from their interactions and relationships with the residents for whom they care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511428456">Ball et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027511428456">Garland et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511428456">Monahan &amp; Carthy, 1992</xref>). On the basis of the logic of the two-factor model, it is reasonable to assume that resident-centered job satisfaction will have a negative effect on turnover. Indeed, as discussed above, previous qualitative studies have suggested that resident-centered job satisfaction deters DCW turnover.</p>
<p>Based on of the above conceptual framework and empirical findings, it is hypothesized, for the quantitative portion of this study, that DCWs’ turnover intent will be negatively associated with resident-centered job satisfaction, controlling for other potentially important variables discussed above.</p>

<sec id="section2-0164027511428456">
<title>Study 1: The Qualitative Study</title>
<p>Given the importance of resident-centered job satisfaction to DCW turnover discussed above, the purpose of the qualitative study is to examine such satisfaction through a content analysis of the responses to an opened-question on job satisfaction in a DCW survey. Results from the analysis not only will enhance our understanding of resident-centered job satisfaction among DCWs but also, will be quantified and transformed into a binary variable on resident-centered job satisfaction for quantitative analyses.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0164027511428456">
<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>The study used data from the preintervention survey administered by the Worker Education, Training, and Assistance Program (WETA). WETA was a demonstration project to improve job satisfaction and worker retention in participating assisted living facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511428456">Sager et al., 2003</xref>). It was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of university faculty members and researchers (with doctoral or master’s degrees) in geriatrics, public health, sociology, anthropology, social work, and statistics. Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to the study. All involved personnel were trained with specifics about this project. The survey was piloted before its formal implementation.</p>
<p>The WETA sample was a convenience sample of 108 assisted living facilities in Wisconsin, recruited through the Wisconsin Assisted Living Association in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511428456">Chou &amp; Robert, 2008</xref>). The facilities in the sample averaged 24 beds, with the majority (103 facilities [95%]) ranging from 8 to 80 beds. All the DCWs in the sampled facilities were invited to participate in a paper-and-pencil survey on their job characteristics, job attitudes, turnover intention, and sociodemographic characteristics. The survey contained both closed- and open-ended sections and lasted for about half an hour. After responding to closed-ended questions, respondents were asked two open-ended questions; one was “What do you find most satisfying about your job?” The survey was administered by project researchers in the assisted living facilities, without the presence of the facilities’ administrators or supervisors. Completed questionnaires were either collected by project researchers during on-site survey administration or mailed in prepaid envelopes to the researchers by the employees, if the employees preferred to do so. The incentive for completing the survey was nonmonetary, in the form of a pen with the project logo. As an anonymous survey, no data were collected from nonrespondents to the survey.</p>
<p>Of the DCWs in the 108 facilities, 984 participated in the survey (response rate = 72%). Among them, 722 (73.4%) responded to the open-ended question. Chi-square tests and <italic>t</italic> tests and indicated that there was no difference in sociodemographics and turnover intention between those who responded to the open-ended question and those who did not. Characteristics of the full sample and subsamples (those who reported resident-centered job satisfaction on the open-ended question vs. those who did not) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511428456">Table 1</xref>. For the sake of parsimony, sample and subsample characteristics are discussed in the quantitative section.</p>

<title>Methods of Analysis</title>
<p>The responses to the question were examined by means of content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027511428456">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>). The procedure of content analysis varies depending on the coding methods (i.e., emergent vs. a priori coding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027511428456">Stemler, 2001</xref>). Under the method of emergent coding, the procedure involves identifying themes from data, developing a coding system, coding the material of interest, analyzing the resultant data, and grouping the emerged themes into categories. Following these steps, two researchers (the author and a colleague) reviewed all responses, identified themes, developed a coding system, coded all the responses, and categorized the themes. Discussions and revisions on the coding system, actual coding, themes, and categories followed at each step until a consensus was reached. For example, as a reliability check, independently coded responses were compared and showed 75% agreement. After a discussion of the differing categorizations, a consensus was arrived on the remaining 25%.</p>
<p>Following the procedure of content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027511428456">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027511428456">Stemler, 2001</xref>), categories, themes, numbers of references (response items), and number of respondents and theme in each category were derived. When respondents offered multiple strings of expressions that related to different themes, each unit of expression was coded and counted as one reference. For example, an employee gave the following response to the question about job satisfaction: “Working with the elderly as well as wonderful coworkers. It makes me happy knowing I did a good deed for someone else who needs my help.” Three units of reference were coded: (a) working with the residents, (b) working with coworkers, and (c) sense of achievement. After the themes were compiled, those themes were grouped into different categories, such as resident, supervisors, coworkers, job characteristics, and work environment. Under each category, the number of respondents actually contributed to that category was tallied. Because a respondent could offer several references, the number of references in each category may exceed the number of respondents. However, if an individual made multiple remarks related to a single theme, those remarks were coded and counted as one reference for that theme. Thus, the number of references and the number respondents are the same under each theme. The numbers of references and residents were further used to calculate the percentages.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Based on responses to the open-ended question on job satisfaction, a total of 21 major and minor themes were identified from 1,042 references (response items) by 722 respondents. Those themes were then grouped into 10 categories representing sources of satisfaction including: the residents (76% of the references, mentioned by 83.2% of the respondents), coworkers (7.4% of references, 9.2% of respondents), job characteristics (6.2% of references, 8.8% of respondents), residents’ families (2.3% of references, 2.7% of respondents), work environment (1.8% of references, 2.6% of respondents), learning and gaining experiences (1.8% of reference, 2.6% of respondents), supervisors (1.5% of references, 2.2% of respondents), management (1.1% of references, 1.5% of respondents), work hours (1% of references, 1.3% of respondents), and pay (0.9% of references, 1.2% of respondents).</p>
<p>Under the category of resident-centered job satisfaction, six major and minor themes were identified: (a) residents (general), (b) helping and working with residents, (c) a sense of accomplishment, (d) recognition and appreciation from residents, (e) affection between respondents and residents, and (f) residents being the only reason for working here. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511428456">Table 2</xref> presents the themes, numbers and percentages of references and respondents in the category of residents, and examples of respondents’ original expressions, while omitting categories unrelated to residents. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511428456">Table 2</xref>, there were a total of 792 references to residents in all responses, representing 77% of all references to all themes in this category. A total of 615 respondents made at least a reference to residents, representing 85.2% of all respondents. As shown, seven DCWs explicitly expressed that residents were the only reason for them to work there or to stay on the job.</p>

<sec id="section10-0164027511428456">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Turnover intention reflects a progression of stages, starting from (a) thinking about quitting one’s job and proceeding to (b) actively looking for a job and (c) applying for a job. Furthermore, targeted employment may also be in the same or a different field. Therefore, several binary variables were constructed to represent different stages or types of turnover intention. The variables of “having thought seriously about quitting” and “having actively looked for a job” were measured respectively by “In the last few months, have you: (a) thought seriously about quitting your job? (b) actively looked for another job?” (yes = 1, no = 0). “Having applied for a job in LTC” and “having applied for a job in a field other than LTC” were created on the basis of responses to the questions “In the last few months, since you’ve been at your current job, have you: (a) applied for a job with another company in the long-term care field? (b) applied for a job with a company in a different field?” (yes = 1, no = 0). “Having applied for a job” was measured by a combination of responses to the above two questions on applying for a job in LTC or a different field (“yes” to either or both of the questions = 1, “no” to both questions = 0). “Intention to quit” was measured by a combination of “having thought seriously about quitting,” “having actively looked for a job,” and “having applied for a job” (“yes” to any = 1, “no” to all three = 0).</p>

<p>Based on the results from the qualitative study, a binary quantitative variable<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0164027511428456">1</xref></sup> was created as a proxy for resident-centered job satisfaction. A response related to any of the six themes (residents, helping and working with residents, a sense of accomplishment, recognition and appreciation from residents, affection between respondents and residents, and residents being the only reason to work there) was coded 1, as a proxy for high resident-centered job satisfaction. No response in any of the five themes was coded 0, as a proxy for no or low resident-centered job satisfaction. In other words, if a DCW mentioned any of the six themes of resident-centered job satisfaction, he or she was coded as having high resident-centered job satisfaction. In contrast, if a DCW did not mention any of these themes, he or she was coded as having no or low resident-centered job satisfaction.</p>

<sec id="section12-0164027511428456">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Age was measured in years. Gender was male (1) or female (0). Ethnicity included White (1) and non-White (0). Educational attainment involved an ordinal scale (grade school or less = 1, some high school = 2, completed high school/General Educational Development certificate = 3, some tech or trade school or some college = 4, completed tech or trade school or college = 5, graduate or professional school = 6). Marital or partnership status was indicated by “married or living with a partner” (1) or “not married or without a partner” (0). Pay indicated hourly pay. Six binary benefit variables (yes = 1, no =0) were included: retirement benefit, health insurance, life insurance, dental insurance, paid holidays, and paid sick days. Certified nursing assistant<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0164027511428456">2</xref></sup> (CNA) status (yes = 1, no = 0), work status (part-time = 1, weekly work hours &lt; 40; full-time = 2, weekly work hours ≥ 40), and facility proprietary status (nonprofit = 1, for-profit = 0) were also included.</p>
<p>Eight extrinsic job satisfaction variables were included. Satisfaction with supervisors (“How satisfied are you with your supervisor?”), satisfaction with coworkers (“How satisfied are you with your co-workers?”), and satisfaction with one’s chances for advancement (“How satisfied are you with your chances for advancement?”) were measured using a 7-point, Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>very dissatisfied</italic> to 7 = <italic>very satisfied</italic>). Satisfaction with work schedule (“My work schedule meets my personal needs”), satisfaction with work demands (“The demands of my job and my personal life often conflict”), and organizational justice in pay (“I am paid fairly for the work I do”) were each assessed using a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Organizational justice in workload (Cronbach’s α = .74) was assessed by combining five items: “I have too many things to do at once at my job” (reversed), “I often leave work exhausted” (reversed), “This company expects too much of me” (reversed), “There is usually enough time to do high quality work,” and “My supervisor often demands more than I can do” (reversed), on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Cross-organizational comparison (Cronbach’s α = .89) was measured by the aggregate score of a set of appraisals: comparing how it might be in other companies, “Job security here is,” “Working relationships here are,” “Recognition for my work here is,” “My benefits here are,” “My pay here is,” “Training and education here are,” “My chance to have input into day to day work decisions here is,” “The company’s commitment to providing quality care to our residents/clients is,” and “Overall, working here is.” Each item was measured on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>much worse</italic> to 7 = <italic>much better</italic>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, making full use of one’s knowledge and skills (“My job lets me make full use of my knowledge and skills”) was assessed using a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Perceived employment opportunity was assessed by the reverse score of “If I left this job, it would be hard to find another one just as good” (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Quality commitment was assessed by “I feel personally responsible for the high quality of my work” (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To examine potential differences from the respondents and nonrespondents to the above open-ended question, <italic>t</italic> tests and χ<sup>2</sup> tests were conducted (analyses not shown). The results indicated that there was no significant difference between respondents and nonrespondents in sociodemographics or facility ownership status (for-profit or nonprofit). The correlation analysis (not shown) of all the continuous variables revealed a correlation of .54 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) between satisfaction with supervisors and comparison with other companies as the highest correlation, indicating no multicollinearity. Chi-square tests and both binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed for hypothesis-testing. To compare the magnitude of effect across variables related to satisfaction at work, <italic>z</italic> scores of the following variables were used in the logistic regression analyses: feeling personally responsible for high quality of work, satisfaction with supervisors, satisfaction with coworkers, satisfaction with opportunities for advancement, work schedule meets personal needs, job demands in conflict with personal life, organizational justice in pay, organizational justice in workload, cross-organizational comparison, job allowing full use of knowledge and skills, and perceived employment opportunity.

On average, the sample had medium levels of satisfaction with supervisors, coworkers, opportunities for advancement, work schedule, fit between work demand and personal life, use of one’s knowledge and skills, and comparative appraisals of own employer with other companies. However, the sample was relatively low on organizational justice in workload, and very low on organizational justice in pay.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511428456">Table 1</xref> further presents subsample characteristics of those who reported resident-centered job satisfaction in responding to the open-ended question and those who did not. Although the two subsamples were similar in general, there were also significant differences between them, on the basis of <italic>t</italic> tests or χ<sup>2</sup> tests. Compared with those who did not report resident-centered job satisfaction as the most satisfying, those who did report were more likely to be female, White, married or living with a partner, or to have applied for a job in a different field. They were less likely to be CNAs, to be satisfied with opportunities for advancement, to have a sense of organizational justice in workload, or to have favorable cross-organizational comparisons.</p>
<p>The study further sheds light on turnover intent, on the basis of responses to the three independent questions as shown in the “Methods” section on dependent variables. While 42.7% of the sample reported having thought seriously about quitting, 30% indicated having actively looked for a job, 10.1% reported having applied for jobs with other companies in LTC only, 10.4% reported having applied for jobs in different fields only, 5.8% reported having applied in both LTC and non-LTC fields, and a total of 26.6% indicated having applied for jobs in any field. In sum, more than half (52.4%) manifested overall turnover intent.</p>

<title>Effects of Resident-Centered Job Satisfaction on Turnover Intent</title>
<p>To understand the one-on-one relationships between resident-centered job satisfaction and each stage or type of turnover intent, χ<sup>2</sup> tests were conducted (not shown). High resident-centered job satisfaction was significant for applying for a job in a different field (<italic>p</italic> = .015). However, counterintuitively, although 10% of those with low or no resident-centered job satisfaction had applied for jobs in fields other than LTC, a much higher percentage (22%) of those with high resident-centered job satisfaction had done so. Resident-centered job satisfaction was not significant for all the other five stages or types of turnover intent.</p>
<p>Results from logistic regression analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027511428456">Table 3</xref>) show that, controlling for all other variables, resident-centered job satisfaction did not predict either positively or negatively (a) having thought seriously about quitting (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, confidence interval [CI] = 0.55 to 1.99), (b) having actively looked for another job (OR = 0.72, CI = 0.37 to 1.38), (c) having applied for a job in a different field (OR = 2.38, CI = 0.76 to 7.46), (d) having applied for a job in any field (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.43 to 1.52), and (e) overall turnover intent (OR = 0.84, CI = 0.46 to 1.54). However, resident-centered intrinsic job satisfaction was negatively associated with the likelihood of having applied for a job with another company in LTC (OR = 0.35, CI = 0.16 to 0.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In other words, DCWs’ resident-centered intrinsic job satisfaction had no effects on turnover intentions, except that DCWs who reported having high resident-centered job satisfaction were less likely to apply for another job in LTC.</p>

<p>A comparison between the qualitative and quantitative data on turnover intent further reveals an interesting finding.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, DCWs’ retention not only is more cost effective from the human resource management viewpoint but also enhances care quality and resident satisfaction. One of the major factors contributing to worker retention is job satisfaction. This study examines whether and how a specific type of job satisfaction, resident-centered job satisfaction, influences turnover intent among DCWs in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p>Unlike employees in many other work settings, DCWs in LTC have the opportunity to form emotional bonds with their clients through daily and long-term interaction. Previous studies have suggested that resident-centered job satisfaction has positive effects on retaining DCWs in LTC settings. The qualitative portion of the study, using content analysis, discovered that resident-centered job satisfaction was indeed the most prominent aspect of job satisfaction among the 722 DCWs.</p>
<p>Whereas previous key studies were based on qualitative or descriptive research methods, the present study includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses. First, results from the qualitative portion (content analysis) of the study were used to construct a quantitative variable on resident-centered job satisfaction. Furthermore, χ<sup>2</sup> tests and logistic regression analyses were applied, with the latter controlling for other important variables identified in theories and empirical findings.</p>
<p>The quantitative portion of the study tells a story quite different from findings in previous key studies. Results from the χ<sup>2</sup> tests show that resident- centered job satisfaction is significant only for applying for a job in a non-LTC field and that a larger percentage of individuals with high resident-centered job satisfaction have applied for jobs in non-LTC fields than those without high levels of such satisfaction (22% vs. 10%). Resident-centered job satisfaction, nevertheless, is not significant for all the other five stages or types of turnover intent. Next, accounting for the effects of other variables in the research model, the logistic regression analyses show that resident-centered job satisfaction has a negative effect on applying for another LTC job, and it has no impact on whether one has thought seriously about quitting, actively looked for another job, applied for a job in a different field, or applied for a job in any field. In short, contrary to findings from previous qualitative or descriptive studies, resident-centered job satisfaction does not help retain DCWs on their jobs but deters DCWs from applying for another LTC job and increases the likelihood of DCWs’ applying for non-LTC jobs.</p>
<p>DCWs in LTC typically have heavy workloads, low wages, few benefits, and few opportunities for job advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511428456">Chou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027511428456">Potter, Churilla, &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>). For those who work under those undesirable conditions, what is surprising perhaps is not the high turnover but the fact that they are willing to stay. A recent national study shows that the direct care workforce is highly vulnerable: More than 90% are women, less likely to be married than the average worker, more likely to be members of minority groups, and more likely to be recent immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027511428456">Potter et al., 2006</xref>). Although such high vulnerability and few employment alternatives may have forced some DCWs to put up with undesirable work conditions, there are also other possible explanations, such as those focusing on intrinsic motivations, notably “psychic income” and “prisoner of love.” Findings from the present study further shed light on these conceptual frameworks and their assumptions.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027511428456">England and Folbre (2003)</xref>, workers who provide care services are awarded with “psychic income”: the appreciation of the care recipient. “Psychic income” constitutes a compensating differential for their sacrifice in enduring less desirable aspects of their jobs (e.g., low pay, heavy workload) and enables the workers to stay on their jobs. Qualitative analysis in the present study shows that DCWs in assisted living do seem to receive such “psychic income,” as manifested in the perceived recognition and appreciation from the residents. For a handful of DCWs, such “psychic income” does seem to compensate for the undesirable job characteristics and enhanced their retention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511428456">Table 1</xref>, Theme 6).</p>
<p>To quantitatively test the possibility that resident-centered job satisfaction may serve as “psychic income” or compensating benefit for truly committed DCWs who are in jobs with undesirable qualities, interaction terms of resident-centered job satisfaction and four job characteristics found to be significant in logistic regression analyses (i.e., satisfaction with opportunities for advancement, job demands in conflict with personal life, organizational justice in workload, and cross-organizational comparison) were included in additional logistic regression analyses. Results (not shown) indicate that these interaction terms are not significant. In other words, those who had low satisfaction with (a) advancement opportunities, (b) conflict between job demands and personal life, (c) organizational justice in workload, or (d) cross-organizational comparison were not more likely to stay, even if they had high resident-centered job satisfaction. This suggests that the “psychic income” derived from resident-centered job satisfaction has no effects on retention.</p>
<p>The “prisoner of love” framework highlights altruistic motivations for, and intrinsic compensation of, care work (e.g., child care, LTC), which may lead care workers to accept less desirable work conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511428456">England, 2005</xref>). According to the framework of “prisoner of love,” DCWs may become attached to individuals for whom they care in a face-to-face and long-term context. The emotional bonds developed between DCWs and care recipients make it difficult for DCWs to withhold their services to demand higher wages or better work conditions. Consequently, the emotional bonds leave DCWs susceptible to an emotional hostage effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511428456">England, 2005</xref>). The “prisoner of love” framework argues that from the perspective of employers, DCWs’ intrinsic motives of caring allow employers to get away with lower pay for DCWs. This argument may have set the premise for DCW turnover reduction strategies that emphasize specific job candidate characteristics, including compassion and commitment, as exemplified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027511428456">Stryker (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0164027511428456">Wagner (1998)</xref>. Findings from the present study show that, unlike what is predicted by the “prisoner of love” framework, “prison breaks” have been contemplated by some DCWs as manifested in their having serious thoughts about quitting, and “prison breaks” have been initiated as evidenced in those who have actively looked for new jobs or applied for new jobs. Even among the seven DCWs who indicated that the residents were the only reason for them to work there or to stay on the job, two actually had turnover intent, including new job applications.</p>
<p>As shown in the counterintuitive finding reported in the “Results” section, ironically, instead of enhancing commitment to LTC and job retention, high resident-centered job satisfaction actually deters the likelihood of applying for another LTC job and contributes to the likelihood of applying for a non-LTC job. Several factors may be have been involved in such phenomenon. First, although a large portion of DCWs enjoy working with residents and have formed close ties with them, providing emotional care to residents can also be emotionally taxing, as indicated in the concept of “caring labor,” which refers to “jobs requiring emotional caring in personal, enduring and constructive relationships with clients” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511428456">Rakovski &amp; Price-Glynn, 2010</xref>, p. 402). Second, in addition to taking care of the residents’ emotional needs, DCWs still need to perform the required “bed and body work,” and work overload has been an issue in assisted living facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511428456">Chou &amp; Robert, 2008</xref>). Third, the physical and emotional demands and heavy workload coupled with other undesirable job characteristics (e.g., low pay, low benefits, lack of career advancement opportunities) may have caused a sense of organizational injustice among DCWs. Indeed, results from a <italic>t</italic> test (analysis not shown) indicated that workers who experience high resident-centered job satisfaction have lower levels of perceived organizational justice in their workload than those who do not.</p>
<p>In contrast to the insignificance of high resident-centered job satisfaction, the study reveals that significant factors enhancing retention are higher perceived organizational justice in workload, more favorable cross-organization comparisons, higher satisfaction with supervisors, more opportunities for career advancement, lower conflict between job demand and personal life, and part-time work status. Although no previous study has looked into the CNA status on turnover, the present study shows that CNA status actually increases the likelihood of turnover. It is possible that CNAs’ qualifications provide a better prospect for finding another job in LTC.</p>
<p>Finally, this study has implications on LTC policy and human resource management. As mentioned before, recruiting candidates with compassion and commitment has been advocated as a strategy for reducing DCW turnover; however, there is a lack of rigorous evaluations on such a strategy. Findings from this study show that, unlike what has been hoped for in LTC human resource management literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027511428456">Stryker, 1982</xref>; Wagner, 1988), “feeling personally responsible for high quality of work” has no effect on any types or stages of turnover intent. Findings from this study also show that DCWs who are compassionate about their work, as evidenced in their close bonds with the residents and in their high resident-centered job satisfaction, are not immune from thinking about quitting or actually applying for another job. In fact, 44% of them have seriously considered quitting, and 27% have actually applied for other jobs. It is evident that recruiting workers on the basis of certain individual characteristics cannot alone decrease turnover. Attention should also be given to factors whose significance on turnover intent has been shown in this study, such as satisfaction with supervisors, opportunities for advancement, organizational justice in workload, conflict between job demand and personal life, and weekly work hours.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, the variable “resident-centered job satisfaction,” a new concept created by the author for this study, is a dichotomous proxy. The dichotomization of this variable is due to the constraint in creating this quantitative variable from qualitative data, which does not contain adequate information on the degree of satisfaction. Future research should develop and test a more comprehensive Likert-type scale to measure various dimensions in resident-centered job satisfaction (e.g., affection, sense of accomplishment, recognition and appreciation) and degrees of satisfaction in each dimension. A second limitation lies in the constraint due to cross-sectional data, which preclude more rigorous testing on causal relationships. Furthermore, because the study was based on a convenience sample, the generalizability of the findings is uncertain. However, the response rate within facilities was good, and the respondent characteristics were generally similar to other samples of DCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511428456">Chou &amp; Robert, 2008</xref>), and facility proprietary status was also included in analyses.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, this study represents the first quantitative study and the first mixed-methods study examining the role of resident-centered job satisfaction in DCW turnover, indexed by turnover intent. Both the sample size and numbers of facilities are larger than those in previous studies. Grounded in a comprehensive conceptual framework, using a unique data set that contains both qualitative and quantitative data, and applying the methods of content analyses, χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and logistic regression analyses, the study adds important information to the existing literature and has substantive, theoretical, and policy contributions. The new construct of “resident-centered job satisfaction” created in this study further provides a fresh direction in conceptualizing and researching job satisfaction of DCWs in LTC for older adults and its relationship with DCW turnover.</p>

<p>The author further experimented with another coding strategy by using the number of themes emerging from each DCW’s response regarding resident-centered job satisfaction. For example, the variable “resident-centered job satisfaction” was coded 2 if a DCW’s response contained both “a sense of accomplishment” and “recognition and appreciation from residents.” This ordinal variable of resident-centered job satisfaction ranged from 0 (no resident-centered job satisfaction themes mentioned) to 3 (three resident-centered job satisfaction themes mentioned), with a mean of 1.01 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.45). Results from the analyses using the ordinal variable were similar to those using the binary variable of resident-centered job satisfaction, although the originally significant and negative relationship between the binary variable of resident-centered job satisfaction and applying for LTC jobs became obscured (i.e., insignificant).</p></fn>

<p>Assisted living facilities in general are less regulated than nursing homes, and not all DCWs in assisted living facilities are CNAs. The non-CNAs in assisted living facilities are workers who have received some very basic training often offered by the facilities, without formal certification.</p></fn>
