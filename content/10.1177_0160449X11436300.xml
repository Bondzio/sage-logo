<p>On September 22, 1910, sixteen garment workers walked away from their jobs at Hart, Schaffner, and Marx, Chicago’s major garment company, to protest newly imposed work rules and a reduction in their pay rate. Within days their strike grew to two thousand people, and it would swell to over forty thousand before it ended in early 1911. This book tells the story of that strike and one of its leaders, Annie Shapiro.</p>
<p>The Chicago garment workers strike shared many characteristics with earlier textile worker strikes in New York, Cleveland, and Philadelphia, as well as with the “Bread and Roses” strike that would take place in Lawrence, Massachusetts less than two years later. Most workers (and strike leaders) were young, immigrant women from a wide variety of ethnic and language backgrounds; the strike was not initially supported by the local textile union, the United Garment Workers’ Union, instead finding support among the progressive, wealthy women of the Women’s Trade Union League; the strikers were met with violence from the police; and the outcome was mixed, with the strikers being forced into a settlement and many being refused reemployment.</p>
<p>Nicole (12 years old) and I read <italic>Annie Shapiro and the Clothing Workers’ Strike</italic> together, and we both enjoyed it. The book consists of three parts: the story presented as a picture book, a dramatization of the story as reader’s theater, and an author’s note. Reminiscent of another great picture book, <italic>The Bobbin Girl</italic> by Emily Arnold McCully, Marlene Targ Brill uses simple sentences and Jamel Akib’s beautiful illustrations to tell Annie’s story. While the story is written so that it can be read aloud to early elementary school students (first through third grades), Nicole worried that the content would be too complicated for such a young audience. The book does indeed provide a starting point to explore and discuss many complex issues. Some questions that may arise: What were working conditions like in factories in the 1900s? Why did kids have to work instead of going to school? Why were workers treated so badly by their bosses? Why did the union leaders laugh at the young women workers? and Why did the police beat the workers? Teachers will need to be prepared to help a young audience discuss these issues.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the reader’s theater script makes the story more engaging for an older audience. Nicole felt that older students (fourth grade and up) would find the picture book too simplistic, but being able to act it out would make it more challenging and interesting for them. The script, written for five readers, could be used as a way to introduce students to Annie’s story and to workers’ history. Older students could use it as a springboard to delve more deeply into the roles that youth, women, and workers have played in shaping current labor laws. At the same time, they could explore the realities of organizing for social change, namely, that agents of social change are met by resistance in many forms and that social change is not won through a single fight. Alternatively, the play could become the capstone of a study of industrialization and early American history and could be used as a way to present that learning to other students and to parents.</p>
<p>Marlene Targ Brill’s book is a wonderful addition to the growing collection of children’s labor books. Her book broadens the collection both by adding to it the story of Chicago’s garment workers and by introducing reader’s theater as a teaching tool. Perhaps more importantly, the author makes the story come alive by sharing her family’s connection to Annie. In the Author’s Note, it is revealed that Annie, named Hannah Shapiro at birth, was the aunt of the author’s brother’s wife. By sharing this personal connection and describing the research undertaken to learn more about Annie, Marlene Targ Brill helps us all see history as something made by real people, some of whom we actually know.</p>
