<abstract>
<p>The unraveling of the Washington Consensus in Latin America is part of a broader decline of US hegemony in the region and beyond. Four distinct approaches by Latin American analysts from Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Cuba are introduced that examine different aspects of this decline. It is argued that any serious analysis of regional hegemony must include consideration of the interrelationship between economic and military factors; the emergent modalities of exercising hegemony such as free trade agreements; the power structure of the hegemonic state; and the broader context of the global political economy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A lot of water has passed over the dam since the heyday of the ‘Washington Consensus’ (WC). During its short-lived apogee, the WC provided an ideological sacred canopy for restructuring Latin American development in accordance with the interests of US-based transnational capital. The neoliberal prototype instrumental for reaching the ‘consensus’ was initially imposed at gunpoint on Chile during the 1970s under the Pinochet military dictatorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419902">de la Barra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511419902">Klein, 2008</xref>). It would later only gradually emerge as a post-Cold War ‘model’, compatible with representative democracy and packaged in an ideology of its own self-inevitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511419902">de la Barra and Dello Buono, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reasons for the decline of this fundamentalist neoliberal ‘recipe’ for development in Latin America are manifold, including the persistently high levels of accumulated foreign debt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511419902">Cockcroft, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511419902">Frank, 2006</xref>), neoliberalism’s overall inability to generate sufficient aggregate demand under the reorganized conditions of early 21st-century globalized production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511419902">Robinson, 2012</xref>); a generalized loss of legitimacy (Gandásegui Jr, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419902">Wallerstein, 2003</xref>) that resulted in ideological meltdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511419902">Dello Buono, 2011</xref>); and the emerging political agendas of leftist and reform forces that are contesting the nefarious effects of radical neoliberal restructuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419902">Kaltwasser, 2011</xref>). Chilean analyst Ximena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511419902">de la Barra (2010)</xref> argues that the G-20 reacted reluctantly but decisively to the simmering crisis by ‘sacrificing neoliberalism’ in order to rescue capitalism. This meant revisiting the relative priority to be assigned to regulatory aspects of economic stimulus, reinforcing protectionist measures in core countries, abandoning the triumphant neoliberal rhetoric of Margaret Thatcher’s ‘TINA’ (There is no alternative) slogan in favor of a new regulatory doctrine, and creating new ideological twists like blaming the developing world for the global ecological crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511419902">De la Barra, 2010</xref>: 639).</p>
<p>As the world region with the highest level of social inequality, Latin America provides a pivotal area of study regarding the current global crisis and the shifting and highly contested dynamics of globalization in its complex transition to a post-neoliberal order. Not only has Latin America long been considered by Washington as its own backyard but it now seems poised to form an integral part of an emerging US strategy to help salvage its global superpower status. The specific circumstances of the ‘Great Recession’ that set in by late 2007 and the installation of the Obama Administration beginning in 2009 coincided with an equally fluid situation throughout the rest of the Americas, yielding a new round of challenges for US hegemony in the hemisphere.</p>

<title>Military and Economic Expressions of Hegemony</title>
<p>Any serious analysis of regional hegemony must consider the interrelationship of economic and military factors. It was the general capitalist logic of territorial control and economic expansion as infused with a drive for new markets and unbridled access to raw materials that brought the US Marines to the ‘Halls of Montezuma’ in 1847, just as it was the earlier maritime threats posed to its commerce by pirates that brought them to the ‘shores of Tripoli’ in 1805. Just about 200 years after the Marines re-exerted its control over the Barbary Coast shipping lanes, Washington was busily phasing in a far-ranging commercial trade agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico in conjunction with its northern allies in Ottawa while attempting to ram in place an even more ambitious project of economic hegemony (FTAA) for the entire Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>By then, the official strategy for US prosperity in a post-Reagan, post-Thatcher era was touted as a commercial one, since most pirates now stole intellectual property. In northern circles, academic discourses still bathed in neoliberal triumphalism and contemplated the ‘end of history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511419902">Fukuyama, 1992</xref>), the ‘end of geography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419902">Ohmae, 1990</xref>), and the increasing irrelevance of borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511419902">O’Brien, 1992</xref>) as globally integrated commodity chains expanded through a world increasing freed from national borders. But as David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511419902">Fasenfest (2010</xref>: 630) points out, ‘one of the great misconceptions of this [neoliberal] era of globalization is that it is based on the freeing of markets and the end of restrictions – most readily seen in terms of knocking down trade barriers to ensure easy and ready flow of capital across borders’. Systemic expansion remained the name of the game and this was all about subordination, expanding the scope and intensity of the exploitation of labor everywhere that it could be placed in structural reach. As the unending mantra of free trade sounded, state protectionism reigned in the global North while the expropriation of national states from essential decision-making prevailed elsewhere, allowing supranational institutions such as the International Financial Institutions (IFIs), transnational enterprises, and arbitration tribunals outside the reach of national accountability to take their place. The rules of asymmetry were being redrawn by transnational capital whose rights ascended at the expense of human rights and the integrity of eco-systems everywhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, life ‘south of the border’ became ever harsher for the majority of Latin Americans who remained painfully aware that borders did in fact still matter even as their own countries competed to export them northward. Rates of violence of all kinds soared while protest increasingly became criminalized, leading to widespread desperation and in some cases, rebellion. Just as in prior eras, Washington responded with military means and Colombia emerged this time as the epicenter of regional operations. The new language of intervention spoke of narco-states, narco-guerrillas, and narco-terrorists as aerial fumigations and heavily armed paramilitaries took aim at insurgent peasantries throughout the Andes. In short order, a clear pattern of destabilization began to re-emerge across the Americas wherever US interests seemed challenged</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Bolivian President Evo Morales who offered the best synopsis of the view from the South as he addressed the 2007 UN General Assembly on the Environment: ‘Capitalism has twins, the market and war. The market converts life into commodities, it converts land into a commodity. And when capitalists cannot sustain this economic model based on looting, on exploitation, on marginalization, on exclusion and, above all, on the accumulation of capital, they rely on war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511419902">Morales, 2007</xref>). Destabilization efforts against his administration as well as against Hugo Chavez in Venezuela were well under way by that time and just a few years later in 2011, the same accumulated craving for oil sent US forces back into action on the ‘shores of Tripoli’.</p>

<title>Four Nationalities, Four Distinct Approaches</title>
<p>During the period of acute economic downturn that inaugurated his administration in 2009, many saw in Barak Obama the possibility of substantial change in both policy and US attitude towards the rest of the world. In the heat of the campaign trail, candidate Obama argued that the NAFTA agreement had to be renegotiated, that Colombia was a major human rights violator, and that there was a need to reformulate US policy towards Cuba. In the article by Silvina Romano, a very different picture of President Obama emerges. Romano, an Argentine analyst, employs a power structure approach that draws out the essential continuities between the Obama Administration and its predecessors. In so doing, she reveals the strains between ‘democracy-building discourses’ and the geopolitical realities of hegemony maintenance. Using official US policy documents, her study details how an evolving discourse shifts up through the latest phase of counter-terrorism as Washington attempts to package its policies designed to exert domination over its ‘backyard’.</p>
<p>Following a line of reasoning pioneered by critical sociologists like C. Wright Mills, Romano demonstrates that the military industrial complex is alive and well in the United States. She puts the spotlight squarely on security apparatus figures that permeate the Obama administration, highlighting shared personnel that provide a clear mirror image of the preceding presidential administrations. Among other insights, Romano’s study provides a useful backdrop to demystifying any notion still harbored by some progressives about some sort of political shift to ‘soft-power’ relationships in the Obama era.</p>
<p>The Washington Consensus represented a strategic push within the post-Cold War global realignment, aimed at consolidating its access to cheap natural resources and raw materials from the region, with increasing emphasis on energy. To do this, it required new institutional mechanisms to capitalize upon its relative superiority over technology and information. The article by Dario Salinas focuses on the evolution of the free trade agreement as a policy modality and explores it in all of its regional, sub-regional, and bilateral forms. Many analysts argued that the Bush administration manifested a certain disinterest in the region in favor of military and economic adventures elsewhere. Salinas, a Chilean analyst based in Mexico, demonstrates that strategic access to key raw materials re-emerged as top priority for Washington, regardless of the relatively small percentage share of commerce that Latin America represents for the United States. He suggests that the Obama administration’s quest to develop ‘new strategies’ for restoring an otherwise decaying and overspent US hegemony effectively helped rekindle a post-Cold War emphasis on consolidating its sphere of regional influence.</p>
<p>Salinas thus seeks to penetrate deeper into the structured nature of asymmetrical relations that have materialized between the global North and South. This research objective is a high priority for Latin American thinkers and is being vigorously approached from many different angles. In the article by the Cuban analyst Luis Suárez, the nature of US hegemony over the region is posited as an imperial project that he terms the ‘new Pan-American order’. Used critically, this terminology reflects a tradition dating back to the visionary thought of José Martí in recognizing the US projection towards the hemisphere as putative imperial design. Suárez methodically sets out to consider the future possibilities for change in the region over the short term. His article analyses the ‘surge’ that Washington spearheaded to extend the reign of neoliberal rule as well as the multi-tiered resistances offered by revolutionary and reformist governments.</p>
<p>As his work shows, the sheer number of maneuvers engineered by the Obama administration is impressive and demonstrates the unwavering US quest for deepening control over its ‘backyard’ under the guise of ‘national security’ concerns. Suárez argues that Obama’s domestic economic ‘fix’ of pseudo-Keynesian policies not only failed to quell his domestic opponents, but likewise proved unable to stem the building resentment against the economic and ecological disasters of underdevelopment resulting from the unrestrained practices of transnational capital in the region. By including the Caribbean in his analysis, Suárez points to the important new solidarities and counter-hegemonic dynamics that have emerged out of alternative regional integration frameworks spearheaded by the revolutionary states of Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>The work of Suárez complements an article published a few years earlier in Critical Sociology by Panamanian analyst Marco Gandásegui, Jr, in which he wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While the Latin American Revolution suffered a setback in the ﬁnal years of the Twentieth Century, we must remain aware that imperialism also suffered profound transformations and this should be the object of more serious analysis. The decades of populism (1950–1980) followed by the neoliberal reaction towards the end of the Twentieth Century have transformed all contending social actors in a qualitative manner. There can be little doubt that revolutionary forces in the region are now regrouping for new battles. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511419902">Gandásegui, 2006</xref>: 49).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But Suárez also argues that new found resistance offered by reform-oriented governments, such as Argentina and Brazil, have helped push back the neoliberal surge, putting further stress on the cracking pillars of the hegemonic order. There is certainly considerable debate surrounding the importance of reform states such as Argentina and Brazil which have projected the possibility of a ‘Third Way’ through shared positions, such as those expressed by the ‘Consensus of Buenos Aires’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511419902">Cockcroft, 2006</xref>: 80).</p>
<p>One major question is whether the leftist and popular-reformist upsurge represents the transition to a post-neoliberal era (the optimistic version) or a trend that ends with the cooptation of progressive regimes by a ‘kinder, gentler’ neoliberalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511419902">MacDonald and Ruckert, 2009</xref>). Suárez suggests that reformist and revolutionary regimes can together constitute multiple sites of resistance to US hegemony through regional integration entities like the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and alternative, anti-imperialist regional cooperation projects like the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). Assuming this is true, it remains to be seen if, as another Cuban analyst José <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511419902">Bell Lara (2009)</xref> argues, such resistances can reduce imperialism’s room for maneuver and create more favorable conditions for the creation of a post-capitalist order.</p>
<p>What is certainly true is that the global capitalist context places structural constraints on developed and developing countries alike. Even if the basic contradictions that prevail in this context cannot be definitively overcome, logic suggests and historical evidence reaffirms that the hegemonic scheme can be prolonged under certain conditions. Chilean analyst Victor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419902">Figueroa (2010)</xref> recently explained in an earlier volume of this journal that any such prolongation of hegemony in the new context would require some real redistribution of income to mollify the existing extreme state of social inequality. This entails the negotiation of some sort of a North–South ‘new deal’, which in turn presupposes a significant redefinition of the present power relations among ruling elites across the North–South nexus where growing social discontent threatens neoliberal rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419902">Figueroa, 2010</xref>: 687).</p>
<p>This formulation spins the crisis of US hegemony over the Americas back to some very basic questions of global political economy. It is precisely against this backdrop that the article in the present volume by Mexican sociologist Adrián Sotelo frames the slipping global position of the US against the broader contradictions of the world capitalist system. His analysis, posited in terms of the global accumulation crisis, proceeds to blow the lid off of reductionist explanations that focus on ‘real estate’ meltdowns, financial bubbles, and other partial statements of the larger global phenomenon. His systemic, structural analysis reveals that capitalism is finding it increasingly more difficult to produce new surplus. In this context, the need to resort to war (Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, etc.) displays both a military Keynesian dynamic and an imperial exigency for securing primary commodity inflows. Highlighting a growing prominence of ‘fictitious capital’ in the neoliberal phase, Sotelo shows how the inability to resolve the underlying contradiction in the productive sphere sets the stage for a building crisis throughout the current world superpowers as they lock into a struggle to extract the maximum relative benefits of global hegemony.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The decline of the Washington Consensus in Latin America is one aspect of a broader crisis of US hegemony during a period of global economic repositioning. Marking little change from preceding administrations, the Obama administration has placed a continuing emphasis on the hegemonic instruments of ‘free trade’ while continuing to project US military presence in the region. Taken together, the analyses developed in this volume by Romano, Salinas, Suárez, and Sotelo offer considerable insight into the crisis of US hegemony in the Western hemisphere. The availability of their work in English will help further expand the regional debate and encourage greater exploration of the crisis through the uniquely Latin American lens provided by these four distinguished critical thinkers.</p>
