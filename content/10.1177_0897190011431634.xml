<p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare prescriber monitoring for safety and efficacy of medication classes used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with BPH who were prescribed medications within a family medicine clinic between January 2008 and August 2010. Patients were divided into those receiving nonselective and uroselective alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), and combination therapy. A chart review was performed with regard to predetermined criteria to monitor how efficacy and adverse effects were assessed by providers in the clinic. Results: A general genitourinary assessment was documented most frequently for patients receiving 5-ARIs and least frequently in patients receiving nonselective alpha-blockers. A digital rectal examination was documented in 11% of patients. Prostate-specific antigen concentrations were assessed evenly across all medication classes and documented in 47% of eligible patients.  However, the American Urological Association Symptom Index and quality-of-life questions were not performed on any patients, and assessments of adverse effects were not documented. Conclusion:  Although prescribers in a family medicine clinic recorded a general genitourinary assessment for patients receiving BPH medications, a more standardized approach is needed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or enlargement of the prostate gland, is common in men and almost universally associated with aging. Enlargement in the periurethral prostate typically begins around age 45. However, symptoms usually do not present until approximately 20 years later. Over time, as the compression progresses, patients present with symptoms of urinary flow obstruction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>About half of men over age 75 have some symptoms of BPH. Mechanical obstruction can lead to difficulty initiating urination, hesitancy, a weak urinary stream, and a sensation of incomplete emptying despite a full bladder.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> Over time more irritative symptoms can develop, including frequency, urgency, and nocturia. If left untreated, complications can arise such as hematuria, frequent urinary tract infections, and urinary retention. One main problem with BPH is that other disease states share similar symptoms, including prostatitis and prostate cancer. Thus, BPH requires a rule out diagnosis prior to treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431634">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pharmacological treatment of BPH may be approached via 2 different mechanisms, addressing either prostate volume or smooth muscle tone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431634">2</xref>
</sup> A static or volume component may be targeted using 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (ARIs), which include finasteride and dutasteride. The 5-ARIs inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and improve symptoms over 4 to 5 months by reducing the prostrate stromal cell number and density. Alpha-adrenergic blockers treat the dynamic component caused by increased urethral smooth muscle tone. Uroselective alpha-blockers (tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin) relieve BPH symptoms via the dynamic approach.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> However, nonselective alpha-adrenergic blockers terazosin and doxazosin also are indicated for BPH by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011431634">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011431634">4</xref>
</sup> All alpha-adrenergic blockers FDA indicated for treatment of BPH are approximately twice as effective as placebo for decreasing lower urinary tract symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> Also, BPH medications require monitoring.  While 5-ARIs and uroselective alpha-blockers may cause sexual dysfunction, nonselective alpha-blockers may cause orthostasis, hypotension, and dizziness.  Additionally, nonselective alpha-blockers must be titrated to achieve efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Health care providers in family medicine settings are becoming more proactive in managing BPH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011431634">7</xref>
</sup> A study that observed prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms was conducted in 6 primary care clinics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>
</sup> It showed that 42% of men over age 50 had moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms and 48% had an enlarged prostate based on digital rectal examination (DRE). However, only 33% of patients with moderate-to-severe BPH intended to discuss their symptoms with the primary care practitioner (PCP). Furthermore, 70% of these men reported never having taken an alpha-adrenergic blocker or 5-ARI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>
</sup> This study suggests that health care providers that are more diligent and proactive with proper medication management and assessment could have a greater impact on BPH.</p>
<p>Despite the high incidence of BPH symptoms as men age, there is little mortality in comparison to other disease states treated by PCPs. Instead of being referred to urologists, PCPs now are assuming a larger role in the care of these patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634">6</xref>
</sup> Also, the goal of BPH management is to alleviate symptoms and avoid complications that could result from inadequate treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> Moreover, patients may be reluctant to discuss BPH symptoms with their PCPs because it is a “quality-of-life” issue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Evidence also exists that PCPs may not be taking advantage of clinical practice guidelines for BPH treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634">6</xref>
</sup> In one survey, two thirds of PCPs reported rarely or never using the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634">6</xref>
</sup> However, nearly all reported routinely performing DRE. More than 90% of PCPs reported ordering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations, while infrequently using other tests. In contrast, 63% of urologists routinely used the AUASI for medication management.  Also, 40% and 39% of urologists routinely performed uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume ultrasounds in comparison to 1% and 3% of primary care physicians performing these tests, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634">6</xref>
</sup> Initial treatment was similar between PCPs and urologists, with alpha-blocker therapy being used before 5-ARI therapy. To date, an observation of BPH treatment patterns across all drug therapy in primary care has not been published.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare physician monitoring for efficacy and safety of different medication classes for BPH in the family medicine setting, specifically observing differences between nonselective alpha-blockers, uroselective alpha-blockers, 5-ARIs, and dual therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190011431634">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a retrospective chart-review study including patients with a diagnosis of BPH within a family medicine clinic associated with a university-based health care center between January 2008 and August 2010. The study received approval from the Institutional Review Board. From electronic health records, 132 patients who had received a prescription for a BPH medication within the study period were identified. All patients included had a confirmed <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) diagnosis code for BPH. Patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, PSA &gt;10 ng/mL, prostatitis, or frequent urinary tract infections (defined as at least 2 within a 1-year period) were excluded.</p>
<p>Patients were divided into those receiving the following: nonselective alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, or off-label prazosin), uroselective alpha-blockers (alfuzosin, tamsulosin, or silodosin), 5-ARIs (finasteride or dutasteride), or combination therapy with alpha-blockers and 5-ARIs. Demographic data included age, race, number of years since beginning BPH treatment, number of years since diagnosis, medications used since beginning treatment, medications that may exacerbate symptoms, and prescribers of BPH medications. Monitoring of adverse events, including hypotension, orthostasis, and sexual dysfunction, was also assessed.</p>
<p>Medical records were reviewed with regard to the following efficacy assessments for BPH medications: AUASI, quality-of-life questions, PSA, DRE, and BPH Impact Index. Also, medical records were monitored for absence or presence of a general genitourinary assessment.</p>
<p>The AUASI is a set of 7 questions that objectively assess the severity of obstructive and irritative symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> Each question ranges from 0 to 5, allowing for an overall range from 0 to 35 to denote BPH severity (mild ≤7, moderate 8-19, and severe 20-35). The BPH Impact Index is a general questionnaire containing 4 questions that denote an overall severity ranging from 0 to 13.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> The quality-of-life question assesses the overall impact of BPH symptoms on a scale from 0 to 6.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> Finally, the presence of a general genitourinary assessment was included if the physician noted in the physical examination whether the patient had urinary complaints.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were used to compare all groups using an analysis of variance for interval data and chi-square analysis for nominal data, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 indicating significance. Demographic data were compared with descriptive statistics.</p>

<p>Of the 76 patients, 21 were on nonselective alpha-blockers only, 39 were on uroselective alpha-blockers only, 6 were on 5-ARIs only, and 10 were on combination therapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011431634">Table 2</xref>). The average daily doses of nonselective alpha-blockers included 3.7 (±3.1) mg and 3.5 (±2.5) mg for terazosin and doxazosin, respectively.  All other patients were taking standard daily doses (ie, 0.4 mg for tamsulosin, 10 mg for alfuzosin, 0.5 mg for dutasteride, and 5 mg for finasteride). No patients were taking silodosin or off-label prazosin for BPH. Only 1 person was documented as taking saw palmetto, and the dose could not be confirmed. There was no evidence that the nonselective alpha-blockers were titrated for efficacy during the study period. No correlation existed between specific prescribers (24 physicians and 1 nurse practitioner) and assessment of efficacy or symptoms or type of medication prescribed.</p>

<p>Symptoms were not documented as being assessed for any patient using an AUASI, a quality-of-life question, or the BPH Impact Index. However, symptoms were monitored with a general genitourinary assessment for 43% of patients. Urinary symptoms were assessed most frequently for patients receiving 5-ARIs and least frequently in patients receiving nonselective alpha-blockers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011431634">Table 2</xref>). Only 11% of eligible patients were documented as receiving a DRE at the family medicine clinic or had one noted, while a PSA concentration was recorded in 47% of eligible patients.  The PSA concentrations among the groups were not significantly different, and the average PSA concentration for all patients was 1.7 ng/mL (±1.6 ng/mL). Of all the patients who received a general genitourinary assessment, 4 patients had a documented referral to a urologist (3 patients on 5-ARIs and 1 patient on combination therapy).</p>
<p>Of the total patients, 38% were receiving concomitant medications that could worsen their urinary symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011431634">Table 2</xref>).  Medications identified that could exacerbate BPH symptoms included diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, and other anticholinergic medications. Of interest, 50% of patients on combination therapy were receiving concomitant medications that could exacerbate urinary symptoms. Also, 30% of patients on nonselective alpha-blockers who had a diagnosis of hypertension were being treated with no additional antihypertensive medications.</p>
<p>Regarding an assessment of potential adverse effects of BPH medications, no blood pressure effects were noted in correlation with the medications. Neither orthostasis nor dizziness was assessed as being present or absent after BPH medications were started. Ten patients were recorded as having a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, but only 1 patient was noted as developing erectile dysfunction after beginning BPH medication. There was no record of discontinuing the medication after the adverse event was noted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190011431634">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare prescriber monitoring of efficacy and safety for each class of BPH medication, including combination therapy, in the family medicine setting. Prescribers recorded a general genitourinary assessment, noting only a presence or absence of complaints, for 43% of the patients included in the study. However, significantly fewer notations were made for patients on nonselective alpha-blockers in comparison to the other medication classes. Neither terazosin nor doxazosin was titrated up to the maximum recommended doses for treatment of BPH (10 mg and 8 mg for terazosin and doxazosin, respectively).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011431634">8</xref>
</sup> Because fewer general genitourinary assessments were done for patients on nonselective alpha-blockers, it is reasonable to conclude that these medications were not titrated to maximal efficacy. Also, there was no evidence that these medications were titrated to efficacy for hypertension. No assessments for adverse effects were evident regarding orthostasis and dizziness. Both nonselective and uroselective alpha-blockers are equally efficacious when the former medications are appropriately titrated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> However, it is reasonable to conclude that within the short scope of time allotted to patient visits, these providers may not consider genitourinary assessments of nonselective alpha-blockers to ensure efficacy for BPH. This may be a provider education issue.  For example, providers could be educated to assess for efficacy with nonselective alpha-blockers after 2 to 4 weeks of titrating up to reach the maximum recommended doses.</p>
<p>Prescribers were more likely to cover a general genitourinary assessment when patients were receiving a 5-ARI. However, a more standardized approach with the AUASI and quality-of-life question has been recognized as a higher quality assessment for BPH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634">6</xref>
</sup> These tools have been implemented quickly and efficiently to properly assess BPH patients in general practice clinics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011431634">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>
</sup> None of the prescribers were recorded as using these assessment tools in the family medicine clinic, so this was not a finding limited to a particular prescriber.  </p>
<p>A PSA concentration was recorded for approximately half of the patients, and the average concentration was within the normal range. There was no statistical difference among the groups with obtaining either PSA concentrations or average concentrations. However, only 11% of eligible patients had been documented as receiving a DRE.</p>
<p>Although none of these patients had a diagnosis for prostate cancer, screening is still important for this population considering their average age and the presence of BPH. According to the American Urological Association for screening, all men with a life expectancy greater than or equal to 10 years should receive a baseline PSA test at age 40.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011431634">9</xref>
</sup> Also, these guidelines state that both PSA concentrations and a DRE should be obtained.  An elevated PSA concentration and/or abnormal DRE should be used to determine a decision for biopsy to definitively diagnose prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Additionally, use of the DRE is important for initiating and follow-up evaluation of 5-ARIs. Evidence shows that a 5-ARI may not be effective unless the patient has an increased prostate size.<sup>

</sup> Thus, it would be prudent clinically to use the DRE in order to evaluate the efficacy of a 5-ARI. It was interesting that patients documented as receiving a DRE were not on 5-ARIs.</p>
<p>Patients who were on combination therapy were most likely to be prescribed concomitant medications that could exacerbate urinary symptoms. Although an AUASI was not performed for monitoring efficacy, it is reasonable to postulate that these patients may have had symptoms that could have been better controlled by discontinuing potentially exacerbating concomitant medications, when applicable. Also, few documented referrals to the urologist could be found. According to the AUA guidelines, patients with symptoms despite maximum medication therapy should be referred to a urologist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011431634">1</xref>
</sup> Of the 40% of patients receiving combination therapy that a general genitourinary assessment was noted, only 1 patient was referred. </p>
<p>Thirty percent of patients with BPH and concomitant hypertension were prescribed only a nonselective alpha-blocker for both disease states. The Joint National Committee (JNC 7) on Hypertension recommends that when a patient has both hypertension and BPH, a nonselective alpha-blocker should not be used as a single therapy agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011431634">12</xref>
</sup> This recommendation was based on a finding in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011431634">13</xref>
</sup> Patients receiving doxazosin only for hypertension during ALLHAT were discontinued from study participation due to an 80% increased risk of developing heart failure. In that trial, the risk was attenuated with concomitant use of chlorthalidone. Thus, patients with both hypertension and BPH that are receiving a nonselective alpha-blocker should also receive another concomitant antihypertensive agent.</p>
<p> These findings are consistent with other studies in this setting. One study of 444 men presenting to primary care clinics found that 42% over age 50 presented with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011431634">5</xref>
</sup> Of these patients, only a third planned to discuss their symptoms with their provider during the visit. This suggests that one problem with BPH control in this setting could be the failure of patients to mention their symptoms. Another study examining the practice patterns of PCPs for evaluating lower urinary tract symptoms found that two thirds reported rarely or never using the AUASI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011431634">6</xref>
</sup> In contrast, two thirds of the urologists studied routinely used the AUASI for evaluating symptom severity and medication effectiveness.</p>
<p>Other than notation for general genitourinary symptoms, this study suggests that PCPs in this family medicine clinic have not used more precise tools (ie, AUASI) to measure medication efficacy. Also, adverse effects of the medications (ie, hypotension, orthostasis, sexual dysfunction) were not assessed. These issues could be addressed easily through patient and prescriber education, as other intervention programs have been successful in this setting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011431634">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011431634">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It would be interesting to develop a comparison study between BPH patients provided medication therapy management (MTM) through a pharmacist versus standard care. Pharmacists have been shown to have a positive impact on clinical outcomes for a variety of disease states.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011431634">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011431634"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011431634">18</xref>
</sup> However, to the knowledge of the authors there has been no literature to date discussing the role of pharmacists to provide such services for BPH. Maintaining quality of life is the primary outcome for MTM of BPH. Thus, administration of the AUASI, monitoring of adverse effects, selecting the most efficacious medication for each individual, and titration of nonselective alpha-blockers to efficacy are functions that could be performed by pharmacists to manage BPH. Additionally, pharmacists idealistically could provide such services in either clinic or community settings.</p>
<p>There are several limitations in this study, and some are inherent in the database used. Records through the electronic health records (EHR) for these patients have been available for less than 3 years. Also, it should be stated that prescribers could have assessed the patients without documentation in the EHR. It is also unknown as to whether patients have been compliant with all medications, as only so much may be ascertained through prescription fill records through this database. Also, patients may have been taking other medications prescribed outside the clinic or by another provider. They also may have been taking herbal therapy on their own. Finally, only a limited number of patients were referred to urology during this time, but patients could have been referred to a specialist through self-referral or through another PCP.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>No statistically significant difference was shown among the medication classes for BPH regarding provider evaluation of efficacy and adverse effects. Although general genitourinary assessments were used, a more standard approach using an AUASI and quality-of-life questions was not recorded. Adverse events also were not systematically evaluated. Current management of patients with BPH at this family medicine clinic could be optimized through a prescriber and patient educational program or through provision of MTM services.</p>
