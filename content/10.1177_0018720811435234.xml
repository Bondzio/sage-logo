<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The continued prevalence and use of teams in organizations calls for a better understanding of their characteristics and the types of tasks and jobs they perform, and our ability to effectively analyze teams and the tasks they perform would seem to be a crucial step in the accomplishment of this goal. Within this context, one important task or job characteristic is the degree of interdependence that is integral to the definition of teams and team-based tasks and jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720811435234">Van der Vegt, Emans, &amp; Van de Vliert, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811435234">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811435234">Wageman, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance and value of task and job characteristics such as importance, time spent, time to proficiency, and consequences of error and the ability to quantify them—in the context of individual performance—have been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811435234">Arthur, Doverspike, &amp; Barrett, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811435234">Sanchez &amp; Fraser, 1992</xref>). These characteristics are equally applicable to teams as well. However, because teams consist of two or more individuals who work interdependently, have specific role assignments, perform specific tasks, and interact and coordinate to achieve a common goal, an additional task and job characteristic not present with individuals is the nature and degree of interdependence that is required for the successful performance of the task or job. To this end, the task and job analysis literature has been remiss in the limited attention paid to team task and job analysis in general, and team task interdependence in particular.</p>
<p>Consequently, as a constructive replication and extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur, Edwards, Bell, Villado, and Bennett (2005)</xref>, we sought in the present study to further investigate the efficacy of team relatedness and team workflow ratings as metrics of interdependence. This objective was accomplished by using team task analysis interdependence ratings obtained from a sample of F-16 combat fighter pilots to assess the efficacy of these metrics in differentiating between tasks and the relationship of the ratings to team performance.</p>
<sec id="section2-0018720811435234">
<title>Team Task Interdependence</title>
<p>Team task interdependence is recognized as an important variable in many domains of organizational theory and research, including organizational design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811435234">Weick, 1979</xref>), job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811435234">Medsker &amp; Campion, 1997</xref>), team task analysis, team training, and team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811435234">Campion, Medesker, &amp; Higgs, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811435234">Medsker &amp; Campion, 1997</xref>). The extant literature also draws a distinction between task work and teamwork, whereby <italic>teamwork</italic> refers to the team’s efforts to facilitate interaction among team members in the accomplishment of team tasks. In contrast, <italic>task work</italic> refers to the team’s efforts to understand and perform the requirements of the job, tasks, and equipment to be used. Our focus in the present article is on task work.</p>
<p>In the context of team task analysis, team training, and team performance, Arthur and associates have conceptualized task work interdependence (i.e., “teamness”) in terms of (a) the extent to which and (b) the manner in which team members must exchange information and resources (i.e., work together) to successfully complete their tasks and jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811435234">Arthur, Villado, &amp; Bennett, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811435234">Van der Vegt et al., 2000</xref>). Arthur and associates operationalized the former as <italic>team relatedness</italic> and the latter as <italic>team workflow</italic>. Teamness can be conceptualized at the level of tasks (e.g., performing an appendectomy is more team based than is mowing a lawn) or at the level of jobs (e.g., commercial pilot is more team based than commercial truck driver). They also noted that similar to other task characteristics, an analysis of task and job interdependence in terms of these characteristics can be used to design jobs, create selection systems, identify specific types of teams, choose training interventions, understand performance problems, and better measure specific aspects of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811435234">Medsker &amp; Campion, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Needless to say, there have been other efforts at team task analysis. For instance, with a focus on teamwork, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811435234">Bowers, Baker, and Salas (1994)</xref> commented on the need for assessment tools designed to provide information pertaining to the importance of specific coordination behaviors that characterize teams. They subsequently constructed a team task inventory by identifying teamwork behaviors taken from the team performance and aircrew coordination literature and having subject matter experts (SMEs) review and modify the list of behaviors. Respondents were then asked to rate each task (behavior) along six dimensions. These dimensions were importance to train, task criticality, task frequency, task difficulty, difficulty to train, and overall task importance. Using these six dimensions, Bowers et al. calculated five indices of task importance, and the results indicated that (a) criticality and importance to train were the only dimensions that explained variance in overall importance ratings, (b) the five task importance indices showed similarly poor interrater agreement, and (c) composite indices of task importance were more correlated with overall importance ratings than were single indices, such as frequency and criticality. The authors concluded that traditional measurement techniques derived from individuals may not be adequate in assessing team tasks.</p>
<p>As another example, Levine and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720811435234">Levine &amp; Baker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811435234">Levine, Penner, Brannick, Coovert, &amp; Llobet, 1988</xref>) presented a methodology for analyzing team tasks in the context of team training. So, instead of a general or broad approach that allowed the analyst to simply classify a task as team based or not, Levine et al.’s approach focused on the decomposition of team tasks into the elements or components performed by specified team members in the accomplishment of the specified team task. This information would then be used to design and develop training.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that unlike other team task analysis approaches (two of which were briefly reviewed already), which are predicated on the assumption that the analyst is <italic>already cognizant</italic> of the fact that he or she is dealing with a team-based job, the team task analysis approach described and evaluated in the present study is predicated on the assumption that, as in the initial stages of a job analysis endeavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720811435234">Doverspike &amp; Arthur, in press</xref>), all the analyst has is a list of task statements with no information about their team-based or team interdependence status. Thus, the analyst’s first goal is to identify which tasks and task elements are team based. It is after these tasks have been identified as such that systems such as those proposed by Levine and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811435234">Levine et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720811435234">Levine &amp; Baker, 1990</xref>) would be employed to engage in a more detailed analysis of these tasks.</p>

<title>Team Relatedness and Team Workflow</title>
<p>Arthur and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811435234">in press</xref>) present team relatedness and team workflow as two different but related conceptualizations of team interdependence whereby the former refers to the <italic>amount</italic> of team interdependence and the latter to the <italic>type</italic> of interdependence. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (in press)</xref> define team relatedness as “the extent to which successful team performance requires the individual to work with members of the team in order to optimally perform the specified task or the job” (p.18). Although tasks and jobs are often referred to as “interdependent” if they require input from multiple individuals for completion, task interdependence is a continuous, not a dichotomous, variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811435234">Wageman, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720811435234">2001</xref>). Thus, team relatedness represents the <italic>amount</italic> or <italic>magnitude</italic> of team interdependence.</p>
<p>Team workflow on the other hand, represents the <italic>kind</italic> or the <italic>type</italic> of interdependence. As multiple individuals contribute resources to an interdependent task, an exchange of resources between team members is required if the task is to be completed successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811435234">Doerr, Mitchell, Schriesheim, Freed, &amp; Zhou, 2002</xref>). Consequently, task interdependence is best conceptualized and operationalized not only in terms of the amount or magnitude of task interdependence (i.e., team relatedness) but also in terms of the manner in which resources move between members of a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811435234">Van der Vegt et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, this facet of team task interdependence is described as team workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811435234">Tesluk, Mathieu, Zaccaro, &amp; Marks, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720811435234">Thompson, 1967</xref>) and is defined as “the way that work and/or information between team members flows for the optimal performance of specified tasks or the job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., in press</xref>, p. 18). It therefore represents the type, kind, or form of task interdependence and is operationalized in terms of five levels, (a) not a team task or job, (b) pooled or additive interdependence, (c) sequential interdependence, (d) reciprocal interdependence, and (e) intensive interdependence, with each subsequent level representing hierarchically more complex and intensive levels of interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811435234">Tesluk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720811435234">Thompson, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>Arthur and associates have provided initial support for the efficacy, viability, reliability, and criterion-related validity of using team relatedness and workflow as metrics of interdependence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>, in press). They have also shown that although related, their moderate intercorrelations are supportive of the proposition that team relatedness and team workflow ratings represent different facets of team task interdependence—specifically, amount and kind. However, as in traditional job analysis, in which if warranted, different task characteristics (e.g., importance and time spent) have been aggregated into a composite, we sought in the present study to also assess the utility and informational value of a team relatedness and team workflow composite, operationalized as the mean of these two ratings.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study assessed the efficacy of team relatedness and team workflow as conceptualizations of team task interdependence. Specifically, we investigated (a) the extent to which ratings of these metrics could differentiate between tasks within the same job using a sample of F-16 fighter pilots in four-ship air-to-air combat flight training and (b) the relationship between these ratings and team (training) performance. We consider the present study to be a constructive replication and extension of previous research (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>) showing that team relatedness and team workflow ratings effectively differentiated between tasks predetermined to be individual versus team based and that these ratings predicted team performance. However, because the previous study involved a relatively small sample of college students who performed and rated tasks for a computer-based tank combat simulator, it was deemed important to replicate these findings in an operational field setting.</p>
<p>To this end, 140 F-16 fighter pilots in 35 four-person teams participating in a four-ship air-to-air combat flight training program rated 34 four-ship flight formation-related tasks and activities on their team relatedness and team workflow. Consonant with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref>, to obtain “true” scores that would permit an assessment of the accuracy of the pilots’ ratings, the tasks were also rated by nine F-16 instructor pilots (i.e., trainers) on their level of interdependence. Consequently, the present study had much higher levels of ecological validity since the only measure that was introduced into the operational training environment was the team task analysis measure; and in addition, the “true” scores were determined not by the researchers (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al., 2005</xref>) but instead by the instructor pilots who taught and led the training program.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study sample consisted of 140 F-16 fighter pilots in 35 four-person teams who completed a team task analysis questionnaire as part of a 5-day four-ship air-to-air competency-based training program. Of the pilots, two (1.43%) were women; six pilots (4.29%) did not report their gender. When the data were collected, the pilots had logged an average of 1,060.15 flight hours (<italic>SD</italic> = 810.63) in the F-16 and 1,597.86 total flight hours (<italic>SD</italic> = 1,406.87). The average age of the pilots was 32.45 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.86), but 10 pilots did not report their age.</p>

<title>Team task analysis questionnaire</title>
<p>As previously noted, the team relatedness and team workflow data were obtained as part of a 5-day four-ship air-to-air competency-based training program. We obtained both decomposed and holistic team task analysis ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720811435234">Butler &amp; Harvey, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811435234">Cornelius &amp; Lyness, 1980</xref>). For the decomposed ratings, we used 34 task and activity statements (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720811435234">Appendixes A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0018720811435234">B</xref>) that were derived from the air-to-air flight competency-based operational training syllabus. Pilots were asked to rate each of these statements in terms of their team relatedness (“the extent to which working with members of the team is required for the optimal performance of your individual specified tasks for successful four-ship air-to-air combat with a controller”) and team workflow (“the paths by which work and/or information flows through the team in order to optimally perform your individual specified tasks for successful four-ship air-to-air combat with a controller”).</p>
<p>Team relatedness was rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not required at all for optimal performance</italic>; 5 = <italic>very much required for optimal performance</italic>). For team workflow, the pilots indicated which of five workflow patterns (i.e., not a team task or activity, pooled or additive, sequential, reciprocal, or intensive interdependence) best characterized the way that work and/or information between team members flowed for the optimal performance of each task or activity. (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018720811435234">Appendix C</xref> for an illustrative example of the team relatedness and team workflow rating scales.) To compute the composite, we averaged the team relatedness and team workflow ratings for each task.</p>
<p>Holistic ratings were at the level of the job (i.e., “overall job as an F-16 combat pilot”). Thus, the pilots also provided team relatedness and team workflow ratings at the level of the job (i.e., one job-level item for team relatedness and one job-level item for team workflow). Consequently, as a result of counterbalancing for order effects for the decomposed and holistic ratings crossed with team relatedness and team workflow, four versions of the team task analysis questionnaire were administered across teams.</p>

<title>Using F-16 instructor pilot ratings to assess accuracy</title>
<p>Consonant with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref>, there was an interest in assessing the accuracy of the pilots’ ratings; consequently, we used nine F-16 instructor pilots to obtain “true” score ratings. The instructor pilots had logged an average of 2,494.44 flight hours (<italic>SD</italic> = 638.57) in the F-16 and had an average of 20.00 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.18) of service in the Air Force. Furthermore, seven of the instructor pilots were lieutenant colonels, two were majors, and all of them are rated as instructor pilots or higher.</p>
<p>Although SME ratings are often used as “true” score estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720811435234">Borman, 1977</xref>), this approach has some conceptual and methodological limitations. For instance, said true scores are in actuality judgments, albeit the judgments of experts. In addition, the impact of initial SME disagreement on the resultant true score estimates is unclear, and there is no agreed-on standard for interpreting intraclass correlation (ICC) values when estimating true scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811435234">Sulsky &amp; Balzer, 1988</xref>). In spite of these concerns, SME true scores continue to be widely used in both research and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811435234">Day, Arthur, &amp; Gettman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720811435234">Gorman &amp; Rentsch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720811435234">Woehr, 1994</xref>) because the threats to the veracity of true scores can be mitigated. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811435234">Sulsky and Balzer (1988)</xref> recommend that SME ratings must (a) generalize across measurement conditions, (b) display convergent and discriminant validity evidence, and (c) be properly calibrated (e.g., via frame-of-reference training). Furthermore, in the present study, the expertise of the instructor pilots was very high, and because we did not use a consensus approach, the initial level of agreement in the instructor pilots’ ratings is reflected in the reported ICC values.</p>
<p>The nine instructor pilots independently rated each task and activity statement in terms of team relatedness and team workflow. The instructor pilots’ ratings displayed high levels of interrater reliability (ICC2 = .90 and .91 for team relatedness and team workflow, respectively). To further support the use of all nine instructor pilot ratings, we ran exploratory factor analyses on their team relatedness and team workflow ratings using parallel analyses as the primary factor retention rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811435234">Hayton, Allen, &amp; Scarpello, 2004</xref>). Specifically, we generated random (uncorrelated) data with the same dimensions as the instructor pilots’ ratings (nine variables and 34 observations), submitted these data to an exploratory factor analysis, and recorded the resulting eigenvalues. This process was repeated 50 times, and the mean eigenvalues were then compared with the eigenvalues for the instructor pilots’ ratings. The results indicated that only the first eigenvalue was greater than those generated by uncorrelated random data for both analyses, suggesting one factor should be retained. This result supported the use of the mean of all nine instructor pilots’ ratings for each task and activity statement as the true scores.</p>
<p>On the basis of the instructor pilots’ ratings, we categorized the tasks into three groups, namely, highly interdependent, moderately interdependent, and minimally interdependent (or independent) tasks. In developing the classification structure, we considered the use of three approaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref> distinguished between individual- and team-based tasks (i.e., two-group classification). We decided not to use this approach for a variety of reasons. For instance, unlike Arthur et al., the instructor pilots provided task ratings rather than simply sorting the tasks into two groups. Consequently, collapsing the ratings into two groups would entail grouping all tasks with a true score rating greater than 1 into one category (i.e., team-based tasks). However, this method would have resulted in substantial information loss since a task with a true score rating of 2 would have been treated as the same as a task with a true score rating of 5. So, given the differences in our true score data and theirs, using Arthur et al.’s scheme would have resulted in too coarse a categorization scheme.</p>
<p>Another potential approach was to categorize the tasks on the basis of the five response categories. However, this approach resulted in an uneven distribution of tasks. For instance, only one and three tasks were rated as true individual tasks for team relatedness and team workflow, respectively. The use of this approach would have resulted in unreliable scale scores. Thus, the approach used was considered a compromise between the two- and five-category approaches. This approach allowed us to retain critical information without threatening the psychometric properties of the scale scores. Specifically, this approach entailed the creation of three categories such that tasks with true scores of a 4 or 5 (by standard rounding rules) were classified as highly interdependent tasks, tasks with true scores of a 3 were classified as moderately interdependent tasks, and those with true scores of 1 or 2 were considered to be independent or minimally interdependent tasks.</p>

<title>Team performance</title>
<p>Team performance was operationalized in terms of the teams’ performance during the 5-day four-ship air-to-air combat flight-training program. This training was conducted on four networked high-fidelity F-16 simulators in which the pilots completed six combat missions as part of the training program. Specifically, four F-16 pilots completed three four-ship air-to-air benchmark scenarios on their 1st and 5th day (total of six scenarios) of training in which their primary objective was to prevent two enemy Strikers (ground attack aircraft) from reaching the home base. Their secondary objective was to destroy six enemy air attack fighter aircraft and two enemy Strikers (i.e., all enemy aircraft). A scenario ended when (a) all F-16s were destroyed, (b) all enemy aircraft were destroyed, (c) enemy strikers reached base, or (d) a 13-min time limit was reached.</p>
<p>Participants’ team scores were a function of the number of fratricides, number of enemy fighter aircraft destroyed, number of Strikers destroyed, number of F-16 destroyed by the enemy, and whether the Strikers reached base or not (i.e., dichotomously scored). Each of these performance metrics was aggregated to form a composite for each scenario trial, which ranged from 0 to 1,800. Because of the pilots’ proficiency levels and probably as a result of training on earlier trials, there was limited variability on the latter training trials (e.g., 54% of the teams obtained a perfect score on the third trial). Consequently, we used the mean composite score for only Trials 1 and 2 on Day 1 as our measure of performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720811435234">
<title>Design and procedure</title>
<p>The team task analysis and team performance data were collected as part of a larger project that entailed a 5-day four-ship competency-based Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training program conducted at the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Human Effectiveness Directorate. Specifically, the pilots completed three performance benchmark trials on Day 1, received training using a competency-based air-to-air syllabus on Days 2 through 4, and completed three additional benchmarks on Day 5. Pilots completed the team task analysis questionnaire on Day 1. Demographic data (i.e., gender, age, and flight hours) were gathered from self-report demographic forms.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref>, there was a moderate relationship between the team relatedness and team workflow ratings (mean <italic>r</italic> = .44, <italic>SD</italic> = .06, min = .33, max = .54). Specifically, Arthur et al. reported a mean correlation of .25 (<italic>SD</italic> = .15, min = .11, max = .64). Although not small, these correlations are in an order of magnitude that is lower than what one would typically expect if team relatedness and team workflow were alternate forms or measures of the same construct (i.e., estimates of alternate or equivalent form reliability). Hence, these correlations are more consistent with the explanation that posits that each metric provides unique interdependence information and, thus, represents a different facet of interdependence—specifically, the extent or the degree of interdependence (i.e., team relatedness) and the form or type of interdependence (i.e., team workflow).</p>
<p>To permit a more streamlined presentation, the description of the results focuses more, but not exclusively, on the composite, which was operationalized as the mean of the team relatedness and team workflow. However, for the sake of completeness, the team relatedness and team workflow results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720811435234">Appendixes A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0018720811435234">B</xref>, respectively, and it is worth noting that the pattern of results was similar, resulting in the same conclusions. Consonant with this finding, as would be expected, the relationship between the composite and team relatedness (mean <italic>r</italic> = .84, <italic>SD</italic> = .02, min = .79, max = .88) and between the composite and team workflow (mean <italic>r</italic> = .85, <italic>SD</italic> = .02, min = .08, max = .88) were larger in magnitude compared with the relationship between team relatedness and team workflow.</p>
<p>To assess the extent to which the composite ratings (i.e., the average of team relatedness and team workflow) differentiated between tasks, we computed the mean rating for each task statement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811435234">Table 1</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811435234">Table 2</xref> presents the descriptive statistics for the tasks identified as highly, moderately, and minimally interdependent (or independent). (For team-level ratings, only teams where all four team members provided ratings were retained in the data set.) For the composite, highly interdependent tasks were rated higher than were moderately interdependent tasks, <italic>t</italic>(34) = 20.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 2.41, which were in turn rated higher than minimally interdependent and independent tasks, <italic>t</italic>(34) = 23.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 1.53. For team relatedness, highly interdependent tasks were rated higher than moderately interdependent tasks, <italic>t</italic>(34) = 20.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 3.37, which were in turn rated higher than minimally interdependent and independent tasks, <italic>t</italic>(34) = 16.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 2.39. Likewise, for team workflow, highly interdependent tasks were rated higher than moderately interdependent tasks, <italic>t</italic>(34) = 23.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 3.57, which were again rated higher than minimally interdependent and independent tasks, <italic>t</italic>(34) = 19.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 2.64.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811435234">Table 1</xref>, for the composite, of the bottom five tasks, four were categorized as minimally interdependent or independent tasks on the basis of the instructor pilots’ data. Similarly, four of the minimally interdependent or independent tasks were the bottom five team relatedness tasks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720811435234">Appendix A</xref>), and four out of the seven minimally interdependent or independent tasks were in the bottom five of the team workflow tasks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0018720811435234">Appendix B</xref>). Finally, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811435234">Table 2</xref> also indicate that there was a fairly high degree of agreement between the pilots in terms of their interdependency ratings; however, it is worth noting that the agreement levels were slightly higher for the interdependent compared with independent and minimally interdependent tasks.</p>
<p>Although the composite ratings effectively differentiated between the individual- and team-based tasks, the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811435234">Table 1</xref> also highlight the diagnostic value of this process and ratings. Specifically, it shows that two tasks were “misclassified” by the pilots (e.g., independent or minimally interdependent tasks rated in the middle third of the distribution), indicating a lack of convergence between the levels of independence as designated by the instructor pilots and interdependence as reflected in the pilots’ ratings for these tasks. The implications of this are discussed in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>We also ran a series of confirmatory factor analyses to further assess the extent to which the (composite) data fit a one-factor model (that comprised all 34 tasks) versus a three-factor model (that consisted of 5 minimally interdependent or independent, 9 moderately interdependent, and 20 highly interdependent tasks for the composite ratings). The comparative fit index and normed fit index for the one-factor model were .51 and .42 for the composite ratings. The corresponding values for the three-factor model were .72 and .59 for the composite ratings. Thus, as relative fit indices that assess the adequacy of a model’s fit relative to other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811435234">Ullman, 2007</xref>), these results provided additional support for the ability of the composite ratings to differentiate between individual and team tasks.</p>
<p>We also assessed the relationship between the holistic (job-level) and decomposed (aggregated task-level) ratings. The results of this analysis, which are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720811435234">Table 3</xref>, indicate moderate correlations between the holistic (job-level) and decomposed (aggregated task-level) ratings. Specifically, as would be expected, the holistic (job-level) rating was positively and moderately to strongly related to the decomposed (task-level) aggregate of the highly interdependent tasks. In contrast, the holistic ratings displayed a very weak relationship with the aggregate of the decomposed independent and minimally interdependent tasks. This finding indicates that the job of an F-16 combat pilot is a team-based job.</p>

However, the relationship between ratings of highly interdependent tasks and performance was not statistically significant. Thus, teams that more accurately recognized the lack of interdependence of the specified tasks outperformed those that did not. Similar results were found for the relationships between performance and team-relatedness and between performance and team workflow.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study replicated those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref>. Specifically, like Arthur et al., the results indicated that the team relatedness and team workflow ratings effectively differentiated between tasks that were predetermined to be minimally interdependent or independent, moderately, and highly interdependent (as identified by the instructor pilots) and displayed high levels of interrater agreement. These findings were sustained even when interdependence was operationalized as the composite of the team relatedness and team workflow ratings. Furthermore, the interdependency ratings were related to team performance. However, we also extended the findings of the previous study by (a) investigating the efficacy of the team relatedness–team workflow composite and (b) using operational field data based on F-16 fighter combat pilots instead of college students performing a computer-based tank combat simulator. Thus, in summary, in their totality, the study’s results provide additional evidence for the efficacy of using team relatedness and team workflow as metrics of interdependence as demonstrated in their ability to differentiate between tasks within the same job.</p>
<p>Team relatedness and team workflow ratings would seem to have enormous utility in both applied and research settings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720811435234">Kyte (2009)</xref> used them as criteria in a crew resource management (CRM) training program with railroad crews, reasoning that an effective CRM training program would also be one that sensitized trainees to the interdependencies of their tasks and jobs; consequently, one should expect to see higher posttraining team relatedness and team workflow ratings compared to the pretraining ratings.</p>
<p>Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can also serve as predictors of team performance. Specifically, consistent with the conceptual and theoretical basis for the positive relationship between team performance and shared mental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811435234">Day et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811435234">DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811435234">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811435234">Edwards, Day, Arthur, &amp; Bell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811435234">Mohammed, Ferzandi, &amp; Hamilton, 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al.’s (2005)</xref> results indicated that teams that rated individual tasks as team based performed worse on the computer-based tank combat simulator than those that rated them as individual based. Conversely, teams that rated team tasks as team based performed better than those that rated them as individual based. We obtained similar results with the F-16 pilot data. Specifically, the results generally indicate that teams that rated independent, minimally interdependent, or moderately interdependent tasks as high in team relatedness or team workflow performed worse than teams that rated these tasks lower in team relatedness or team workflow.</p>
<p>Although we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al.’s (2005)</xref> questionnaire-based approach to measure team relatedness and team workflow, it is conceivable that other measurement approaches or scales (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811435234">Dieterly, 1988</xref>) could be used to operationalize these metrics of team interdependence. Nevertheless, an advantage of the approach presented here is the flexibility and transportability of these metrics and associated ratings to other settings. That is, because of their basically “generic” nature—at one level, they are fundamentally response options—these metrics can be readily used with preexisting task statements, as illustrated in the sample form presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018720811435234">Appendix C</xref>. Thus, all one has to do is fill in one’s task statements on the form. This flexibility also means that this team task analysis approach and resultant ratings can be readily incorporated into existing occupational, job, and task analysis systems.</p>
<p>The implications of using an interdependence composite also warrant additional discussion. For instance, as in traditional job analysis, in which it is not uncommon to combine different task characteristics, such as task importance and time spent (frequency), into a composite, we extended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref> and investigated the efficacy of an interdependence composite. Given that this composite was operationalized as the mean of the team relatedness and team workflow ratings, it is not surprising that (a) the correlations between the composite and its facets were quite high and (b), although the intercorrelation between relatedness and workflow was only moderate, the pattern of results obtained from the facets and the composite were very similar.</p>
<p>Finally, although we operationalized the composite as the mean of team relatedness and team workflow ratings, we acknowledge that alternative operationalizations are feasible, such as the use of differential weights or even conditional statements. Thus, for example, concerning the latter, one could envisage a situation where one is interested in the <italic>form</italic> of interdependence (i.e., team workflow) only if the <italic>amount</italic> or <italic>degree</italic> of interdependence (i.e., team relatedness) exceeds some threshold or cutoff. From this perspective, as previously noted, the conceptual basis and practical implications of these two team interdependence metrics is not much different from other task characteristics (e.g., importance and time spent/frequency) that are investigated in the job and task analysis literature.</p>
<p>Among their myriad of uses, the interdependence ratings also have potential diagnostic value. For example, in the present study, the fighter pilots and instructor pilots disagreed on the team relatedness of five tasks. Specifically, four tasks that were identified as moderately interdependent tasks by the instructor pilots (e.g., executing air combat while fatigued) were consistently rated by the fighter pilots as being highly interdependent tasks in terms of team relatedness (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720811435234">Appendix A</xref>). In addition, the task of executing timely in-flight ops check was designated as an independent or minimally interdependent task by the instructor pilots, yet it was rated as a moderately interdependent task by the fighter pilots.</p>
<p>There were also eight tasks on which the instructor pilots and pilots disagreed in their workflow ratings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0018720811435234">Appendix B</xref>). Five of these discrepancies were in regard to moderately interdependent tasks that were rated as highly interdependent tasks by the fighter pilots (e.g., executing air combat with friendly integrated air defense system in assigned area of responsibility). Two of the disagreements were in regard to independent or minimally interdependent tasks rated as moderately or highly interdependent tasks (e.g., executing air combat over mountainous terrain) by the fighter pilots. Finally, the last of the eight areas of difference was the rating of a moderately interdependent task as an independent or minimally interdependent task (e.g., executing All Aspect Missile Defense).</p>
<p>Fighter pilots consistently rated some tasks as more interdependent (in terms of team relatedness and team workflow). From a diagnostic perspective, this finding has resulted in interesting discussions at the training site as to why tasks that are supposedly trained by the instructor pilots as independent or minimally interdependent tasks are perceived (and presumably performed) by the F-16 pilots as moderately to highly interdependent tasks.</p>
<p>Related to this finding, as another example of their diagnostic value, remedial and developmental interventions—such as team building and process consultation—that are directed at team performance may be misplaced if the level of interdependence is so low that team performance resides primarily at the level of the individual and not at the team level. Indeed, this finding is consonant with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811435234">Barrick, Bradley, Kristof-Brown, and Colbert (2007)</xref>, who found interdependence to be an important moderator of the process-performance relationship in top management teams. Specifically, they found that top management teams with higher levels of interdependence had higher team and firm performance when the team was more cohesive and had more communication. The converse was true of low-interdependence teams such that for these teams, higher team and firm performance was associated with lower communication and cohesion. Thus, an effective team task analysis directs researchers and practitioners to the critical team tasks and associated behavioral requirements.</p>
<sec id="section13-0018720811435234">
<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>In spite of our findings, it is not our intention to suggest that team relatedness and team workflow capture <italic>everything</italic> one needs to know regarding the nature and degree of team interdependence. For instance, in his work on “groupness,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811435234">Campbell (1958)</xref> argued that the perception of groupness was dependent on three basic principles: (a) common fate, or the extent to which individuals seem to experience similar outcomes; (b) similarity, or the extent to which individuals display the same behaviors; and (c) proximity, or the distance between individuals in the group. That is, the perception of groupness increases to the extent that individuals all respond to a common goal, behave in a similar manner, and are proximally located. Hence, these or possibly other dimensions, in addition to workflow and team relatedness, may help to more fully capture the nature of teamness.</p>
<p>There are also additional, less perceptually based approaches and techniques for identifying and capturing aspects of task and behavioral interdependence. For instance, researchers have used the frequency of support behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811435234">Wagemen, 1995</xref>) and communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811435234">Ellis, Bell, Ployhart, Hollenbeck, &amp; Ilgen, 2005</xref>) as indicators of interdependence. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720811435234">Wageman and Baker (1997)</xref> proposed a formula that represents the influence of one person’s behavior on another’s performance. These indicators of interdependence represent nonperceptual, and thus non-self-report, methods of assessing interdependence.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that these approaches to capturing aspects of interdependence may be comparatively more resource intensive. As such, they could be used conjointly with a team task analysis approach that parallels the combined use of observations, interviews, and task analyses in a traditional job analysis. Further-more, the use of multiple indicators of interdependence may aid in increasing the veracity of “true” scores when using team relatedness and team workflow ratings as predictors or criteria. Specifically, one would expect a team-based task or job that is identified as such by SMEs to, in turn, engender higher levels of communication, support behavior, and performance interdependencies compared with individual tasks or jobs.</p>
<p>The performance domain for the present study entailed action teams. Consequently, future research to examine the utility of team relatedness and team workflow ratings in nonaction teams is warranted, and questions of interest might include the following: What exactly do interdependence ratings look like in knowledge or decision-making teams? Would the interdependence metrics proposed by us be equally applicable, or would they need to be modified? And if so, how would they need to be modified to make them more applicable to situations in which the task is not primarily coordinative, as is the case in the tasks used by us and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811435234">Arthur et al. (2005)</xref> as well?</p>
<p>For future research, one could also envision a database, such as the U.S. Department of Labor’s O*Net, that provides information on the degree and type of job and task interdependence. For instance, numerical indicators of the level of team relatedness and type of team workflow for commercial pilots compared with, say, commercial truck drivers might have various informative uses. O*Net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811435234">Peterson et al., 2001</xref>) presents a number of important job characteristics (e.g., work activities, interests, work values, knowledge, skills, and abilities) that permit comparisons of jobs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720811435234">Dierdorff &amp; Morgeson, 2007</xref>). Similarly, analogous data could be generated for team interdependence to facilitate the comparative study of jobs in organizations in terms of their degree and type of interdependence. Furthermore, such a database could provide an initial reference for team-based job analysis.</p>
<p>However, since levels of team relatedness and team workflow are likely to vary across industries and organizations, local team-based job analyses are likely warranted. (We acknowledge that some items in the O*Net work context scale provide gross information about whether the incumbent works with others or not.) Such an effort would also permit needed investigations of the relationships between team relatedness and team workflow and other job and task characteristics, such as importance ratings. For instance, in team-based contexts, are team-based tasks (i.e., team task work) generally considered more important than individual-based tasks (i.e., individual task work)? Future research investigating the relationship between team interdependence and other task characteristics, including, but not limited to, time to proficiency and consequences of error, is warranted.</p>
