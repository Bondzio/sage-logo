<p>With her maroon coloured Mysore sari wrapped tight around her bodyline. She arrived at a crowded nameless, random airport. Far West. Far, too far for her to imagine. Far, too far for her to grasp. Far, too far for her to understand. Her locality on a compass. Her distance on a global map. Her status in a statistic. Her situation on a global index. And her plight in a newspaper.</p>
<p>With her children in her arm. And their toys in their hands. Her eyes and mouth gasped for the husband she came for. But was met by the police she ran away from. She pressed tight, so tight. Too tight. The hands of her children. And hurt their fragile palms and fingers. Through the fear and agony. Drawn on her face. The insecurity and its palpability. That evoked tears in their young brown eyes. Of being caught and sent back.</p>
<p>And return to the un-returnable.</p>
<p>Together. The three of them.</p>
<p>Were led to a room in grey. That read immigration office at its desk. Where mothers were separated. From their screaming children. Their begging voices. And their beating hearts. Tied to their children.</p>
<p>Uninviting and unwelcoming. She left. And arrived. To sit down. In an empty room. With nothing but two chairs. A table. A mirror. And dizzling light. Titled: interrogation room.</p>
<p>Whilst her luggage continued to turn lone rounds. On an emptied baggage claim. Abandoned. In an airport. In the Far West. Waiting. And waiting. To be claimed. Remembered and repossessed.</p>
<p>Through the reflection of the mirror in front of her she saw herself. For the first time ever since. She braided her hair in front of her bedroom mirror. In another empty room. Where life has disappeared from long before her body left. Where joy has vanished from long before her husband fled.</p>
<p>Where corpses laid around long before the dead arrived. 63 hours ago.</p>
<p>Before she left behind the world she was situated in. And circulated in. In safety and gravity. In fear and insecurity. Like a satellite in a derailed universe. And a ship without anchor. Vulnerable to the omnipresent Shiva. Whose planetary constellation has changed. Her sun and moon cycle. Her sweat and blood flow. Whose dance of rage moved <italic>salangais</italic> and <italic>mridangams</italic>. Planets and suns. As well as tanks and regiments.</p>
<p>Rhythmic dances to a rhythmic beat. Of bomb – and gunshots. Shiva’s dance. His devotees waltz. Along his lethal rhythm. In their little <italic>kovil</italic>. Into their little graveyard. Their divine and ancient world.</p>
<p>And her home. For 27 years.</p>
<p>Before she dared to cross holy borders. Drawn by Gods not men. Drawn by water not land. <italic>Kala paani</italic>. Black water. And red oceans. That have swallowed crops and corpses. Long before she was born. To be purified from the impurity that coloured her home in red. And bodies in black.</p>
<p>To be diseased with the melancholy. And be infected with the guilt. Of the betrayers. Escapees. Exilees. Survivors.</p>
<p>Who have left home for life. And fled from life for death. Afar from home.</p>
<p>Her fingers wiped away the tears from her round cheeks. From the face of a mother who has secured the lives of her children. The wife who has followed her husband’s path to security. The daughter who has left behind her ageing parents. The sister who had fled without knowing the whereabouts of her siblings. The friend who disappeared without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>The woman who never turned around. To look into the eyes of the devastation of life and the living. The human who dreamed to return in peace. And left with war. Occupying, destroying and raging her mind and heart. Her memories of home.</p>
<p>Pale, colourless, but with a blood red <italic>pottu</italic> on her forehead and a blood drenched <italic>kunkumum</italic> strip between the roots of her parted hair. Like traces of blood from a battle she fled from. A battle she forgot to fight. In fear and despair. And left. Without a word. She sat in front of the border agent.</p>
<p>Feeling her dry skin. Moisted by tears and sweat. Fears and traumas. Vulnerability and insecurity. Of facing men in uniform. Of facing men of war and death. Rape and torture.</p>
<p>With guns and anger – not pens and papers.</p>
<p>Sheets of papers. Words and memories. Witness and testimony. Trial and judgment. Accused and accuser. Prosecuted and prosecutor. Judged and judge. On life and death. Asylum and deportation. War and melancholia. Loss and suffering. Despair and plight. Despair in plight. In this vicious circle. Called life.</p>
<p>Fears of being labelled. Stamped. Of being shoved off shore. Again and again. Into another <italic>kala paani</italic>. Into another boat and plane. To be forced to return to the un-returnable. To be forced to abandon. On repeat. To leave behind. On repeat. To repeat and repeat. Actions and reactions. To be caught up.</p>
<p>And abandon her husband. And luggage. Her dreams. Hopes. And imagination of the unimaginable. Of peace and security. Of rights, dignity and life.</p>
<p>Her nightmares of bleeding to death. In pain and agony. With her wrists cut. And the picture of her children and husband. Next to her face. To colour their faces with tears and blood. And fall asleep in their sight. To never forget. And never be forgotten.</p>
<p>In this airport Far West. Far, too far from her abandoned mother, father, siblings and friends. Far, too far from her abandoned husband and children. Far, too far from her abandoned home.</p>
<p>Far, too far to return in death. Far, too far to find peace in death. In the lagoon, ocean and gulf of her ancestors.</p>
<p>Abandoned lives. And abandoned bags. Waiting. In this endless baggage claim. For someone to return. For someone to arrive.</p>
<p>For something to change.</p>
<p>Caught up in this system. And mechanism. Without individual control. That manages and dictates. Life and death. Of the desperate and needy. Of the impoverished and war torn. Of the unprivileged and unaccepted. Unwanted and unneeded. Of humanity’s inhumanity. Its ugly face. Covered and disguised. The factory of life and the living. Of death and the dead. On a mass scale. To produce and reproduce. Its mass product.</p>
<p>That remained unreleased and unpublished.</p>
<p>For hearts to beat in fear.</p>
<p>In an endless cycle.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>For abandoned bags circling on baggage claims in nameless airports. For husbands waiting in anxiety in nameless arrival terminals. For children sobbing the names of their nameless mothers. For relatives too fearfully and hopefully reading the news for stories about their nameless relatives.</p>
<p>Waiting for her.</p>
<p>Waiting for them.</p>
<p>Praying for her.</p>
<p>Praying for them.</p>
<p>To appear.</p>
<p>In her maroon coloured.</p>
<p>Mysore sari.</p>
<p>With her tired children.</p>
<p>And her luggage held tight.</p>
<p>As well as tearful eyes.</p>
<p>To trespass this nameless border</p>
<p>Of this nameless airport</p>
<p>In this nameless country</p>
<p>That reads:</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Welcome back to life.</p>
