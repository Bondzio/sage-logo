<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 60-year-old man presented with a three month history of an ulcerated lesion on the pulp of the middle finger. He was treated with antibiotics for about two months in another hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of infection. His past medical history included a nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed three years ago, treated by total laryngectomy. Pulmonary metastases were detected at the time of his last evaluation when he was referred to us. On examination, a bleeding ulcerative mass about 3 cm × 2 cm was seen on his volar side of the distal phalanx of the middle finger. White cell count, sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were normal and magnetic resonance imaging showed a soft tissue mass on the volar side of the distal phalanx without any bone lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412441776">Figure 1</xref>). With suspicion of metastases, we biopsied this ulcerative lesion. The biopsy result suggested epidermoid carcinoma as metastasis from the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Disarticula-tion through the metacarpophalangeal joint was performed. On pathologic examination, keratinizing squamous cell lesions and large undifferentiated epithelial tumoral islands were seen and reported as nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412441776">Figure 2</xref>). Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was referred to his own oncologist again after the operation. In the second year of his oncologic treatment, we lost the patient because of lung metastasis.</p>

<p>Metastases to the hand, can be the first manifestation of a primary tumor, and metastases may mimic other skeletal diseases, particularly infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441776">Flynn et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the rarity of this disease, it is important to consider metastases when diagnosing unusual hand conditions. Symptoms are similar to infections often present with pain, redness, swelling, erythema or loss of function. Differential diagnoses, such as whitlow, felon, osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, tenosynovitis and gout, must be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441776">Flynn et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The distal phalanx is the most frequent site of metastasis and the dominant side is involved more frequently, perhaps because the dominant side receives more blood supply and repeated trauma reducing tissue resistance, allowing tumor settlement. Chemotactic factors (prostaglandins) released after repeated trauma are responsible for cell migration and adherence. If bony involvement is presented, radiographs mostly show osteolytic lesions except prostatic metastases, which frequently show osteoblastic metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412441776">Tolo et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Primary lung tumors comprise almost 50% of neoplasms that metastase to hands, followed by kidney and breast. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma very rarely metastases to hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412441776">Gold and Reefe, 1963</xref>). Metastases to the hand represents widespread disease and carries a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412441776">Amadio and Lombardi, 1987</xref>). Amputation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, curettage and wide excision are the modes of treatment used most often. If the lesion is symptomatic, amputation is the suggested treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441776">Flynn et al., 2008</xref>). The indication of adjuvant therapy is based on the patient’s individual disease status. Radiotherapy can be helpful in isolated painful lesions without surgical intervention, especially for preservation of thumb function. But radiotherapy is not possible on ulcerated skin and recurrence is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412441776">Amadio and Lombardi, 1987</xref>) As this case emphasizes, clinicians should always consider acrometastases in a patient with unusual distal upper extremity lesions and a previous history of malignancy.</p>
