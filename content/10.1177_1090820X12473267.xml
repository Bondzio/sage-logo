      <p>As subscribers to <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal</italic> (<italic>ASJ</italic>), you are probably most interested in reading about new scientific techniques, advances in clinical practice management, and perhaps even the latest cutting-edge bench research. The business behind managing, editing, and printing the content you read in <italic>ASJ</italic> (or any scientific publication) isn’t likely to be the first thing that crosses your mind when the latest copy of The Gold Journal arrives on your desk. However, many of you are not just readers; you are authors, reviewers, and Editorial Board members. In those roles, you may find yourself curious—and occasionally concerned—about publishing industry trends, especially when those trends become “buzzwords” used in the national and international media, and probably even by your colleagues who publish frequently. We are all well aware by now of how online versions of our favorite publications—both scientific and popular—have affected the way we read. <italic>ASJ</italic>’s fantastic iPad app, the RADAR Resource, is an example of how reading the Journal in a technology-based format can offer you features that a print copy never could: you can save specific articles to a bookshelf, add your own voice/video/text notes, have real-time discussions with your colleagues about what you’re reading, and search for specific topics in the entire backfile (1995-present). But how has technology changed the publishing landscape from an author’s perspective? <italic>Open access</italic> (OA) is one of the buzzwords I mentioned earlier. You’ve probably heard it, but you likely would have difficulty explaining what it means, why it is important, and how it might affect your favorite journal in the coming years. Therefore, I’d like to use the next few pages to discuss OA with you.</p>
      <p>As always when discussing new concepts, it’s best to start with a definition. OA, according to the Public Library of Science (PLoS, which is perhaps the most important source of OA material), is “free immediate access to, and unrestricted reuse of, original works of all types.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12473267">1</xref>
         </sup> Essentially, OA indicates that an article—or, in some cases, an entire journal—is available to any reader without a subscription fee. Considering the recent attention OA models have garnered, it might surprise you to know that the history of open-access publishing dates back almost to the inception of the World Wide Web. According to Laasko et al,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12473267">2</xref>
         </sup> “Open Access emerged in the early 1990s, triggered by the possibilities offered by the web, but also partly as a reaction to the so-called ‘serials crisis’ of subscription prices, which seemed to be constantly rising faster than the rate of inflation.” Laasko et al also divided the historical course of OA into 3 phases:</p>
      <list id="list1-1090820X12473267" list-type="bullet">
         <list-item>
            <p>the pioneering phase, from 1993 to 1999, when OA was largely confined to online repositories created and maintained by individual scientists or institutions;</p>
         </list-item>
         <list-item>
            <p>the innovation phase, from 2000 to 2004, when “new business models for running OA operations on a wider scale emerged,” including OA publisher BioMedCentral (“funded by venture capital and later purchased by Springer”) and PLoS (which created “a handful of very high-quality journals using a substantial start-up grant”);</p>
         </list-item>
         <list-item>
            <p>and the consolidation phase, from 2005 to present, when the dramatic percentage growth in the number of OA journals/articles has declined from “peak years” but when more infrastructure has emerged, including the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), an indexing service for OA journals.</p>
         </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>In the current market, OA can actually mean a variety of things. In 2009, Mark Ware and Michael Mabe<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> issued an overview report for the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical (STM) Publishers in which they comprehensively described OA models and distinguished among OA approaches “in terms of <italic>what</italic> is made open, <italic>when</italic> it is made open, and <italic>how</italic> it is made open.” Depending on the policies of the journal and the publisher, the <italic>what</italic> can be the draft (“preprint”) version of the manuscript submitted by the author for peer review, the final version of the manuscript accepted for publication but not yet edited or formatted, or the actual published article as it would appear in the “Version of Record” (VOR) on the journal’s website or in an indexing database. The <italic>when</italic>, of course, could be “prior to publication, immediately on publication, [or] at some publisher-specified period after publication (an ‘embargo’ period).”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> Last—and this is perhaps the most important distinction as you gain an understanding of OA—there are a few models for <italic>how</italic> the material can be posted. Full open access, generally referred to as “Gold” OA, happens when the final VOR of an article is available immediately online to all potential readers. “Gold” OA can pertain to entire journals, in which all of the content is offered free of charge (PLoS journals are published with this model), or to selected articles in an otherwise subscription-based journal. The latter is generally called “hybrid” OA, and authors are often required to pay a fee to the journal’s publisher to make their article OA; this payment offsets potential loss of revenue from subscriptions or pay-per-view fees that might be lost when articles are offered on a complimentary basis. An alternative to full OA is delayed OA, in which the final VOR is published after an embargo period specified by the publisher. Another option is called “self-archiving,” which is generally called “Green” OA. In this model, the author publishes his or her article on a personal website. The article is therefore “posted” online in an OA format alongside the official publication in the journal.</p>
      <p>There are many motivations for making scientific research freely available. For the purposes of this Editorial, we will explore a select few of the arguments. The first major argument for OA relates only to research funded by government grants in the United States. In 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a “Guide Notice for Public Access,” requiring that all “final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive [be submitted to] PubMed Central [the OA portion of PubMed] upon acceptance for publication,”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12473267">4</xref>
         </sup> regardless of the journal in which they are published. The NIH believes that this immediate, free, public access will “help advance science and improve human health.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12473267">4</xref>
         </sup> Some of the argument for this type of OA also centers on taxpayer rights—specifically, that if research is funded by taxes, the citizens who pay those taxes have a right to the fruits of that labor. In fact, there is currently an Internet petition that would implement the NIH policy in all federal agencies. The petitioners believe that “expanding access would speed the research process and increase the return on investment in scientific research.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12473267">5</xref>
         </sup> Although the case for OA in grant-funded research was clearly decided with the NIH requirement, the question behind the initial movement—Who owns science?—underlies arguments for and against OA even in private studies. PLoS argues that OA research benefits everyone because of accelerated discovery (“With open access, researchers can read and build on the findings of others without restriction”) and improved education (“Open access means that teachers and their students have access to the latest research findings throughout the world”).<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12473267">1</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>The second argument in support of OA centers on increasing citations, which are important to both authors and journals. Many authors believe that their article will be more heavily cited by other scientists if it is published in an OA format, rather than being available only to subscribers of a single journal. Likewise, many journals believe that OA articles will receive more citations, which can potentially increase a journal’s impact factor and subsequently its visibility, profitability, and attractiveness to future authors. This argument is somewhat more easily addressed than the first. In the 2009 STM report cited earlier,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> the authors did acknowledge that “most studies have shown that it does appear to be the case that self-archived articles [ie, those posted on a physician’s own website, if a publisher allows it] receive more citations than non-archived articles,” but they also cautioned that there were likely several factors contributing to those numbers. “An ‘early view effect,’” they said, “posits that archived articles may have received more citations at a given point because they had been available for longer; selection bias occurs if authors are more likely to archive their better work, or if better authors are more likely to self-archive; [and] the open access effect is the component due purely to the fact that the article was open access.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> They cited 2 earlier research articles concluding that the percentage citation increases for OA articles “demonstrated a clear early view effect” as well as a selection bias but said unequivocally that there was “no evidence to support an open access effect.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> They concluded that “the best available evidence . . . therefore suggests that open access articles do not receive more lifetime citations but they do get them sooner due to early view and selection bias effects.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>What does all of this mean for you, as authors and readers of <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal?</italic> As it currently stands, SAGE, our publisher, provides clear guidelines about author rights and responsibilities. Harking back to the earlier descriptions of <italic>what, when</italic>, and <italic>how</italic>, you may circulate the draft (preprint) version of any article you submit to <italic>ASJ</italic> immediately, on any website. After the article has been accepted, you may post that version on any noncommercial website, but no sooner than 12 months after publication in the <italic>ASJ</italic>. This version may not incorporate any changes made after acceptance, and it may not be the final, formatted, and typeset version (ie, it cannot be the proof you receive for approval prior to publication, nor can it be the final PDF that appears online at the <italic>ASJ</italic> website). You may question why this is the case and why we do not currently offer authors the option to pay for OA access to their specific articles. The authors of the STM report cited earlier in this Editorial acknowledged that “optional (hybrid) OA potentially provides a relatively low-risk way for established subscription journals to experiment with open access,” but they also stated that “gold OA is [likely] not a good model for the very prestigious, top-tier journals that depend on expensive editorial quality control.”<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> They named the “less prestigious” PLoS ONE journal and other PLoS community journals, which employ a system of “light peer review,” as those that could make a “positive financial contribution” from full OA publishing.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473267">3</xref>
         </sup> As you well know, those descriptions do not pertain to <italic>ASJ</italic>. Our peer review is rigorous, and our editorial standards are high. We might, in the future, choose to offer an optional (hybrid) OA model for authors, but the adoption of that model is currently low throughout publishing; it now stands at an estimated “1-2% average across all publishers,” with “the total number of papers published via this route” at only 0.5%. We are currently applying the same theory you use when evaluating a new device for your clinic: we want to remain on the cutting edge and we certainly will not be the last to adopt any proven model of successful publishing, but we want to be absolutely certain than any changes we make are in the best interest of the subspecialty, our authors, and our readership.</p>
