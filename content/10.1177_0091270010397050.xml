<abstract>
<p>The aims were to determine the effect of an oral inhibitor of the signaling mediator p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (GW856553, losmapimod) on sputum neutrophils, pulmonary function, and blood biomarkers of inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three hundred and two individuals with GOLD stage II COPD were randomized to oral losmapimod 7.5 mg twice daily, inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50 µg/500 µg combination (SFC), or placebo in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study (MKI102428/NCT00642148). Neither losmapimod nor SFC had an effect on the primary end point of sputum neutrophils. Losmapimod was well tolerated and reduced plasma fibrinogen by 11% (–0.4 g/L, ratio of effect of losmapimod/placebo 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.96; P = .002) with nonsignificant reductions in interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein. There was evidence of improvement in hyperinflation with losmapimod compared with placebo (overall P = .02). Inhaled SFC significantly improved lung function and reduced serum CC-16 (ratio of effect of SFC/placebo 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.93; P &lt; .001). It was concluded that oral losmapimod significantly reduced plasma fibrinogen in patients with COPD.</p>

<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from the inhalation of tobacco smoke and aerotoxins. It is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality and is predicted to become the third leading cause of death by 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010397050">1</xref></sup> COPD is a multifaceted condition involving both local and systemic pathological processes that include airway obstruction, emphysema, mucus hypersecretion, loss of lean body mass, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010397050">2</xref></sup> There is systemic inflammation in tobacco smokers, with even greater systemic inflammation in individuals with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010397050">3</xref></sup> Indeed, blood markers of systemic inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and interleukin (IL)-6 are elevated in individuals with COPD compared with smoking and nonsmoking controls without airflow obstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010397050">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010397050">7</xref></sup> Fibrinogen levels also correlate with disease severity as assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397050">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010397050">9</xref></sup> with exacerbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397050">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397050">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010397050">11</xref></sup> and with risk of death from COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010397050">12</xref></sup> There is no evidence that approved therapies for COPD have a clinically meaningful impact on the systemic component of the disease that is associated with elevated plasma fibrinogen.</p>
<p>It has been reported that p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase plays a critical role in signaling between environmental stress (such as tobacco smoke, growth factors, cytokines, and inflammation-derived oxidants) and gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010397050">13</xref></sup> It acts at a posttranscriptional level to stabilize the messenger RNA for cytokines and chemokines that are likely to be important in the pathogenesis of COPD; these include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. p38 MAP kinase is elevated in alveolar macrophages and the alveolar walls of individuals with COPD compared with smoking controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010397050">14</xref></sup> Inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase have anti-inflammatory effects in murine models of tobacco smoke–induced inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010397050">15</xref></sup> However, oral dexamethasone had no effect in these models, thereby demonstrating that p38 MAP kinase and dexamethasone mediate their effects on different anti-inflammatory pathways. In view of these findings, small-molecule inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents in individuals with COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010397050">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010397050">17</xref></sup> but these have not been fully evaluated in clinical trials. We report here the results of a phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the effect of losmapimod, an oral inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, on sputum neutrophils, clinical outcomes, and biomarkers of inflammation in individuals with COPD. Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination (SFC) was included as a positive control arm because previous studies have shown that it can reduce sputum neutrophils in individuals with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010397050">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Losmapimod (GW856553)/SFC Intervention Study (MKI102428, NCT00642148)</title>
<p>Three hundred and two individuals aged 40 to 75 years with a 10 or more pack-year smoking history, ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 0.7, and an FEV<sub>1</sub> between 50% and 80% predicted (following inhalation of 400 µg of salbutamol) were randomized to receive either 7.5 mg of losmapimod (tablets) twice daily, inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50 µg/500 µg combination (SFC), or placebo using a computer-generated permuted block schedule with stratification by country and smoking status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010397050">Figure 1</xref>). Patients randomized to losmapimod received a twice-daily placebo inhalation, and patients randomized to SFC received placebo tablets to match losmapimod. Inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators were withdrawn for 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients were allowed to use albuterol or ipratropium if thought necessary, but other medications for COPD, including long-acting muscarinic antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids, were not permitted during the study. The primary end point was change in percentage of sputum neutrophils with secondary end points being changes in lung function, patient-reported outcomes, plasma and serum biomarkers of inflammation. The modified intention-to-treat population consisted of 294 randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 on-treatment efficacy assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010397050">Table I</xref>). One subject randomized to losmapimod did not receive treatment and a further 7 subjects had no on-treatment efficacy assessments.</p>

CRP was measured in serum using a validated chemiluminescent-based immunoassay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, Illinois), and fibrinogen was measured in citrated plasma using an automated photometric clot-based method (MLA Electra 1400C, Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, Massachusetts). Surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Clara cell protein-16 (CC-16) were measured in serum samples as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010397050">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010397050">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The power calculation for the losmapimod intervention study was based on a previous study of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor dilmapimod.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010397050">22</xref></sup> It was estimated that inclusion of 100 patients per treatment group would detect an absolute reduction of 9.3% in the primary end point of sputum neutrophil differential cell count between losmapimod and placebo using a 2-sided 5% significance test with 90% power. This assumed that 80% of the patients would provide data for sputum neutrophils. End points were compared between treatments using a mixed-model, repeated-measures analysis with covariates of baseline value, smoking status, country, age, sex, and visit, with the effect of treatment group and baseline varying at each visit. All data are presented as mean values. A prespecified log transformation was applied to all biomarker data to improve compatibility with the normal distribution assumption. The biomarker data are presented as geometric means. <italic>P</italic> values for the secondary end points were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and should therefore be viewed as exploratory. To address the problem of multiplicity, multivariate analyses using O’Brien’s test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270010397050">23</xref></sup> were performed to obtain an overall assessment of treatment on 3 prespecified clusters of end points: (1) lung inflammation: percentage neutrophils, total cell count, sputum weight, sputum myeloperoxidase, and serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D), CC-16, and CCL-18; (2) hyperinflation: postbronchodilator FVC, inspiratory capacity (IC), residual volume (RV), total gas volume (TGV) at functional residual capacity (FRC), and total lung capacity (TLC); and (3) systemic inflammation: plasma fibrinogen and serum IL-6, CRP, and CCL-18.</p>

<title>Safety and Tolerability of Losmapimod</title>
<p>Three-hundred and two patients were randomized in the treatment study to losmapimod (n = 102), SFC (n = 102), or placebo (n = 98). The duration of exposure to study medication was similar in each treatment group. One subject (losmapimod group) was excluded from the safety analysis for failure to take the assigned treatment. The overall incidence of adverse events occurring during the treatment period was low and comparable across all 3 groups. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis (11% losmapimod, 12% SFC, and 9% placebo) and headache (4% losmapimod, 4% SFC, and 16% placebo).</p>
<p>The incidence of withdrawals was 12 (12%) for placebo, 15 (15%) for losmapimod, and 13 (13%) for SFC. The reasons for withdrawal were similar between the 2 treatment groups and placebo. Serious adverse events were reported during treatment by 4 patients in the placebo group (angina pectoris, exacerbation of COPD [n = 2], myocardial infarction), 2 patients in the losmapimod group (pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD), and 2 patients in the SFC group (nephrolithiasis, cystitis). None of these serious adverse events were considered by the investigator to be related to losmapimod or SFC, and there were no deaths or pregnancies during the course of the study.</p>
<p>There were no clinically significant changes in hematology, clinical chemistry (including liver function tests), urinalysis, vital signs, or 12-lead electrocardiogram in either treatment group or placebo throughout the study. Minor changes were seen in the mean values of each of these parameters, but the changes were not of clinical concern.</p>

<sec id="section15-0091270010397050" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Investigators have proposed that p38 MAP kinase is a potential therapeutic target in individuals with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010397050">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010397050">17</xref></sup> This was assessed in a 12-week clinical trial of an oral inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (losmapimod) or inhaled SFC. Neither losmapimod nor inhaled SFC had an effect on the primary end point of the percentage of sputum neutrophils at any time point assessed. This was selected as the primary end point because preliminary data from a 28-day safety study with another p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (dilmapimod, SB-681323, MKC101614/NCT00144859) demonstrated a 9.4% reduction in sputum neutrophils (<italic>P</italic> = .06) following 4 weeks of treatment in COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010397050">22</xref></sup> Inhaled SFC has been shown to have effects on lung function and sputum neutrophils following 8 weeks of intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010397050">18</xref></sup> It was therefore included as a positive control arm. However, SFC had no effect on sputum neutrophils in our study and so we cannot rule out the possibility of a technical failure on sputum end points despite clear engagement of pharmacology by losmapimod (as assessed by the HSP-27 assay).</p>
<p>Oral losmapimod was generally well tolerated over the study treatment period, with no effect on liver function assessments or clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters, vital signs, or 12-lead electrocardiogram results. This is in contrast to other p38 MAPK inhibitors whose development has been discontinued because they have caused an increase in liver transaminases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010397050">24</xref></sup> Losmapimod increased prebronchodilator FVC by 87 mL and reduced residual volume by 124 mL and thoracic gas volume by 113 mL compared with placebo, but these changes were not statistically significant. It significantly reduced plasma fibrinogen at most time points assessed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010397050">Figure 3</xref>). These findings are similar to those of dilmapimod, which also significantly reduced plasma fibrinogen by 11% after 2 weeks of treatment relative to placebo (<italic>P</italic> = .002).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010397050">22</xref></sup> In addition, there was a trend to lower values of other systemic biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, and CRP) with losmapimod but not with SFC. Losmapimod significantly affected 2 predefined clusters of end points representing hyperinflation and systemic inflammation but had no effect on the cluster of lung inflammation. This suggests that losmapimod can have an impact on multiple downstream effectors of p38 MAP kinase.</p>
<p>As expected, our data confirm that inhaled SFC is effective as a bronchodilator and is associated with improved patient-reported outcomes (as measured by the SGRQ-C). There was a trend to significance in reducing blood SP-D with SFC that is similar to that reported by Sin and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091270010397050">25</xref></sup> However, most striking was the effect of inhaled SFC on serum CC-16. Levels of CC-16 are increased by acute inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091270010397050">26</xref></sup> but are reduced in individuals with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010397050">20</xref></sup> We show here that they are reduced relative to baseline levels following therapy with inhaled SFC. This is likely to be an effect of steroids on inflammation within the lung that may have resulted from steroid withdrawal during the 2-week washout period. However, we cannot exclude a direct effect of SFC on the Clara cells that produce CC-16.</p>
<p>The effect of oral inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase on circulating fibrinogen demonstrates that they act on a different pathway from the inhaled corticosteroids/long acting β<sub>2</sub> (ICS/LABA) agonists SFC, and so inhibiting this enzyme may have additive or synergistic effects with those of SFC in individuals with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091270010397050">27</xref></sup> The reduction in fibrinogen and the trend of effect on other biomarkers imply that inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase are able to reduce systemic inflammation in patients with COPD. Although the clinical significance of reducing plasma fibrinogen is unclear, a previous study showed that individuals with plasma fibrinogen greater than 3.3 g/L had an increased risk of hospitalization compared with those with plasma fibrinogen of less than 2.7 g/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397050">8</xref></sup> Moreover, elevated levels of fibrinogen are associated with reduced lung function, exercise performance, and mortality in COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397050">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010397050">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010397050">12</xref></sup> and so it is possible that these agents may be useful in reducing disease progression. However, the impact of reducing plasma fibrinogen on an individual with COPD is unknown and requires further evaluation, given that there is no established causal relationship between elevated fibrinogen and outcome in COPD.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest that there may be at least 2 distinct mechanisms to reduce inflammation in individuals with COPD. One could be responsive to inhaled corticosteroids and reflected in changes in the blood biomarkers CC-16 and SP-D. The other could be responsive to the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase as reflected in the biomarkers fibrinogen and, to a lesser extent, IL-6, IL-8, and CRP. Long-term intervention studies are required to determine whether the changes in biomarkers observed in our study are associated with an improvement in relevant clinical outcomes in COPD.</p>
