<body>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to clinical symptoms, neuroradiological findings and treatment responses. The obvious differences in disease courses between patients led to the classification of MS as either relapsing–remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS). The majority of patients starts with a relapsing–remitting disease course characterized by acute exacerbation followed by partial or total recovery; whereas PPMS is associated with a continuous worsening of symptoms and is only observed in about 10–15% of the patients. However, even the clinical presentation does not always allow clear separation between RRMS or PPMS, since some MS patients start with a progressive disease course after a single or few relapses or suffer from a progressive disease from the beginning superimposed by few relapses. The subsequent rate of disease progression is comparable in SPMS and PPMS and is not affected by relapses as soon as a certain Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score is reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458513476563">1</xref></sup> Only about 50% of siblings with MS show an identical disease course. The recently identified susceptibility genes, each of which each contributes less than 1% of disease risk, are comparably distributed in RRMS and PPMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458513476563">2</xref></sup> These epidemiological findings suggest that the different disease courses represent different ends of a disease spectrum rather than different diseases or disease etiologies. This point of view is supported by histopathological and imaging studies that describe quantitative rather than qualitative differences between different clinical courses. Although no fundamental differences have been identified between patients with either RRMS/SPMS or PPMS, this does not mean that the same pathomechansims are responsible for clinical symptoms in all MS patients. The histopathological hallmarks of MS change with disease duration. Whereas the development of new focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions in grey and white matter dominate the pathology at the beginning of the disease, the progressive disease phase is characterized by diffuse white matter abnormalities, accumulation of axonal loss in demyelinated as well as normal-appearing white matter and limited remyelination.</p>
<p>The relapses are believed to be the consequences of focal inflammatory lesions whereas recovery may be induced by resolution of inflammation and edema, increased plasticity and endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination. RRMS patients develop numerous contrast-enhancing lesions which presumably represent actively demyelinating lesions and the number of newly developing lesions decrease with disease duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458513476563">3</xref></sup> This point of view is supported by histological studies which demonstrate a higher number of actively demyelinating lesions in RRMS than in SPMS. Patients with PPMS also develop contrast-enhancing lesions and this is associated with a more rapid progression of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458513476563">4</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, actively demyelinating lesions can also be found in patients with PPMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458513476563">3</xref></sup> These highly inflammatory lesions, observed in the early disease stages, are heterogeneous with respect to composition of inflammation and extent of initial oligodendroglial cell death, suggesting that different pathomechanisms may lead to demyelination. However, these different histological patterns described by Lucchinetti et al. are not predictive for the clinical disease course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458513476563">5</xref></sup> Due to the accumulation of new lesions, the extent of demyelination increases with disease duration: histopathological and imaging studies show that patients with PPMS tend to have comparable lesion loads to RRMS or SPMS patients but that the lesions tend to have formed over much longer intervals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458513476563">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458513476563">6</xref></sup> Demyelination is not limited to the white matter, it is also observed in the cortex and other grey matter areas, even in early disease stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458513476563">7</xref></sup> Similarly to white matter, the lesion load of grey matter increases over time and is associated with inflammation that decreases in SPMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458513476563">3</xref></sup> Meningeal inflammation is also present in PPMS and a greater degree of meningeal inflammation is associated with more extensive cortical demyelination as well as neuronal pathology in this patient cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458513476563">8</xref></sup> In the progressive disease phase the pathology shifts from the formation of new focal lesions to diffuse pathological changes in the periplaque white and gray matter. These diffuse changes include sparse perivascular T-cell infiltrates, microglial activation, mild demyelination and minor ongoing acute axonal damage, and these changes are present in comparable levels in PPMS as well as in SPMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458513476563">3</xref></sup> Interestingly, the extent of diffuse white matter abnormalities correlated with cortical but not white matter lesion load. This is in line with a recent combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological study which found a correlation between diffuse neurodegeneration within distinct thalamo-cortical tracts suggesting that anatomical connections influences the spread of pathological changes via Wallerian or trans-synaptic degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458513476563">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458513476563">10</xref></sup> Extent of axonal loss in corticospinal tracts is comparable in patients with PPMS and SPMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458513476563">11</xref></sup> and acute axonal damage as a measure for recent axonal injury is similar in lesions from patients with either RRMS, SPMS and PPMS when lesions with comparable demyelinating and inflammatory activity were analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458513476563">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, RRMS/SPMS and PPMS share many similarities; the observed differences are more of a quantitative rather than a qualitative difference, most likely modulated by individual genetic predisposition and environmental influences. The vast majority of epidemiological, imaging or histopathological studies do not provide evidence for fundamentally different causes of RRMS/SPMS or PPMS. The lack of treatment responsiveness of SPMS or PPMS to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents together with imaging and histopathological findings indicates that neurodegeneration instead of inflammation dominates the disease process in the progressive disease phase. The identification of the yet unknown pathways responsible for the lack of remyelination and accumulation of axonal injury and loss and underlying clinical progression are prerequisite for the development of new treatment options.</p>
