<abstract>
<p>Qualitative researchers cannot rely on research ethics to be a static practice. In this article we discuss how observation of guidelines for inquiry and international agreements on the dignity of health care research are not sufficient on their own to ensure that the challenges inherent in the everyday management of a project are regulated. We focus in particular on ethics in accessing participants and the construction of informed consent. During our study, important contrasts emerged between the ideal presented for the standard ethics review process and practical ethics. As a result, we focused on building open communication with the participants through rigorous project management. We analyzed the data and wrote this article collaboratively to represent the empirical reality of a team of researchers aiming to take ethical challenges seriously while collecting data in three National Health Service Trusts in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Qualitative researchers are required to manage the ethical aspects of any research project carefully. Furthermore, those conducting research in health care settings face particular ethical rules and standards covered by both external and internal regulation. In the context of medicine and social research, ethics have to be closely applied to the realities of the research situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312460765">Homan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312460765">Morse, 2010</xref>). By acknowledging that there is a growing mismatch between standardized ethics procedures and the complex nature of qualitative research, we argue that ethics should be approached as a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312460765">Cassell &amp; Young, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312460765">Cutcliffe &amp; Ramcharan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312460765">Guillemin &amp; Gillam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312460765">Miller &amp; Bell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312460765">Ramcharan &amp; Cutcliffe, 2001</xref>). Through examples, we demonstrate that ethics-as-process raise important considerations for research conducted in the health care setting and for wider qualitative research, especially regarding informed consent. In doing so, we raise valuable questions for health researchers and for research ethics committee (REC) members.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312460765">Frank (2004)</xref> explained the difference between ethics-as-substance and ethics-as-process by pointing out how in the first condition, ethics are constructed as a “specialty that some people do, and it can be left to them,” whereas in the latter approach, the researcher recognizes the “ongoing negotiation” and the openness of ethics in decision making (p. 355). We demonstrate in this article how “ethics as process takes on the messier, more complicated work of recognizing that multiple interests are each real and that any choice implicates multiple persons and groups” (Frank, p. 356).</p>
<p>Characteristic of contemporary discussion on ethical issues is a focus on the principle of informed consent: the notion that human subjects of research should be allowed to agree or refuse to participate in the light of comprehensive information concerning the nature and purpose of the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312460765">Homan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312460765">World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 2008</xref>). In addition to formal requirements and standardized procedures, such as researchers producing and participants signing consent forms, it is of fundamental importance that research participants understand what the research is about, who is undertaking and financing it, why they are undertaking it, and how they will promote it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312460765">British Sociological Association [BSA], 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732312460765">1</xref></sup> How, then, to convey this information in a way that is meaningful to participants and to the researchers managing this process on a day-to-day basis, in a changing context, with emergent ethical dilemmas?</p>
<p>In discussing the process of constructing informed consent within a qualitative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312460765">Miller and Boulton (2007)</xref> suggested that the research community should share their experiences from the field: the challenges, practicalities, and decisions made. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312460765">DeVries and Subedi (1998)</xref> suggested that researchers who use empirical data and concrete documentation of the practice should move on to investigate “how ethical decisions are actually reached as opposed to how they should be reached” (p. v). In line with these suggestions, we present key dilemmas in accessing participants and seeking informed consent for a qualitative study within three National Health Service (NHS) hospital trusts in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732312460765">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, the constant negotiations for gaining access to participants—that is, different health care professionals—proved to be a crucial component of securing inclusiveness and informed consent, whereas open communication was vital in guaranteeing the ethical progress of the project. The discussions focused on (a) the project approval stage with an REC, (b) negotiations with gatekeepers to access participants, and (c) challenges in the field. The research team engaged in reflexive practices while in the field and during the data-analysis processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312460765">Barry, Britten, Barber, Bradley, &amp; Stevenson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312460765">Guillemin &amp; Gillam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312460765">Patterson, Hart, &amp; Weaver, 2010</xref>), and thus we were “aware of [our] own research activities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312460765">Roberts, 2001</xref>, p. 3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1049732312460765">3</xref></sup> This article is based on our ethnographical data, and in the conclusions we present a set of good practices we learned through many research encounters within the complex health care environment.</p>

<title>The Project: Leadership and Patient Care</title>
<p>In the study, we explored the meanings and perceptions of relationships between leadership and patient care. We focused in particular on how leadership was defined by key stakeholders and transmitted across organizations to impact on service delivery. We began from the premise that leadership, patient care, and organizational change are not objective facts, but social or discursive constructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312460765">Nicolson et al., 2011</xref>). We collected data in three NHS trusts that we considered manageable within the timeframe and with the resources available for the project. Data were collected between June 2007 and June 2010 in nine departments across five hospitals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312460765">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We chose the trusts according to three criteria: (a) they were each different from each other in the image they projected (on their Web sites; in terms of their physical style, locality, size, and community); (b) they were within easy reach of London (for practical purposes, because the study team was based in London and the neighboring county of Surrey); and (c) we were able to gain access to the trusts via personal contacts in research and development departments or senior management (the gatekeepers). We sampled the research sites within each of the trusts through negotiations with the gatekeepers and/or key informants recommended by the gatekeepers. Our intention was to strike a balance between the specific academic interests of the research team, the degree of opportunity for comparison between the trusts, and the concerns of the gatekeepers and other senior trust staff. Data collection methods included focus groups, individual semistructured interviews, ethnographic observation and shadowing of key personnel (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312460765">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312460765">Bruni, Gherardi, &amp; Poggio, 2004</xref>), as well as an adaptation of a preexisting measure of organizational climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312460765">Stringer, 2002</xref>). Participants included junior doctors, registrars and consultants, managers, clinical directors, midwives, and medical secretaries.</p>

<p>Our recruitment plan involved selecting participants for interviews and focus groups on an informed-volunteer basis. We organized meetings with key informants and group presentations that provided information about the study, and offered staff an opportunity to ask questions. To recruit staff members who could not attend the meetings or presentations, and to increase the variety of staff groups and levels of seniority in the sample, we planned to send emails via a staff mailing list; however, hospital confidentiality issues impeded this research strategy and prevented us from accessing the email lists, so we never achieved the mass communication.</p>
<p>We decided the rules for engagement in ethnographic observation on a strategic basis (that is, identifying the staff and/or situation that would yield the richest source of information) and on a pragmatic basis (that is, the possibility of the situation yielding important data regarding leadership, organizational culture and climate, and patient care). In the field, which in this case was a department in an NHS trust, our aim was to “understand how the cultures [we were] studying ‘work’”; that is, to grasp “what the world looks like” to the participants in the context being observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312460765">Delamont, 2004</xref>, p. 218). In addition, the participants needed to be comfortable with our presence, familiar with the ongoing research project, and also prepared to cooperate.</p>
<p>Shadowing involved the same conceptual framework as ethnographic observation, with the aim to understand what the world looked like from the perspective of the staff member being shadowed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312460765">Czarniawska, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312460765">McDonald, 2005</xref>). This process involved one of the researchers meeting the participant (usually) at 8:00 a.m., and for 1 or 2 days accompanying the participant at all times, including breaks, until the participant went home. In trusts occupying more than one site and/or when the nature of the day’s work involved meetings outside the hospital, the researcher spent time in a car with the participant, and if mutually agreed, the conversations were digitally recorded as an aide memoire for the field notes. The participant was able to withdraw at any time, or for a period of time, across the shadowing period.</p>
<p>We prearranged with the participants the dates and times of observation and shadowing. Through the ethnographical approach, we were able to immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of each of the trusts and departments, and to provide evidence about the processes of leadership and patient care, as well as the climate within each organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312460765">Bloor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312460765">Goffman, 1961</xref>). The use of observational and shadowing methods allowed us to record how hospital staff expressed their inner thoughts physically. This set of data would have been inaccessible through the survey or interview questions. Data collection, recruitment of participants, and analysis took place simultaneously, and we managed to capture the interplay between leadership and patient care within the several sources of data. In the process, we faced diverse ethical challenges that the use of each method brought about, and it became crucial that we addressed these challenges as the study progressed.</p>
<p>Our aim to study the relationship between leadership and patient care in situ meant that ethics were very closely connected to the fieldwork itself. However, there was an aspect of disconnection between the management of the study (for example, meeting deadlines, aims of the project, and answering research questions) and the management of ethics on a practical level. Although the team members had all had previous experience of fieldwork, and an understanding of the nature of access negotiations in health care settings, the implementation issues had not been accounted for in the formal requirements of the study design. Setting out to fulfill the promise of a qualitative research proposal seemed not to be a straightforward issue in health care research, because the field could take even the most seasoned researchers by surprise.</p>
<p>In this article, we discuss specifically the ethics processes that we experienced during the negotiations to access each hospital, including our having conducted three seminar presentations to clinical staff members, piloting an organizational climate survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312460765">Stringer, 2002</xref>), asking our focus group questions, and participating on a hospital tour. Our main aim in this article is to describe how access to participants and informed consent were constantly negotiated and reestablished during the qualitative data collection part of this study. We discovered that a positive ethical review had been only a start to managing research in an ethical way.</p>

<title>Research Ethics Committees and Qualitative Research</title>
<p>In the United Kingdom, hospital and health authority research ethics committees have existed in different forms since 1968. These committees follow the principles of the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312460765">World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 2008</xref>) and a standardized framework with inputs from the Department of Health and National Research Ethics Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312460765">Howard, 2004</xref>). A research proposal must be approved by an REC before any study can be conducted in a health care setting. In addition to the procedural control of RECs over a research project, there are several professional bodies that provide codes or guidelines for social research, such as The British Sociological Association and The British Psychological Society. Individual university departments and schools also have their own ethical guidelines for staff members and students conducting research; these are often based on the framework of the Economic and Social Research Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312460765">Hedgecoe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312460765">Wiles, Heath, Crow, &amp; Charles, 2004</xref>). There is also an obligatory “Good Clinical Practice” course, run by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), for researchers who wish to conduct studies in hospitals. In brief, the role of RECs is to review research proposals and set out specific standards, whereas the ethical guidelines attend to complex ethics issues arising in the conduct of research.</p>
<p>Qualitative researchers have criticized RECs for using a regulatory model of research ethics based on the positivist tradition of biomedical research, within which the existence of objective, universal truths and the “essentialized subject” is taken for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312460765">Halse &amp; Honey, 2005</xref>, p. 2147). This framework presumes a radically different epistemic standpoint and data collection methods, as well as analysis other than social sciences and humanities, in which research ethics policy and processes should provide “guidance but not definitive solutions to questions about ethical research and moral behavior” (Halse &amp; Honey, p. 2148). There are clear “epistemic tensions between the discourses of the universal, rational subject of scientific realism and those of the multidimensional, particular, and social subject of interpretative, qualitative research” (p. 2150). Instead of opting for objective scientific neutrality, qualitative researchers pay attention to the research process as an interactive enterprise. Thus, instead of submitting to “universal certainty that crafts an illusion that ethics approval means ethical research,” the researchers in qualitative tradition reflect on the ways that “researchers think through ethical questions” (Halse &amp; Honey, p. 2148).</p>
<p>Critics also question the authority of RECs, and their ability to judge qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312460765">Coleman &amp; Bouësseau, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312460765">Dixon-Woods, Angell, Ashcroft, &amp; Bryman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312460765">Halse &amp; Honey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312460765">Howard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312460765">Murphy &amp; Dingwall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312460765">Tod, Nicolson, &amp; Allmark, 2002</xref>). Even though critics acknowledge the importance of some form of monitoring (Howard) and the presence of organizational processes and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312460765">Kyarimpa &amp; Garcia-Zamor, 2006</xref>), the current procedures are often perceived to be intimidating and intrusive, and merely an obligation that delays the real work of research (Halse &amp; Honey). Alas, RECs are “infamous for their rejection of research proposals” (Howard, p. 109). In the current situation, ethical gatekeepers, such as RECs, perform an initial review of a study. However, during the course of the project, “the responsibility for ensuring that the research is conducted in an ethical manner rests with the researcher” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312460765">Daniel-McKeigue, 2007</xref>, p. 240). How, then, to involve RECs in the resolution of ethical dilemmas that are likely to emerge over the course of a qualitative research project, without establishing an even heavier regulatory structure?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312460765">Ells (2011)</xref> offered simple advice: Researchers need to better communicate their study design and research plan to the research ethics review boards. Research teams need to refine their skills to explain procedures relating to qualitative methods prior to data gathering. This communication should include a description of the uncertainties that are a part of qualitative inquiry, and explain that unforeseeable situations are likely to arise in the field. In response, the ethics review boards need to adopt an open, exploratory attitude toward inductive research proposals. If a proposal does not include specific numbers for interviews, or a structured list of focus group questions, this is likely to be because the measures are incompatible with the research design, rather than from any lack of expertise or preparedness on the part of the researchers.</p>
<p>The researchers should have the opportunity to argue their case and present it in a coherent form within the field of qualitative inquiry without having to employ quantitative research measures and templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312460765">Ells, 2011</xref>). In the case of successful communication between qualitative researchers and an ethics review board, the accumulation of examples and experiences, and establishment of common ground could lead to a situation in which the board can shift from being a disciplining institution to a stakeholder in the process. The evaluation of a qualitative research proposal should focus on how the researchers plan to manage their project to prevent harm and to tackle the ethical challenges that will arise.</p>
<p>We do not intend to disparage the expertise of REC members; rather, we seek to emphasize how qualitative researchers themselves need to understand that, however well intentioned RECs are, their members are not necessarily the best people to decide on the “risks and benefits of their research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312460765">Hedgecoe, 2008</xref>, p. 874). According to Hedgecoe’s ethnographic study of United Kingdom RECs, the members of the committees saw their role as “one of supporting or encouraging research, in addition to the more obvious duties of protecting patients and ensuring informed consent,” and they shared much of the “skepticism about the way in which qualitative research is or has been dealt with by such committees” (p. 874).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1049732312460765">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because “goalposts” within health care organizations are constantly being moved, it is inevitable that researchers and participants will encounter unexpected ethical challenges during the course of a study. Therefore, RECs and researchers should discuss ethical procedures postproject, as well. For example, researchers could provide RECs with descriptions of situations in which they were required to take action to achieve or sustain ethical conduct. This would enable the RECs to develop a broader view of realities in the field, and to act as a mediator between projects and research teams, communicating examples of incidents to researchers with new proposals. Such dialogue would help to develop RECs into evidence-based and supportive institutions for qualitative researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312460765">Anderson &amp; Sieber, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Informed consent is at the heart of ethical concerns, because a researcher becomes informed about context-specific ethics through the questions and possible concerns that gatekeepers and the participants raise in the initial stages of a project. “[O]rganizations are internally characterized by ambiguity, ambivalence, and equivocality” (Czarniawska, 2005, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312460765">Dixon-Woods et al., 2007</xref>, p. 799), and therefore one template of ethics does not match all situations. In the following, we discuss briefly how informed consent is perceived within health care research, before moving on to describe how we negotiated access to participants and introduced our study.</p>
<p>Informed consent is “a procedure widely agreed to safeguard the rights of human subjects to know that research is being conducted and to approve their own participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312460765">Homan, 1991</xref>, p. 2). In the context of health- and social care research, ethics of data collection are often focused on disabled or vulnerable participants; for example, how to secure informed consent of hospital patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312460765">Booth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312460765">Knox, Mok, &amp; Parmenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312460765">Ramcharan &amp; Cutcliffe, 2002</xref>). The position of medical professionals within a study attracts less attention because they are construed as powerful and by definition able to make “rational informed choices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312460765">Halse &amp; Honey, 2005</xref>, p. 2146); after all, these are the professionals who should strive to secure informed patient consent prior to medical procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312460765">Brown, Butow, Butt, Moore, &amp; Tattersall, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Because “research ethics is deeply embedded and implicated in the social context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312460765">Halse &amp; Honey, 2005</xref>, p. 2149), it is beneficial in the early stages of a study to construct an understanding of the particular organization in question. How are research projects perceived in the participating units and departments? Perhaps staff have been exhausted with numerous studies, or there might be an organizational restructure taking place that could affect the research outcomes. This situation becomes clear only after the researchers have negotiated entry and spent some time in the field. Thus, exposure to the field informs the researchers on the context-specific ethical considerations. This kind of information cannot be foreseen per se, but could be disclosed in the research proposal and discussed with the ethics review board as one of the initial stages of the investigation.</p>
<p>Public service ethics can be “very broad” and “often ambiguous,” shaped by circumstances including the political and social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312460765">Kyarimpa &amp; Garcia-Zamor, 2006</xref>, pp. 31-32). Kyarimpa and Garcia-Zamor noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n most public service organizations, patterns of basic assumptions predetermine and even control [the] behaviors, thinking, performance, and decision making of individual members. These basic assumptions can take the form of values, beliefs, symbols, customs and rituals—thus constituting organizational culture that guides the performance of organizational members. (p. 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It can therefore be challenging to remain within a rigid framework of ethics when conducting research with participants who represent such a shifting organization as the NHS. Researchers conducting qualitative studies face specific and situated ethical dilemmas, and at each stage of the research process, researchers work through a variety of complications, searching for less-harmful alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312460765">Burgess, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312460765">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312460765">Lincoln &amp; Denzin, 2000</xref>). In the following section we describe and elaborate on two aspects within our study that became ethically important when we negotiated access to participants and sought to enhance informed consent, namely, educational seminars and managing challenges in the field.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312460765">
<title>Introducing the Research Project to Participants</title>
<p>Even though consent needs to be reestablished on a regular basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312460765">Ramcharan &amp; Cutcliffe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312460765">Sin, 2005</xref>), the initial presentation of a study has an elementary role in recruiting participants and establishing a research relationship. The talk that introduces a study can be viewed as an “active, consequential part of the interviewing process . . . such talk clearly provides precedence and direction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312460765">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 1995</xref>, p. 41). In our study, this introduction comprised three preplanned educational seminars that we organized for the prospective participants. During these seminars, we encouraged the potential participants to ask questions and to give feedback about the project, thereby making the purpose of the study and the intended proceedings transparent and open to challenge.</p>
<p>We organized two staff seminars at a maternity unit in Trust One. In the first seminar we gave a presentation about our project, after which the audience asked questions and made comments on the organizational climate survey. In the second session in Trust One, we gave a lecture about theories of leadership and focus group methodology, and gave participants time to ask questions and to take part in a focus group discussion. In Trust Two, we introduced the project to three gatekeepers in a formal meeting, after which they took us on a walking tour of the hospital site and introduced us to other health professionals. In Trust Three, we organized an educational seminar to a mixed group of health professionals, and gave a presentation of leadership theories and the project, with an emphasis on ethnographical methodology. These seminars provided us with a robust start to data collection at each site, but also introduced an unexpected ethical problem in that they were not inclusive of all professions working in each unit. We therefore had to launch additional negotiations to gain gatekeeper approval and access to the excluded groups.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312460765">
<title>Trust One: Two Seminars in an Obstetrics and Gynecology Department</title>
<p>Following approval by an REC, our team of seven— comprising two professors, three senior members of staff, and two research assistants—arranged for a meeting at a participating hospital. The gatekeepers had allocated 3 hours for us to give a presentation and to pilot our survey. During the gathering, two members of the research team (Franklin and Rowland) took observational notes and recorded part of the session, with the knowledge and agreement of all participants; we later transcribed the dialogue verbatim. For the first seminar, the group comprised 15 to 20 junior doctors, registrars, and consultants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1049732312460765">5</xref></sup> The proceedings included a presentation on recent academic literature on leadership, given by the chief investigator of the project (Nicolson); a case study for discussion, presented by a senior member of the team; and a pilot of the survey, which received some correction suggestions from the participants. After the meeting, the participants were provided with the REC-approved participant information sheet about the project, a consent form, and a researcher’s business card. Some individuals agreed to participate and scheduled an interview time on the spot.</p>
<p>This initial contact with a number of staff members proved to be an efficient way to recruit participants and to enhance informed consent. Indeed, 7 people from this group participated in an interview, and 6 in a focus group. However, we realized only later the limitations of this recruitment process. Although the main gatekeeper, with whom we had negotiated the practicalities, had given us the impression that this was an inclusive seminar open to all staff members of the unit, this was not actually the case. Generally, it was only managers and senior clinicians who had been able to take the time out of clinical practice to attend these presentations, and we discovered that nursing staff and midwives were routinely left out. Rather than viewing the access negotiations as a hindrance to the study, we considered the process of recruiting participants as actual data. It was these situations that clarified to us, for example, how this particular organization functioned, how it related to the external environment, and how it attempted to integrate nonmembers into its own way of looking at and interpreting the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312460765">Pearson, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The second seminar in Trust One’s maternity unit was very different in nature, and involved a smaller group of participants meeting in a more intimate space. The group comprised six junior doctors (three women, three men) and the gatekeeper consultant who had arranged for the first educational seminar. Attendance at the seminar had been prearranged, because it was structured as part of the junior doctors’ education. Within this meeting a senior member of our research team gave a presentation on leadership approaches, followed by a discussion, after which another team member conducted a focus group. Some of the participants did not wish for an audio recorder to be used, so during the session two researchers (Franklin and Rowland) took observational notes that were subsequently subjected to rigorous discussion, including comparisons of how the team members had made sense of the proceedings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1049732312460765">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Initially, the consultant dominated the responses in this focus group, but gradually the junior doctors became more involved, with one of them presenting a contrary opinion to that of the supervisor. An interesting situation emerged when the consultant, after the presentation and discussions, decided to attend the focus group, but attempted to get the facilitator to complete the focus group prematurely because he had to leave. The consultant eventually agreed that the group of junior doctors could continue without his presence. This was a prime example of a gatekeeper’s power and ethics-as-substance:
<disp-quote>
<p>For clinicians, ethics designates a resource to be called on while doing daily, shop-floor work, as well as a system of accountability for this work. . . . This ethics-as-substance can bring necessary safeguards to clinical work and improve some people’s lives—it is often better than no ethics at all—but imagining ethics this way limits the scope of being ethical. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312460765">Frank, 2004</xref>, p. 355)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whether or not the consultant was protecting his juniors from the researchers—or the unit leaders, including himself—from the prospect of receiving criticism, he was not empowered to give consent on behalf of the rest of the group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1049732312460765">7</xref></sup> This incident highlighted to us how ethical decisions cannot always wait for a committee to gather and make a recommendation. Fieldwork requires good project management and researchers’ personal evaluations of each incident. For example: Were we causing harm? Should we have discontinued data gathering? What did the act of a senior staff member giving consent on behalf of his junior colleagues tell us about the culture, and how should we have responded to the situation? The proceedings of this educational seminar clearly demonstrated how gatekeeper power can extend beyond access negotiations and into data collection. Because we had already negotiated access to participants and introduced the study in Trust One, we were confident in approaching Trust Two, hoping that a similar style of presenting our research to prospective participants could be replicated. However, we quickly realized there was no single template for negotiating access with gatekeepers or informing participants. Therefore, each approach had to be tailored to each trust, department, and professional group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312460765">
<title>Trust Two: Formal Meeting and Walking Tour at Hospital A</title>
<p>Trust Two occupies Site A and Site B. The first formal meeting was conducted by three gatekeepers—a senior nurse, a medical director, and a director of emergency services—and attended by three members of our research team—the chief investigator (Nicolson), a senior team member, and two researchers (Fox and Rowland). The meeting was recorded on tape and later transcribed verbatim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1049732312460765">8</xref></sup> In the meeting, Nicolson gave a presentation, which introduced the research team, gave an overview of the project, and outlined the research methods. After the presentation, all three gatekeepers expressed their interest in the project and formally granted permission for the research to be conducted at the hospital. They also discussed the perceived value that they felt the research would generate on a personal level and to the trust more broadly, suggesting that they had their own agenda for approving the research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1049732312460765">9</xref></sup> Although the participants had openly expressed their personal interest to the researchers, the previous experience of situations in which some groups had been excluded from the project because of gatekeeper actions alerted us to hidden agendas. These gatekeepers could have had an impact on access to, or been able to coerce, certain participant groups, which would have had a negative influence on informed consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312460765">Morrill, Buller, Buller, &amp; Larkey, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312460765">
<title>Walking Tour</title>
<p>After the meeting, the senior nurse and medical director led the research team on a walking tour of Site A. We also recorded and transcribed verbatim the conversation during this tour. During the tour, the gatekeepers introduced the research team to key health professionals and managers, including consultants, physicians, matrons, and general managers, all of whom granted permission for the researchers to contact them. Although we were able to access a great number of participants through the walking tour, we had only been introduced to the most senior members of the department. This meant that the more junior potential research participants had not initially been informed about the research. We did not have a direct access to them, which meant that senior health professionals had to assist by arranging meetings with their chosen junior professionals, which could potentially have been interpreted as participant coercion. This was another practical example how ethics-as-process works. By being aware of the excluded groups, we were able to plan more effective project management, and thus increase the inclusiveness and ethical standard of the study.</p>
<p>A similar communication weakness arose at Site B. Although the consultants and doctors had been informed of the project details through meetings, the nursing team had been absent from these meetings and the information had not been adequately passed on. When the researchers approached the nurses to take part in the research, they expressed anger at not being informed about the project and claimed that decisions had been made on their behalf by the consultants and the management team. This matter had to be resolved as quickly as possible, so we arranged an additional presentation through one of our nursing contacts. The presentation was conducted by two researchers (Fox and Rowland) to a group of 15 to 20 senior nurses during their training session. The presentation allowed the nurses to gain a sense of involvement, and allowed them to provide their full informed consent to participate in the study. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312460765">Young et al. (2010)</xref> noted, in seeking informed consent, it is highly important to “promote communication that establishes all participants as co-agents” (p. 629). In Trust Two, the power of gatekeepers created particular communication dilemmas for the research team, resulting in our having to engage in complex renegotiations to gain access to participants. The accumulation of organizational insights also clearly enhanced our sensitivity to ethical issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312460765">
<title>Trust Three: Shadowing and Accidental Participants</title>
<p>In Trust Three, a new ethical issue emerged, this time not involving gatekeepers, but what we have termed <italic>accidental participants</italic>. The introduction of the study began in Trust Three as an educational seminar, organized by one of the Trust’s gatekeepers, a medical director. The presentation was conducted by the chief investigator (Nicolson) and a researcher (Rowland), and attended by health professionals of various grades, including consultants, doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and physiotherapists. Unlike the meeting in Trust One, this group seemed to operate as a cohesive and supportive team, and gave off no sense of coercion surrounding informed consent.</p>
<p>The presentation was informal, and the health professionals asked questions and made comments throughout, suggesting their engagement with the project. From the presentation, two consultants agreed to take part in ethnographic shadowing. At the time of shadowing the consultants, we had no fresh ethical concerns because the health professionals had fully consented to participate in the research. Instead, we were faced with a situation in which we had to make a decision on how to secure the informed consent of accidental participants. Such participants were defined as patients, other health professionals, and anybody who happened to be in the same room and was interacting with the fully consenting health professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312460765">Mulhall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312460765">Wiles et al., 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1049732312460765">10</xref></sup> The researchers discussed this ethical dilemma with the chief investigator and among the research team, and it was agreed that the health professional(s) being shadowed or observed would provide full informed verbal and written consent, whereas accidental participants would provide (when possible) informed verbal consent.</p>
<p>The patients and health professionals with whom the consented health professionals interacted gave their verbal consent for the research to continue in their presence, following introductions made by the observed health professional. However, explaining the research to accidental participants—especially patients—in a way that was meaningful to them was particularly difficult, because of time restrictions and the nature of the encounter itself. This raised questions about whether their consent was truly informed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312460765">Mulhall, 2003</xref>). One researcher (Rowland) was also concerned that patients might have felt coerced into consenting because of the presence of and the introduction by the health professional treating them. This situation demonstrated how researchers must make ethical decisions in the field, and take responsibility for those judgments. In discussing the complex ethical implications in an ethnographic study taking place in a health care setting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312460765">McGibbon, Peter, and Gallop (2010)</xref> emphasized the importance of obtaining consent from patients, even though the study was being conducted on the staff members. This includes ensuring that patients are aware of their right to refuse to allow their medical professionals to be under observation while they work.</p>
<p>In our study, some accidental participants declined consent, indicating that they understood that their participation in the research was voluntary, and that it had no bearing on their medical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312460765">Cassell &amp; Young, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312460765">Masson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312460765">Morrow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312460765">Stalker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312460765">Wiles et al., 2004</xref>). On these occasions the researcher did not take ethnographic notes, respecting the wishes of the accidental participants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we focused on exploring the ethical challenges in negotiating access to participants and seeking their informed consent within a qualitative study on leadership and patient care in three hospital trusts. We discussed the role of research ethics committees, suggesting that for these regulatory bodies to become meaningful to qualitative researchers, we need to develop a common understanding of what can be expected from a qualitative research proposal. In addition, we suggested that RECs could play an important role in forming an evidence-based ethics “library” for qualitative health research. We also illustrated how informed consent can become biased through participant coercion, and in relation to this, we discussed the importance of good research management in the field. In our study, the process of accessing participants transformed from the anticipated straightforward issue of contacting staff members via email into a series of educational seminars at hospital wards. These seminars provided valuable data about each organization, but also caused friction and raised the doubts of excluded participants about the research team.</p>
<p>We faced many ethical challenges in the field, and limited potential harm by employing effective communication between the team members and the participants. It was fundamentally important that we developed sensitivity toward the organizations, so that we were able to seek the inclusion of different stakeholder groups and subgroups. During the 3-year project, it became apparent, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312460765">Wiles et al. (2004)</xref>, that we, as social researchers, had to balance a number of factors in managing access and informed consent. This included legal frameworks and regulation, as well as a range of competing interests, such as the personal interests of gatekeepers. The aims of our study became challenged in educational seminars, and the elusive “best interests of research participants” (Wiles et al., p. 11) became contested in the case of accidental participants.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have described some of the ethical dilemmas our research team faced during a 3-year project studying leadership and patient care in three NHS hospital trusts. We began with a discussion on the role of research ethics committees in evaluating a qualitative project, because they represent the formal body of ethical approval, and because emphasizing ethics as a static collection of standards is in stark contrast to our experience of ethics as process. To change the perceived role that RECs occupy today—namely, as a disciplining committee of positivist school of thought—we recommend open communication: Qualitative researchers need to educate their audience through the presentation of a proposal that is “true to their research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312460765">Ells, 2011</xref>, p. 886). For example, instead of having to use hypotheses or projected aspirations for data collection (number of participants, interviews, focus groups, and observations), RECs could ask researchers to describe a situation or briefly introduce a case study. This approach would be more in line with the inductive approach.</p>
<p>Our main aim was to discuss ethics as process on two levels: for qualitative research in general and, more specifically, within the health care setting. However, some of the findings could be valuable in other areas of research. The introduction of the project through staff seminars proved to be an effective method of communication, although we would like to emphasize the importance of careful management of these occasions. Also, lessons learned from the study included the acknowledgment of gatekeepers’ power when it comes to accessing participants in health care settings. This is worth noting, for example, when recruiting patients for clinical epidemiological studies.</p>
<p>Based on our findings in the field, we argue that because of power differences between gatekeepers and networks in complex organizations such as the NHS, some (occupational) groups inevitably become construed as vulnerable in ethical terms. Our multimethod, multisite project required constant negotiations of access and participant recruitment, as well as ensuring that we distributed information as widely and openly as possible. Thus, we advise ensuring the inclusiveness of all stakeholders in any preparatory meetings and seminars, and maintaining active communication with all participants and team members throughout a project.</p>

<p>Researchers informed the chief investigator (Nicolson) about any scheduled meetings at hospitals and disclosed (verbally or in email messages) descriptions of events in the following days. Data transcripts and field notes were circulated among the team, allowing all members to provide feedback and advice regarding, for example, the refinement of data-collection tools. Researchers also shared an office, which enabled easy comparison of notes and experiences, and the planning of activities. Discussing difficult situations, such as a researcher being prevented from conducting an agreed-on focus group and being dismissed from the room by a senior clinician, or the anger expressed toward the project by excluded staff groups, became an important part of communication within the team.</p>

<p>A similar incident took place with a nurses’ focus group, when some of the participants disclosed that they did not have any prior information about the study; they had been instructed by their managers to participate. These highly dubious actions came close to “proxy consent,” which is sometimes used in research with “vulnerable” groups who are viewed as lacking the capability or “competence” to understand what participating in a study involves, and so are unable to provide their own informed consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312460765">Wiles et al. 2004</xref>, p. 18).</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1049732312460765">
<label>10.</label>
<p>Researchers who observe health professionals in relation to their patients face similar dilemmas as researchers who carry out studies of teachers being observed in classrooms. Ideally, informed consent should also be obtained from students, because a teacher’s behavior cannot be observed independently of students’ reactions. However, there is a difference in the organizational context, which limited the ability to foresee the situation in hospitals. Pupils are permanent fixtures in a classroom, whereas the participants of our study were truly accidental in the respect that their presence often could not be predicted (e.g., in the case of orderlies and physiotherapists), and in the case of patients, a continual variable.</p>
