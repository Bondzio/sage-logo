<abstract>
<p>Muslim religiosity and South Asian ethnicities are at times experienced as rival forms of affiliation, especially for the second generation born and brought up in the West. In this article, I investigate the role of ‘roots visits’ to Bangladesh and pilgrimages to Mecca in shaping ethnic/religious affiliations of young second generation Bengalis in London's East End. Building on Glick Schiller (2004), I argue that Bengali translocal ways of being (travel to Bangladesh) have become untethered from Bengali translocal ways of belonging (self-identifications), due in part to the more critical stance on Bengali culture propagated by deculturated Islamic institutions in the East End and to young people's perceptions of their social class difference from Bangladeshi locals. While second generation youth who travel to Bangladesh tend to express a distancing from their ‘roots,’ those who travel on <italic>hajj</italic> or <italic>umra</italic> find that this bolsters their sense of rootedness in translocal Muslim belonging.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468796813483731" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The documentary film <italic>Every Marriage Begins with Tears</italic> follows two East London-born sisters who remain connected to the village of their Bengali parents like it is second nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468796813483731">1</xref></sup> Hushnara is known as the dutiful sister while Shahanara is the more freewheeling one. At around age 20, they face the prospect of arranged marriages in Bangladesh and both agree. Yet, as the narrative unfolds, each sister in her own way becomes increasingly ill at ease with the ‘Bengali’ expectations on her behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468796813483731">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468796813483731">Glick Schiller (2004)</xref> has made the helpful distinction between ‘transnational ways of being’ and ‘transnational ways of belonging.’ Transnational ways of being are ‘actual social relations and practices’ as people, gifts, money, goods, and information move across borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796813483731">Levitt and Glick Schiller, 2004</xref>: 1010). The existence of such ways of being constitutes a central insight in the study of transnationalism: that contemporary lives are not lived in discrete ‘containers’ of one nation-state or another, but instead people maintain various long-term ties that cross or transcend national boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468796813483731">Wimmer and Glick Schiller, 2003</xref>). Transnational ways of belonging, in comparison, are self-identifications. They are instances in which a person will ‘signal or enact an identity which demonstrates a conscious connection to a particular group’ not bounded by the nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796813483731">Levitt and Glick Schiller, 2004</xref>: 1010). These two aspects of transnationalism do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. Indeed, Shahanara and Hushnara's sense of Bengali belonging seems to have been tested by arranged marriage, a putatively Bengali transnational way of being.</p>
<p>This article investigates the relationship between transnational ways of being and belonging for second generation Bengali young adults in the East End of London who have taken short trips abroad to Bangladesh or to Mecca. Specifically, I am interested in how and to what extent ethnic and/or religious transnational ways of being (manifest in short-term visits) are related to concomitant ways of belonging (signalled by youths’ discursive representations of themselves) within the domain of everyday life. I argue that youth perceive their short-term visits abroad through the lens of everyday life in East London, and that certain aspects of this daily context are experienced as chronically unequal and as a place in which religion and culture clash. When youth travel to Bangladesh and witness further disparities and conflicts with religion, these tend to only distance them from a sense of Bengali belonging. In contrast, these young people find the radically equalising performance of <italic>hajj</italic> or <italic>umra</italic> Islamic pilgrimage extremely attractive. Taking part in pilgrimage tends to reinforce, or in some cases substantially increase, their everyday commitments to Islamic transnational ways of belonging, often at the expense of Bengali ethnic belonging.</p>
<p>In the next section of this article, I review key studies of roots visits taken by the British South Asian second generation to the ‘homeland,’ setting this alongside recent work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468796813483731">McLoughlin (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468796813483731">2009b</xref>), which shows that Islamic pilgrimage can also be viewed as a journey ‘home.’ I then describe the research methods of original interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in East London. Building from this I provide an analysis of how second generation youth perceive their journeys to Bangladesh and follow this with a complementary analysis of journeys to Mecca, explaining how these kinds of travel divergently influence transnational ways of belonging. The article ends with a conclusion that summarises the main arguments and draws implications for research on translocal religion and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Before going further, however, a brief note on terminology is warranted. I will tend to use the word ‘translocal’ in preference over ‘transnational’ because connections abroad from East London are generally to particular localities (the villages of Sylhet; Mecca) rather than to nations (Bangladesh; Saudi Arabia). Second generation young people's travel experiences are highly localised and dependent on their families’ plans. While many ‘transnational’ theorists and researchers have long been more interested in the local (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468796813483731">Wimmer, 2004</xref>) or in various levels of scale (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468796813483731">Levitt, 2004</xref>), and not strictly in overcoming the ‘national’ frame of reference, the recent theoretical repositioning of translocalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468796813483731">Brickell and Datta, 2011</xref>) brings semantic clarity to our understanding of the East End.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468796813483731"><title>British South Asian roots visits and pilgrimages</title>
<p>Most previous research on British South Asian visits to the Indian subcontinent has focused on Pakistanis, particularly those from Mirpur. Shaw (1994) describes how first generation Pakistani parents in Oxford who desire greater daily continuity in family life and traditions send their children to Mirpur for a ‘top up’ of Pakistani culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468796813483731">Mason (2004)</xref> writes about first and second generation Pakistanis who take trips to the homeland for various reasons. She observes that (423): ‘Almost all of our interviewees were enthusiastic about visits to Pakistan, whatever their age or generational position. Visits were something to be planned with relish, looked forward to, and remembered fondly (for the most part) until the next time.’ Mason finds that the second generation saw visits as a way of gaining agency in their self-identification, claiming Pakistan as ‘theirs’ (428).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468796813483731">Kalra and McLoughlin's (1999</xref>) research on Pakistani ‘roots visits’ to Mirpur takes a more critical view, emphasising their discrepant narratives and the often touristic and consumeristic nature of the experiences. Similarly, Bolognani (forthcoming) finds that second generation Pakistanis (age 18 to 34) visiting Mirpur regard their trips as holidays for ‘chilling out’ in which they often have little in common with locals. The young second generation engage in a kind of ‘re-bordering’ from Pakistan on these visits, considering Mirpur ‘to be less and less a site of ‘belonging’ and more a site of ‘possession’ or potential exploitation’ (14).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468796813483731">Mand's (2010</xref>) research is a rare example of work on second generation Bengali visits to the country of origin, focusing on children aged 9 to 10. Mand finds that these children consider both London and Sylhet to be ‘home’ and that they have difficulty disentangling the two. Children tend to recount their experiences in Sylhet from the perspective of the large houses their families have built (‘it's got like 24 rooms,’ 280). In this respect, children are both witnesses and participants in the reproduction of the privilege of their Londoni families.</p>
<p>As valuable as studies of South Asian roots visits have been, they do not adequately address how second generation overseas travel may relate to negotiations and contestations over Islamic religious belonging. A somewhat different literature, on religious pilgrimage, may be more helpful in this respect. The fifth pillar of Islam is <italic>hajj</italic>, a self-financed journey to the Islamic holy land in Mecca (and usually also to Medina) to take part in collective Islamic rituals that mirror the experiences of the Prophet. <italic>Hajj</italic> must be accomplished in the 8<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup> days of the final month in the Islamic lunar calendar, and is considered obligatory for Muslims who are physically and financially able to accomplish it. A shorter pilgrimage known as <italic>umra</italic>, at any time of year, is less grueling and more commonly taken. Each year approximately 25,000 British Muslims take part in <italic>hajj</italic> and 100,000 in <italic>umra</italic> (Association of British Hujjaj).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468796813483731">McLoughlin's (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468796813483731">2009b</xref>) research with Pakistani returnees from <italic>hajj</italic> is beginning to shed light how pilgrimage may influence British Muslim ways of belonging. McLoughlin's team interviewed eighteen returning Pakistani <italic>hajjis</italic>, aged from their teens to seventies, who were living in Lancashire mill towns. In interviews focused on the pilgrimage experience, they found that the <italic>hajjis</italic> described overpowering emotions including an ‘oceanic feeling of oneness and collective effervescence’ (2009b: 9). The pilgrims also acknowledged some tensions with the intermingling of the sacred and profane during <italic>hajj</italic>, due to the commercialisation of Mecca with souvenir shops and food outlets. However, even despite this ‘[a]ll pilgrims experienced something of the liminality of ritual separation from <italic>dunya</italic> [the corruption of the world] in the Holy Places, affirming intensified consciousness of Allah and being Muslim’ (2009a: 27). Importantly, this heightened Muslim ‘consciousness’ was related to a sense of homecoming, because ‘British-Pakistanis describe pilgrimage … as a return to the sacred homeland of all (monotheistic) humanity’ (2009a: 27). In this respect, travel to South Asia and to Mecca might equally be perceived as journeys to one's ‘roots’ or ‘home.’</p>
<p>While previous studies of South Asian roots visits and <italic>hajj</italic> journeys have been valuable in and of themselves, most provide less leverage for understanding how these travels influence everyday life. McLoughlin's <italic>hajjis</italic> attested to a heightened sense of Muslim consciousness, but whether this was merely fleeting or was later sustained in Lancashire is unexplored. Likewise, the wide range of ages and backgrounds of McLoughlin's interviewees makes it difficult to contextualise their <italic>hajj</italic> journeys within wider life experience, and the analysis remains at an abstract level. In this article I build from McLoughlin's insightful and significant precedent of empirical research on accounts of Islamic pilgrimage, bringing this to bear on how these journeys tangibly affect and are affected by everyday life. By pairing <italic>hajj</italic> and <italic>umra</italic> experiences with roots visits to Bangladesh, I am able to provide a more comprehensive and comparative account of the young second generation's travel experiences and their concurrent negotiations of translocal ways of belonging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468796813483731"><title>Research methods</title>
<p>The research for this article is part of a larger study of the role of religion in the civic engagement of second generation ‘emerging adults,’ age 18–25.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468796813483731">3</xref></sup> The full study included ethnographic observation and interviews with second generation young adults in Tower Hamlets as well as in Brixton. For the Tower Hamlets (i.e. East End) component, young people were systematically recruited from various streets, institutions, and public places in the Tower Hamlets wards of Spitalfields, Whitechapel, and Shadwell. To be eligible for the study, these young people confirmed that they were 18 to 25 and born in the Britain to at least one parent from Bangladesh.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468796813483731">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 36 resulting interviews with Tower Hamlets youth were semi-structured and usually took between 1 and 1.5 hours. The first third of the interview included a section on transnationalism, in which I asked questions about if youth had visited Bangladesh (32 had), the nature of their visits and other contacts/connections there, if they would ever consider living in Bangladesh, their languages spoken, and how they would describe ‘Bengali culture.’ A later section of the interview involved the choice and ranking of many possible self-identifications such as ‘Bengali,’ ‘Sylheti,’ and ‘Londoner,’ allowing for the elaboration of the cultural issues raised earlier. Although there was an extensive interview section on religion and Islamic practices, no questions were included about visits to Saudi Arabia for Islamic pilgrimage. Therefore <italic>hajj</italic> and <italic>umra</italic> visits were only discussed in interviews when young people brought them up. The findings on Islamic pilgrimage in this article are based on incomplete data from the six interviewees who spoke about having engaged in this, with the actual phenomenon likely to be more widespread and significant than I am able to trace here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468796813483731"><title>The everyday East End context</title>
<p>The daily rhythms of life for East End Bengali second generation youth are punctuated by family and kinship commitments alongside schooling or vocation and, for many, five daily Islamic prayers. Tower Hamlets has the largest concentration of Bangladeshis in the UK. Bangladeshis account for about half or more of the population in wards at the ‘heartland’ of settlement near Brick Lane and Whitechapel Road where this study was conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468796813483731">Eade (2010: 15)</xref> writes of Bengalis in Tower Hamlets as forming ‘a highly encapsulated community’ in which ‘[e]veryday life is still dominated by ethnic ties and the need to survive within an extremely diverse global city.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468796813483731">5</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796813483731">Gardner (1993)</xref> has shown, through these ethnic ties to Bangladesh translocal ways of being are maintained and power and privilege are reproduced. Gardner describes the twin worlds of <italic>desh</italic> (home in Sylhet) and <italic>bidesh</italic> (away, East London in this case) as closely and inequitably intertwined. Bengali youth in Tower Hamlets typically live in crowded conditions with their families in one of the most deprived boroughs in the UK. Yet relative incomes are dramatically higher than in Bangladesh, providing their parents and relatives with opportunities to build wealth and investment. In the Sylheti language, <italic>London</italic> has come to represent Britain as a whole and <italic>Londoni</italic> those who live in or maintain links there. Londonis’ tremendous earning power enables them to gradually transform their villages via remittances, gifts, and the purchase of land and mansions. Yet, Gardner notes, ‘as time goes by and fewer and fewer Londonis have actually been born in Bangladesh, such relationships are bound to change’ (2008: 492).</p>
<p>Research in Tower Hamlets indicates that relationships are indeed changing as daily contact with the <italic>desh</italic> becomes more limited, particularly in the second generation and beyond. Young people brought up in inner city London have different cultural tastes, educational experiences, and life aspirations than their parents. The ‘encapsulated community’ in these respects can be stifling, especially for young women who, in everything from daily movements to future marriage partners, are more likely to find themselves restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468796813483731">Dench et al., 2006</xref>: 86–101). One young second generation woman I interviewed, Rubina,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468796813483731">6</xref></sup> spoke of her childhood as being ‘like a cocoon.’ She said: ‘I know how my mum brought me up. The neighbours were all Bengali. They had Islamic circles in the house, we had Bengali lessons and stuff like that. Our parents tried very hard to keep us away from things of western culture. Like even things that are allowed in Islam.’</p>
<p>Revivalist Islam has become increasingly attractive to East End second generation youth, often as an alternative source of translocal belonging. While the local Brick Lane Mosque follows a Barelwi style of Islam that is continuous with Bengali village practices such as venerating Muslim <italic>pirs</italic> (saints), the East London Mosque and related institutions have propagated a ‘new Islam’ that rejects such practices as idolatrous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468796813483731">Glynn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468796813483731">Kibria, 2008</xref>). This new religious system has been ‘deculturated’ by purging syncretistic influences of Bengali culture to leave a purportedly pure and timeless Islam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468796813483731">DeHanas, 2013</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468796813483731">Roy, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468796813483731">Eade and Garbin (2006)</xref> have documented struggles over articulations of Islam and culture in East End public space, involving key local actors from the East London Mosque, Brick Lane Mosque, and various translocally-connected secular and Islamist movements such as the Awami League, Nirmul Committee, Jamaat-e-Islami, and Islamic Forum of Europe (see also, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468796813483731">Keith, 2005</xref>: 145). The everyday allegiances of young Bengalis in the second and third generation are seen as a crucial battleground, with the East London Mosque and Darul Ummah Mosque, in particular, investing heavily in cutting edge in-house media, crime prevention, drug rehabilitation, and youth programmes to reach this generation. The deculturated Islam proffered by these mosques has given youth empowering arguments and social support to loosen the grip of parents in their everyday lives, especially on the issue of arranged marriage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468796813483731">7</xref></sup> As such, the terms of debate have shifted, allowing much more internal criticism of Bengali culture and enabling London-Sylhet translocal ways of being, which all second generation youth experience, to be untethered from Bengali translocal ways of belonging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468796813483731"><title>Holidays in Sylhet</title>
<p>Nearly all of the 36 youth I interviewed (with four exceptions) had visited Bangladesh at least once. The majority had travelled there three or more times. Although some stays were short, most lasted at least a month. In three cases stays that were intended to be medium-length had been substantially extended to last 9 months or more. An important characteristic of almost all visits to Bangladesh was that they were initiated and organised by parents, who retained control (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468796813483731">Mand, 2010</xref>). Parents arranged the trips for a variety of reasons such as weddings, funerals, or settling land disputes. Yet there was a surprising uniformity to how all of these were experienced by their children. The impressions of trips most often mentioned by second generation youth were of the large mansion-like houses built by their parents or relatives, the buzz of the social atmosphere, or the natural habitat of Bangladesh. Such impressions were expressed from the viewpoint of a sojourner rather than a direct stakeholder. As Bolognani (forthcoming) has noted, some words and phrases are ubiquitously used to describe visits, such as being ‘relaxing’ or a time for ‘chilling out.’ These phrases recurred in my interviews:<disp-quote>
<p>It's literally go there, meet my grandparents, meet my uncles, my aunties and just sort of communicate with them and just have a relaxing time more than anything else. (Jamil)</p>
<p>Bangladesh is like … is a place where you just go there to chill out, just a holiday basically. That's the only reason I'd go there. For about max probably a month, two months, that's it. (Amin)</p></disp-quote>While trips to Bangladesh are a welcome relief from London life, it is extremely rare for youth to seriously consider moving there. Salma told me that she had once contemplated moving to Bangladesh to attend medical school in Dhaka, where her parents own an apartment, rather than studying at Queen Mary University. But she made a point to clarify to me that ‘I wouldn't live there full time – it was only like, if there was a holiday I would come straight back here with my parents and whatnot.’ Indeed so many youth were at pains to confirm that they could not sustainably live in Bangladesh that they seemed to be reciting a ‘mantra of non-return.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468796813483731">8</xref></sup> Jamil was the only youth I met who expressed an interest in living in Bangladesh for the long-term, stating that ‘I’m planning to retire there.’ Yet in this case his motives seemed to be calculated and opportunistic as he described the rock-bottom property prices in Sylhet and spoke about also buying property in Bahrain or Dubai.</p>
<p>Londoni families’ experiences of social status in Sylhet and London are highly uneven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468796813483731">Gardner, 1993</xref>). Indeed the youth I interviewed often lived in very cramped government-subsidised housing in London while having what Sabina called a ‘massive house’ when visiting Sylhet. Sadiq told me that in his village he is ‘treated like a king – really, really well.’ This mismatch between being low-income in London and a ‘king’ in Sylhet can lead to uneasy class relations. For several youth this instilled a sense of disdain for the impoverishment of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>When I asked Shaynul, based on his visits ‘Did you feel like you saw something of yourself in Bangladesh?’ his answer was simply ‘No.’ He explained that the visits had only made him more aware of differences between London where ‘the government is stronger and they provide things for you’ and Bangladesh where ‘there are loads of people on the streets begging and it’s hard for them.’ He is one of many youth who find it difficult to relate to Bangladesh, and describe it as pitiable or ‘backwards.’ Salma mentioned that ‘the roads are terrible’ and many spoke of their difficulty coping with the insects and the heat. Samia and Masud had visited in 2004 during a major flood. Seeing the human toll of suffering, Masud said, made him ‘feel different.’ He remarked ‘I've got everything, yeah. There's people out there who don’t have any money they need. Even though I’ve got a free NHS if I’m ill, [they don’t].’</p>
<p>Not all comments on visits to Bangladesh were negative. Some youth were truly enamoured with the country when describing its natural beauty or particular elements of culture or relationships there. The most common enthusiastic comments about Sylhet were that it was a place to see many relatives, and that this created a vibrant social atmosphere. While Salma had been deeply critical of the religious and political climate in Bangladesh during our interview, she spoke fondly of the natural lifestyle there:<disp-quote>
<p>We would walk around with bare feet because it was nice, just all flat mud ground. I would watch women making rice from the little grains. We’d make a lot of food, handmade food, and dry it on the rooftops. It was all really natural and really, really different.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, some of the youth who felt warmest towards Bangladesh were those who had never been there. Fauzia was eagerly looking forward to her first trip. Zahera, age 25, had not yet visited and said for this reason she felt unsure in some ways of what it means to be Bengali, asking rhetorically ‘where's my manual?’</p>
<p>A young woman named Yasmin was easily the most positive about visits to Bangladesh. Her experience was an anomalous case and for this reason is worth recounting at some length.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1468796813483731">9</xref></sup> Yasmin's first and only visit to Bangladesh had been with her mother and sisters. It was through this visit that she realised her emotional connection with the country as ‘home’:<disp-quote>
<p>I was eleven when I went. We initially said we were going to stay there for six weeks, for the whole summer break, but it extended to six months. And that was purely because we didn’t want to come back. Myself, my two sisters and my mum, we were in a house, and going there and seeing my father’s grave, which is over there, and being in the village that my parents grew up in as husband and wife. That for me was a place that I needed to be at that particular time of my life. My sister felt exactly the same. I was eleven, one of my sisters was twelve and my other sister was eighteen. The gap is quite large between myself, my other sister, and the eighteen year old. But we had a common ground, which was ‘We’re home!’… It was really just seeing another life that was ours.</p></disp-quote>Although Yasmin was born and raised entirely in London, upon visiting Bangladesh she experienced ‘another life that was ours.’ Her close connection with her mother and her longing for her father may help to explain why Bangladesh resonated so deeply with her then. A sense of not fully fitting in among her peers in Tower Hamlets, as she would explain later, also played a part.</p>
<p>Yasmin identifies herself as a Muslim, but speaks of this in an interesting way. She told me: ‘Muslim is a part of my identity that I can't deny.’ Her response of ‘can't deny’ was much more passive than most of my interviewees, who spoke with an active enthusiasm about being Muslim. As we talked more, I learned that being Muslim is indeed significant to her, although not in the ways I was accustomed to hearing in the East End. Yasmin is a Sufi Muslim and says that Sufi spirituality has deep roots in her father's side, now actively maintained by her mother. She told me that in her view ‘the essence of Sufism is a spiritual sense, a perspective on how you see life … And that for me is something I've got and will always carry.’</p>
<p>As a young Sufi Muslim, Yasmin feels like something of an outsider from daily life in the East End. Unlike other interviewees, when asked about her five closest friends, Yasmin did not list any Bengalis, but instead mentioned a diverse set of friends she has met in university and through her vocation as a dance performance artist. She says that she tends to have a different view of religion and Bengali culture than most local young people: ‘Their perspective on the Bengali culture and their perspectives on religion are completely different [than mine] because there's a separation … In my mother's household we embrace the two, but in their household they divide the two.’ Yasmin's refusal to divide Bengali culture from Islam, an approach she says is at odds with other young people she knows, demonstrates that she is an exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p>Most second generation youth in the East End, as Yasmin described, are in some way influenced by a deculturated view of Islam in which culture and religion are perceived as being in conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468796813483731">DeHanas, 2013</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468796813483731">Bolognani and Mellor, 2012</xref>). Bengali culture does not emerge from this clash favourably. The words youth most commonly used to describe Bengali culture were ‘backward’ and ‘narrow-minded.’ Easily the most common critiques (from both young women and men) were levelled on issues of gender equality:<disp-quote>
<p>Within the culture of Bengali people there's a lot of expectations which clash with being a Muslim. And parents, they fail to realise that. They say ‘oh obviously you need to grow up, get married, this and that.’ But being a Muslim, it doesn't tell you that girls have no rights, girls cannot be independent. (Rupa)</p>
<p>Islamically we believe a woman can go to a mosque and gain knowledge, can be a part of the society, can be part of your community. In Bengaliness, no, you're not allowed, she just stays at home all day. (Masud)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Masud's comment that participation in society means ‘a women can go to a mosque and gain knowledge’ reveals much about everyday gender norms in the East End. Like many traditional mosques maintaining Bengali ways of being, the Sufi-infused Brick Lane Mosque is accessible to men alone. The East London Mosque, in contrast, is well known as a place where women can pray in the women's area and can become involved in various groups and activities. In late 2013 the mosque will complete a major expansion called the Maryam Centre, widening its already extensive programmes for women even further. While the mosque does maintain norms of gender segregation on its premises, this was seldom called into question by my interviewees. Instead they saw the East London Mosque as progressive on gender issues in comparison to traditional Bengali institutions. The East London Mosque has become emblematic of Islamic empowerment more broadly, and a foil against which allegedly ‘narrow-minded’ Bengali customs can be contrasted.</p>
<p>The everyday East End context, then, shapes how visits abroad to Bangladesh will be perceived. Particularly important to this are young people’s positions within the everyday translocal fields of struggle over culture and religion that are being waged by Bengali and Islamic institutions. Yasmin's family life and cultural positioning seems to have predisposed her for a positive ‘homecoming’ experience upon visiting Bangladesh. Memories of that childhood visit still remain with her in everyday life, inflecting her sense of Bengali identity and serving as a resource for her performances as a professional dance artist. While Yasmin is likely to represent some second generation youth whose Bengali ways of belonging are enlivened by roots visits to Bangladesh, she is nonetheless atypical. Rubina's critical remarks serve as a reminder of the sense of distance that most young visitors to Bangladesh feel:<disp-quote>
<p>You know it's very different [in Bangladesh]. I couldn't live there now … None of them [in my family] are educated. We're from, you know, quite a poor area. So you can't afford to go to school and they've got a very narrow-minded way of thinking.</p></disp-quote>The uneven class relations of <italic>desh-bidesh</italic> make it challenging for Rubina to relate to local villagers in ‘quite a poor area’ who have few opportunities for education. She also perceives in Bengali culture a ‘narrow-minded way of thinking.’ These two issues encapsulate the influence that visiting Bangladesh frequently has on second generation Bengali translocal ways of belonging: it creates a double sense of distance, of social class and culture.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1468796813483731"><title>Homecomings in Mecca</title>
<p>While visits to Bangladesh are routine for most second generation young people interviewed, visits to Saudi Arabia for Islamic pilgrimage are less frequent, if they have been taken at all. Frequency, however, does not determine the hold that <italic>hajj</italic> has on local imaginations. Sites of pilgrimage including the <italic>ka'aba</italic>, the Prophet's tomb in Medina, and Mount Arafat are continual topics of conversation. The popular Islam Channel broadcasts images of these holy sites every day. The <italic>masjid al-haram</italic> as a framed picture is nearly ubiquitous in Londoni businesses and family homes, and travel agencies specialising in <italic>hajj</italic> and <italic>umra</italic> travel seem to outnumber Bangladesh remittance services. Clothing styles have ‘Arabised’ over the past several years to include the black Saudi <italic>abaya</italic> for women and red and white chequered <italic>ghotra</italic> headgear for men. Even prayer, perhaps the most quotidian Muslim act, must face the <italic>ka’aba</italic> in Mecca precisely. Thus there are countless daily translocal ways that East London and Saudi Arabia are linked.</p>
<p>Actually setting foot in Mecca is a highly anticipated moment for the young people I interviewed. Sometimes small steps of faith lead up to the visit itself. Salma recalled going on <italic>umra</italic> pilgrimage when she was quite young. Her family had needed to apply to the pilgrimage visa lottery. ‘People say you will only go when Allah says it’s your time,’ she told me, ‘And then, you know, when we applied and we got our visas the first time I thought ‘It’s my destiny!’’</p>
<p>Much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468796813483731">McLoughlin's (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468796813483731">2009b</xref>) research on returning <italic>hajjis</italic>, I found that young people emphasised the experiential, emotional, and aesthetic dimensions of pilgrimage. A common motif was the indescribable feeling of praying shoulder to shoulder with thousands of co-believers. Masud related his emotions and senses:<disp-quote>
<p>But the best experience is during Ramadan. And when the imam prays, waving his hands up to God, everyone's crying, the imam is crying. It’s beautiful. Just you feel this … you feel this relationship between you and your Lord Almighty. It’s beautiful. Can’t describe it.</p></disp-quote>The aesthetic of Islamic pilgrimage extended beyond the <italic>masjid al-haram</italic>. In an interesting moment, Salma described the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as uniquely ‘beautiful’:<disp-quote>
<p>SALMA: It’s just the most beautiful place ever. It really is. I mean, I’ve been to South Africa twice and to Bangladesh, and I’ve been to Dubai as well. But Saudi Arabia was just beautiful!</p>
<p>DND: What do you mean by beautiful?</p>
<p>SALMA: It was just seeing … like how when its prayer time everyone will just leave the shops. They won’t even shut it, close it, lock it, or anything. I mean there’s just sort of a trust in everyone … It’s amazing to see how everyone comes together like that.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Salma was not referring to an inherent beauty of Saudi Arabian desert landscapes, but rather to the beautiful trust and unity between people. Even shopkeepers could safely abandon their goods to join with others for communal prayers. In Mecca young people like Salma caught sight of Islamic solidarity enacted in community at a large scale. Such an idealised vision of unity could only be hinted at in East London, even during the temporary rise in Islamic public activity during Ramadan.</p>
<p>The appeal of Islamic pilgrimage was not limited to the communal sense of trust and solidarity. A recurring theme was that on <italic>hajj</italic> and <italic>umra</italic> people were more equal:<disp-quote>
<p>[In Mecca] there is no difference between man and woman, there’s no difference between poor and rich – they’re a minister or they’re just a labourer driving a rickshaw or taxi driver. Everyone’s equal from the ground. Everyone. (Masud)</p>
<p>Everyone [in Mecca was] a community, there was no difference in anyone, I didn’t feel any different to the person standing next to me, even though they were a different colour to me, a different gender, I didn’t feel any different, whereas here, the person next to me is totally different to me, there everyone just feels united, cos we’re all there for the same purpose. (Rupa)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These words from young people betray their perceptions of the everyday class, gender, and ethnic inequalities in Tower Hamlets. Masud speaks of the difference between a (government) minister and a labourer being transcended in the equalising experience of pilgrimage. All pilgrims to Mecca, male and female and regardless of background, wear a white gown and circumambulate the <italic>ka’aba</italic> together. For Rupa, this sense of equality contrasted with her usual daily experience – whereas ‘here’ people are different, ‘there’ in Mecca ‘everyone just feels united.’ Youth may have perceived <italic>hajj</italic> and <italic>umra</italic> as a foretaste of how disparities and divisions that are mundanely familiar in Tower Hamlets would, in an eschatological future, finally be put right.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1468796813483731">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mecca and Medina are widely idealised in the East End as places where Islam is egalitarian and unadulterated, although this is not completely uncontested. In conversation, Fozrul<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1468796813483731">11</xref></sup> scathingly critiqued the formalised ethnic caste system in Saudi Arabia as being ‘un-Islamic.’ Most young people seemed blissfully unaware of the low standing that Bangladeshis have in the Saudi status hierarchy. This is to say nothing of the policing of public morality enforced by the Saudi state’s <italic>mutaween</italic> that maintains the moral order youth so cherish. A few young people did dispute the projected moral image of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but kept this separate from their impressions of the sacred sites within it. <italic>Hajj</italic> or <italic>umra</italic>, as a short-term participatory spectacle, was something youth found compelling on its own terms.</p>
<p>Although Islamic pilgrimage is a distinctly rare experience, several spoke about how it had led them to see themselves in new ways that have penetrated everyday life. As Rupa told me: ‘Even though I knew all about it [pilgrimage], I knew what Islam was about, just being there made me feel like a different person.’ In this case she was referring to her experience of the levelling of differences during pilgrimage, which had broadened her view of Islam and herself as a Muslim. This was not a ‘conversion’ so much as what another young woman, Rubina, called a ‘reaffirmed’ faith. Rubina grew up in a Muslim family, having been taught Islam by her parents and at Saturday Islamic school. She took an <italic>umra</italic> trip with her brother that she described as the first opportunity in which she had the space and independence to test Islam personally: ‘I saw it with my own eyes and I know what I felt in my heart. And I knew that it was complete peace. I reached that when I was there and, you know, it was enough for me.’ Rubina’s experience became a turning point in her personal dedication to the faith. She continues to look back to it as a reference point that has affected her daily practice of Islam: ‘I think [visiting Mecca is] why I’m a very strong Muslim.’</p>
<p>Salma also traces her re-discovery of Islam to her first pilgrimage. She told me that she had often skipped prayer times when she was growing up: ‘I would like sit in my room for about two minutes and then go back and be like, ‘yeah I’ve finished praying.’ But I didn’t.’ <italic>Umra</italic> had transformed for her the experience of prayer, from a skill she had learned to please her parents to a source of personal fulfilment. ‘After that I started praying more often,’ she said, ‘It just brings a sort of peace to you.’ According to Salma, the personal change she experienced at Mecca was far from unusual. Pilgrimage could itself lead to pitting Bangladesh and Mecca against each other, as she described in a story about her aunt and uncle:<disp-quote>
<p>My aunt, she went on pilgrimage and she went with her husband. Her husband wasn’t particularly religious but she wanted to prove to him and she said, ‘look I’m ready for this pilgrimage, if you don’t come I’m going to go with my brother.’ And then he said, ‘no I’ll come,’ and he went. And he came back and said, you know, ‘why am I going to go on holiday to Bangladesh when I can go to the Land of God all the time? Why am I going to go to Bangladesh?’ He’d changed. And it happens when people go there. They change so much, and you don’t expect it sometimes, but it happens.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, while Bengali second generation youth tend to regard their visits to Bangladesh as holidays, visits to Mecca have taken on the character of homecomings. The <italic>hajj</italic> or <italic>umra</italic> pilgrimage experience is compelling for these youth both because of its fulfilment of Islamic moral order and because the ethnic, gender, and class inequalities they have become accustomed to in Tower Hamlets are seemingly resolved in a single preternatural moment. The power of the Islamic pilgrimage experience is in how it continues to suffuse everyday life with memories of the <italic>ka’aba</italic> and a reaffirmed sense of translocal belonging in the global community of Muslims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468796813483731" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Short-term trips to Mecca and Bangladesh are, by nature, extraordinary. I have argued, however, that their significance can only be understood in relation to ordinary, everyday life. The everyday is the hermeneutical lens through which the second generation views and interprets their experiences abroad. London’s East End is translocally linked to Sylhet and Mecca in myriad day-to-day ways, from the reproduction of <italic>desh-bidesh</italic> relationships to the ubiquitous imagery of the <italic>ka’aba</italic> in homes and shops. Thus Bengali Muslim second generation youth who travel to Sylhet or Mecca for the first time will arrive with expectations that have been honed by ordinary life experience.</p>
<p>East End second generation youth on short-term visits to Bangladesh tend to undergo a distancing from Bengali belonging, while those who travel to Mecca find that their Muslim sense of belonging is powerfully reaffirmed. These changes may appear instantaneous, but they have actually been the product of a daily sedimentation of translocal influences. In this article I have drawn attention to the role of Islamic institutions in the East End in deculturating Islam by attenuating the ‘impure’ influences of Bengali culture. I have also emphasised the uneasy social class situation of Londonis, who experience relative deprivation by UK measures but prosperity compared to their neighbours in Bangladesh. Due to these continual aspects of their daily situation, second generation youth who visit Bangladesh find it difficult to relate to local Bengalis in terms of culture and social class, particularly on flashpoint issues such as arranged marriage. During the pilgrimage to Mecca, in contrast, youth glimpse a pristine Islamic moral order and a world in which divisions of class, gender, and ethnicity have all been momentarily transcended. They find this vision beautifully compelling. Through memory, social reinforcement, and facing the <italic>ka’aba</italic> each day in the practice of prayer, a single pilgrimage journey can become an everyday catalyst of Muslim translocal ways of belonging.</p>
<p>The idealised unity in diversity that young people experience on <italic>hajj</italic> and <italic>umra</italic> could be seen as a kind of ‘Islamic cosmopolitanism.’ Masud, who had visited Bangladesh during the great flood of 2004 and remarked on the poverty and suffering of Bengalis there, now felt ‘different’ in his relationship to the country. He had become very active in fundraising for Muslim Aid, a global humanitarian aid charity whose offices are headquartered in the London Muslim Centre and East London Mosque complex. In this way, Masud’s Islamic identity was providing a cosmopolitan source of belonging from which, rather than narrowly sending remittances to his country alone, he might give back to Bangladesh alongside Afghanistan, Somalia, Palestine, Pakistan, and many other places. Yet Islamic cosmopolitanism, for all its merits, has ironies as well. The young woman named Yasmin who passionately upheld a Bengali identity (which her peers might regard as ‘narrow’) was unique among my interviewees for having five closest friends who were not Bengali Muslims – two Jamaicans, a Nigerian, a Pakistani, and an Irish/Indian. In comparison, the five closest friends of young people who upheld a ‘cosmopolitan’ Islamic identity were in most cases (including Masud’s) Bengalis, and in nearly all cases Muslims. Islamic cosmopolitanism, then, seems to be upheld within what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468796813483731">Eade (2010)</xref> has called a ‘highly encapsulated community,’ although now more along the lines of Muslim affiliations rather than Bengali ones.</p>
<p>This article contributes to a significant and growing research literature on religion as a source of translocal ways of being and belonging (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468796813483731">Ebaugh and Chafetz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468796813483731">Levitt, 2007</xref>). Like the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468796813483731">Glick Schiller et al. (2006)</xref> it attempts to move beyond assumptions of the ‘ethnic lens’ to incorporate religion while also taking a critical stance on the broader implications of religious translocalism. Scholars including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468796813483731">Modood (2005</xref>) and Werbner (2006) have perceptively traced the relative decline of South Asian ethnic self-identifications to make way for a contemporaneous rise in Muslim identity politics. This article can help to deepen such accounts by calling attention to deculturation as a polemical means by which this change has been purposively accomplished.</p>
<p>The issues at stake are not all political, however. The positive subjective role of Islamic translocal ways of belonging in the daily lives of second generation youth should not be underestimated. In young people’s own accounts, Mecca is growing increasingly important over Bangladesh as a symbolic source of fulfilment, direction, and belonging. Quoting her uncle approvingly, Salma expresses the view that tends to prevail: ‘Why am I going to go on holiday to Bangladesh when I can go to the Land of God all the time?’ As more of these young people reach an age at which they organise and finance their own trips, journeys to Mecca may well be seen as more meaningful than holidays in Sylhet, and can be expected to account for a greater proportion of second generation ‘roots visits.’ Over the course of time, <italic>hajj</italic> will increasingly feel like home.</p>
