<p><italic>Aims</italic>: Use time trends in cause-specific middle-age death risk to study differences in mortality patterns among the Nordic countries. <italic>Methods</italic>: Middle-age (40–69 years) death risk and its decomposition into cause-specific death risks were computed. <italic>Results</italic>: In 1952, middle-age death risk was highest in Finland and lowest in Norway. For men, the death risk at the age of 40–69 years stagnated or increased during the first 20–30 years after 1950. From 1970–1980 until present time, there has been a strong decrease in male middle-age death risk. For women, there was a strong decreasing trend during the whole study period with the exception of Denmark. For 20 years from the late 1970s, the death risk at 40–69 years increased for Danish women followed by a sharp decrease from the mid-1990s. The main driver of the initial upward trend in men and downward trends in both men and women were changing death risks from circulatory disease. The upward trend in Danish women was driven by increased death risk from non-circulatory diseases that also gave an untoward trend in Danish men. Middle-age death risks converged after 1990 for Danish and Finnish men at a higher level than in the three other countries. In 2010, middle-age death risk in Finnish women, who had the highest level in 1952, converged with Norway, Sweden and Iceland at a risk much below Danish women. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Trends in risk and causes of middle-age death from 1951–2010 showed important variation among the five Nordic countries and between men and women.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) are small Northern European countries with population sizes ranging from 0.3 to 9.4 million. During the past half-century, these countries have evolved into modern Nordic welfare states characterized by high per-capita gross domestic product, universal health coverage, low levels of social inequality, increasing female participation in the workforce, extensive social security and unemployment benefits. Yet, men and women in these countries have experienced large differences in mortality patterns and life expectancy as has been noted also for other high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813491032">1</xref>]. We used cause-of-death data kept by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813491032">2</xref>] to analyse trends in middle-age mortality patterns from 1951 to 2010, and assess possible links to lifestyle and other secular trends in risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813491032">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813491032">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813491032">4</xref>]. Analyses were restricted to middle age (40–69 years) because this age span is likely to capture life style-associated premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813491032">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813491032"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813491032"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813491032">8</xref>]. Also multiple cause and data quality problems associated with determining underlying cause of death at older ages of death is a smaller problem in the 40–69-years age span.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494813491032" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Cause of death data reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) form the basis for this paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813491032">2</xref>]. We extracted data for Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data">www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data</ext-link>). For all five countries, data were available at least for the period 1952–2006. The probability of death from age 40 to 70 years (middle age), <italic><sub>30</sub>q<sub>40</sub></italic>, and the partitioning of this probability into cause-specific probabilities of middle-age death, was computed by multiple decrement life table methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813491032">9</xref>]. The number of deaths and population was available in 5-year age groups; <italic><sub>5</sub>a<sub>x</sub></italic> = 2.5, was used for computations for all age intervals (<italic>x</italic> = 40, 45, . . ., 65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813491032">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813491032">10</xref>]. We computed cause-specific middle-age death risks for deaths from cancer, from circulatory disease, other diseases, and accidents and violent deaths. We further computed estimates for several specific causes: cancers of the lung, stomach, breast, prostate, upper aero-digestive tract (UADT: lip, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and esophagus), ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, respiratory and digestive diseases including liver cirrhosis. Unknown and unspecified causes were redistributed proportionally to the specific cause groups for each year and for men and women separately. The classification of causes of death was done using the appropriate WHO ICD-7 to ICD-10 Mortality Tabulation Lists (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data">www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data</ext-link>). When recent data were missing in the WHO mortality database for Denmark 2007–2010 and Iceland 2010, total mortality, <italic><sub>30</sub>q<sub>40</sub></italic>, estimates were obtained from the Human mortality database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mortality.org">www.mortality.org</ext-link>) or Statistics Denmark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dst.dk">www.dst.dk</ext-link> for the year 2010). In this case of missing data, death risks for the four main cause groups (cancer, circulatory, other diseases, accidents and violence; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813491032">Table I</xref>) were computed from <italic><sub>30</sub>q<sub>40</sub></italic> as predicted by 10-year linear trends in cause-fractions, for men and women separately. Data extraction and computations were done with R (The R Project for Statistical Computing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Due to small-sample fluctuations, trends for Iceland were smoothed with the <italic>supsmu</italic> smoother available in R. Also, for Iceland, the 1951 data point for breast cancer was removed because of an implausible high level for this year only.</p>

<p>Additionally, we obtained times series data from OECD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oecd.org">www.oecd.org</ext-link>) on alcohol consumption and daily cigarette smoking (supplementary figures). There are comparability issues with these data and particularly the data on alcohol that were based on sales or production/import data are crude estimates of alcohol consumption. However, the data provide explanatory power when combined with the cause-of -death data.</p>

<title>Total middle-age death risk</title>
<p>In 1952 male middle-age death risk was much higher in Finland (49%) and around 30 % in the other 4 countries. Between 1952 and 1970, middle-age death risk increased in Norway, Denmark and Iceland whereas it remained relatively stable in Sweden and Finland. In 2010, Finland and Denmark had high male middle-age death risk (22-23 %) while Iceland, Sweden and Norway had low (14-17%). For women in 1952, Finland with a 31% middle-age death risk, and Norway and Iceland with 21%, constituted the extremes. Danish and Swedish women were placed in between. In 2010 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813491032">Table I</xref>) female middle-age death risks converged for Norway, Sweden and Finland to 9–11 % while it remained much higher for Denmark at 15%. We also investigated middle-age death risks by cause of death groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813491032">Table I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813491032">II</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813491032">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494813491032"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1403494813491032">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Middle-age death risks from circulatory disease</title>
<p>Male middle-age death risk from circulatory diseases showed an initial increase from 1950 to 1970 (except Sweden that remained relatively stable) that was followed by a steeper decline than was observed for all-cause death risk. The patterns were similar for Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden with death risks from circulatory diseases that converged to a narrow range from 5.0%–5.6% in 2006. These four countries contrasted with the Finnish men who remained at higher risk in 2006 of 8%. The time trends for middle-age death risks for cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease (IHD) were very different for men. The male death risks for IHD from 1952 to 1970 increased strongly for all countries except Finland where the increase was weaker. For Norway and Iceland, the IHD death risks more than doubled during this period. From 1970–2006, IHD deaths rates fell steeply in all countries. For stroke there was no upturn 1950–1970, but a more or less continuous decline in all five countries.</p>
<p>For women, the general pattern of circulatory middle-age death risk was of convergence and almost linear decline from 1952 to 2006, but Finland and Denmark had higher middle-age circulatory death risk in 2006 than the three other countries. This difference was mainly driven by higher risks of cerebrovascular deaths in Finland and Denmark.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494813491032">
<title>Cancer deaths</title>
<p>Middle-age death risk from all cancers combined showed much less variation than for circulatory diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813491032">Figure 1</xref>). Roughly, cancer death risk remained between 5% and 11 % for both men and women from 1952–2006, but with complex, and for some cancer sites opposing trends among the countries. For both Finnish men and women, there was a linear decrease throughout the period. For Danish men, the cancer death risk was higher in 2006 compared to 1952 while the decrease between 1952 and 2006 was very slight for both Swedish and Norwegian men.</p>
<p>Of mortality from specific cancers, lung cancer showed the most different and changing patterns over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494813491032">Figure 2</xref>). The earliest and most pronounced epidemic of middle-age lung cancer deaths was observed for Finnish men. It peaked around 1970 when the middle-age lung cancer death risk was 4.3%. The second largest male lung cancer epidemic was Danish, and peaked 15 years later, around 1985. The weakest male lung cancer epidemic was seen in Sweden. Middle-age lung cancer death risks were higher in Norway and Iceland, particularly after 1980. In all five Nordic countries, the male epidemic has subsided and risks were lower in 2006 compared to 1990.</p>
<p>This contrasted with the situation in women. The female middle-age lung cancer death risks were highest and flattened out in Denmark and Iceland after 1990. Norway followed with a similar flattening after 1995, but no decline has been observed. There was no sign of stagnation in Sweden or Finland that were the countries with the most moderate female lung cancer middle-age death risks. The contrast between Finnish men and women was noteworthy. Finland had the strongest and earliest middle-age lung cancer epidemic among men and the weakest and most recent epidemic among women.</p>
<p>Gastric cancer was the dominant malignant condition in men in all five Nordic countries in 1952. At that time, middle-age deaths risks from gastric cancer were particularly high in Iceland and Finland. Gastric cancer deaths in middle age showed strong and uniform decreasing and converging trends for both men and women from 1952 to 2006.</p>
<p>Deaths from colorectal cancer showed important variation with low risks for both men and women in Finland and Iceland, and highest, but decreasing middle-age death risks in Denmark. After 1980, Norway joined Denmark with high middle-age death risks from colorectal cancer for both men and women. After 1990, death risks were stable or decreasing in all countries for both sexes. An increase was observed in Norway from 1950 to 1990.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer showed a pattern very similar to colorectal cancer. The initial highest levels and a decreasing trend over time were observed in Denmark. The levels for Sweden and Finland converged at low levels, and for Denmark and Norway, a convergence was observed at higher levels.</p>
<p>Compared to the four other countries, Danish women had markedly higher middle-age death risk from breast cancer throughout the period from 1952 to 2006. It increased from 1952 to 1995, and has since decreased sharply. Norwegian and Swedish women had stable middle-age breast cancer death risks from 1952 to around 1990 and thereafter both countries experienced a decline. In 1952, Finnish women had the lowest death risk that since increased and reached the levels of Norway, Sweden and Iceland around 1995, and has shown a decline in recent years.</p>
<p>Death risks from upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) cancers were high in both Finnish and Icelandic men and women in 1952, and showed decreasing trends in these two countries until about 1990 in women and 1980 in men. Levels have been relatively stable at low levels since 1990 in both men and women for all countries except Denmark. For both Danish women and men, there has been a strong increasing trend in death risk from upper aero-digestive tract cancer.</p>

<title>Other diseases</title>
<p>Most pronounced for men, but also for women, in Denmark and Finland for the last 2–3 decades, there has been an increase in death risk due to diseases of the digestive system including liver cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1403494813491032">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813491032">Table II</xref>).

<title>Violent and accidental deaths</title>
<p>In middle age, death risks from accidents and violence are smaller than the other main cause of death groups (circulatory, cancer, other diseases). Finland and Denmark had the highest middle-age death risk from accidents and violence. Finnish men had levels above the other four countries throughout the study period, and male differences were larger between Finland and the four other countries in 2006 than during the 1950s. For women, Denmark had the highest middle-age death risk from 1952 to around 1990. After 1990, Finnish women experienced the highest middle-age death risks in this category.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have studied time trends in middle age (40–69 years) risk of death in the Nordic countries for the period 1952–2010. During the 1950s and 1960s, male middle-age death risk either remained stable (Sweden and Finland) or increased (Norway, Denmark, Iceland). For women, all countries experienced a continuous decrease from 1951 to 2010, except Denmark from 1975 to 1995. From 1990–1995 to 2010, there has been a strong decrease in middle-age death risk for both men and women in all five countries.</p>
<p>The high mortality and low life expectancy of Danish women in the last quarter of the 20th century has been described and discussed extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813491032">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813491032">12</xref>]. It is also clear that the mortality of Danish men has developed in an untoward direction relative to the other Nordic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813491032">13</xref>]. Finnish men had the highest middle-age death risk since 1950s, but were joined by Danish men after 1990. The time trends of Finnish women are as exceptional as those of the Danish, but have been less noted, possibly because they have been in a beneficial direction. We will discuss major life style factors, using lung cancer deaths as a marker of tobacco exposure, liver cirrhosis of alcohol consumption and upper aero-digestive tract cancer deaths as a marker of high combined intake of the two.</p>
<p>Causes behind the dramatic decline in IHD has been studied particularly in Finland where it followed intense intervention programs that aimed to reduce smoking and improving fat quality with reduction of saturated to increasing unsaturated fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813491032">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813491032">15</xref>]. Remarkable reductions in serum cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking were observed from the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813491032">16</xref>] and it was estimated the more than 50% of the decrease in IHD between 1982 and 1997 in Finland could be attributed to risk factor improvements, dominated by cholesterol, but including blood pressure and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813491032">17</xref>]. Studies aiming to explain the high mortality in Denmark have concluded that predominantly smoking but also alcohol are the most important contributors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813491032">13</xref>]. A similar conclusion was drawn to explain the large difference in life expectancy between Finnish men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813491032">18</xref>]. These conclusions are supported by the fact that Denmark and Finland have the highest alcohol consumption among the Nordic countries (OECD data, supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813491032">Figure 1</xref>) and highest and increasing risk of middle-age death from liver cirrhosis. Also obesity trends should be considered to explain the observed increase in deaths from liver cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813491032">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Tobacco smoking accounts for 80% or more of lung cancers with a delay of 20–30 years in incidence increase after consumption increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813491032">20</xref>]. Finnish men had the highest middle-age death risk of lung cancer among any of the Nordic countries. The Finnish epidemic peaked in 1969 and was followed in size by Denmark, where the peak was observed some 15 years later. High prevalence of cigarette smoking in Finnish men occurred earlier than in the other Nordic countries, as noted by Doll and Peto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813491032">21</xref>]. This contrasted with Finnish women who experienced clearly the smallest female epidemic of middle-age lung cancer death of any Nordic country. In Norway, restriction of tobacco during the second world war could have contributed to low mortality, and Norway’s position with the highest life expectancy in the world during the 1950s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813491032">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813491032">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813491032">23</xref>]. Since 1970, both Danish women and men reported the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking among the Nordic countries, and Finnish women the lowest (OECD data; supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494813491032">Figure 2</xref>). Using lung cancer rates to estimate smoking prevalence it has been estimated that 79,000 (Norway), 134,000 (Sweden), 209,000 (Denmark), and 168,000 (Finland) persons aged 35–69 years died from smoking between 1960 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813491032">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Upper aerodigestive-tract cancer (including oesophagus) causes 0.8 million annual deaths worldwide. Alcohol and tobacco account for 70%–90% of UADT cancers, particularly in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813491032">20</xref>]. Thus the strong increase in UADT cancers in Danish men, but also women, that occurred after 1970 and only weakly is observed in the other Nordic countries point to alcohol (in combination with smoking) as a possible major factor behind the untoward mortality trends in Denmark over the past 35–40 years. This is further corroborated by data on alcohol consumption where Denmark (followed by Finland) has had by far higher reported consumption compared to the other Nordic countries (OECD data, supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813491032">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of other life style factors (for example, unhealthy fat) is difficult to establish from cause-of-death data alone. First, we lack specific exposure-marker diseases that exist for tobacco and alcohol (lung cancer, liver cirrhosis, UADT cancer). Second, we also lack reliable historical data on relevant dietary components, particularly fat types. However, it is generally believed that a more beneficial composition of dietary fat (less saturated fat, less trans fat, more mono- and poly-unsaturated fat) has contributed to the dramatic decline in mortality from IHD and other circulatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813491032">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813491032">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813491032">25</xref>]. Also, trends for deaths from IHD have been remarkably similar for all Nordic countries suggesting that the factors behind the initial increase in men (1952–1970) and the dramatic decrease that followed are shared by the Nordic countries, and thus contribute less to the variation in overall middle-age death risk during the study period. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2010 have quantified the contribution of risk factors to mortality from 1990–2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813491032">26</xref>]. In the GBD study for the year 2010, smoking is the leading risk factor for mortality in women aged 50–69 years in all Nordic countries except Finland where it is ranked fourth. In men, smoking was ranked among the three leading risk factors for deaths at age 50–69 years in 2010. Alcohol has a rank position among major risk factors between five and eight for both women and men in 2010, but may still contribute to explaining mortality differentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813491032">27</xref>].</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the patterns of colorectal cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer middle-age death risks are so similar. This could be due to similar evolution in the fat-profile of diet in the Nordic countries. The high cancer death risk observed in Denmark can be partially explained by lower survival of Danish cancer patients due to a higher prevalence of diagnoses at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813491032">28</xref>].</p>
<p>We restricted our analyses to the age span 40–69 years of age. This restriction has several advantages. First, it captures premature adult mortality which is crucial from a prevention viewpoint. Second, this age span captures important life style-related mortality as for example smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813491032">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813491032"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813491032"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813491032">8</xref>]. Third, the age restriction captures a period of life where a death more often has a single obvious underlying cause, and the problem of selecting the underlying cause from multiple competing conditions is less than at higher ages of death. It is well known cause-of-death data for international comparison studies suffers problems due to differences in certification and coding practice as well as autopsy rates over time and among countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813491032">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813491032">30</xref>]. Work of the Nordic Medico Statistical Committee for the two past decades has contributed to improved comparability of causes of death among the Nordic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813491032">30</xref>]. Finally, we computed the risk of dying between 40 and 70 years of age. This metric has a simple interpretation that is easily communicated to the general public. It is further decomposed into cause-specific death risks that attach an intuitive importance to each cause of death.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated important variation in middle-age death risk in the Nordic countries during the past half-century. Full understanding of this 60-year time series of cause-of-death data would require similar time series of levels and prevalence of major risk factors. Such data do not exist even in the Nordic countries, but should be secured for the future.</p>
