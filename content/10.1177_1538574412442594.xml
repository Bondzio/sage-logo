<abstract>
<p>The type of venous drainage of a direct carotid–cavernous fistula is an important issue to consider for the endovascular therapeutic decision. In case of an inadequate posterior drainage associated with a good anterior drainage, the facial vein is a useful alternative. The exclusive embolization with ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH Onyx), arterial and/or venous via the internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion has been used successfully, in a few cases until now. Nevertheless, the use of this method through anterior transvenous approach has not been previously described. Presented here is the case of a 13-year-old female patient with left posttraumatic carotid–cavernous fistula, with predominant anterior drainage, as well as carrier of traumatic occlusion of the contralateral ICA. The treatment was by means of a transvenous approach with transient occlusion of the left ICA.</p>

<p>Direct carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) or type A<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412442594">1</xref>
</sup> is an abnormal communication between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the cavernous sinus (CS), whose origin is traumatic frequently. The Neurological Endovascular Therapy is currently the treatment of choice, with CS obliteration by preserving carotid flow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412442594">2</xref>
</sup> The preservation of the arterial flow is possible in about 80% of the cases only, while in other cases the sacrifice of the ICA has been required.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412442594">3</xref>
</sup> The material employed at the time are diverse, the most commonly used devices are the detachable balloons and coils, with variable results.<sup>

<title>Clinical Case</title>
<p>A 13-year-old female with severe head injury that conditioned stupor, Battle sign, and left otorrhagia. The computed tomography (CT) showed fracture at the skull base and pneumoencephalon. After 1 month of hospitalization, she left the hospital with left peripheral facial paralysis as the only sequela. After 3 weeks, the patient developed left tinnitus, bipalpebral edema, and left eye (LE) proptosis, as well as diplopia when looking to the left. Physical exploration showed proptosis with LE episcleral congestion, and auscultable systolic murmur in orbital and temporal regions. The intraocular pressure (IOP) of the LE was 24 mm Hg. Neurologically, we found her with paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve (CN).</p>
<p>The cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA)<bold> </bold>showed<bold> </bold>complete occlusion of the right ICA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">Figure 1A</xref>). The injection in the left ICA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">Figure 1B-D</xref>) showed an CCF with evident venous drainage toward the complex formed by the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV), angular and facial veins, besides the pterygoid plexus, and very poor drainage to the left superior and inferior petrosal sinuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">D</xref>). Moreover, the left CS presented communication to the contralateral CS through the inter-CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">Figure 1B</xref>). Despite the high-flow fistula, the left ICA was still supplying the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and both anterior cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">C</xref>). The vertebral artery injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412442594">F</xref>) showed spontaneous collaterality in the right ICA through the right posterior communicating artery (RPCoA) with a good filling of the right MCA. Meanwhile, the collaterality toward the left carotid axis with the manual compression handle of the left ICA was noticed.</p>

<p>Diagnostic angiography: The injection in the common right carotid artery shows complete occlusion of the ICA (A). During the injection in the left ICA (B-D), it could be noticed the high-flow CCF with preservation of the distal circulation (B, C). In the anteroposterior (AP) projection, the communication with the contralateral cavernous sinus through the intercavernous sinus can be observed (empty arrow in B); while in the lateral projection (C), it is evident that the anterior drainage prevalence through the superior ophthalmic vein to the angular/common facial vein complex. At the panoramic AP projection, which includes cranial base, neck and upper thoracic portion (D), it can be clearly noticed that the facial vein drains to the external jugular vein (arrows), which is an infrequent pattern. The dye injection through the left vertebral artery in AP projection (A) showed spontaneous collaterality with the right ICA through the ipsilateral PCoA (dotted arrow). Following the manual compression of the left ICA, it could be observed the collaterality opens with the left ICA through the left PCoA. ICA indicates internal carotid artery; PCoA, posterior communicating artery.</p>

<title>Endovascular Management</title>
<p>Under general anesthesia were performed arterial and venous femoral approaches. Platelet antiaggregation therapy was initiated with Tirofiban on a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg during 30 days, and a maintenance dose of 0.04 mg/kg during the procedure. Through the arterial via the left ICA was catheterized with a guiding catheter of 6F (Guider, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). The injection clearly showed the venous flow from the SOV to the facial vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2A</xref>). The common facial vein usually flows directly to the internal jugular vein, nevertheless in this case the drainage communicated to the external jugular vein (EJV). Through the anastomosis it comes into the anterior facial vein with the retromandibular vein. By means of a road mapping, the EJV was catheterized with a 6F guiding catheter (Guider, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). Then, a microcatheter was entered (Echelon eV3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) mounted on a micro guide of 0.014” (Silver Speed, eV3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) until the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2A</xref>). The microcatheter was fixed in a place very close to the superior petrosal sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2B</xref>). A compliant microballoon (Hyperglide, eV3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) was navigated through the artery and then fixed between the horizontal portion and the posterior knee of the cavernous segment of the left ICA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2C</xref>). Following the microballoon insufflation, the complete occlusion of the ICA was confirmed and under road mapping the injection of EVOH with a viscosity of 18 centipoise units (Onyx, eV3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) was initiated through the microcatheter. Preparation of copolymer and previous injection of DMSO was achieved in the usual form described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412442594">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2D-F</xref>). The injection technique was performed in the rostral-caudal sense to the upper ophthalmic vein, and it was practiced during periods of 5 minutes (3 minutes for the injection itself and 2 minutes wait), with balloon deflation between these periods for (1) restoring the carotid flow, (2) evaluating the permeability of the ICA, and (3) evaluating the occlusion of the fistula. The same protocol was performed every time as needed. The injection was definitely stopped once the occlusion of the fistula was confirmed, and after waiting 3 minutes the microcatheter was removed applying a slight tension. The procedure was uneventful. By means of fluoroscopy, the morphology of Onyx cast was evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">H</xref>) and the final DSA showed the integrity of the ICA and absence of the fistula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412442594">Figure 2I-K</xref>).</p>

<p>Endovascular treatment: A venous and arterial road mapping (A and B) allowed the catheterization of the left CS through the anterior venous drainage (dotted arrows in A, and empty arrow in B). The microcatheter was fixed close to the upper petrosal sinus, which was confirmed by the dye injection through the microcatheter (B). A compliant microballoon was fixed (C, thick arrow), and mounted on a 0.10” microguide (C, dotted arrow) in the CS between the horizontal segment and the posterior knee of the cavernous segment of the left ICA. It was performed the injection of Onyx by means of road mapping (D-F) in stages. It was achieved the filling of the CS in the caudorostral direction, with the formation of a cast. At first, directed to the petrosal sinus and posterior third of the CS (D), and progressively to the superior ophthalmic vein (E, empty arrow). In the last stages of the polymer injection (F), the gaps between the cast and walls of the CS were filled up. The fluoroscopic control in lateral (G) and AP (H) showed the onyx cast inside the CS with its extensions to the petrosal sinus, to the superior ophthalmic vein, and even to the inter-CS (dotted arrow). The final angiographic shot in the left ICA, in AP and lateral projections (I, J, K), made evident the complete occlusion of the CCF, the preservation of the vascular tree, and the Onyx cast (I and J, arrow). The occlusion of the CCF is evident in the lateral projection in the slightly late arterial phases (K). ICA indicates internal carotid artery; AP, anteroposterior; CS, cavernous sinus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The venous drainage of the CCF is responsible for most of the symptoms of the fistula, (for instance, ophthalmological signs)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412442594">8</xref>
</sup> and is one of the most important aspects of planning for endovascular management. The femoral venous access to the CS through the complex IJV-petrosal sinus is the more frequently used, because it is considered the most reliable with lower ischemic risk, when compared with the arterial via.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412442594">9</xref>
</sup> An inadequate posterior drainage (IJV-petrosal sinus) limits this approach. For this reason, another endovenous strategies have been created to access to the CS (SOV, facial vein, pterigoid plexus, etc), some of them can be laborious or little reproducible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412442594">9</xref>
</sup> The surgical access through SOV is not new<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412442594">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412442594">11</xref>
</sup> but requires a team with experience in orbital surgery and surgical equipment at the cath laboratory. It has been described as a reliable method, but it is not far from serious complications such as intraorbital hemorrhage, trochlear or another orbital lesion, or infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412442594">11</xref>
</sup> The access through direct percutaneous puncture of the SOV has also been described as a treatment for indirect CCF,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412442594">12</xref>
</sup> nevertheless, it is better to access SOV through a transfemoral, as far as possible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412442594">9</xref>
</sup> In our patient, the access through the venous complex IJV-petrosal sinus was not possible, while the anterior access was feasible although its anatomical pattern is infrequent, seen in 9% of cadaveric specimens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412442594">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Currently, the useful endovascular materials are diverse; the most used are detachable balloons and detachable coils.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412442594">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412442594">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412442594">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412442594">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The use of a coated stent is shown as a promising alternative,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412442594">14</xref>
</sup> however, they are not well available and its navigability is still difficult. The EVOH (Onyx, eV3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) has been used successfully in a few indirect CCF series, frequently combined with coils or, with less frequency, as the only material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412442594">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412442594">15</xref>
</sup> Concerning the direct CCF, Onyx has been the only embolization material used in a very few cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412442594">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412442594">12</xref>
</sup> Zenteno et al recently showed that the EVOH is a suitable material for the treatment of direct CCF, by means of a technique consisting of the transient occlusion of the ICA, and the access for embolization with Onyx of the CS were either via the arterial or via the venous.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412442594">6</xref>
</sup> Among the advantages the following can be highlighted: (1) total and permanent occlusion of the fistula, (2) good radiographic visualization of the ICA, (3) preservation of the CNs due to the fact that Onyx does not need overpacking, and (4) lower cost compared with other strategies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412442594">6</xref>
</sup> In the mentioned article, access to CS was performed through the petrosal sinus in 1 case, and the injection technique from the EVOH was performed in a rostral-to-caudal fashion. In our case, access was made through an EJV communication with the facial vein through anastomotic veins. For this reason, the injection technique of the EVOH used was carried out in an inverse way: starting at the petrosal sinus, with the object of progressively filling the sinus until reaching the upper ophthalmic vein, so that the passing of the EVOH would not be closed, an event that would occur in case of having started with the upper ophthalmic vein. The occlusion of the right cervical ICA, posttraumatic surely, added up more risk to this technique, however, collaterality demonstration, the strict temporal occlusion, and the use of tirofiban provided an adequate security margin.</p>

<sec id="section6-1538574412442594">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This case is interesting in several aspects: (1) absence of the contralateral ICA to the CCF, (2) absence of an adequate posterior and anterior drainage with unusual outlet to the EJV, and (3) the modification made to the technique described by Zenteno et al with Onyx injection in a reverse way showed successful results.</p>
