<abstract>
<p>In many newsrooms, journalistic work has increasingly been reorganized in ways that make it more flexible, multi-skilled and assertive, or even ‘liquid’. Empirical studies on liquid journalism, however, are scarce. This article examines how the rise of liquidity can be seen in the work-related ethos of Finnish political journalists. The article is based on 25 in-depth interviews of political journalists. In the findings, three generational groups – the solid moderns, the liquefying moderns, and the liquid moderns – emerge divided roughly by age. These differences reflect a more general change, whereby the organizations of the solid industrial modernity have been flattened and decentralized and, in many professions, the expertise and career prospects have been questioned. In the course of this change, political journalists are developing an anti-institutional and flexible ethos accentuated by opinionated assertiveness – in effect, an ethos of liquid revolutionaries.</p>

<p>In today’s newsrooms, the only certainty seems to be a sense of uncertainty and change. Journalists face new technologies, organizational restructuring and new audience preferences, and they are reformulating their work practices and normative ideals. Here, I examine how Finnish political journalists and their work-related ethos are changing in the current climate.</p>
<p>Deuze paraphrases Bauman’s notion of liquid modernity; specifically, that journalism has become increasingly liquid for its creation of a flexible, multi-skilled, highly moveable and manageable workforce. For Deuze, liquidity is characterized by an enhanced sense of change and uncertainty. Technological advances, convergence, changing audiences and new work practices mould the everyday work in newsrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 142–162). Journalists, seeking news, information and audiences, are living up to a heightened state of contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2011</xref>: 111–118).</p>
<p>While the notion of ‘liquid’ is an appealing catchword to describe the current condition, it also raises questions. Given that empirical research on the concept remains scarce, the actual forms of liquid journalism are unclear. Journalists try to preserve their public service ideals yet adapt to the change. Thus, it seems the journalist needs to simultaneously be both solid and flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912454504">Deuze and Marjoribanks, 2009</xref>: 557–558). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912454504">Deuze (2008</xref>: 860) asks, what is going on within the profession? How do journalists themselves experience the change? Are they put off by the rationale of liquidity, or do they make of it something new?</p>
<p>The study, conducted between 2010 and 2011, draws from a round of 25 in-depth interviews with Finnish political journalists. In the interviews, I examined the changes in practice-related work ethos based on the desire to do a job well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1464884912454504">Sennett, 2008</xref>: 9). The interviews show how journalists negotiate their self-understanding when faced with new practices. All of the journalists acknowledge changes in their work, yet they interpret them differently, by being critical, negotiating, or approving the change.</p>
<p>In the light of modernization theory, journalists fall into three generational groups: solid moderns, liquefying moderns, and liquid moderns. The differences between the groups are, to a great extent, age bound: the identity of the older generations differs markedly from that of the younger ones. However, at the same time, the change is not a straightforward move from solid to liquid ethos. Rather, the groups show how journalists negotiate their identity and ethos at the moment. Most importantly, the youngest, the revolutionary liquid modern generation, still needs to face the test of middle age. As they age and become more career conscious, it remains to be seen whether they can overcome the problems of all revolutionaries and become permanent revolutionaries, or whether they will adopt the more common path and become solid journalists.</p>
<p>In the following pages, I discuss journalism in the context of modernization theories and then turn to Finnish political journalists and their changing ethos. Finally, I discuss the future of liquid ethos and consider whether it can endure the test of time.</p>

<title>Journalists in modernity</title>
<p>Theories of modernity have suggested that since the latter part of the 20th century, western societies have undergone a gradual shift from a relatively solid and heavy modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2000</xref>: 6, 113–125) – or organized modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1464884912454504">Wagner, 2008</xref>: 65–68) or high modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912454504">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 14–34) – to a more mobile, flexible, liquid, light and reflexive modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912454504">Beck et al., 1994</xref>). While the oppositional keywords suggest dramatic changes, the change has not taken place as a great leap, but rather as a complex and subtle change within modernity itself. Mobility and change, the key elements in the current condition, have been the inherent features of modernity since the beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912454504">Berman, 1988</xref>). However, in recent decades, they seem to have been upgraded to a new level, which signals changes in modernity.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, the post-war Fordist-Keynesian system that dominated from 1945 to 1973 started to give way to new logics of production. The new information and satellite communication technologies as well as declining transport costs sped up the flow of goods and services and overcame spatial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912454504">Harvey, 1990</xref>: 124, 147, 240). The investment-profit-investment cycle accelerated, and profit rates declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912454504">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 11). Subsequently, many industries attempted to transform themselves into flexible network enterprises that deliver tailored ‘just-in-time’ products for niche customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912454504">Castells, 1996</xref>: 151–279). Indeed, many of modernity’s solid and core industries, such as newspaper firms, made their investments for decades. Currently, however, many companies are uncertain what their main business will be, say, in five years.</p>
<p>Also, in many media organizations, the locus of operations has changed from production to consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1464884912454504">Murdock, 1993</xref>: 537). The dominant media of solid age – the national television channels or daily newspapers – still continue to exist, yet the new information technologies, customer orientation and flexible organizations – all important fundamentals of liquid modernity – have entered media houses and their operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884912454504">Lanchester, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912454504">Picard, 2006</xref>: 6–27).</p>
<p>Professions are also changing. In solid modernity, the experts claimed to have technical knowledge independent of the practitioners and clients, and they developed a self-confident, high-modernist ideology of rational planning and scientific progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1464884912454504">Scott, 1998</xref>: 4). Typically, these experts were men of heavy institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2000</xref>: 113–116). <italic>The Organization Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1464884912454504">Whyte, 1956</xref>) and <italic>The Company Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464884912454504">Sampson, 1995</xref>) made careers in large corporations and state bureaucracies. Moreover, expertise came to reign over social relations and private life as well. The doctor, the counsellor, and the therapist became as central to modernity as are the scientist, the technician, and the engineer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912454504">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>The journalist can be added to the list. Journalism, the sense-making profession of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912454504">Hartley, 1996</xref>), has been a paradigmatic profession of modernity with its search for immediacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2005</xref>: 449). Journalists liked to see themselves as autonomous and impartial professionals in the service of public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">2007</xref>: 162–163). They became experts of communication: professional communicators who ‘edited’ the society with their arsenal of rational and objective techniques and special skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912454504">Ekecrantz, 2005</xref>: 100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1464884912454504">Schudson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1464884912454504">Wiik, 2010</xref>: 26–27) and whose messages have no necessary relation to their own thoughts and convictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912454504">Carey, 1997[1969]</xref>: 132–133).</p>
<p>In many countries, the notion of objectivity lay at the heart of journalistic expertise. Through objectivity, journalists claim to possess a rational technique that gives them the expertise to stand above society and report on it by commenting in a non-partisan manner. With objectivity, journalists also sought to withdraw from the political community – claiming a political role but no political identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1464884912454504">Rosen, 1997</xref>: 194–195). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912454504">Daniel Hallin (1992</xref>: 16) describes the self-confident, high-modernist journalist in the US context:
<disp-quote>
<p>An era, when it seemed possible for the journalist to be powerful and prosperous, and at the same time, independent, disinterested, public spirited, and trusted and beloved by everyone, from the corridors of power around the world to the ordinary citizen and consumer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Bauman, the expert is analogous to a gardener who takes care of the plants and applies rational methods with which to create optimal conditions for growth. Being guided by rational-scientific insights, the gardener is sure to know what is good or bad for his plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912454504">Bauman, 1992</xref>: 178; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1464884912454504">Schiel, 2005</xref>: 81). The metaphor works well with journalists. In the public sphere, journalists work as modernity’s national gardeners; they claim to serve the public good through their rationally guided work, and they nurture the public with objective facts and balanced information.</p>
<p>In solid modernity, one builds up a career and climbs up the ladder of an organization and, thus, can ideally get a relatively clear sense of achievements. Now, the very meaning of career is in flux as corporations and state bureaucracies have sought to flatten hierarchies in order to become more flexible. The guiding principle has been ‘just-in-time’ efficiency – lean management, which cuts all the ‘slack’ out of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2000</xref>: 116–123; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884912454504">Holweg, 2007</xref>). Wherever possible, teams and projects, decomposable and flexible to change, have replaced organizational pyramids.</p>
<p>In flat network organizations, careers become problems. Flat organizations do not offer clear upward paths; the steps disappear or become blurred and clear and fixed rules for promotions are abolished. Concepts such as maturation, development, career, or progress make no sense in the way they did in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2007</xref>: 3–4). In fact, long-term loyalty and a secure career can turn into a trap for the professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1464884912454504">Sennett, 1998</xref>: 20–25). Also, the secure ethos of many professions is changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912454504">Beck, 1994</xref>: 47–52). For instance, in the public sector, administrators, public servants, and practitioners are increasingly advised to see themselves as business managers, purchasers, contractors, or strategists who think of customers rather than citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912454504">Clarke and Newman, 1997</xref>: 91–106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912454504">Du Gay, 2007</xref>). In Bauman’s words, gardeners turn into hunters who are always on the move. While a gardener’s utopia is to fulfil a certain project, hunters never stop and, like chameleons, they need to keep changing to respond to the demands of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912454504">2011</xref>: 24–30).</p>
<p>This all does not mean that modern careers and experts are disappearing. There are time-lags, and many institutions carry on and keep up their practices. Many public sector and non-market institutions have been sheltered from the impact of market logics, and some industries are more exposed to the forces of creative destruction, changes in technology, market fluctuations and competition than others. Thus, many well-off dailies with their regular readership have felt the changes only since the year 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884912454504">Lanchester, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Many professions also carry on. Changes often take place as subtle shifts; organizational restructuring moulds work practices, self-understanding and occupational ideals, and the professionals adapt to the new requirements through a series of minor negotiations.</p>
<p>All of this can currently be sensed in journalism, as recent research suggests: multiple changes challenge the profession’s self-understanding and ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">2007</xref>: 142–170; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912454504">Metyková and Waschková Cisarová, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1464884912454504">Ruusunoksa, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1464884912454504">2010</xref>: 54–58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1464884912454504">Ryfe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1464884912454504">Wiik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1464884912454504">Witschge, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1464884912454504">Witschge and Nygren, 2009</xref>). Specifically, the traditional ideals of the profession, such as public service, objectivity, autonomy and immediacy might be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">2007</xref>: 162–164).</p>
<p>For one, declining audience interest might hamper journalism’s ability to maintain its ethos of public service and informative objectivity. As quality journalism struggles, it has adopted new, better-selling news criteria from the tabloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884912454504">Preston, 2009</xref>: 121–124; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1464884912454504">Rove, 2010</xref>). Also, web-based communication technologies have put new demands on journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912454504">Carpentier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912454504">Castells, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1464884912454504">Shirky, 2008</xref>: 70–77). Increasing daily work load questions journalistic autonomy and self-confidence. Journalists need to be multi-skilled and mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1464884912454504">Witschge and Nygren, 2009</xref>) and provide updates whenever new information becomes available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1464884912454504">Schmitz Weiss and De Macedo Higgins Joyce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1464884912454504">Singer, 2011</xref>). While journalists have always been keen on immediacy, the pace of work has accelerated substantially in a way that might endanger their ability to check facts or use their autonomous judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2009</xref>: 316; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884912454504">Phillips, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912454504">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1464884912454504">Weaver, 2009</xref>: 396). The increased emphasis on audiences also questions journalists’ status as objective expert of public opinion. Instead journalists look out for the man on the street and blog interactively with their audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1464884912454504">Robinson and De Shano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1464884912454504">Ruusunoksa, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1464884912454504">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1464884912454504">Witschge, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The occupational ideals of autonomy and public service might also be endangered by the tightening economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1464884912454504">Schudson, 2009</xref>: 370). In many cases, the walls between news departments and businesses, and marketing and advertising have broken down; therefore, journalists need to think more closely about audiences’ needs and preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912454504">Picard, 2006</xref>: 6–7). Journalists turn increasingly to news producers or bloggers, and editors-in-chief become CEOs.</p>
<p>Some recent studies suggest that journalists are caught between the past and future. Past traditions of the profession influence journalists, yet, at the same time, journalists embrace novel forms of content creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884912454504">Mitchelstein and Boczkowski, 2009</xref>: 564, 575). Some develop an ethos that is based on worker autonomy and freedom, while others fail to meet the new requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464884912454504">Ryan, 2009</xref>: 656–659). Thus, it is relevant to ask how the ongoing changes affect the professional ideals and occupational ideology of journalism. How do journalists view their place and their tasks in society in the midst of the changes? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912454504">Deuze (2008</xref>: 860) suggests, we need to ask what journalists make of the change. I examine the change in the Finnish context to portray how political journalism is changing in a small western democracy that has experienced solid modernity and is currently facing the liquid state.</p>

<title>Research materials and methods: Finnish political journalism</title>
<p>This study examines the changes in the professional ethos of Finnish political journalists. All of the changes described have been felt in political journalism as well – and perhaps in political journalism <italic>par excellence</italic>. Political journalism, in particular, was at the core of the profession when the solid modern was characteristically the product of a state-centred society. Politics mattered, and politics was the central platform of the society. Political journalists were the <italic>crème de la crème</italic> of the profession in a state-centred era when national politics were regarded as representing the most vital public issues. Subsequently, quality political journalism has been seen to be threatened by economic pressures, such as ‘infotainment’ and ‘tabloidization’, which give priority to entertainment over enlightenment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884912454504">Neveu and Kuhn, 2002</xref>: 11–13). The economic pressures and the new communication technologies have highlighted the problematic developments as the race for news audiences seems to lead to a culture of sensational scoops and scandals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884912454504">Neveu, 2002</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>In fall 2010 and spring 2011, I interviewed 25 top political journalists in Finland, including people who represent national television channels, daily newspapers, and tabloids as well as the main regional dailies. The interviews were part of a project that examined a national scandal of unreported election campaign finances in Finland. The scandal, which started in 2007 and still has some cases pending in court, targeted several top politicians and became the biggest political scandal in Finnish political history. Many journalists also saw that the scandal revealed a generational gap within their profession. The older generation of journalists felt that the scandal was overblown, while younger journalists saw it as a sign of change whereby political journalism was becoming more critical towards politics and taking distance from politicians. The starting point of my interviews was the election campaign finances scandal, yet, as virtually all active political journalists reported on it, I was able to interview political journalists as a profession and ask about their professional ideals on a more general level.</p>
<p>Finnish political journalists form a relatively clearly demarcated professional community where everyone involved knows each other. Some 120 journalists are accredited to the Parliament, and they pretty much form the group of professional political journalists who spend time in Parliament, mingling with politicians and each other. The biggest media houses even have work desks there.</p>
<p>I was interested in the profession’s ethos, i.e. practice-related work ethics. Journalism ethics are often understood as relatively abstract ideals or codes in the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912454504">Berry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1464884912454504">Ward, 2005</xref>), or as occupational ideology with ideals. Public service, objectivity, autonomy, immediacy, and ethics lie at the heart of the professional ethos that journalists employ in their everyday work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2005</xref>). I studied the ethos of journalists: the practice-related work ethic, which consists of the normative evaluations of good work that relate with the desire and ability to do good work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912454504">Calhoun and Sennett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1464884912454504">Sennett, 2008</xref>: 241–254). Thus, ethos is created, tested, and recreated through everyday work practices. How should work be conducted on a daily basis? What is considered good journalism, and what are the obstacles to doing good work? What are the normative lessons learned? Ethos is often linked with occupational ideology and carries similar ideas. The occupational ideals, however, undergo subtle mutations in different places over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912454504">Carpentier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 162–163). The notion of ethos grasps these changes induced by everyday work experiences and deciphers how the changing work practices mould occupational ideology.</p>
<p>In the interviews, I asked the respondents to describe their own careers: how and why they joined the profession, and how their professional work practices and ideals have changed. Second, I invited them to evaluate the changes: what have been the pros and cons? The normative aspect of the answers led me to understand the ethics of their everyday work – that is, the ethos entailed in their work experiences. Another way to talk about ethos in practice was to ask what the journalists consider as their best stories, and what they consider as their biggest failures professionally.</p>
<p>I also asked the interviewed journalists to identify the persons they regard as the best in the profession. Later, I interviewed those mentioned most frequently. Thus, I hoped to reach out to well-respected individuals in the interpretive community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1464884912454504">Zelizer, 1993</xref>) to find practices and ethical standards that are highly regarded within the community. At the same time, I also paid attention to cleavages within the profession. As there was a generational discussion going on within the community, I made sure that I contacted representatives of the various age groups within the profession.</p>
<p>The interviews were transcribed and in the qualitative analysis I focused on the evaluative notions on work practices. How did the journalists evaluate their work practices and experiences normatively? In the following, I describe the analysis in more detail</p>

<title>Three generational groups</title>
<p>The Finnish democratic corporatist model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912454504">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>: 29, 66–75) is in trouble – newspaper circulations are falling, public broadcasting faces economic pressures, and new media technologies tighten competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912454504">Herkman, 2009a</xref>). Under these circumstances, Finnish journalism has become more market oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912454504">Herkman, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912454504">Kantola, 1998</xref>). The quality dailies as well as the tabloids are troubled by decreasing circulation and increasingly volatile audiences. News criteria have veered from social importance to human interest – people, everyday interests, and the topic of the day.</p>
<p>The tightening pace hampers journalistic work today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884912454504">Jyrkiäinen, 2007</xref>). Journalism is also managed more consciously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884912454504">Hujanen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884912454504">Kunelius and Ruusunoksa, 2008</xref>). A host of projects have tried to reach out to audiences by developing more ‘humane’ journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912454504">Hujanen, 2010</xref>) or by looking from the angle of ordinary citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912454504">Ahva, 2010</xref>). The traditional high-brow fields of journalism, such as cultural journalism, are trying to avoid elitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884912454504">Hellman and Jaakkola, 2009</xref>). Political journalism has also changed considerably. For one thing, its pace has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1464884912454504">Pitkänen, 2009a</xref>: 105). In Finland, Parliament has been the main work forum, yet now journalists try to reach out to the ‘man on the street’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1464884912454504">Ruusunoksa, 2006</xref>). Journalists also work and are interactive on the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884912454504">Pitkänen, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>All of the journalists interviewed acknowledged the profound changes in newsrooms. The pace of work has increased considerably, news management has become more active and well-organized, and the news criteria are changing towards those of the tabloids. The time-span of journalists’ work has shortened: the prospect of a lifelong career is secondary to everyday activities. Linked to this is an increase in the ‘just-in-time’ logic of journalism: journalistic resources are put to use more effectively and journalists rotate from task to task.</p>
<p>As one experienced political journalist put it, earlier he would have done two pieces per day, but nowadays he must write five to seven pieces a day, which must also be updated. The change can be seen, for instance, in the reporting on party conventions. Earlier, a journalist would have written four or five stories during a two-day convention. Now, journalists may write 25 stories plus an internet version.</p>
<p>The increased workload is not only quantitative: each story needs its own angle. Journalists need to earn their audience, and the competition is fierce as they are pushed to find angles and headlines that interest and attract audiences. At the same time, there is little or no time left to verify whether a piece of information is true or false. The deadline is continuously open, and there is pressure to put things out without checking. All this leads to a more chaotic public life: rumours spread in minutes, and false accusations and suggestions are thrown around.</p>
<p>All of the journalists acknowledged these changes. The way these changes were interpreted, however, varied considerably. There were some journalists who were predominantly in favour of the changes in journalistic work practices; meanwhile, other journalists were mainly critical of the changes. Moreover, there was a mediating group of journalists in between them. The variation seemed often, if not always, age bound. The older journalists were more critical than their younger peers.</p>
<p>In the interviews, I found themes that were typical for each group. First, the formative years played a role as journalists described their moral self-understanding. Second, the different age groups saw the normative task of journalism differently. For instance, the oldest liked to talk about social and national responsibility, the middle generation emphasized their professional watchdog role, and the youngest liked to challenge existing practices and institutions. Third, evaluative ideals on journalistic work varied – for example, the use of sources or the criteria of a good story.</p>
<p>In the following, I present three different practice-related work ethics, each ethos pertaining to a specific age group: the solid moderns (born 1939–1955), the liquefying moderns (born 1956–1969), and the liquid moderns (born after 1970) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464884912454504">Figure 1</xref>). The age groups are not as clear-cut as the groups suggests. There were also younger journalists who had critical views. They were, however, clearly in minority in their own age group. Also, there were senior journalists who clearly embraced the new practices. However, yet again, they were an exception within their age group. The generational differences were so clear that I found them relevant enough to be used as a frame to describe the ongoing changes in the professional ethos. The oldest journalists tend to be critical of the changes, while the youngest view them most positively. In the middle, the middle-aged journalists negotiate their identity when still carrying the traditional ideals and yet feeling the need to adjust to the new requirements. Thus, I suggest that the three groups all together give a picture of the negotiation that is taking place within the profession as it faces the current changes.</p>

<title>The solid moderns: National responsibility</title>
<p>The solid moderns are from the post-war baby-boomer generation and are retiring from newsrooms. They have been in dominant positions in the profession for a long time. They started working in the late 1960s and 1970s when politics was the leading sector in society and party allegiances were clear. Many newspapers and journalists were openly party aligned and party members. Politics attracted the most talented and ambitious of that generation. Many journalists were actively engaged in politics in their youth and have maintained a relatively stable basic political alignment, despite the fact that they have become professional journalists. They are also closely linked with their media house, which has in many cases offered them a long career from a summer apprentice to a respectful position at the top of the organization.</p>
<p>They see societal relevance as the main news criterion and are deeply suspicious of the infotainment trends in news production. As one of them says: ‘Journalism needs to be based on the societal relevance of the issues, and one has to be able to be proud of that and not only of selling figures and the number of clicks on the net.’</p>
<p>They also emphasize that journalists need to report on issues that deal with political institutions, such as the Finnish Parliament, which has been the cornerstone of their work. They have spent long working days in the corridors and the café of the Parliament. Many have close relations with sources going back to the politicized 1970s. These relations are the basis of their work: journalists need to have good working relations with politicians and insider circles in parties. They also value news that is based on insider sources, and they claim to dig deeper than the younger journalists.</p>
<p>The solid moderns like to see themselves as objective professionals who have a mission of keeping up the level of journalism and public discussion. They abhor opinionated journalism, which is not based on insider information. They criticize the younger journalists for being too eager to write about things they do not really understand. Many also criticize the tendency to turn a journalist into a personal brand. The solid moderns would rather keep the personality in the background and let the facts speak for themselves. One solid modern explained that he had worked at <italic>Helsingin Sanomat</italic> for 15 years before he wrote his first column. In contrast, a summer apprentice now usually writes her first column after two weeks.</p>
<p>The solid moderns also criticize the tabloidization and personalization of politics. They worry that politics has become an area in which capable people do not bother to participate because public life has become too rough and the tabloid criteria have become too prevalent. One of them describes her mixed feelings on being assigned to ask the Prime Minister about his divorce:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt that it was the most embarrassing thing I had ever had to do. I would not be able to work in a women’s magazine or a tabloid. I was totally embarrassed to ask: ‘Well, what are you up to now?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1464884912454504">
<title>The liquefying moderns: The careerists</title>
<p>The liquefying moderns are most typically journalists that came into the profession in the 1980s. The central value in their ethos is independent professionalism: journalism is a career for professionals who conduct their work impartially. The liquefying moderns are career people who see journalism as a profession with special techniques. Ideally, a career is not spent within one sector of the media, but acquiring different experiences and widening personal skills are valued instead.</p>
<p>Many in this group pursued a university education in journalism, which was not usual for those in the previous generation. They emphasize that they have no political alignments because that would have an effect on their work. As political journalists, they do not want to have anything to do with politics. As one of them ponders:
<disp-quote>
<p>Do I want to change the world? The answer is: no, not in this job (…) I do not feel that it is the task of this profession. If I need to change the world, I will do it after the workday.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This impartiality is demonstrated by their voting behaviour. Many state that they have voted for several different parties; one journalist reckoned that he had voted for seven different parties in major elections. Some say that they cast empty ballots in order to show respect for democracy and to guard their neutrality.</p>
<p>The professional touch is clearly seen in their source relations, which they handle skillfully. They do not make friends with their sources; yet they still try to maintain close contacts. They stay in touch with their sources over a long period, but at the same time they maintain contacts in all directions and claim independence from their sources.</p>
<p>The liquefying journalists stand at the crossroads of change. In some respects, their identity is still solid: they believe journalists have a privileged position in public life and believe that journalism has an important role to play by producing the kind of quality reporting that cannot be replaced by the social media. Liquefying journalists have been apprentices to the solid generation, yet they have had to change their working practices in many ways. They came to the profession in the 1980s when media became more business oriented and gave up formal party alignments. Media houses have offered them jobs as non-aligned professionals who can be critical of politics in general.</p>
<p>Many suggest that the news criteria have changed. Societal relevance has been combined with human interest. According to one journalist from Finland’s National Broadcasting Company, YLE:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our basic task is to redress socially important issues in a way that makes them interesting. Our toolkit of human interest contains tools such as personalization, storytelling, case histories, and model stories.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The liquefying journalists not only lament the change, but also see the reasons for it. They contrast themselves with the earlier generations who, according to the liquefying journalists, wrote long stories and reported on the sayings of politicians respectfully. As one of them claims, there is no space for ‘Sorsa says’ journalism, referring to the long-standing Prime Minister of the 1970s and 1980s, Kalevi Sorsa. Now, political journalism needs to be interesting; therefore, it cannot only report the sayings of politicians, but also needs to be a story teller and make good stories.</p>
<p>These journalists are critical of stories that are too long and of boring writing, which only quotes the sources. Many believe that traditional quality journalism needs to change. As one of them states:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are like Volvo, reliable but not very exciting. Every day we need to offer our readers an experience so that they have a reason to say: ‘Wow, look at that!’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For liquefying journalists, a more tempting story telling is a major technique for gaining audiences. They feel that journalism as a profession needs to cover primarily the upper echelons and institutions of society and not to be degraded to poll journalism asking views on the street. The way to preserve this high status of journalism is to change the way stories are told. As one journalist explains, political journalism used to be ‘boring and massive’, stories were too long and ‘looked awful’. Political journalism can be as colourful as other kinds of journalism; as one journalist described himself: ‘I am a sort of sports editor in politics; I like colourful persons and journalism that resembles a Shakespearean drama.’</p>
<p>As another experienced political journalist explains, good journalism builds on both reason and feeling and appeals to the head as well as the heart because ‘we tell stories; we simplify and dramatize persons’. As quality journalism has become more audience-sensitive, it cannot avoid issues that evoke strong emotions. As one journalist states: ‘The moral outcry, which is born among citizens, fuels our work and is our energy source.’ This moral outcry seems to replace political alignment. As politics in themselves have become a dubious issue, a critical stance is increasingly built by focusing on issues of personal morality.</p>
<p>At the same time, the liquefying moderns do not embrace the changes wholeheartedly. The tabloid criteria lead to problems at times as quality journalism joins the herd mentality and focuses on personalities rather than on issues. As one journalist describes, he could never have imagined that he would interview the Prime Minister’s female friend, yet the profession has drifted into it: ‘Did we study ten years at the university only to drop to the level of a journalistic ape?’</p>
<p>Many journalists are also critical of the stepped-up working pace, citizen orientation, and online journalism. Many suffer from the hectic pace and feel that they cannot deliver quality. Thus, one journalist admits ironically to being a bad journalist in the sense that she is old-fashioned and tries to make stories that describe larger processes rather than reporting on single items one at a time.</p>
<p>Many liquefying journalists are also sceptical of work rotation, internet journalism, and citizens’ polls, which often feel like forced job assignments that underrate professional expertise. The internet has spoiled journalism; as one journalist ironically puts it: ‘I was once ordered to take a street poll. So I went, but I actually timed how long it would take, and it took me exactly ten minutes to do it.’ Many of these journalists defend their professional status and worry what will happen as journalists increasingly spend their time interviewing the ‘man on the street’ and producing increasing numbers of stories for the internet.</p>
<p>The team-based and flexible working practices as well as the enhanced editorial control have challenged the idea of a special reporter dedicated to political journalism. Some see this development as problematic. As one journalist states, sometimes the new criteria bypass important political issues and journalists need to fight for their views in order to get relevant issues on the agenda.</p>
<p>The backbone of their individualized professionalism is a sense of loneliness. They are individual professionals whose main purpose in life lies in their own individual careers and there are no bigger causes. Accordingly, the increasingly flat organizations and the constant work rotation pose a problem. As they become more middle aged, many of these journalists feel that the flat and rotating organizations offer few prospects for an advancing career.</p>

<sec id="section6-1464884912454504">
<title>The liquid moderns: The project people</title>
<p>The liquid journalists recognize the changes in newsrooms, but whereas the two previous groups view these changes critically, mainly as a threat to the profession, the liquid journalists see the changes mainly in a positive light. They are typically newcomers to the profession, born mainly in the 1970s. However, some older journalists who hold key editorial positions clearly have adopted a liquid mentality and have a mission to advance it in the newsrooms as they like to talk of the future and not lament the past.</p>
<p>The liquid journalists do not see the increased pace of work or the internet as being problems. They view the social media as a major change in society, but not in negative terms. Some believe that newspapers will be gone in 10 years. However, they are not put off by this and believe that new forms of journalism will arise.</p>
<p>They view the flat and flexible organizations in optimistic terms. As one journalist says, their careers will not be ‘stuck’ in one department as ‘in the old world’. Another young journalist states that no one in the younger generation believes that it is possible to specialize in a certain field. Instead, one can develop projects that can be squeezed into the everyday routines of daily tasks. This change has been accentuated by personnel management techniques that encourage circulation and mobility – both upwards and downwards – in editorial rooms.</p>
<p>The liquid journalists oppose journalistic routines and the ready-made conventions for what makes an important piece of news. Instead, their aim is to look at the ‘everyman’ and ‘everywoman’ on the street. What would be their concerns? What do they make of high-level political decisions? Thus, these journalists have also made their peace with citizen orientation and audience orientation.</p>
<p>The liquid moderns do not relish the idea of a star journalist or writer. Instead, the ethos of teamwork replaces the idea of the lonely hero. There are still star journalists who dig out stories through their personal work, but more and more journalism is about teams:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the morning we ask what the hell does this mean, and we start to dig it out together and make something together in ways that would be impossible for one journalist alone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many liquid moderns also express a strong anti-institutional feeling. This derives, in part, from the traditional journalistic watchdog ethos. This ethos, however, has gained new meanings in the liquid age. In particular, liquid moderns and political journalism have followed too closely the agenda of political elites and bureaucratic institutions and need to find distance from institutional agendas and seek the citizens’ angle. Journalism should become more active and set its own agenda apart from institutional politics. Journalists need to keep a distance from official agendas and consider what is really relevant for people and the citizens of a society:
<disp-quote>
<p>One needs to separate oneself from what someone says; if a bureaucrat says something, it is not the word of God …Too close relations with the bureaucratic machinery were the gravest sins of the old journalism.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another journalist described the changed work practices in Finland’s biggest daily, <italic>Helsingin Sanomat</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you think ten years back, we produced reports about Parliament that took half a page or more. We don’t do those any more … Now we are looking for a different kind of angle … Journalism questions things more critically, and we are more eager to look for our own angle.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Liquid journalists differ from the earlier generations in their emphasis on assertive opinion-building. From the outset, they have been encouraged to write columns in newsrooms, and this has become one of their ideals: journalism needs to express well-grounded opinions as well as be interesting and relevant. Neutral, objective reporting is thus, at least to some extent, bypassed by opinionated assertiveness.</p>
<p>The anti-institutional ethos of journalism is also partly explained in generational terms. The baby-boomers and their star journalists have mostly retired, and the editorial posts have been reallocated to younger people. As one journalist described the change:
<disp-quote>
<p>As far as I can see, all the editorial posts have been refilled, and they (the new journalists) are all now under 40 years of age and their approach is totally different.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The up-and-coming younger journalists mark a clear difference from the older generation who are at the core of political journalism. They sceptically view the older generation as having too close relations with their sources. As one journalist sternly professes when asked about the political journalists assigned to the Finnish Parliament:
<disp-quote>
<p>No, I don’t belong to them. I don’t believe that any of these new-generation political journalists belongs to them. It is a very special group, and no matter how experienced they are as professionals or how well they know the Parliament, they cannot help but identify with those they watch as they sit in the same cafeteria with them year after year.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another journalist sees herself on the fringe of the profession because she is not interested in the traditional core of political journalism, namely, the political games reported on from the corridors of Parliament. Rather, she is more interested in the wider political processes and the legislative developments. Another describes himself as a journalist who happens to report on politics rather than being a political journalist per se.</p>
<p>At the core of the liquid ethos is a readiness to change: the liquid moderns like to be on the move; they like to move fast and express their own opinions. For them, journalism is fun and interesting – a dream job for many, but, at the same time, it is also just another profession and they are ready to reconsider it if needed. Their ideal is no longer a firmly progressing career within political journalism. Such an ideal, which dominated the earlier generations, seems to the liquid moderns to be old fashioned and even dangerous because a person is in danger of getting stuck in one area that can turn into an ivory tower; then, the connection with readers is lost. Quality journalism has maintained an ideal of professionals who have specialized in their respective fields – be they political, economic, or cultural journalism. This idea of a well-established career seems more like a trap to many younger journalists. They do not want to identify with a specific field, and they have the ethos of opinionated rebels who defy existing hierarchies. As such, they enhance their own rebellious ethos by contrasting themselves with the earlier generations, which are depicted rather critically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1464884912454504">
<title>The liquid ethos in time</title>
<p>The findings here suggest that Finnish political journalists have adopted a range of work practices that can be described as liquid: a faster pace, flexible teamwork, and opinionated assertiveness. In this study, the new practices are perceived rather differently by the different generational groups. These groups are, of course, not hard and fast; a journalist’s ethos is not dictated by year of birth. There are senior journalists who embrace the change and young professionals who worry about the changes in journalism. Moreover, some ideals remain, but only expressed in new ways. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">Deuze (2007</xref>: 43–44) observes, liquid practices are not totally different from solid modernity, but mingle with the old practices of solid modernity. Categories of solid modernity are disintegrating, overlapping, and remixing as many categories of modern life have lost their commonly held and consensual meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 43–44).</p>
<p>While the generational divide is not absolute, the three styles still capture the typical ethos of each age group. The oldest group, the solid moderns, came into the profession in the late 1960s, an era of national responsibility and party power. From the 1970s onward, their careers were characterized by a sense of security and advancement as the national media and journalism grew stronger. They view public life as gardeners look upon a garden – something that needs to be guided and nurtured from above – and they deplore the weakening standards in the profession.</p>
<p>The middle generation, the liquefying moderns, stand at the crossroads of solid and liquid ideals. They came into the profession in the 1980s, an era of marketization and professionalization of the media. They are career people whose ethos is based on solid professionalism, and they want to preserve the high status of journalism and are sceptical of citizen orientation. In order to maintain journalism’s status, they are focused to develop new tabloid-style practices in order to survive the heightened competition. They also have controversial feelings about the changes and are worried that the solid ideals are lost.</p>
<p>The youngest, the liquid moderns, were typically born after 1970. They have developed an ethos that fits into the disappearing career possibilities and rotating work practices, the individualized and contingent work contracts as well as the sense of a permanent revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 143, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912454504">2008</xref>: 856). They are project people who do not see themselves as lonely heroes working their way to the top of a newsroom hierarchy. They view the lifelong career of the political journalist as being stuck in an ivory tower where the connection with ‘ordinary life’ is easily lost. Instead, they maintain an anti-institutional and revolutionary ethos.</p>
<p>There are also studies with comparable outcomes, which suggest that the young journalists, especially, are ready and willing to explore new avenues for journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884912454504">Lee-Wright et al., 2012</xref>: 153). In Russia, Pasti found two similar generations of Russian journalists. The older generation held a cultivated view of journalism as an important societal task carried out in collaboration with those in authority; the younger generation gravitated towards entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464884912454504">2005</xref>: 89). A somewhat similar change has also been found between print and online journalists; the latter were more audience oriented and source detached than their print colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1464884912454504">Steenseen, 2009</xref>). In political journalism, the liquid moderns also seem to signal the arrival of the fourth generation of political journalism as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884912454504">Neveu (2002</xref>: 33–46).</p>
<p>The differences between age groups suggest that the formative years are important for professional identity and ethos. Journalists born at the same time may share similar formative experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1464884912454504">Scott, 2000</xref>: 356). The post-war generation of solid modernity developed a self-professed doctrine of social, national, and institutional responsibility. The Organization Man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1464884912454504">Whyte, 1956</xref>), the Company Man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464884912454504">Sampson, 1995</xref>), the Social Engineer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1464884912454504">Scott, 1998</xref>) and the Objective Journalist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1464884912454504">Schudson, 2001</xref>) were siblings – all children of the solid modern society with their objective expertise. In Finland, the Northern European democratic corporatism was based on a national project of welfare society and rational bargaining among social interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912454504">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>: 160–164). Journalists were part of a national consensual politics that built up versions of national welfare societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912454504">Becker et al., 2000</xref>: 36–37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912454504">Hallin, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884912454504">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884912454504">Kantola, 2011</xref>). The solid moderns still echo these ideals as they see themselves as carriers of national responsibility. Many institutions of solid modernity remained relatively intact in the 1980s and 1990s, and some of them, such as national dailies or state-owned public service corporations, still carry on today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912454504">Allern and Blach-Ørsten, 2011</xref>: 101).</p>
<p>Similarly, identity based on objectivity still continues and, thus, many journalists are still seeking the isolation of truth tellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1464884912454504">Rosen, 1997</xref>: 195). While the older generation maintains the ethos of social responsibility, the middle generation became the professional and objective ‘editors’ of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912454504">Ekecrantz, 2005</xref>: 99–100) who also adopted a more audience-oriented ethos of being story tellers and scriptwriters (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884912454504">Kunelius, 2009</xref>). They are detached from and critical of politics, as their careers have been made in media houses, which became more market driven and loosened their ties with politics since the 1980s.</p>
<p>The liquid age has developed its own virtues. It is a time of disengagement, elusiveness, facile escape and hopeless change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2000</xref>: 120), with increasing anxiety, the corrosion of character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1464884912454504">Sennett, 1998</xref>) and a sense of permanent revolution that wreaks havoc on the foundations of existing institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2008</xref>: 856, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912454504">2009</xref>). Yet, the liquid age also has a strong anti-hierarchical ethos. Since the 1970s, the corporate world has developed an anti-authoritarian rhetoric that is typical for revolutionaries. They call for change, want to do away with the existing institutions and rules, and create a communal and egalitarian feeling of ‘us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912454504">Kantola, 2009</xref>). Post-bureaucratic organizations emphasize creativity, commitment, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912454504">Clegg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912454504">Heelas, 2002</xref>: 81). ‘Soft bureaucracies’ do not rely on hierarchical supervision; they encourage decentralized ways of conducting activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912454504">Courpasson, 2000</xref>: 155). Managers often communicate a sense of optimism, confidence, and a ‘can-do’ attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912454504">Alvesson and Svenigsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912454504">Kantola, 2009</xref>). The liquid ethos capitalizes on these changes and, as in earlier times, the liquid ethos tries to make the best of them. In liquid craftsmanship, anti-authoritarian feelings, the readiness to change and teamwork are the valued core skills. Long-term experience and a recognized position in the field are less important. The liquid moderns also side with the people and often replace objectivity with opinion. With regard to modernity, the liquid journalists are moderns who believe in progress and change. The progress, however, does not come by expertise and knowledge, but they are modernity’s revolutionaries who build their identity on the critique of existing institutions and, instead, build an egalitarian ‘movement’ that challenges them.</p>
<p>The end result, however, is still unclear. The now prevalent variations between age groups might also signal a dynamic that takes place within the profession as younger generations challenge the older ones. Many journalists have also recognized the adverse effects of continuous liquidity. Middle-aged journalists especially communicated frustration, usually linked with career options. This is in line with recent studies that have found rising burnout rates of newspaper journalists: in flexible organizations, the protective buffer of efficacy is weakened, and journalists do not get a feeling of accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464884912454504">Reinardy, 2011</xref>: 45). The disappointed journalists in this study were bothered by the disappearance of long-term horizons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912454504">Bauman, 2007</xref>: 3) and career progression, both of which have been displaced by projects and work rotation.</p>
<p>Generational theory has rightly been criticized for making generalizations and for being too robust (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1464884912454504">Rotolo and Wilson, 2004</xref>). Indeed, the generational interpretation might exaggerate the differences between generations, and the interviews themselves might give a too drastic picture of the actual changes. The worries that journalists express sound very similar to some worries expressed earlier. Journalists, for example, sensed that everything is going faster and pieces of news are getting shorter; when in fact, the news stories were getting longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912454504">Barnhurst, 2005</xref>: 244–248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912454504">Barnhurst and Nerone, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, the revolutionary ethos of the liquid journalists might sound a bit too good to be true. While they call for the ‘man on the street’, recent studies suggest that citizen participation is often minimalistic with regard to having an actual impact on society or politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912454504">Carpentier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1464884912454504">Witschge, 2012</xref>: 133). Liquid journalists also need to find a balance between the relatively closed culture of expertise and a more collaborative or even dialogical journalistic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912454504">Deuze, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Revolution has been a central constitutive idea of modernity from the start and, ultimately, became a central tenet of the generation of 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1464884912454504">Wagner, 2008</xref>: 65–71). Later, however, that generation became the keepers of the system – the solid moderns of today. The generational differences among today’s political journalists might also reflect different career phases. The senior generations are the keepers of the system and nostalgic for their golden past; the middle-aged are busy with their careers, and the youngest are the revolutionaries who have not yet secured places in the system. It remains to be seen how the liquid moderns will endure the test of middle age. This is the central problem of all revolutionaries: how to keep the revolution alive and not to be incorporated into the system. With time, the liquids of today might also find the will to solidify and look for secure positions and careers. In that case, today’s liquids will be tomorrow’s solids.</p>
