<abstract>
<p>Scholarship has long suggested that, in the decades of mass migration, Italian subversives were part of a global network based on the worldwide circulation of radical ideas and activists. Yet historiography has studied such dynamics mainly in the receiving countries and has tended to overlook the Italian side of those interactions. This article examines Italian migrants’ development of political and labor militancy in a transnational perspective. It focuses primarily on the contribution of the experience abroad to Italian radicalism and offers a few examples of the influence that migrants tried to exert, directly or indirectly, in their native country. On the one hand, expatriates often invested part of their remittances to support workers’ mutual aid societies, local unions, political newspapers, and strikes. On the other, returnees were able to draw on the new strategies and ideas they had learned abroad when taking part in the class struggle and political battles in Italy.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0014585813478925"><title>Introduction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014585813478925">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>Transnationalism has been central to migration studies in the last few years. Conventional scholarly wisdom now holds that immigrants live in two societies – the native and the adoptive – at the same time. Sociologists and cultural anthropologists have elaborated this paradigm, drawing especially upon the experience of the recent and present-day newcomers to the United States from eastern Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America. This conceptualization aptly depicts the conditions of people who can nowadays keep in touch with their native land almost round the clock by means of the internet, cheap cell phone rates, cable television, and low-cost airlines. Conversely, attempts at applying this notion backwards in time seem more troublesome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014585813478925">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In particular, the concept of transnationalism hardly applies to the case of Italian expatriates at the time of the mass exodus from the peninsula between the late 1870s and the mid-1920s. In those decades, correspondence exchanges by surface mail with relatives and friends in the ancestral country were slow and visits home by a combination of train and ship were obviously less frequent and much more time-consuming than the relatively cheap air travel that migrants can enjoy today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0014585813478925">Bertonha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0014585813478925">Foner, 2000</xref>: 169–188; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0014585813478925">Gabaccia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0014585813478925">Romeo, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in some spheres of the Italian experience at the time of mass migration, the concept of transnationalism can be applicable. Radical politics is one such dimension in the worldwide mobility of activists, resources, and ideas at the turn of the twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014585813478925">3</xref></sup> After all, one of the initial elaborations of this notion resulted from the discussion of a very political issue – the Italian emigrants’ right to vote – though within an institutional perspective that was alien to many subversive expatriates, who rejected elections under a bourgeois regime, branding them as a fraud to the detriment of the proletariat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0014585813478925">Martellone, 1978</xref>: 191–193). Referring to a bill that had been recently introduced to the Italian Parliament and intended to grant Italian male citizens residing abroad the right to vote for the Chamber of Deputies in Italy’s elections, Italian–American lawyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0014585813478925">Gino Speranza (1974: 310)</xref> envisaged as early as 1906 that ‘the ebb and flow of travel will render the old distinctions of nationalities … more and more an anachronism’ and ‘we may have to recognize a sort of world or international citizenship as more logical than the present peripatetic kind, which makes a man an American while here, and an Italian while in Italy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014585813478925">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0014585813478925"><title>Emigration and radicalism: Flight or revolt?</title>
<p>Debating the political meaning and implications of emigration a few years before the outbreak of the First World War, prominent Italian socialist leader Claudio Treves harshly criticized workers who had left Italy for another country in the previous few decades. He himself had spent a couple of years in Berlin between 1895 and 1896 before returning to Milan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0014585813478925">Casali, 1989</xref>). Yet, in 1912, Treves held that the decision to expatriate equaled a lack of class consciousness, revealed a rejection of labor militancy, and was generally the consequence of an apolitical stand. According to Treves, only those who remained in Italy could operate to the benefit of the working class, in contrast to those who pursued dreams of personal enrichment and social advancement in a different land (Degl'Innocenti, 1976: 207).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014585813478925">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>His argument has subsequently found some scholarly echo. For example, in the view of John S MacDonald, emigrants from Italy, especially those from the southern regions and the rural areas of the country, were workers who did not intend to participate in strikes or labor agitation and were unwilling to support the Socialist Party at the polls in their birthplace. They had therefore decided to improve their situation by means of expatriation rather than subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0014585813478925">MacDonald, 1958</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0014585813478925">1963</xref>). Similarly, Renzo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0014585813478925">Del Carria (1979)</xref> has contended that, for defeated revolutionaries, emigration was the equivalent of flight, especially when the failure of strikes resulted in the blacklisting of labor activists.</p>
<p>This interpretation, however, has not been uncontroversial and there has been scholarly disagreement about the thesis that outward migration and militancy were alternative responses to the same crises. For instance, Luciano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0014585813478925">Tosi (1979: 73)</xref> has suggested that ‘peasants’ struggles and emigration shared common roots and were the two sides of the proletarian rebellion.’ Other historians have followed suit and maintained that emigration per se could be regarded as a kind of ‘revolt’ and ‘social protest’ because it resulted from the refusal to abide by a condition of subjugation to landowners, employers, or the establishment in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0014585813478925">Franzina, 1976</xref>: 202–204; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0014585813478925">Moretti, 1980</xref>: 191–203). According to Donna R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0014585813478925">Gabaccia (1988: 55–75)</xref>, in late nineteenth-century western Sicily, especially in wheat-growing towns, the exodus rates were higher in places where labor militancy was more intense.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the minds of many left-wingers, expatriation was hardly tantamount to political defeat or a cowardly escape for individuals who were not brave enough to fight for better working and living conditions at home in the face of repression by the state or employers. In their opinion, instead of being a safety valve for dissatisfied workers, emigration meant the search for a country where radical reforms could be more easily carried out. For instance, socialist Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida, one of the leaders of the peasants’ leagues in Sicily in the 1890s, maintained that emigration was an ‘active form’ of ‘rebellion’ in the rural areas of the island (as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0014585813478925">Renda, 1963</xref>: 64–65). Many exiles hoped that progressive achievements abroad could be replicated in Italy. Against this backdrop, the returnees who had previously contributed to these changes or had simply witnessed them were supposed to share their experience with their fellow citizens who had stayed in the motherland. As a result, the expatriates could help the politicization and the development of class consciousness on the part of the Italian masses. The homecoming did not even need to be real and physical. It could also occur through the transnational circulation of ideas between the native and adoptive countries.</p>
<p>Karl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0014585813478925">Marx (1930: 858)</xref> warned that, after the end of the Civil War in 1865, the United States had undergone such a fast centralization of capitalistic power that the era of the ‘Great Republic’ as ‘the Promised Land for emigrants’ had come to a definitive close. Nonetheless, the radical press in Italy continued to cherish the myth of America as a place in which the class struggle was still viable and potentially effective. From this perspective, the country where capitalism had revealed its most mature developments was also the milieu in which a socialist revolution was most likely to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0014585813478925">Testi, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0014585813478925">Vecoli, 1998</xref>). Drawing upon such awareness, socialist leader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0014585813478925">Giacinto Menotti Serrati (1972)</xref> contended in 1902 that the Socialist Party could be successful and expect great achievements in no other country than the United States.</p>
<p>In a 1912 rejoinder to Treves, another influential member of the Italian Socialist Party, Ettore Ciccotti, welcomed emigration because returnees would contribute to the class struggle in Italy by applying new warfare strategies and ideas they were likely to learn abroad. Having migrated to Switzerland in the late nineteenth century, Ciccotti specifically referred to the United States in his analysis and urged his comrades to stimulate emigration to this country in the hope that ‘American ideas’ would be imported to Italy and help the fight against capitalism and social injustice, especially in the southern regions (as quoted in Degl'Innocenti, 1976: 206).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014585813478925">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, Treves’s standpoint was slow to die among the ranks of the Italian radical left. For instance, in late 1922 the Communist Party of Italy expelled Albano Corneli, one of its own co-founders and a sitting member of parliament, because he had moved to Argentina after Benito Mussolini’s rise to power in that very year in order to seek sanctuary from the fascist squads that had been storming his own constituency in the Marche region. Italian communists shunned Corneli as late as 1954, when he went back to his native town for a short visit. Of course, Corneli thought that his life was in jeopardy after his own house in Camerano was burnt twice during fascist raids. Yet Corneli was not a political quitter. Once he had landed in his adoptive country, Corneli began to organize his fellow Italian newcomers and to mobilize them against the fascist regime. He established the Fronte Unico dei Partiti Operai Italiani in 1935 in an effort to gather all Mussolini’s opponents of Italian descent in a single association. After the <italic>Duce</italic>’s henchmen had taken over the Dante Alighieri Society, the leading association that promoted Italian culture abroad, Corneli also created a group called Nuova Dante to curb the fascist attempts at indoctrinating immigrants by means of Italian language classes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014585813478925">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0014585813478925"><title>Political transnationalism: The dynamics in the adoptive country</title>
<p>There is no evidence that Corneli’s anti-fascist activities in Argentina, though relevant in that country, had any meaningful impact across the Atlantic in his native land. But, notwithstanding this specific case, Ciccotti’s hopes in the debate with Treves were not groundless. Although many radical exiles scattered abroad, they kept in touch with one another and retained relations with their comrades in Italy. They therefore ended up establishing and consolidating worldwide networks through which political views, theories, strategies, and forms of material support were disseminated between their respective places of settlement in foreign countries and the land of their birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0014585813478925">Bencivenni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0014585813478925">Gabaccia and Ottanelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0014585813478925">Topp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0014585813478925">Zimmer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Serrati himself was part of this dynamic. Indeed, his appointment as the editor of <italic>Il Proletario</italic> – the mouthpiece of the US-based Italian Socialist Federation of North America – was a decision that the Italian-American members of the Socialist Party of America made upon the advice of their comrades in Italy’s Socialist Party and upon the encouragement of one of the latter’s leaders, Enrico Ferri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0014585813478925">Deschamps, 1996: 73</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0014585813478925">Garroni, 1984: 324</xref>; Rosada, 1972: 50). Serrati’s predecessor at the helm of the newspaper, Dino Rodani, had also been nominated as editor of <italic>Il Proletario</italic> in 1899 under the guidance of socialists in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0014585813478925">Cartosio, 1985: 432–433</xref>). By the same token, Italian agitators who led labor struggles abroad often resorted to techniques that they had already experienced and applied in their native land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0014585813478925">Brusa, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0014585813478925">Dadà, 1982</xref>). For instance, during a 1912 walkout from the textile manufacturers of Lawrence, Massachusetts, the strikers’ children were sent out of town to stay with sympathizing radical foster families elsewhere, following a well-established scheme of labor disputes in Italy that immigrant and socialist organizer Ugo Lupi urged workers to replicate in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0014585813478925">Tait, 1973</xref>: 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0014585813478925">Vezzosi, 1991: 116–117</xref>).</p>
<p>This specific event in the history of Italian-American radicalism offers further proof of the subversives’ transnationalism. News of the Lawrence strike captured the attention of workers on the other side of the Atlantic and radical newspapers that were printed in Italy, such as the Liguria-based <italic>Lotta Operaia</italic>, published numerous and detailed accounts of the struggle against the woollen mill owners in Massachusetts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0014585813478925">Fasce, 1993: 22–27</xref>).</p>
<p>Solidarity with the so-called victims of the bourgeois repression was a transnational phenomenon as well. Campaigns for the release of Italian-American radicals who were detained in the United States usually elicited support and mobilized workers in Italy, too. This kind of Italian agitation in response to the lot of fellow radicals in the United States started with the transatlantic echo of the imprisonment of Joseph J Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, the leading organizers of the Lawrence strike, on charges that they were involved in the murder of a woman who had taken part in the walkout (Ministero dell’Interno, b. 2439, f. 6607; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0014585813478925">Vezzosi, 1991</xref>: 35). Committees to collect money for their defense fund sprang up not only in Molise, Giovannitti’s native region, but throughout the country, especially in almost all major Italian cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0014585813478925">D’Ambrosio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0014585813478925">Hill, 2008</xref>: 165). Mussolini (1952: 180–181) himself, then a socialist leader and the editor of the Forlì-based subversive weekly <italic>La Lotta di Classe</italic>, published an editorial in this newspaper and urged Italian workers to join forces in order to save the two Italian-Americans from the electric chair. He reiterated his appeal after becoming editor of <italic>Avanti!</italic>, the official mouthpiece of the Italian Socialist Party (Mussolini, 1952: 239–241).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014585813478925">8</xref></sup> The future <italic>Duce</italic> even took the platform at rallies in support of Ettor and Giovannitti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0014585813478925">Mussolini, 1952: 267</xref>). A few years later, Italian radicals’ empathy with the plight of their comrades on the other side of the Atlantic underwent a significant revitalization in the aftermath of the arrest of anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, reaching a climax between their death sentences and their execution in 1927.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014585813478925">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>These mobilizations sometimes resulted from the spread of misinformation, as happened in the case of an Enrico Mastracchi, who called on the mayor and City Council of Carpi, in the province of Modena, to petition the US government for the pardon of Ettor and Giovannitti because he wrongly thought that they had been sentenced to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0014585813478925">Topp, 1997: 45</xref>). Yet even such reactions offered evidence not only that Italian subversives backed their comrades abroad, but also that there were significant links between the radical political circles at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The other side of the Atlantic was the destination of a number of Sicilian radicals who had fled their native island after Francesco Crispi’s conservative government had crushed the socialist-oriented <italic>Fasci</italic> (workers’ leagues) in late 1893. Many settled in Tampa, Florida, and spread subversive ideas among their fellow countrymen who had found employment with the local cigar factories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014585813478925">10</xref></sup> For instance, these exiles invited outstanding and charismatic agitators from their homeland, such as anarchists Lorenzo Panepinto, Errico Malatesta, and Luigi Galleani, to address Italian-American workers, printed short-lived radical newspapers like <italic>L’Alba Sociale</italic>, and imported other subversive mouthpieces from Italy – such as <italic>Il Risveglio</italic>, which was published in Catania – for Tampa-based readers. As a result, even Italian-American laborers who had not been active in politics before leaving their native country ended up being exposed to radical ideas and mobilized on the occasion of labor struggles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014585813478925">11</xref></sup> For example, Giovanni Vaccaro, the correspondent from Tampa for <italic>La Parola dei Socialisti</italic>, the Italian-language mouthpiece of the Socialist Party of America, had been too young for active participation in the <italic>Fasci</italic> movement in his native Sicily before moving to Florida. Yet he was deeply influenced by Panepinto and became a leader of Italian-American workers in his adoptive city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0014585813478925">Gabaccia, 1988: 125–127</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0014585813478925">Mormino and Pozzetta, 1987: 97–126, 143–153</xref>). In Houston, too, refugees from the repression of the <italic>Fasci</italic> invited Italian radical orators from Italy to give speeches and exploited this kind of propaganda to help their fellow Sicilians overcome political apathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0014585813478925">Sylvers, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>There were further cases of Italian immigrants’ politicization in the United States. Pasquale Russo, for instance, had been politically lukewarm before leaving Italy. At the very beginning of his stay in America he even deluded himself into believing that the United States was ‘the land of the free.’ Nevertheless, Russo became a member of the revolutionary union Industrial Workers of the World after moving to Chicago, as soon as radical propaganda in his adoptive land opened his eyes and made him realize that ‘true Americanism’ was the willingness to fight and die for the liberation of workers from the exploitation of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0014585813478925">Russo, 1923</xref>: 9–14). Nick Di Gaetano, a labor activist in the inter-war years, joined the ranks of socialism only after reaching Detroit from his native Castellamare del Golfo in Sicily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0014585813478925">Fasce, 1981: 42</xref>). Even Nicola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0014585813478925">Sacco (1961: 11)</xref> – one of the icons of Italian subversion abroad – embraced anarchism in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0014585813478925"><title>Political transnationalism: The impact on the native land</title>
<p>The radical emigrants’ transnational networks also implied a political fallout in Italy. Prominent anarchist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0014585813478925">Carlo Tresca (2003: 75)</xref> wrote in his memoirs that, even after settling in the United States, ‘for years … I was still living in Italy, both with my heart and mind.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014585813478925">12</xref></sup> His words meant not only that the political divides within the ‘Little Italies’ usually mirrored their Italian counterparts and, for instance, reproduced the conflicts between socialists and clerics or between anti-fascists and fascists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014585813478925">13</xref></sup> Tresca’s remarks also implied that, notwithstanding their exile, Italian subversives continued to think of their native country and to make efforts to influence the political dynamics there.</p>
<p>The radicals who had left the Sicilian village of S. Stefano Quisquina for Tampa after the repression of the <italic>Fasci</italic> offered a case in point. These expatriates committed themselves to contribute 1,200 Italian lire each year to the Socialist Party branch in their birthplace and to purchase shares in a rural cooperative in S Stefano Quisquina by the name of Unione Agricola that their fellow villagers incorporated in 1902 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0014585813478925">Cartosio, 1992: 133–134</xref>). Similarly, in the years before the First World War emigrants from the village of Morano, in Calabria, used part of their remittances to encourage labor strikes and to fund radical newspapers in their birthplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0014585813478925">Cappelli, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>From as far away as Australia, political emigrants made a point of supporting radicalism in their native country. For example, in the late nineteenth century, socialist exiles, such as Francesco Sceusa from Trapani, Giuseppe Prampolini from Modena, Quinto Ercole from Abruzzi, and Pietro Munari from Schio, sent money to fight against the remnants of the Sicilian <italic>Fasci</italic> and to help the families of the 80 unarmed demonstrators killed by soldiers in Milan in 1898 to quell a local riot against the increase in the price of wheat and bread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0014585813478925">Bentivoglio and Di Leonardo, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0014585813478925">Grassi, 1973: 102–109</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0014585813478925">Romano, 1950–1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0014585813478925">Simini, 1996</xref>). Sceusa and Munari also contributed articles to two Milan-based and socialist-oriented periodicals, <italic>Lotta di Classe</italic> (not to be confused with Mussolini’s newspaper mentioned earlier) and <italic>Critica Sociale</italic>. The purpose of their pieces was not only to provide Italian workers with news about the struggle of Australian laborers, but also to offer examples of class warfare from abroad that could inspire the fight of the Italian proletariat against capitalism, although Munari urged his comrades to seize power by means of the vote instead of resorting to an armed insurrection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0014585813478925">Rando, 2004: 36–37</xref>). In 1890, while living in Australia, Sceusa even made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the Italian Parliament in his native constituency of Trapani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0014585813478925">Costanza, 1991: 288–292</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the major contributions to labor and political militancy in Italy from the radicals who lived abroad resulted from the subversives’ actual repatriation. Many Italian workers, who had been uninterested in politics before leaving their native land, underwent a process of politicization during their time spent in foreign countries spanning from France to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0014585813478925">Paparazzo, 2004: 32–35</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0014585813478925">Pécout, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0014585813478925">Pinna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0014585813478925">Sanna, 2011</xref>: 119–222). The contact with radicalism, trade unions, and left-wing parties in the adoptive societies was a sort of apprenticeship through which emigrants were trained and instructed in the strategies and tactics of class warfare. They usually drew on such experiences when they participated in political fights and labor struggles after going back to their native country. As a result, their return migration stimulated class consciousness, helped weaken workers’ subservience, and eventually galvanized the labor movement as well as the political fight in Italy. Canadian repatriates to Molise in the late nineteenth century, for example, triggered strikes that led to the emancipation of fellow laborers, who had remained home, from oppressive working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0014585813478925">Ramirez, 1991</xref>: 26–35). As an investigator for a parliamentary inquiry into Italian peasants pointed out in 1910, returnees revealed ‘an awareness of their dignity as men and a sense of independence and freedom when they face the class of gentlemen’ that they had lacked before leaving their native land (<italic>Italia</italic>, 1910: 2:251). Another acknowledged that former expatriates went back ‘radically transformed’ from their political and labor militancy abroad (<italic>Italia</italic>, 1910: 3:545). The emigrants themselves recognized the transformation. For instance, Rosa Cavalleri, a newcomer from Lombardy who settled in Chicago in the early twentieth century, stressed the development of class assertiveness in the United States and remarked that ‘those poor men from the village who go to America, they get smart. They’re not so afraid anymore of landlords’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0014585813478925">Hall Ets, 1970</xref>: 119).</p>
<p>Returnees often took the lead in labor and political agitations in the homeland. After spending a couple of years in Buffalo, New York upon release from an Italian prison in 1896, Bernardino Verro – a former leader of the Sicilian <italic>Fasci</italic> – went back to his native island in 1898, started a radical newspaper, <italic>Lu Viddanu</italic> (meaning ‘the peasant’ in the local dialect) in the village of Corleone, and promoted the fight for the distribution of the land of the latifundia among farm workers and tenants. He also created a consumer cooperative in 1899 and reorganized Corleone’s local branch of the Socialist Party. He managed to gather a political following large enough to be elected to the City Council on a socialist ticket in 1900 and to become mayor in 1914, after another period of exile in Tunisia, before being murdered a year later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0014585813478925">Rizzo, 1996–1997</xref>). Sebastiano Bonfiglio, another radical migrant returned from the United States, where he had been a contributor to <italic>Il Proletario</italic>, was elected mayor of Monte S. Giuliano, in the Sicilian province of Trapani, in 1919 and became a member of the national executive board of the Socialist Party in 1921 following his repatriation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0014585813478925">Andreucci, 1975–1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0014585813478925">Basiricò, 1995</xref>: 119–131; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0014585813478925">Cartosio, 1992</xref>: 132–133). Likewise, Edmondo Rossoni was very active in labor agitation, made incendiary speeches, and in 1913 planned strikes in northern and central Italy – especially in the province of Modena and Milan –after previously organizing workers in Brazil and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0014585813478925">Tinghino, 1991: 54–55</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Rossoni eventually turned to fascism, other returnees stuck to radicalism. This, for instance, was the case with Efrem Bartoletti. A miner in Hibbing, Minnesota, Bertoletti became a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and was also another frequent contributor to <italic>Il Proletario</italic>. In 1919, he went back to his native village, Costacciaro in the province of Perugia. There he created a consumer cooperative, the Cooperativa di Consumo Montecucco, and served as his hometown’s socialist mayor in 1920 and 1921 until fascist violence overthrew his progressive administration and caused the demise of his attempts to curb Mussolini’s storm troopers at the local level (Mazazzi, 2001; Ministero dell’Interno, b. 368; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0014585813478925">Vecoli, 1981: 458</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0014585813478925">Vezzosi, 1991</xref>: 59–60). Another returnee, Ruggero Baccini, struggled with fascist squads in his native Lazio after going back from Paterson, New Jersey, where he had come under the influence of anarchist ideas and had become a member of a faction of direct-actionists by the name of <italic>gli insorti</italic> (the insurgents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0014585813478925">Anonimi Compagni, 2002</xref>: 166–167; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0014585813478925">Avrich, 1996: 157</xref>).</p>
<p>The transnational stimuli to Italian radicalism intensified following the emergence of fascism in Italy. Indeed, the task of anti-fascists abroad was not only to curb Mussolinis’s propaganda within their respective immigrant communities, but also to help mobilize the Italian people against the <italic>Duce</italic>’s regime. Italian-born Luigi Antonini – the vice president of the US-based International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union and a former member of the Workers’ Party, the legal political arm of the Communist Party of America – confined himself to launching appeals to the Italian people on short-wave radio and to rallying Italian immigrants against fascism in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0014585813478925">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>A few returnees fought against Mussolini in Italy as well. A leading example was Erasmo Abate. A 17-year-old newcomer to Philadelphia in 1912, Abate became an active anarchist in the United States. For this reason, he was deported to his native country in 1922. Once he was back in Italy, he practiced the political ideals he had developed in America. In Ancona, he established the local section of the Arditi del Popolo (the people’s warriors), a paramilitary organization that fought against fascist storm troopers and vainly tried to prevent Mussolini’s rise to power. He also participated in an unsuccessful conspiracy to assassinate the Italian dictator in 1924 in retaliation for the murder of socialist member of Parliament Giacomo Matteotti, who had been kidnapped and killed by fascist secret agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0014585813478925">Avrich, 2005</xref>: 159–160).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0014585813478925">15</xref></sup> Another emigrant who had embraced anarchism in the United States, Michele Schirru, made his way back to Italy from the Bronx in 1931 for a fruitless and ill-conceived attempt at taking the <italic>Duce</italic>’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0014585813478925">Fiori, 1990</xref>). Schirru’s model was anarchist Gaetano Bresci, a Tuscan-born weaver who had spent several years working in Paterson’s silk mills, before repatriating to murder King Humbert I in 1900 to avenge the 80 victims of the repression in Milan 2 years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0014585813478925">Ferraris, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0014585813478925">Petacco, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Subversive emigrants and returnees antagonized fascism not only in their native country, but also in Spain, in response to the well-known slogan that Italian emigrant Carlo Rosselli had launched from Radio Barcelona: ‘Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy!’ (2001: 167–172). Italian-American radicals volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War on behalf of the legitimate Republican government, besides donating money to the anti-fascist forces in the Iberian peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0014585813478925">Ottanelli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0014585813478925">Ventresco, 1986</xref>: 20–21). Financial contributors included socialist Giacomo Battistoni, from Buffalo, New York, who sent Italian socialist leader Pietro Nenni US$100 for the Garibaldi Brigade (a group of mainly Italian combatants who took part in the defense of the Republic), and fundraisers such as communist Maria Belcastro, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and anarchist Giovanni Camillò, from Somerville, New Jersey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0014585813478925">16</xref></sup> A few expatriates from other countries joined the Italian-American fighters in Spain. They not only arrived from nearby nations such as France, Great Britain, and Switzerland, but also crossed the Atlantic from Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0014585813478925">Audenino and Bechelloni, 2009: 357–360</xref>).</p>
<p>Many emigrants, however, remained in their adoptive countries as long as the <italic>Duce</italic> stayed in power. What remained an auspice for most radical emigrants who continued to live abroad in the inter-war years turned into an actual opportunity, primarily for exiles in France after the 1943 fall of Mussolini’s regime. Several anti-fascists who had sought sanctuary across the Alps to escape police repression before the Second World War went back to Italy following the collapse of fascism in 1943 and joined the ranks of the partisans in the struggle for the liberation of Italy from German occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0014585813478925">Bechelloni, 2001: 226</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, many leaders of Italy’s post-war unions left the country during the fascist regime. Most prominent among them was Giuseppe Di Vittorio, the secretary general of the Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro from 1944 to 1957, who fled Italy in 1927 and spent his exile in France, Belgium, the Soviet Union, and Spain. In the latter he, too, fought on the side of the republican forces against Francisco Franco’s insurgents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0014585813478925">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Remarkably enough, the Second World War and the collapse of the fascist regime did not put an end to the emigrants’ contribution to radical politics in their native country. For instance, following his deportation to Italy at the beginning of McCarthyism in 1950, Calabrian-born Michele Salerno – the editor of the communist mouthpiece <italic>L’Unità del Popolo</italic> in New York and a veteran of the Spanish civil war – began to write for <italic>Paese Sera</italic>, a communist daily published in Rome and, therefore, plunged himself into Italy’s early Cold War political debate, providing a criticism of American capitalism that could seem more reliable and authoritative as it came from an eyewitness who had spent 27 years in the United States. Salerno had been a communist fellow traveler and a member of the party’s youth federation before emigrating in 1923, yet fascist authorities did not regard him as politically dangerous and let him leave the country with a regular passport. It was only in 1927 that his anti-fascist activities became evident in the eyes of the Italian consul general in New York City, who suggested that Salerno should be arrested in case he went back to Italy. Therefore, Salerno, too, underwent a process of radicalization in the United States. When he returned to Italy in 1950, he took with him a fully-fledged political consciousness that he had developed in America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0014585813478925">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The experience of Mattia Giurelli offers another case study. When he settled in Arnold, Pennsylvania in 1913 after landing in the United States, 16-year-old Giurelli was perhaps too young for radicalism. Yet contacts with the labor movement and subversive organizations while he was employed in a glass factory in Arnold and in textile plants in Paterson turned him into an activist, initially for the Industrial Workers of the World and then for the Textile Workers Union, as well as into a member of the Anti-Fascist Alliance of North America and the Mazzini Society, which similarly antagonized Mussolini. In the post-war years, Giurelli managed to become a small entrepreneur. But he never disavowed his radical orientation. In particular, he donated part of his profits to the establishment of a <italic>Casa del Popolo</italic>, a center for workers’ social and political meetings, in his birthplace, Porchiano del Monte in the province of Terni. Moreover, when he moved back to his native village in 1968, he founded a socialist club that was key to a project for the political reorganization and rebirth of this rural community that had undergone a decline following the end of sharecropping as the leading economic activity in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0014585813478925">Sorbini, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, not all emigrants were radicals; they also exerted a conservative influence on Italian politics. For instance, from Australia to Argentina and from Great Britain to the United States, Italians abroad backed the fascist invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, mobilized to prevent their governments from imposing sanctions on Mussolini’s regime, and even financed the <italic>Duce</italic>’s military machinery by donations of money usually disguised as contributions to the Italian Red Cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0014585813478925">Cresciani, 1979: 74–76</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0014585813478925">Goglia, 1996: 835, 852–862</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0014585813478925">Luconi, 2000</xref>: 85–111; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0014585813478925">Newton, 1994</xref>: 42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0014585813478925">Pretelli, 2010: 68–71</xref>). Likewise, against the backdrop of the Cold War, on the occasion of Italy’s 1948 parliamentary elections, Italian-Americans started a letter-writing campaign from the United States to urge their relatives and friends in Italy not to vote for the socialist and communist candidates of the Popular Front fusion ticket, which was eventually defeated by the Christian Democratic Party and the latter’s allies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0014585813478925">19</xref></sup> Antonini – who had grown increasingly conservative in the inter-war years – even summoned a press conference to show off a check in the sum of $50,000 for the election campaign of Italy’s Socialist Democratic Party, whose members had seceded from the Socialist Party, rejecting the political alliance with the communists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0014585813478925">Filippelli, 1992: 116–118</xref>).</p>
<p>These activities, however, took place outside Italy and did not involve the emigrants’ actual return to their native country. Specifically, in 1948 the US government tabled a proposal to exempt Italian-Americans from the provisions of the 1940 Nationality Act, which deprived naturalized Americans of US citizenship if they voted in foreign elections. The idea was to let the immigrants’ children cast their votes in the 1948 parliamentary elections for conservative candidates and, thereby, to enlist their help to prevent a victory of the Popular Front at the polls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0014585813478925"><italic>Italian Echo</italic>, 1948</xref>). But the State Department eventually decided to ignore this suggested scheme as it amounted to blatant political interference in a foreign country and was likely to be counterproductive for propaganda purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0014585813478925">Department of State, 1948</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0014585813478925" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As early as 1962 historian Ernesto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0014585813478925">Ragionieri (1962: 643)</xref> urged scholars to study Italian emigration as part of the ‘formation and growth of both the Italian and the international labor movement.’ Half a century later, however, it seems that only the second part of his suggestion has been pursued. The repeated calls for the adoption of a transnational perspective for a better understanding of Italian migrants’ political militancy have resulted in an almost unilateral development where, with few exceptions, historians have concentrated on the receiving milieu of the exodus from Italy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0014585813478925">20</xref></sup> As a consequence, the most investigated issue has long been how transnational connections facilitated the newcomers’ mobilization and accommodation within the labor movement and the political life in their adoptive countries, in part in an effort to test or dispel the thesis of the Italian people’s so-called amoral familism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0014585813478925">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, the scholarly debate over the impact of return migration on Italy has focused primarily on economic issues and lifestyles, and has overlooked the political repercussions and consequences of the homecoming. In particular, the leading historians in the field – Francesco Paolo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0014585813478925">Cerase (1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0014585813478925">2001</xref>), Dino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0014585813478925">Cinel (1991)</xref>, and Andreina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0014585813478925">De Clementi (1999)</xref> – have argued that conservatism meant the purchase of plots of land, which perpetuated the agrarian character especially of southern regions, and the resumption of traditional practices from food production to gender roles. Instead, innovation involved investing money in commercial or entrepreneurial activities and retaining the behavior that return migrants had practiced abroad. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0014585813478925">Franca Iacovetta (1992: 6)</xref>, the only significant change that the returnees could make was ‘transforming themselves from laborers or tenants into independent smallholders.’</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the political dimension of repatriation has hardly been addressed. Even scholars who have drawn upon the records of the Casellario Politico Centrale – the police files about radicals, subversives, and the opponents of the Italian government in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0014585813478925">Franzina, 1983</xref>) – have confined themselves to the socio-economic sphere and overlooked the political consequences of return migration. For instance, in a study about the return of radical emigrants to Calabria, Emilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0014585813478925">Bruno (2004)</xref> has elaborated a typology of the causes for their repatriation in terms of retirement, failure in the working experience abroad, and stimuli to invest savings in traditional or new economic activities. Her use of the police files about the radical returnees has not involved politics or labor militancy.</p>
<p>Indeed, the existing literature has not examined the former emigrants’ political activities once they went back home. As outlined in the introduction to this article, when some historians have dealt with the concerns of Treves, they have researched whether radicals left from areas of intense or restrained militancy and how the exodus affected the supply and demand dynamics of agricultural wages and, thereby, labor relations in rural areas. But studies in this field have generally paid scant attention to the impact of the returnees on the labor struggles and politics in their native areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0014585813478925">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, scholars of the Italian labor movement have generally regarded the years that leaders and activists spent abroad as mere side effects of their militancy, as if their experience outside their native country did not affect their activities significantly after repatriation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0014585813478925">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>An attempt at offering some ideas to fill such a gap in the current literature, this article has suggested that emigrants not only sent home money that was used to finance workers’ mutual aid societies, unions, political newspapers, and strikes while they were living abroad. Upon repatriation, they also plunged into the class warfare, enriching it by means of their experiences outside Italy. Therefore it can be reasonably suggested that, contrary to the gloomy prophecies from Treves, in the end, emigration turned out to be beneficial for the development of political consciousness and labor militancy in Italy.</p>
