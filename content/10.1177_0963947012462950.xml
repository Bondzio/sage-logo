<p><italic>Language and Style</italic>, edited by Dan McIntyre and Beatrix Busse, is a collection of essays demonstrating current trends and developments in the field of stylistics. The book is a tribute to Professor Mick Short (co-founder of PALA and founding editor of <italic>Language and Literature</italic>), whose work in stylistics has influenced countless practitioners in the field – not least the contributors of this edited collection. The aim of <italic>Language and Style</italic> is twofold: ‘to demonstrate current thinking at the cutting edge of the discipline’ and ‘to convey the practical means by which stylistic analysis can be carried out’ (p. 5). The book has a clear pedagogic focus and will appeal to students, teachers and researchers working in stylistics. The interdisciplinary nature of stylistics means that scholars from a range of literature and linguistics backgrounds would also benefit from this book, especially (but not limited to) those working in critical discourse analysis, corpus linguistics and cognitive linguistics.</p>
<p><italic>Language and Style</italic> is divided into three sub-sections based on genre: the stylistics of poetry (containing five chapters), the stylistics of drama (four chapters), and the stylistics of narrative fiction (14 chapters). These ‘carefully balanced broad sub-sections’ (p. 10) are said to be representative of current interests in stylistics, with drama having the fewest number of chapters in part because this is the most recent of the literary genres to have been studied by stylisticians, McIntyre and Culpeper argue, ‘did not have the tools with which to analyse dramatic texts’ (p. 204). The first chapter in each genre-based sub-section aims to provide an overview of developments in that particular area, or ‘a general stylistic analysis of a text from the genre in question’ (McIntyre and Busse, p. 11). Wales (Chapter 4) carries out an analysis of Walter de la Mare’s poem <italic>The Listeners</italic>, demonstrating how stylistics not only offers a ‘way in’ – providing the tools with which to analyse and describe poetic texts – but also helps to shed light on our responses to poetry; Munkelt (Chapter 9) critically evaluates the universal elements which underpin the stylistic study of drama; and Shen (Chapter 13) examines point of view and speech/thought presentation in different versions of a mini-narrative, exploring some of the ways in which linguistic choices affect meaning and interpretation. All of the remaining chapters within each sub-section exemplify a particular analytic technique using a text (or texts) from that genre. The introduction, by McIntyre and Busse, provides a short, but very informative, history of stylistics, summarising key developments in the field since its formalist beginnings at the turn of the 20th century. This is followed by a section entitled ‘Preliminaries’, which contains three chapters that are designed to give an overview of the ‘foundational principles of stylistics’ (p. 10), offering a useful starting point for the reader and helping to add a coherence to the remaining sections.</p>
<p>The first chapter, ‘Analysing Literature through Language: Two Shakespearean Speeches’, by Geoffrey Leech, begins by defining what is meant by the terms ‘style’ and ‘stylistics’. Whilst recognising that it is not possible to ‘neatly divide texts into those that are literary and those that are not’, stylisticians, Leech explains, seek to identify how (through parallelism, foregrounding and deviation, in its very broadest sense) ‘“literary” modes of writing make “extraordinary use of language”’ (p. 15). That is not to say, however, that stylistics is restricted to the study of literature alone (see, for instance, Busse’s multimodal analysis in Chapter 26 of a corpus of cover pages from the satirical magazine <italic>Private Eye</italic>) and Leech directs the reader to studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947012462950">Lesley Jeffries (e.g. 2010)</xref> for examples of stylistic analyses of non-literary works. What is made clear when reading through this first chapter (and when reading through <italic>Language and Style</italic> as a whole) is that stylistics as a discipline has evolved, moving away from the text as a discrete linguistic object, to a broader interest in the ‘mental representation and processing of texts’ (described as ‘the cognitive turn’) and to the socio-cultural context in which the text is produced and in which it is read (described as ‘the social turn’. Leech, p. 18). Examples of such contextualist approaches to stylistics are provided later in the book: Peter Verdonk, for example, draws on research in the cognitive sciences to explore rhetorical patterns in Ted Hughes’s Hawk Roosting (Chapter 5); Emmott and Alexander take a cognitive stylistic approach to examining reader manipulation in Agatha Christie’s <italic>Sparkling Cyanide</italic> (Chapter 18); Simpson uses cognitive and sociopragmatic models of analysis to explore style and point of view in a selection of prose fiction (Chapter 16); and Nørgaard offers a multimodal approach to examining literary texts, demonstrating how (non-linguistic) semiotic modes such as visual images, colour and layout all contribute to meaning-making within a specific socio-cultural context (Chapter 24). For his own study, however, Leech is very much grounded in the text ‘as a material linguistic object’ (p. 18), offering a practical stylistic analysis of two speeches in <italic>The Merchant of Venice</italic> to demonstrate how the lexicogrammatical choices and patterns serve a particular function. The analysis provides a clear example of how stylistics brings to light the relationship between linguistic fact, meaning and interpretation.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Beatrix Busse discusses recent trends in stylistics and modern historical linguistics, examining how these evolving fields are providing a wealth of new opportunities for examining historical texts. Chapter 3, ‘Methodologies for Stylistic Analysis: Practices and Pedagogies’ by Ron Carter, will be particularly useful for teachers, providing a general overview of some of the main approaches in stylistics. The preliminary chapters provide a sound grounding for what follows: a collection of innovative, empirically based studies which draw on a range of methods and theories to explore style. It is especially promising to see so many studies drawing on the tools and techniques of corpus linguistics, helping to establish corpus stylistics as a sub-discipline in its own right; see McIntyre (Chapter 10), Archer and Bousfield (Chapter 11), Walker (Chapter 20) and Mahlberg and Smith (Chapter 25). Other studies that draw on computational methods of analysis to measure the statistical significance of certain linguistic features include Hoover’s investigation of authorial style (Chapter 14) and Opas-Hänninen and Seppänen’s exploration of stance in romance and detective fiction (Chapter 15).</p>
<p>Geoff Hall provides a thought-provoking concluding chapter, ‘Stylistics, Linguistics and Literature: A Short Afterword’, reflecting on where stylistics began, how it has evolved and where it might go from here. Stylistics, Hall argues, is emerging as ‘a more assertive and confident stylistics’ (p. 504). Previously concerned with the linguistic analysis of text fragments and extracts, stylistics has now ‘proceeded to look at whole texts and genres of text’ (p. 504); it encompasses a wider range of literary (and non-literary) modes including drama, film and television; and it is concerned with the larger issues of reader response, interpretation, and the relationship between text and context. Changes in curriculum and an increase in combined language/literature programmes mean that stylistics is no longer on the periphery – a module that ‘doesn’t quite fit’ – rather, it is becoming an integral part of the English course. From my own experience of designing modules in stylistics for a combined literature/language degree, I have found that stylistics bridges disciplines, allowing students to identify crossovers between the theories and approaches examined in other modules (CDA, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and literary theory for example); it consolidates learning and provides a multi-perspectival approach to understanding how texts work and how texts make their meaning.</p>
<p>What is impressive from reading the various contributions to this edited collection is the range of analytical tools and techniques that are applied to the texts. In many ways, I think that the book might have been better if it were organised by methodology, rather than by genre. For one, the representative breakdown by genre may be a little misleading for students as the weightings could be viewed as indicative of where stylisticians place more emphasis or value. A student interested in the stylistics of drama, for example, might be put off by the lack of research represented here. One option might be to have equal weightings of each genre; however, this would still not help students to navigate their way around the many theories and methodologies that are showcased in the book. In the introduction, McIntyre and Busse suggest that that the analytical techniques used in each chapter can also be applied to non-literary texts; however, how this can be done is not always clear from the individual chapters and sometimes the methodology seems very specific to the text in question. By organising the book by methodology it might have been possible to demonstrate more clearly how the different techniques and theoretical frameworks can be transferred to different text types (both literary and non-literary), allowing the reader to consider the broader implications of adopting a particular type of analysis. As <italic>Language and Style</italic> has very clear pedagogic aims, a section on how teachers and students might use the book would also have been helpful, perhaps suggesting to the reader how they might utilise the different chapters in their teaching or how they might decide on a particular approach for their research, for instance.</p>
<p>These – what I consider to be very minor – issues aside, the diverse range of essays contained in <italic>Language and Style</italic> certainly provide inspiring examples of how style can be explored, providing useful case studies which can be adapted for the classroom or given as background reading. If the aim of stylistics is, in Carter’s words, ‘to provide a systematic set of analytical tools … that can foster insights into the patterning of literary texts in ways which allow those insights to be open, evidenced, and retrievable’ (p. 68), then <italic>Language and Style</italic> demonstrates exactly this.</p>
