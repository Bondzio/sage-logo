<abstract>
<p>While source separation of waste packaging materials for recycling is well established in several metropolitan areas, the collection of food waste from the households is less widespread because of its more difficult implementation. Source segregation of food waste in densely populated areas is raising new interest, as the availability of biogas following its anaerobic digestion (AD) paves the road to a number of possibilities, from electric energy production to its upgrading to biomethane and subsequent feeding in to the natural gas network or in vehicles as a fuel. The study addresses this waste management option by analysing a real metropolitan situation where food waste currently ends up mixed with the residual waste in a waste-to-energy plant (WTE). We assume to establish a new collection scheme for household food waste, followed by its treatment in a new AD and post-composting facility. A comparative life cycle assessment was carried out, where possible synergies between the existing WTE plant and the new one were evaluated. All new scenarios based on AD attained similar or better results compared with the reference scenario for almost all of the impact indicators. The most robust indication is related to global warming potential, with a potential improvement of up to 37%. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of the variation of the most relevant parameters. Results have proven to be very sensible to the hypothesis on the type of substituted electric energy. All the other examined sensitivities resulted in variations well below 10%.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The present article reports the major outcomes of research on the potential of the anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste in a large urban area, following the implementation of a new source separation scheme for such waste stream. The evaluation is based on a ‘life cycle thinking’ approach, with a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12453611">Finnveden et al., 2009</xref>) in particular, where the current situation is compared with a number of possible future scenarios. In order to rely on robust data representative of a real situation, the LCA is based on a case study of the municipality of Milan, in northern Italy. This is representative of a number of large, densely-populated metropolitan areas of Western Europe, where source separation is implemented for packaging waste (glass, paper, metals, plastics), while the organic fraction (food waste) is generally collected together with the residual waste (RW) destined to energy recovery in a dedicated waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. Such an approach derives from the following considerations. On the one hand, implementing a source separation scheme for food waste in densely-populated areas is challenging mainly because of the presence of blocks of flats with small-to-medium size apartments, where storing such a putrescible waste fraction might prove annoying; on the other hand, the WTE plant for RW, if it exists, is always based on a moving grate furnace—a flexible technology which allows the presence of a certain amount of food waste together with RW. This might be a driver for keeping the current waste-management system as it is, without the risk of subtracting a relevant amount of waste to the WTE plant.</p>
<p>In recent years, a growing interest in AD as an alternative process for the treatment of food waste has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12453611">Curry and Pillay, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12453611">Digman and Kim, 2008</xref>). This is driven mainly, at least in Italy, by the strict law requirement for target overall source separation levels, set to 65% by the end of 2012. In the municipality of Milan, in 2009 the overall source separation level reached 34% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12453611">ISPRA, 2011</xref>), with a minor contribution from the organic fraction of waste (food + green) representing only 15% of the total source separated waste (27 kg in.<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>). It is clear that compliance with such a challenging law requirement can be obtained only if food waste, being a relevant fraction of the gross waste (ranging approximately from 25 to 35% in weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12453611">Christensen, 2011</xref>) is separated at the source.</p>
<p>When it comes to the technologies adopted for the treatment of the organic fraction, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12453611">ISPRA (2011)</xref> an impressive growing trend is observed in Italy for AD followed by post-composting, from 63,000 tonnes treated in 2005 to 450,000 in 2009 (roughly +600%). This is not yet happening at the expense of composting, which is also increasing owing to the huge amount of food waste collected separately (in Italy, food waste is the most relevant flux of source separated waste, higher than paper and glass), but is indicating a clear trend that will likely affect the relevant ratio of the two technologies in the near future. This also because aside from new AD plants being constructed, a number of them have actually been derived from the revamping of existing composting plants, where a new AD section is constructed and the existing aerobic facility is utilised for post-composting of the digestate. Such an operation allows also for a significant increase of the food waste treatment capacity of the plant, which can be threefold.</p>
<p>A final, but not irrelevant, aspect of this trend is related to an economic issue, where electric energy produced from biogas is highly subsidised, especially for small-sized plants. This is a key aspect to overcome the traditional limitations and concerns related to the sale of compost and guarantee a more interesting return on investment.</p>
<p>The availability of biogas paves the road to a number of possibilities for the recovery of its energy content, starting from the simple electric energy production to more sophisticated utilisation, such as feeding it into the natural gas network or using it as a fuel for vehicles. In the latter cases, the preliminary upgrading of biogas to biomethane is required because the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> is not acceptable in either case. It has to be realised that the utilisation of biomethane is still limited, at least in Italy, for a number of reasons. Among those reasons, we cite the large subsidies currently granted to electric energy production only, as well as the cost to upgrade to biogas, which is justified only for large-scale installations, as it would be the one envisaged in the present article.</p>
<p>Very few studies have approached a similar assessment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12453611">Curry and Pillay (2012)</xref> have investigated the feasibility of urban AD as an alternative to landfilling, presenting a case study for small-scale AD system design for an urban building. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12453611">Khoo et al. (2010)</xref> applied a LCA to compare different scenarios of food waste treatment for Singapore, where, once again, the major emphasis is on finding an alternative to landfill. The major findings of the study are that small-scale composting can be recommended as a way to divert food waste away from incinerators, but a significant reduction of global warming impacts can be realised by implementing the food waste AD recycling process.</p>
<p>The novel approach of the present work is to utilise a LCA to evaluate food waste diversion and proper treatment not as an alternative, but as a complementary step to the existing waste-management scheme. In particular, the focus is on how the existing WTE plant designed for RW treatment might be affected by the diversion of such a relevant flux, and what kind of synergies can be put in place between the two facilities. In this sense, the proposed alternative scenarios are based on a newly-built, large-scale, centralised AD plant located close to the existing WTE plant, so that residues from the pre-treatment of food waste might be routed to energy recovery in the latter. In one of the scenarios, the thermal side of the WTE plant, where the biogas is utilised within the thermodynamic cycle for electricity production, is further explored. Other scenarios are based on internal combustion engines (ICE) for heat and power generation from biogas combustion, as well as the utilisation of biomethane as an alternative to natural gas in the distribution network and to diesel fuel for road transport.</p>
<p>The results of this evaluation might be of help in all those situations where large municipalities equipped with a WTE plant for energy recovery from RW decide to implement new source collection schemes for food waste from the households.</p>

<title>Definition of scenarios</title>
<p>Two main scenarios are defined: the first one represents the current situation of waste management in the municipality of Milan (‘Scenario 0’, based on data published by the Province of Milan in 2008); the second one is the future implementation of a new, separated collection scheme for the household food waste (‘Scenario 1’). Four sub-scenarios are then defined for Scenario 1, according to four different biogas utilisation routes:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12453611" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Scenario 1A: ICE for combined heat and power (CHP) production, with 40.8% electric and 41.7% thermal efficiency; part of the electricity and heat are utilised to support the internal consumption of the AD and post-composting processes;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Scenario 1B: combustion in an auxiliary boiler integrated with the WTE plant to improve the steam parameters before entering the turbine, thus allowing an increase in the electric energy conversion efficiency;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Scenario 1C: upgrading to biomethane through the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> with amine scrubbing and feeding it into the natural gas distribution network;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Scenario 1D: upgrading to biomethane through the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> with amine scrubbing and its use as a fuel in vehicle transportation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12453611">Figure 1</xref> shows the waste flows in Scenario 0, where a minor amount of food waste is actually collected, but only from large users (canteens, street markets), and sent to a composting plant. Other fluxes are reported for sake of clarity (source-separated packaging materials, bulky waste, road-cleaning), but they will not be accounted for as they are outside the boundaries of the system. It was, in fact, assumed that the implementation of the new collection scheme for food waste would not affect such streams, but only the quantity and characteristics of the RW.</p>

</fig>
<p>Scenario 1 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12453611">Figure 2</xref>, where food waste collection from households is implemented with a kerbside scheme and the use of biodegradable bags. In the base case, a 60% sorting efficiency rate was hypothesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12453611">Giugliano et al., 2011</xref>) pending the modification of such parameter in the sensitivity analysis. The sorting efficiency defines how much of the material fraction is segregated into the defined sorting fraction in average. In this scenario, all collected food waste (from large users and from household) is delivered to a newly constructed AD + post-composting plant for biogas and compost production. Residues from the pre-treatment prior to AD are routed back to the WTE plant mixed with the RW.</p>

<p>The performances of the existing WTE plant in Scenario 0 are based on real data derived from the ‘Silla 2’ plant. This is a mass-burn, moving grate-type incineration plant serving the municipality of Milan, equipped with three identical parallel lines and operated on a CHP mode with 24.2% electric and 5.5% thermal efficiencies on an average yearly basis. Data refer to 2008 and are reported, together with a detailed description of the plant and of all its major parameters, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12453611">Turconi et al. (2011)</xref>. For Scenario 1, the performances were modelled by means of a proprietary simulation program named GS, currently developed at the Department of Energy of Politecnico di Milano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12453611">Chiesa and Macchi, 2002</xref>) and formerly at Princeton University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12453611">Consonni, 1992</xref>). GS has been used to simulate a variety of WTE technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12453611">Consonni and Viganò, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12453611">Consonni et al., 2005</xref>) and has always been in very good agreement with actual performances.</p>
<p>In Scenarios 1A, 1C and 1D, a GS model of Milano Silla 2 plant has been used, assuming no change in the yearly average plant load with respect to Scenario 0, but according to the new mix of treated waste, which accounts for the reduction of the food waste and the addition of residues from AD pre-treatment.</p>
<p>Scenario 1B assumes all the hypotheses used for Scenario 1, except for the adoption of an innovative thermodynamic cycle configuration, in which the WTE plant is integrated with an external auxiliary boiler fired with the biogas from AD. This boiler increases the superheating temperature of the steam generated by the WTE plant ahead of its utilisation in the steam turbine. It adopts a very high recuperative combustion air pre-heating in order to optimise the utilisation of the biogas. Moreover, as its thermal input is relevant (on a biogas lower heating value (LHV) basis it amounts to about 12.5% of the thermal input of the WTE plant), an enhanced thermal cycle with increased evaporating pressure has been considered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12453611">Figure 3</xref> represents the energy balances of the WTE plant for Scenario 0 and Scenario 1B. The electricity production increases very much as a consequence of the additional steam superheating. The GS model of the integrated system (WTE plant + auxiliary boiler) predicts an energy efficiency increase of about 18% with respect to Scenario 0. Although this innovative configuration can be considered quite uncommon, we believe in its feasibility, as it involves only widely-proven technologies.</p>

</fig>
<p>The modelling of the AD process was carried out by evaluating mass and energy balances of some of the most recent plants operating in Italy and Europe. As a result, a wet process was selected, with 22 days of residence time in the digester and the production of 600 m<sup>3</sup> of biogas per tonne of volatile solids. Biogas is composed of methane (60%)—the rest being mainly CO<sub>2</sub> and other minor components. Such figures are in line with what reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12453611">Banks et al. (2011)</xref> and derived from the long-term monitoring of an anaerobic digester fed with food waste. Digestate is aerobically post-composted to obtain a final product fulfilling the Italian law requirements for utilisation in agriculture. A simplified mass balance of the AD + post-composting process is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12453611">Figure 4</xref>. Residues are routed to the existing WTE plant, together with the RW. Their characteristics (composition, heating value, etc.) are very difficult to be determined accurately and no reliable information can be found in the literature. However, they are contaminants of the food waste; thus, they are composed mainly of other waste fractions—paper, plastics, etc. Moreover, in the considered scenario they represent a minor part of the WTE plant feedstock (about 30,000 t/y out of about 363,000 t/y, i.e. 8%). Thus, good performance predictions for the WTE plant can also be determined on the basis of a rough estimate of the properties of these residues. A reasonable guess has been adopted by considering their composition equal to the one of RW.</p>

<p>The biogas is directly utilised for energy production (Scenarios 1A and 1B) following the simple removal of moisture and traces of H<sub>2</sub>S, or upgraded to biomethane thanks to the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> by means of amine scrubbing (Scenarios 1C and 1D). As a general approach, all future scenarios were designed in such a way that AD + post-composting process was self-sustained by electric and thermal energy produced by ICE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12453611">Figure 5</xref> for Scenario 1A); this means that in Scenarios 1C and 1D only a fraction (69% and 64% respectively) of the biogas is upgraded to biomethane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12453611">Figure 6</xref> for Scenario 1C). Such a difference is related to the different requirements for biomethane compression prior to its final utilisation. For introduction in the national grid (Scenario 1C) 5 bar is required, while utilisation as a fuel (Scenario 1D) requires 250 bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12453611">Regione Lombardia, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Transport for the newly-established food waste collection system was included in all sub-scenarios of Scenario 1, with a specific value of 12 km per tonne derived from an experimentation carried out by AMSA (the waste management operator) in some districts of the city of Milan. No organisational changes were assumed for RW collection in future scenarios, thus leading to an increased specific distance for Scenario 1 [21 km t<sup>−1</sup>, as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12453611">Giugliano et al. (2011)</xref>] compared with Scenario 0 (15 km t<sup>−1</sup>) simply because of the lower amount of collected material. It has to be noted that the optimisation of the RW collection system following the introduction of food waste source separation might lead to a decrease of RW collection frequency, which was not considered at this stage.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X12453611">
<title>LCA modelling</title>
<p>LCA was carried out by means of the Simapro 7 software, developed by PRé Consultants. Two characterisation methods were adopted: the cumulative energy demand (CED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12453611">Hischier et al., 2010</xref>) to calculate the total energy demand; and the CML 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12453611">Guinée et al., 2001</xref>) to evaluate the environmental impacts. In this second method, the following indicators have been selected: global warming potential (GWP100), human toxicity potential (HTP), acidification potential (AP), and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). This choice was based on the central role of energy production from waste of the modelled systems (which justifies the CED) and on the extreme importance of air pollution impacts for places like the Po Valley in Northern Italy, where Milan is located.</p>
<p>It has to be clearly stated that the impact on water has deliberately not been taken into consideration in this study, and this is a limitation to be noted when considering the results.</p>
<p>Functional unit was defined as the total amount of food waste and RW produced in one year, assumed to be constant in all scenarios and equal to 504,000 tonnes. System boundaries include only the two mentioned waste fractions. All remaining waste streams were not included, being supposed identical in all scenarios and then mutually excluding in a comparative LCA. The system boundaries include all treatment processes from the moment the two waste fractions are collected until they leave the system as an emission (solid, liquid or gas) or as a secondary raw material, following the ‘zero burden assumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12453611">Ekvall et al., 2007</xref>). For this reason, the production of biodegradable bags for food waste collection was included, being strictly related to Scenario 1 only. Waste collection, treatment, recovery and final disposal of all residues were included.</p>
<p>As for the life cycle inventory, in addition to the information supplied in the section devoted to the definition of scenarios, the following assumptions were made.</p>
<p>Composting in Scenario 0 was modelled according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12453611">Blengini (2008)</xref>, with a traditional windrow technology characterised by 65 kWh of electric consumption and about 400 kg of compost production per tonne of input material. Two hundred and eighty litres of leachate are produced and treated in a waste water treatment plant, as well as 166 kg of residues that are disposed in a landfill situated at a distance of 100 km. Produced compost is delivered to the final users at an average distance of 15 km, while exhaust air from the active composting phase is treated with a biofilter, whose corresponding emission factors were taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12453611">Grosso et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In all scenarios, stack emission factors, and residues-specific production and management for the WTE plant are derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12453611">Turconi et al. (2011)</xref>, and include recovery of iron and aluminium from bottom ash and recycling of its inert fraction, as well as the recovery of salts from air pollution control residues following the treatment of flue gas with sodium bicarbonate. Transport distances are included in the range 25–100 km according to the different destinations.</p>
<p>Based on information gathered from commercial suppliers of ICE and from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12453611">Eder and Schulz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12453611">Walla and Schneeberge, 2008</xref>), energy conversion efficiency was assumed 40.8% for electricity and 41.7% for heat. The same sources were utilised for stack emission factors. Biodegradable bag production (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12453611">Novamont (2010))</xref> includes the utilisation of corn starch and water (3.4 kg and 37 l per tonne of collected food waste respectively), the consumption of electric energy (43.5 kWh per tonne of collected food waste) and the production of residues disposed in a landfill (0.3 kg per tonne of collected food waste) transported at a distance of 100 km.</p>
<p>Cases of multifunctionality were resolved by expanding the system boundaries to also include avoided primary productions due to material and energy recovery from waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12453611">European Commission Joint Research Center – Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12453611">Finnveden et al. 2009</xref>). Avoided processes and products include electric and thermal energy displaced thanks to the corresponding production of the WTE plant (for all scenarios) and of the ICE (where present), as well as peat and fertilisers displaced by compost. For electricity in particular the thermoelectric Italian mix was assumed as of 2007 [composed of coal (18%), fuel oil (9%), natural gas (10%) and natural gas in a combined cycle (63%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12453611">Terna, 2008</xref>)], while for heat the one produced by natural gas fed household boilers with 87% thermal efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12453611">Giugliano et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12453611">Centemero (2010)</xref>, who has reported the current situation of compost utilisation in Italy, we have assumed that 25% of the produced compost is used in garden centres in substitution of peat, 68% in agriculture in substitution of mineral fertilisers with the same content of nutrients (N, P and K) and 7% in environmental restorations without substituting anything. The modelling approach is the one adopted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12453611">Giugliano et al. (2011)</xref>, also assuming an average transport distance of 50 km for the compost.</p>
<p>Upgrading of biogas is carried out through amine scrubbing, leading to a biomethane with 99% purity and CH<sub>4</sub> leakage of 0.0006 m<sup>3</sup> per 1 m<sup>3</sup> of treated biogas.</p>
<p>In Scenarios 1C and 1D, biomethane substitutes the same quantity of natural gas of fossil origin and of diesel fuel, respectively—the latter being accounted for in terms of the equivalent amount of energy.</p>

<p>An overall positive picture is obtained for all scenarios, including the current one (Scenario 0) thanks to the performance of the Silla 2 WTE plant. When implementing the food waste collection and its treatment in an AD plant (Scenario 1), no dramatic change in the results was observed compared with Scenario 0, and possibly some differences are included within the inherent uncertainty of any LCA study applied to complex systems such as waste management. Keeping in mind this consideration, we can state that the integration of AD in the current framework will not worsen the energy and environmental balances, but might actually contribute to further improvement of the performances of the system, which is more robust for Scenarios 1A and 1B and for the GWP indicator. Scenarios 1C and 1D, based on biogas upgrading to biomethane, suffer the limits of the substitution of a clean fuel (the natural gas), which results modest when compared with the substitution of electric energy produced from a mix containing a certain fraction of coal and oil.</p>
<p>The most relevant negative contributions are those of the WTE plant, including the routing of AD residues followed by AD (it has to be noted that in Scenario 1B biogas utilisation is actually credited to the WTE plant because of the design of the scenario). Positive contributions are modest when compared with negative ones, and include waste collection and transport, as well as biodegradable bag production.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The decrease in the sorting efficiency of food waste (SA1) does not affect significantly the performances of the corresponding Scenario 1, with a maximum difference of 6% for HTP in 1A. The variations are not univocal, as GWP and CED are always worsening, while other indicators show better or worse results according to the specific sub-scenario. In general, the lower biogas production is only partially compensated by the increased energy production in the WTE plant. In comparison with Scenario 0, the majority of indicators result better, thus suggesting that a possible overestimation of the amount of collected food waste might be acceptable.</p>
<p>When operating with an increased heat production of the WTE, at the expense of electric energy (SA2), very minor variations are observed (below 5%). Scenario 1B worsens, while Scenarios 1C and 1D improve or remain nearly unchanged (for the AP). With the sole exception of AP for Scenarios 1C and 1D, a noteworthy improvement with respect to Scenario 0 is observed.</p>
<p>A different electric energy substitution, based on highly efficient combined cycle power plants (SA3), leads to a dramatic worsening for acidification (around -90%), as well as for GWP and POCP, with a value of roughly half. Nevertheless, final values remain on the negative side, meaning that the whole management system is still beneficial for the environment. Similar considerations apply to the comparison with Scenario 0.</p>
<p>Finally, if produced compost needs to be transported long distances to find customers (SA4), the effect on the results is modest and the relative ranking of scenarios 1 remains unchanged. Scenario 1 still performs better than Scenario 0, with few exceptions represented by AP and POCP in Scenarios 1C and 1D.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>New options for food waste collection and management in a densely-populated metropolitan situation were analysed, with the aim of evaluating possible synergies with the existing facilities and, in particular, with the WTE plant devoted to the treatment of RW. The current situation in the municipality of Milan was considered as the starting point, where food waste is collected to a minor extent and from large users only (canteens, street markets), and subsequently composted. In such a context, we have assumed to establish a new collection scheme for household food waste, followed by its treatment in a new AD + post-composting facility. A comparative LCA between the current situation and some alternative scenarios was then carried out, where possible synergies between the existing WTE plant and the new AD one were evaluated, such as the routing of the food waste pre-treatment residues to the WTE plant and, for some scenarios, the utilisation of biogas within the thermodynamic cycle for electricity production in the WTE plant. Other scenarios were based on the upgrading of biogas to biomethane and its feeding in the natural gas network or utilisation as a fuel for vehicles.</p>
<p>All future scenarios based on AD resulted in similar or even better performances than the current situation for almost all the evaluated environmental impact indicators. The best outcomes pertain to the cases of biogas utilization in traditional ICEs producing heat and power, as well as for the superheating of the steam produced by the WTE plant that treats all the remaining RW, according to an advanced arrangement of the thermodynamic cycle. The GWP indicator is the most affected by such an improvement.</p>
<p>Scenarios based on biogas upgrading, despite still being beneficial, suffer the limits of the sole substitution of relatively clean fuels, with modest results when compared with the substitution of electric energy from a mix that, despite being heavily unbalanced towards natural gas, still contains a certain fraction of coal and oil.</p>
<p>Finally, sensitivity analyses on the most critical parameters were implemented, which showed that only the hypotheses on electric energy substitution affect the results significantly. All the other sensitivities resulted in variations well below 10%.</p>
