        <p><italic>Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can
            find information on it.</italic></p>
        <p>Samuel Johnson, quoted in <italic>Boswell’s Life of Johnson</italic></p>
      </disp-quote></p>
    <p>What is the purpose of <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic>? Our concern as an editorial team
      is to publish articles that make <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic> a destination of choice
      for readers to, as Samuel Johnson says, ‘find information’ about palliative care that is
      robust and relevant. The reason for this editorial is to highlight to you, our authors,
      reviewers and readers, how we are evolving to meet your needs in changing clinical, and
      research, publishing and dissemination environments.</p>
    <p>The overarching purpose of the journal has changed little since its inception in 1987 and is
      probably best articulated in the way we position the journal in our instructions to authors: <disp-quote>
        <p>Palliative Medicine <italic>is a scholarly research journal dedicated to improving
            knowledge and clinical practice in the palliative care of patients with far advanced
            disease. It reflects the multi-disciplinary and multi-professional approach that is the
            hallmark of effective palliative care. Papers are selected for publication based on
            their scientific excellence, contribution to knowledge, and their importance to
            contemporary palliative care. We welcome papers relating to palliative care clinical
            practice, policy, theory and methodological knowledge.</italic></p>
      </disp-quote>
    </p>
    <p>As we evolve, we have no intention of amending this purpose; it serves us well. It highlights
      what we feel are the key features of this journal: a focus on high-quality research,
      contemporary clinical utility and broad perspectives. Perhaps, the only aspect not explicitly
      encapsulated in this statement is our international focus and a desire to publish research
      that has wide-ranging relevance across the globe. We try to meet this purpose in the best way
      we can, reflecting the many changes that have occurred within palliative care in the last 25
      years. We highlight below three areas of development in management, strategy and
      processes.</p>

      <title>New Editorial Board and Editorial Advisory Board</title>
      <p>We are delighted to warmly welcome two new members, Dr Nathan Cherny and Dr Jenny van der
        Steen, who are joining our Editorial Board and Dr Henrik Støvring who has already joined as
        our statistical editor. Dr Cherny is Norman Levan Chair of Humanistic Medicine and Director
        of Cancer Pain and Palliative Medicine, Department of Oncology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center,
        Jerusalem, Israel. He also chairs the European Society of Medical Oncology Palliative Care
        Working Group. He brings wide-ranging international expertise in palliative care within
        oncology to the journal. Dr van der Steen works at the EMGO<sup>+</sup> Institute for Health
        and Care Research, one of the interfaculty research institutes of the VU University Medical
        Centre Amsterdam and the VU University Amsterdam. She brings epidemiological expertise, with
        particular interests in dementia- and nursing-home care. We have also created the position
        of statistical editor, a new departure for the journal. Dr Støvring works at the Department
        of Public Health – Institute of Biostatistics at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. We look
        forward to the new perspectives and insights these new board members bring to the journal,
        together with our refreshed Editorial Advisory Board. We have appointed a number of new
        editorial advisory board members to reflect the changing nature of palliative care globally.
        The full details are on our website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pmj.sagepub.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://pmj.sagepub.com/</ext-link>. Thank you to all
        editors and board members past, present and future, but particularly to Dr Nicholas
        Christakis and Dr Franco De Conno who are standing down from the board.</p>

      <title>New ways of making your work visible</title>
      <p>We choose to publish the highest possible quality of research relevant to the palliative
        care field that is submitted to us. We know that many of the articles we publish are highly
        cited and well downloaded, and we use that as the best proxy we have for relevance to our
        readers. It is fair to say we were disappointed with this year’s slight dip in our impact
        factor, but with a journal of this size and scope recognise that just a few very highly
        cited articles leaving the impact factor window can make this difference.</p>
      <p>What we have changed, which we hope will make a real impact on the visibility, citations
        and downloads of the future, is a clear strategy to improve the visibility of the articles
        we publish, so that they are easy to search for and find. This work starts with our authors,
        as we actively review titles, abstracts and keywords with them. Our abstracts are now
        structured, so that the key information readers need is quickly retrievable, and we pay
        equal attention to appropriate titles and keywords. Our aim is that however readers choose
        to search the literature they will find relevant research published in <italic>Palliative
          Medicine</italic>.</p>
      <p>We also have an active social media presence on Twitter <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/palliativemedj" xlink:type="simple">
        @palliativemedj</ext-link> and Facebook. We encourage you to interact with us using these media, and we post daily
        updates on the research we publish. We also contribute regularly to the EAPC blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eapcnet.wordpress.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://eapcnet.wordpress.com/</ext-link>), with authors of selected articles discussing
        their work; this blog is freely available on the EAPC website.</p>

      <title>New ways of meeting the needs of authors, reviewers and readers</title>
      <p>We want to encourage you to submit your highest quality research that is likely to have a
        major impact on palliative care practice, policy or theory to us. We know that we have to
        provide you with the best possible service to encourage new, and retain existing, authors.
        We have therefore set ourselves new deadlines for our decision-making processes to improve
        the turnaround time for submitted manuscripts. We are also starting to run regular special
        editions starting from next year. Forthcoming special editions will focus on family carers
        and the palliative care of those with non-malignant disease, and we are still inviting
        submissions for these (see our website for more details). We will be working more closely
        with reviewers to support them in their work and are planning to run a reviewer workshop in
        2013.</p>
      <p>We look forward to continuing to meet the needs of the palliative care community and, as
        ever, are delighted to enter into dialogue with our authors, reviewers and readers about how
        we can best do this.</p>
