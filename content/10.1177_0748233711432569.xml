<p>Widely used fungicides and pesticides are known to have profound effect on several nontarget organisms, which is a cause of concern. The present study aims to demonstrate the effect of a fungicide, Thiovit<sup>®</sup> Jet on the structure of epidermal microtrichia (trichome) of the dorsal thorax in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. External morphology and structural variations of thoracic appendages have been extensively studied using scanning electron microscope from flies treated with different concentrations of Thiovit Jet (20, 30, 40 or 200 μg/ml). Similar to the effect of other fungicides like captan and captafol which are reported to produce somatic mutations in the same organism, the present study successfully demonstrates variation in the trichome/microtrichia structure of the dorsal thorax of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Structural variations were observed to be associated with different concentrations of Thiovit Jet (30, 40 and 200 μg/ml), but the maximum notable change was found with 40 μg/ml treatment. The gross abnormality in the trichome structure may be due to mutation in proteins associated with normal cuticular deposition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fungicides are chemical compounds used to kill fungus or fungal spores causing serious damage to agriculture. Along with its native role, fungicides can act on nontarget organisms as well. Several research works have shown that fungicides cause deleterious effects on both invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates like <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711432569">Jones et al., 1996</xref>),<italic> Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711432569">Mathew and Al-Doori, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711432569">Pai, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711432569">Perocco et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711432569">Rahden-Staron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711432569">Vargová et al., 1980</xref>) and vertebrates like humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711432569">Hrelia et al., 1996</xref>) have been found to be sensitive to various fungicides. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been in use in environmental monitoring studies either as a target or as a nontarget organism of environmental chemicals. Use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> was recommended by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods ((ECVAM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711432569">Festing et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711432569">Mathew and Al-Doori (1976)</xref> used mercuric fungicide in the food medium and observed a significant increase in sex-linked recessive lethals. Similar results with organomercurial fungicide treatment in <italic>D.</italic> <italic>melanogaster </italic>are reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711432569">Gayathri and Krishnamurthy (1985)</xref>. Their interesting findings show that the fungicides, when administered in larval diet failed to induce significant dominant lethal or sex-linked recessive lethals or translocations, whereas when administered in adult diet were found to elicit significant mutagenic responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711432569">Pai (1983)</xref> reported that dietary administration of a fungicide fenaminosulf at 10 mg/100 ml dose failed to induce mutagenicity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711432569">Vogel (1975)</xref>, this lack of mutagenicity could be due to the presence of drug metabolizing enzyme in <italic>Drosophila</italic> similar to those of mammals. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711432569">Vargová et al. (1980)</xref> could not show any mutagenic effect with the fungicide trymorphamide in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711432569">Hemavathy and Krishnamurthy (1989)</xref> were successful in describing the mutagenic potential of Cuman-L, a dithiocarbamate fungicide. Interestingly, the fungicides captan and captafol are reported to cause somatic mutation in wing cells of <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711432569">Rahden-Staron, 2002</xref>). Earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711432569">Binnington (1985)</xref> reported the ultrastructural changes on larval cuticle of sheep blowfly on treatment with diflubenzuron and polyoxin D.</p>
<p>Historically, fungicides are used for the control of powdery mildew, rust and mites in pome and stone fruit, citrus, grapevines, kiwifruit, strawberries and some vegetables. Thiovit<sup>®</sup> Jet is a registered product of Syngenta India and its active constituent is 80% elemental sulphur. It is a unique micronised sulphur formulation, wettable with spherical particles that mix easily with water to form a spray with good spreading and sticking properties. It is classified as a fungicide/miticide and is used for the control of powdery mildew, rust, mites, aphids and thrips in pome and stonefruit, citrus, grapevines, kiwifruit, strawberries, apples, tomatoes and vegetables.</p>
<p>The maximum residual level (MRL) of sulphur, the active ingredient of Thiovit, was reported to be 50 mg/kg in fruits such as citrus fruits, pomes, berries and strawberries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711432569">EU Pesticides Database, 2005</xref>). However, more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711432569">Nasr (2010)</xref> reported 15.83 and 19.98 ppm of deposit of sulphur in and on tomato and squash, respectively, 1 h after plants at fruiting stage were sprayed with sulphur at the rate of 250 g/100 L. The residues were decreased to 10.88 and 12.31 ppm, with a loss of 31.26 and 38.38% within the first 24 h after application. The residues dropped to 9.37, 7.01, 3.15 and 1.97 ppm with a loss of 40.80, 55.71, 80.10 and 87.55% after 3, 7, 10 and 15 days, respectively, from treatment of tomato. These findings very well demonstrate the fact that Thiovit-sprayed fruits would never pose a risk for human consumption but the effect of such chemical on nontarget insects are still to be explored.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors tried to elucidate the effect of Thiovit Jet on the structure of dorsal thoracic epidermal derivatives, with special emphasis on thoracic trichomes in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>(Oregon R strain), thereby aiming to explore the effect of a chemical on a nontarget organism. The insect integument is made of monolayer of epidermal (hypodermal) cells and most of the signalling pathways that are responsible for epidermis morphogenesis therefore take place in two-dimensional space. The protective property of the insect integument is achieved by a complex extracellular structure referred to as cuticle. Several generations of geneticists have been able to identify determinants of the fly development, leading to the discovery of many genetic networks regulating embryonic development on the basis of the fact that the cuticular extensions that decorate the external surface of <italic>Drosophila</italic> maintains a fixed stereotyped pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711432569">Payre, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the large bristles, variably called macrochaetae, macrosetae, bristles or setae, and small bristles, variably called microchaetae, setulae or hairs, which are sensory in origin, are found to cover the body externally. Along with them, there are trichomes or microtrichiat, which are merely cuticular processes secreted by the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711432569">Simpson et al., 1999</xref>). While concentrating on the trichome formation, it is seen that cells that would form trichome, start to accumulate actin filaments in a focus, at the apex. These microfilaments are then bundled in an apical cone that grows perpendicular to the cell surface and would ultimately support the epidermal extension. Trichomes thus result from the control of apical cell shape that occurs during epidermal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711432569">Dickinson and Thatcher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711432569">Payre, 2004</xref>). Thereby any structural change in the trichome would definitely add knowledge on the adverse effects of xenobiotics on the development of the adult epidermal structures.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The effect of fungicide, Thiovit Jet on epidermal microtrichia (trichome) of the dorsal thorax (scutum and scutellum) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> was studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using SEM (S-530 HITACHI, Japan), for the study of external morphology and variations in these structures.</p>
<sec id="section3-0748233711432569">
<title>Preparation for scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>Adult flies were collected randomly from each treatment groups in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for fixation and then dried in graded alcohol. Next, samples were dried at critical point temperature in the CPD machine (HCP-2 HITACHI, Japan) and gold coating was done using IB-2 Ion Coater (EIKO ENGINEERING, Japan). Thereafter the samples were analyzed under SEM.<disp-quote>

<title>Treatment of insects</title>
<p>Different concentrations (20, 30, 40, 200 μg/ml) of Thiovit Jet (containing 80% w/w sulphur) of Syngenta were made using water and mixed with <italic>Drosophila</italic> food medium containing agar, corn meal, sugar and yeast. A total of 50 eggs were introduced to food containing different concentrations of Thiovit Jet along with control, where only normal food constituents were present. The eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were kept to grow in respective food medium until the emergence of flies. The whole developmental cycle was carried out at a regulated temperature of 22±1°C. All the treatments were carried out in triplicate. The adult flies were taken for SEM study. </p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Several sensory and nonsensory appendages cover the external surface of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. These can be large bristles and small bristles variably called microsetae, macrosetae, setulae or trichomes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711432569">Simpson et al. (1999)</xref>, both types of bristles are sensory organs and are distinct from trichomes or microtrichia that are merely cuticular processes secreted by the epidermal cells. In the present context, treatment with Thiovit Jet resulted in structural variations in the epidermal derivatives. We have confined our investigation to the effect of Thiovit Jet on the nonsensory epidermal derivatives like trichome or microtrichia on the dorsal thorax particularly.</p>
<p>The adult normal <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> shows a definite pattern of organized arrangements of trichome covering the dorsal scutum and scutellum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711432569">Figure 1</xref> shows the dorsolateral thorax with microchaete, macrochaete and trichomes dispersed in a properly organized alignment which is seen to be thoroughly disrupted in a fly treated with 40 µg/ml Thiovit Jet. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711432569">Figure 2</xref> showing the dorsolateral view of the treated insect reveals a definite intercalation and mesh-like network formation arising due to loss of discrete pattern of arrangement of trichomes over the thorax. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233711432569">Figure 3</xref> shows the normal pattern of trichome arrangement and a complete change is visible due to 40 μg/ml treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748233711432569">Figure 4</xref>. A ×1000 magnification clearly shows the change in the structure of trichomes due to treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748233711432569">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748233711432569">6</xref> under ×3000 magnification show the sensory base of microchaete appearing as a socket from which the microchaete arises adjacent to the sensory bristles. The fine trichomes projecting from epidermis are seen to be discrete and separate from one another, maintaining a definite orientation. Flies at the low concentration of 20 μg/ml observed under ×1000 and ×3000 magnification were observed to fail to elicit any notable structural change (Figure not shown) but interestingly the 30 μg/ml dose produced the early signs of variation which is clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0748233711432569">Figure 7</xref>, where a distinct line of demarcation in the scutellum between the normal and variant trichomes is visible. The dotted line on the photograph under ×400 magnification facilitates to identify the zone of demarcation. Under ×3000 magnification, the trichomes adjacent to the microchaete socket in the scutellum are seen to show a definite intercalation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0748233711432569">Figure 8</xref>) in the same individual. A comparison of the same zone in the scutellum of control insect makes it apparent that the trichomes adjacent to the socket of microchaete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748233711432569">Figure 5</xref>) on treatment failed to maintain the discrete orientation as the control.</p>

<p>Observation on the same zone keeping the base of the microchaete in the scutellum as a marker clearly shows the change in the structure of trichomes in the several treatments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0748233711432569">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0748233711432569">10</xref> show the structure of trichomes treated with 40 μg/ml under ×1000 and ×2000 magnification, respectively.

The trichomes appear to be thickened and the epidermis seems to be covered with the trichome due to overthickening of trichomes, which loose their discrete appearance and produce such intercalation so that they form a layer over the epidermis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>
<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has been used as a model to study the effect of several pesticides and insecticides since many years. Several workers across the globe have recently indulged in studies tracing the effect of some fungicides in this insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711432569">Nazir et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711432569">2003</xref>). In the present study, the effect of a fungicide, Thiovit Jet on the morphology of Drosophila has been analyzed. </p>
<p>In this study, treatment with different concentrations of Thiovit Jet was able to disrupt the normal structure of trichome/microtrichia, which are merely cuticular processes secreted by the epidermal cells. The concentrations of Thiovit Jet selected for treatment of the insects in the present study were far below the reported lethal concentration 50 (LC50) values and the chemical being a miticide/fungicide is hardly expected to kill the insect at the experimental concentrations.</p>
<p>It is well known that mutation inactivating Sec 61β, a component of protein conducting channel of endoplasmic reticulum, causes a gross abnormality in cuticle deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711432569">Valcarcel, 1999</xref>). Similarly, another protein involved in synaptic vesicle with their target membrane, Syntaxin 1A, is also required for cuticle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711432569">Schulze and Bellen, 1996</xref>). Thus, any mutation associated with these proteins would probably disrupt the normal cuticle deposition process. Treatment with certain chemicals may have an inhibitory effect on normal integument development. Low concentration of 20 μg/ml of Thiovit Jet in the present study was found to be ineffective in eliciting any response (Figure not shown), whereas concentrations of 30 μg/ml and above were able to produce changes in the structure of the trichome. The first appearance of altered structure of trichomes was noted with 30 μg/ml concentration confined only to a particular region of the scutellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0748233711432569">Figure 7</xref>). This signifies the onset of chemical-induced morphological change; further, higher concentrations of 40 and 200 μg/ml were seen to be effective to elicit variable grades of changes in thoracic epidermal outgrowths. The trichomes appear to be shortened, thickened and blunt at the tip in different treatment groups (30, 40, 200 μg/ml). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711432569">Ostrowski et al. (2002)</xref> showed the development of blimp phenotype due to the inhibition of chitin synthesis as a result of treatment with luferunon. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711432569">Lee and Adler (2004)</xref> demonstrated a similar mutant cuticle due to the inactivation of gene encoding GATA transcription factor. In 200 μg/ml treatment category, the trichomes appeared to be overlapping. The adjoining trichomes intercalate to form a continuous layer covering the cuticle. Similar sclerotization process was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711432569">Wright et al. (1976)</xref> who demonstrated that the β-sclerotization process depends upon the activity of gene encoding 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase enzyme, which converts the DOPA to dopamine. Finally, epidermal cells also display endocytosis at their basal face for the import of tyrosine from haemolymph as insects cannot synthesize it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711432569">Locke, 2001</xref>). Thus, epidermal cells undergo transepidermal transport of molecules. Such transport was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711432569">Dubois et al. (2001)</xref> and was found to be of critical importance for diffusion of morphogenetic signals such as wingless (Wg). The well-orchestrated mechanism of integument development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has several factors (proteins), morphogenetic signals and different key players associated with it. Any inhibition, upregulation or downregulation in these factors may result in the disruption of this well-choreographed ballet leading to structural or morphological changes as observed in 30, 40, 200 μg/ml treatment categories. The socket-like base of the microchaete is found to be completely atrophied in 200 μg/ml treatment category. This may be due to the complete disruption of the normalcy, indicating malfunctioning of several signalling pathways controlling epidermal differentiation. As reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711432569">Payre (2004)</xref>, genetic cascade controlling epidermis differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> involves the signalling pathway like Wnt, Hh, EGF-R, Notch, and so on. Interestingly, all these pathways are known to be involved at different levels of epidermal differentiation in vertebrate also. The effect of any chemical on epidermis differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can thus be extrapolated to vertebrates also. The result thus far very well demonstrates a significant effect of Thiovit Jet on integument development. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711432569">Lee and Adler (2004)</xref>, who pinpointed on a particular gene responsible for mutant cuticle development, the present study fails to pinpoint on any particular gene, whose improper functioning results in the abnormality. Further research in this area in future may trace out the particular genes involved in particular signalling pathways whose functional anomaly brings about such structural abnormality in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, thus opening an avenue for effects of several fungicides on nontarget organisms.</p>
