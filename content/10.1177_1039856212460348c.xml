<p><bold>Dr Harry Alfred Derham OAM</bold>, Victoria, was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia ‘for service to psychiatry, particularly in the field of eating disorders’. Dr Derham is an Honorary Senior Fellow at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne and has been an active clinician at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and The Melbourne Clinic, whilst also maintaining a private practice. He has directed both institutions’ Eating Disorders Programs and was also a long-serving Medical Director, and Research and Ethics Committee Chair at The Melbourne Clinic. Dr Derham was awarded the RANZCP’s College Citation in 2009.</p>
<p>These awards acknowledge the many contributions psychiatrists are making to mental health services in Australasia and will hopefully raise awareness, increase knowledge and reduce stigma of mental illness.</p>
