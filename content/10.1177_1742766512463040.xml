<abstract>
<p>This study critically reflects on a schism evident in debates surrounding ‘humanitarian communication’. On one hand, it is approached as embodying an ideal of ethical practice. On the other, ideal humanitarianism is deployed as the grounds for a critique, whereby ‘humanitarian practice’ is seen as compromised by exigencies and political-economic influence. Drawing on the testimony of humanitarian communication practitioners within major international agencies, we argue this also reflects a felt tension within the field, where practitioners are very aware of the practical constraints and material influences to which they are subject. In both cases, however, an assumed opposition between the ‘practical’ and the ‘ethical’ tends to position ‘humanitarian ethics’ as an ahistorical ideal that stands apart from, and acts as a check on, instrumental action. This paper argues that a more historically grounded analysis suggests a more complex interrelationship between ethical and instrumental concerns.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean, I’m an idealist, but …. if you came to the Red Cross with a real, strong advocacy agenda or an activists’ agenda, then you just wouldn’t survive here, because you would be too frustrated by the things that we have to do… (International Communications Manager, Australian Red Cross)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Michael Barnett and Thomas G Weiss have put it, ‘humanitarianism is not separate from the world it attempts to civilize; in many respects, it is its creature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463040">2008</xref>: 9). This is certainly true of humanitarian communication, a field in which a history of critical debates surrounding the politics and ethics of humanitarian practice has made practitioners highly aware of the dilemmas they confront. These are habitually experienced and understood as a tension between an ethical <italic>ideal</italic> of humanitarianism and forms of <italic>practice</italic> that, as exemplified above, are often framed as necessities. By contrast, academic debates surrounding humanitarian communication are more schismatic, providing perspectives on the field that can be identified as ‘idealizing’ and ‘critical’, respectively. Nevertheless, as we argue below, what is shared across these positions is an (often implicit) mythic view of ‘humanitarianism’ as a moral ideal that can be regarded as separate from the material realities of ‘actually existing’ humanitarian work. This article argues that while this myth serves as a material influence on humanitarianism itself, it nonetheless deleteriously limits critical engagements with it. This, in turn, raises the question of what sort of approach might provide an approach that is ‘better’ – in the sense of being more historically sensitive and critically effective?</p>
<p>To address this question, we draw on a number of works that have sought, in different ways, to provide a more historical and materialist perspective on the ethics, practice and politics of humanitarianism ethics and humanitarian action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">Craig Calhoun (2008)</xref>, for example, has traced the rise of humanitarianism as, simultaneously, a basis of ethical identity and field of practice that arose and has been subject to historical transformation as a consequence of definite material influences. Calhoun argues that the emergence of modern humanitarianism is marked by two developments. On one hand, humanitarianism developed with the gradual emergence of the widespread belief that forms of distant suffering could be rationally and effectively addressed and that those in a position to perform such action had a moral responsibility to do so. On the other, humanitarianism became embodied through the development (and subsequent expansion and transformation) of various non-governmental and governmental agencies, expert knowledge and forms of action directed to the alleviation of suffering. Reading this as a narrative of ‘rationalization’, Calhoun suggests that this dual embodiment, as ethical discourse and modes of instrumental action, produces a characteristic tension within the field between an ethical ‘value rationality’ and a pragmatic ‘instrumental rationality’:<disp-quote>
<p>Humanitarian action is thus grounded simultaneously in an individual ethical imperative to save life or alleviate suffering and social organization to improve collective conditions of life. The specificity of the ‘field’ of humanitarian action – its internal hierarchies and struggles as well as its always contested external boundaries – derives from the interface of these two dimensions and not from one alone. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">Calhoun, 2008</xref>: 90)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This perspective represents, we suggest, a significant advance on positions that represent humanitarianism as either the embodiment of an ethical ideal or as compromised by a combination of external influences and pragmatic exigency. Following a review of debates surrounding humanitarian communication, this article explores how such tensions are evident in the rationales that practitioners see as underpinning their work, drawing on evidence generated through seven in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted with communication practitioners working for three major humanitarian and development agencies in Australia (the Australian Red Cross, Oxfam Australia and Save the Children). A critical reflection on their testimony leads us to argue that the relationship between ‘value rationalities’ and ‘instrumental rationalities’ is more complex than Calhoun’s characterization of it as a process of ‘reconciling moral self-justification and instrumental assessment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">2008</xref>: 95) suggests. Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512463040">Duffield (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463040">Chouliaraki (2010)</xref>, this leads us to argue for the need for a more thoroughgoing critical engagement with humanitarian ‘ethics’, which, rather than merely considering how ethics informs ‘reflexivity’ in humanitarian communication practitioners, considers the consequences of how it may also delimit it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1742766512463040">
<title>Idealizing humanitarian communication</title>
<p>Lilie Chouliaraki defines ‘humanitarian communication’ as ‘the rhetorical practices of transnational actors that engage with universal ethical claims, such as common humanity or global civil society, to mobilize action on human suffering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463040">2010</xref>: 108). Within ‘idealizing’ approaches to such practices, international humanitarian agencies in particular are seen to exemplify, embody and promote cosmopolitan relations of shared humanity and moral obligation, such that subjects increasingly come to see the plight of distant others as their proper concern. Within this framework, agencies are positioned as both embodiments and promoters of an emergent ‘global civil society’, in which, increasingly, cosmopolitan subjects gain awareness of the suffering of others and partake of a global humanitarian ethos. This is also seen as, at least in part, a consequence of subjects being more aware of distant suffering through media imagery and humanitarian campaigns.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463040">D Robert DeChaine’s (2005)</xref> rhetorical analysis of the humanitarian discourse of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) exemplifies this perspective. Humanitarian agencies such as MSF, DeChaine argues, operate as key agents in the crafting of emergent formations of the global community by working to produce forms of subjectivity that involve a commitment to global humanitarianism. This involves ‘the successful rallying of formative energies in and around clusters of key related terms, words, and phrases, in order to dramatize and publicize the exigency of the crisis at hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463040">2005</xref>: 3). By aligning itself to the principle of <italic>sans frontièrisme</italic> (‘without borderism’), MSF ‘de-territorializes’ action through the rhetorical deployment of an ideographic ‘humanitarian space’. The deployment of the ideograph, ‘humanitarian’, is thus positioned as ‘an agency of control over social-spatial topography’. To the extent it is successful, this creates an ‘ethical and humane practice of humanitarian action’ at the levels of both social imaginary and material reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463040">2005</xref>: 93–96).</p>
<p>In a parallel argument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742766512463040">Martin Shaw (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742766512463040">1999</xref>) suggests humanitarian agencies craft ‘legitimately intervenable emergencies’ to mobilize both public and governmental agendas for humanitarian action. Through symbolic constructions of distant phenomena as ‘global crises’, Shaw suggests, morally obligated subjects are called to take global action. In his analysis of the Kurdish crisis in 1991, Shaw positions humanitarian agencies and television as the two central agencies that mobilized the international community to alter state policies and enact the ‘internationally legitimate’ intervention that followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742766512463040">1999</xref>: 227–230). However, where DeChaine positions MSF as <italic>independently</italic> producing an humanitarian ethos, Shaw’s focus on television’s central role informs a more critical perspective. Thus, he points to the manifest inconsistencies of television’s humanitarian gaze (upon which agency campaigns depend), its presentation of the Kurds as passive ‘pure victims’ rather than protagonists with a voice of their own, and the manner in which the cueing of coverage also remained dependent on, and tied to, the geo-political agendas of nation-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742766512463040">1999</xref>: 231; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742766512463040">Ignatieff, 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, Shaw argues, while media may not <italic>generally</italic> serve as agents of a global civil society, they may – under particular circumstances, influenced by forms of humanitarian media advocacy and campaigning – <italic>occasionally</italic> do so.</p>
<p>If Shaw suggests that television, in concert with the humanitarian practices of transnational agencies, occasionally serves as an agent of global civil society, Chouliaraki’s work on television representations of suffering (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512463040">Chouliaraki, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512463040">2008</xref>) has sought to identify, theoretically and analytically, the particular occasions when this might be seen to occur. ‘Suffering’, for Chouliaraki, refers to a mediated relationship through which spectators are discursively constituted as ‘moral subjects’ in particular ways. Through discourse analysis of an array of television representations, she shows how particular instances of suffering are generically differentiated in ways that have manifest effects for the constitution of moral subjectivity and ethical action. Thus, Chouliaraki demonstrates how media constructions of humanitarian suffering range from detailed and emotive reports, which produce forms of communal co-feeling between sufferers and viewers, to forms of ‘distant’ coverage, which represent suffering as impersonal ‘dots on the map’ at the periphery of spectators’ emotional consciousness. In this way, she shows how a political economy of suffering, in which certain subjects are positioned as being more important than others, is <italic>culturally</italic> (re)produced. However, Chouliaraki is also concerned about the degree to which television news might serve to engender a form of cosmopolitan sensibility with progressive and transformative effects. This, she argues, is supported through certain instances of what she calls ‘emergency news’ that effectively bridge political and emotional distance between the audience and the distant, suffering other.</p>
<p>As one of the most sophisticated analyses that identify media as (albeit only occasionally) performing a progressive, cosmopolitan role, Chouliaraki’s work serves to illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of ‘idealist’ approaches to humanitarian communication. A potential strength is that they do not fall prey to an easy cynicism about their potential, whether conducted directly by humanitarian agencies or through mass media, to facilitate social justice. Nevertheless, given the significance she places upon it, it is worth considering Chouliaraki’s key example of ‘cosmopolitan’ reportage – a Greek television report focused on the predicament of Amina Lawal, a young Nigerian mother condemned, in 2002, to death by stoning under Sharia law. Through a semiotic and critical discourse analysis of this report, Chouliaraki argues that by virtue of its aesthetic qualities, it effectively enables the audience to engage with Lawal as ‘a sufferer with a name, a face and a history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512463040">2008</xref>: 845). Consequently, she claims, the report moralizes the spectator to partake in a condemnation of the inhumanity and injustice of the sentence and, by focusing on scenes of international protest, to mobilize the spectator to take action to address it:<disp-quote>
<p>The effectiveness of this proposal … depends upon the voices of Amnesty International as well as other non-governmental organizations, international governance actors such as the UN, individuals such as Nelson Mandela or celebrities like the Live Aid artists, because these agents command the authority and popularity necessary to push solidary forms of agency through to vast television publics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512463040">2008</xref>: 845)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While Chouliaraki thus situates television’s agency in relation to other sites of humanitarian practice, her reading of this text as corresponding to an ethical ideal highlights a tension in her work. <italic>Analytically</italic>, she seeks to demonstrate how the aesthetic qualities of texts serve to performatively constitute particular relations between spectators and distant, suffering others. These are understood as connected to wider relations of power that produce particular instances of suffering as moral imperatives for action, while others are presented as peripheral to spectators’ concerns. Yet, Chouliaraki also concerns herself with identifying instances where coverage serves to embody a form of <italic>normative</italic> cosmopolitan agency, drawing on Roger Silverstone’s ethical ideal of ‘proper distance’, defined as:<disp-quote>
<p>the more or less precise degree of proximity required in our mediated interrelationships if we are to create and sustain a sense of the other sufficient not just for reciprocity but for a duty of care, obligation and responsibility, as well as understanding. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742766512463040">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 47)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, at the point that a text comes to be categorized as embodying such a normative ideal, a critical reading of the role played by power relations in both its production and circulatory impacts is effectively sidelined. Instead, it is simply presented as both the embodiment and the means of the production of the ideal ethical persona of the cosmopolitan. Yet, even in this ‘ideal’ instance, the valence of this cosmopolitan politics appears more ambiguous than Chouliaraki acknowledges. We might consider, for example, how the report of the young Nigerian woman being stoned under Sharia law exists not merely as an instance of suffering and a call for humanitarian action, but can also be read as a representation of ‘Islamic barbarism’ whose very ‘newsworthiness’ at this time was conditioned by the cultural politics of the ‘war on terror’. In this context, as Judith Butler notes, ‘sexually progressive conceptions of feminist rights or sexual freedoms have been mobilized not only to rationalize wars against predominantly Muslim populations, but also to argue for limits to immigration to Europe from predominantly Muslim countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463040">2009</xref>: 26). Perhaps, too, we should retain concerns about a representation centred on tension between the barbarism of Sharia law and violent African mobs and the civilized spaces of Western humanism represented by Amnesty International protests conducted in Europe. While clearly grounded in a discourse of human rights, such a representation may nevertheless serve to represent those rights as privileges to be granted by the agency of Western benefactors, even if such agency is political rather than merely charitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742766512463040">Slim, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The point here is not to propose that one should not support action against such human rights violations or that it is simply wrong to describe such forms of communication as ‘cosmopolitan’. No doubt such representations do, as Chouliaraki suggests, serve as modes of ‘moral education’ that support internationalist consciousness and action. Yet, a persistent problem in ‘idealizing’ approaches, which position agents or examples of humanitarian representation as corresponding to abstract ethical norms, is that political analysis inevitably becomes (at least partially) displaced. This is equally evident in Shaw’s elision of the highly ambiguous politics surrounding ‘humanitarian intervention’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512463040">Chandler, 2006</xref>), and the absence of any critical perspective on the representational politics of MSF campaigns in DeChaine’s functionalist representation of them as harbingers of global humanitarianism. This is not to deny the value of, in particular, Chouliaraki’s work, which facilitates consideration of the relationship between the constitutive role performed by humanitarian communication in producing ‘suffering’ as a sociopolitical relation and its material constitution as a field of practice. To consider these issues further, however, it is also worth turning to some key critical perspectives on this field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1742766512463040">
<title>From idealization to critique</title>
<p>While some seek to show that humanitarian communication does, or at least might, act as a means by which an idealized cosmopolitan politics is facilitated, others criticize its <italic>failure</italic> to live up to this critical standard. For example, in a largely sympathetic engagement with the cultural politics of the UK ‘Make Poverty History’ (MPH) campaign, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512463040">Kate Nash (2008)</xref> nevertheless concludes that the event was a failure. Nash argues that the MPH was made possible by the emergence of the ‘cosmopolitanizing state’, a political development that supports the possibility of successfully interpellating subjects as ‘global citizens’, and, paradoxically, making global justice a political priority for national states (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512463040">Beck, 2006</xref>). However, Nash suggests MPH failed in both practical and symbolic terms. Practically, MPH did little to restructure policies that contribute to global inequality and widespread suffering, merely extending relations based on forms of charity (debt relief and commitments to aid), rather than justice (the restructuring of trade relations). Symbolically, while promoting an effective form of mass solidarity regarding the suffering of distant others, MPH produced little genuine understanding, and, indeed, tended to marginalize non-Western perspectives, thus failing to produce a ‘genuine cosmopolitan solidarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512463040">Nash, 2008</xref>: 176). Consequently, she argues: ‘The feeling for the suffering of distant people, which the campaign undoubtedly did achieve, degenerated from a collective understanding of “our” moral obligation to do something to alleviate that suffering into narcissistic sentimentalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512463040">Nash, 2008</xref>: 177).</p>
<p>More stridently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512463040">Sharon Fain (2008)</xref> has drawn on Silverstone’s cosmopolitan ethics of ‘proper distance’ to denounce ONE (the US manifestation of MPH) for its tendency to dehumanize the poor, its commodification and individualization of poverty, and, in line with other critiques of ‘celebrity colonialism’, its representation of celebrities as proxy ‘Northern saviours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742766512463040">Van Den Bulck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512463040">Duvall, 2009</xref>). Thus, Fain suggests, ONE served to reinforce a perspective on the problems of the developing world as only resolvable through the superior and necessary agency of missionary humanitarianism.</p>
<p>Such criticisms relate strongly to a tradition of work that has critically engaged with practices of humanitarian communication, particularly surrounding issues of campaign imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512463040">Benthall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463040">Chouliaraki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742766512463040">Lidchi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742766512463040">Tester, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742766512463040">Vestergaard, 2008</xref>). A useful overview of key critiques is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742766512463040">Denis Kennedy (2009)</xref>. One of these is that suffering has tended to be presented through a focus on victims and reduced to local or existential problems (war, persecution, famine) that can only be resolved by external humanitarian action. Such representations, critics argue, mystify the causes of global suffering and the implication of the developed world in their causes, instead positioning it as an object of humanitarian agency. This is compounded by the use of ‘ideal victims’ (usually women and children) in campaign imagery, reinforcing a gendered and paternalistic dimension to this relationship. In addition, the focus on victims (or, in ‘positive image’ campaigns, ‘empowered’ beneficiaries) serves to sustain a fundamental divide between the objects of pity and/or charity who, as representatives of humanity in its most minimal representation as ‘bare life’, strongly contrast with the agential benefactors (such as, increasingly, celebrities), who both represent a fully-fledged persona and an agency that the suffering object lacks. In this way, despite its mobilization of a discourse of universal humanity, humanitarian communication divides humanity between those accorded the status of generic objects and those represented as individual, agential subjects.</p>
<p>Thus constructed, critics argue, suffering is commodified and ‘sold’ to audiences as a ‘product’: namely, the sense of satisfaction that one has exercised agency in a virtuous fashion through the painless exercise of the charitable donation of (a small amount of) one’s disposable income. This serves, ideologically, to reproduce an image of both the self and the wider community with which the donor is identified as benevolent, virtuous and fundamentally committed (ethically <italic>and</italic> practically) to the project of resolving global suffering. It serves, in this respect, as the sentimental substitute for both political consciousness and effective action to achieve global justice. Finally, humanitarian communication is criticized as fundamentally <italic>narcissistic</italic>, since suffering is presented as a product that merely serves to satisfy the consumer demand for a sense of virtue. Thus, the humanitarian relation is not a means to engagement with the other, but rather with the self. Indeed, the suffering other is doubly objectified – as both the object of the gaze of the humanitarian agent and as a continuously produced commodity to address the demand of consumers to maintain a positive self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512463040">Boltanski, 1999</xref>: 101–103). In these ways, despite raising funds for both emergency relief and development projects, humanitarian communication practices are seen as frequently problematic because ‘they sell suffering in ethically questionable ways, they perpetuate a humanitarian narrative in which Western aid organizations are empowered to act on and for “helpless” Southerners, and they fundamentally challenge basic humanitarian principles of humanity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742766512463040">Kennedy, 2009</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>While such critiques centre on the textual discourses produced by particular campaigns, others have sought to examine how non-governmental organization (NGO) communications are produced through particular forms of discursively organized practice. What such studies offer, which textual analyses cannot, is a stronger sense of the forces that condition humanitarian communication in practice. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512463040">Cottle and Nolan (2007)</xref> conducted interviews with communication managers of major international aid agencies to explore how their work is materially structured by an incorporation of media practices and priorities. In contrast to DeChaine’s rosy account of humanitarian agencies conjuring symbolic resources to craft a global community, their analysis suggests humanitarian practices are materially conditioned by their incorporation of forms of corporate discourse and practice, as embodied in concerns to build a successful brand and enlarge ‘market share’. They also show how practitioners have come to incorporate ‘media logics’ in planning, prioritizing and structuring communication campaigns. On this basis, Cottle and Nolan identify how contemporary humanitarian communication is increasingly governed by four factors: organizational branding in an increasingly competitive and ‘media-hungry’ aid field; the incorporation of corporate marketing (and the increased use of celebrities) to comply with media values; the regionalization and personalization of humanitarian ‘stories’ that enable the production of stories that adhere to news values of local, national and cultural ‘proximity’; and a concern to manage organizational reputation in the face of the increased risks produced by media in the form of negative coverage, criticism and manufactured scandals. As a consequence, they argue, ‘aid organizations are becoming increasingly ensnared in a global “media logic”’ that ‘proves at once indispensable and inimical to NGOs and ideas of global humanitarianism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512463040">Cottle and Nolan, 2007</xref>: 863).</p>
<p>It is notable, however, that all of these critiques focus not on humanitarianism itself, but on a sense of humanitarianism betrayed by its own exigencies. Indeed, what such critical analyses could be seen to share with more ‘idealist’ representations of humanitarian communication is an underlying image of a ‘pure’ global humanitarianism. Thus, critical analyses tend to rest upon a projected, but ultimately counter-factual, ideal of humanitarian practice shorn of the corrupting influence of corporate rationalities, marketing and media logics. An ethnographic study of the MPH campaign produced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512463040">Aeron Davis and Nick Sireau (2007)</xref>, however, suggests that this representation of humanitarianism as an ethical ideal undermined by practical exigency may be questionable. Rather, it appears that ‘actually existing’ forms of humanitarianism do not develop against the grain of ethical norms, but that such norms exist, simultaneously, as both a source of guidance <italic>and</italic> a site of contention. Davis and Sireau documented a major division between the ‘marketing-led’ and the ‘campaign-led’ members of the MPH coalition. Where the former prioritized the endorsement of simplified messages and the use of celebrities to ensure extensive representation, the latter argued that such an agenda was likely to dilute messages and give celebrities excessive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512463040">2007</xref>: 138).This analysis also bears witness to the heated disagreements between campaign members regarding the degree to which the campaign should criticize government. In both cases, there was a tension between a ‘radical’ perspective that was concerned about the potential of a ‘co-option’ of the campaign to government and political agendas emptying out the critical message at its core, and a ‘moderate’ or pragmatic perspective that regarded nurturing positive relations with decision-makers and media as crucial to its potential success.</p>
<p>Such tensions were, no doubt, exacerbated by the diverse nature of the MPH coalition. However, recalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">Calhoun’s (2008)</xref> argument about the tension between ‘value rationalities’ and ‘instrumental rationalities’ inherent to the field, we might suggest that such tensions are also more generally produced by, and part of, the material conditions within which humanitarian communication is performed. Indeed, the very fact that many campaign members experienced this tension as a conflict between a principled humanitarianism at risk of ‘co-option’ demonstrates how a sustaining myth of an apparently pure humanitarianism, constantly under threat of co-option by external material influences, itself operates as a definite influence on forms of humanitarian practice. This is not to deny that such forces are real. On the contrary, Davis and Sireau provide a clear demonstration of how such tensions were produced by the tensions between different forms of expertise, different institutional and organizational agendas, and the very definite pressures that media and governmental agendas brought to bear on MPH. Nevertheless, a simple labelling of one group as ‘ethical’ and the other as ‘instrumental’ underplays the degree to which both ‘sides’ of this debate mounted their arguments on both ‘ethical’ and ‘instrumental’ grounds, with one concerned about the practical consequences of the campaign being ‘co-opted’ and the other defending a pragmatic adoption of relations with government and celebrities on the ethical grounds that, even if distasteful to some, this would nevertheless most effectively address the problem of poverty. This returns us, then, to the problem of how to understand the relationship between ‘ethics’ and ‘instrumentalism’ as a ground for critically engaging with the field of humanitarian communication.</p>

<title>Historicizing humanitarianism</title>
<p>As we have seen, whether ‘idealizing’ or ‘critical’, the majority of work on humanitarian communication has tended to position ‘humanitarianism’ as a moral ideal that is either embodied in particular instances of practice or provides the touchstone against which its shortcomings are highlighted. Both of these approaches tend to accept or assume, and reproduce, a myth of humanitarianism that naturalizes it as a definition of ‘the good’ that is assumed to be pre-given or consensually shared.</p>
<p>As Calhoun suggests, this myth is quite central to the appeal of humanitarianism since it supports an appearance of ‘moral purity’ and it promises to offer ‘an ethically pure way of responding to global problems and suffering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">2008</xref>: 90). ‘Nevertheless, one evident difficulty of this approach is that it requires either that humanitarian practice is presented as conforming to an ideal, leading to the necessary exclusion of relations of power within it, or that ‘humanitarian ideals’ are understood as purely ethical rather than material phenomena and, as such, as ahistorical and immutable.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is suggested by studies that investigate the historical and sociological underpinnings of humanitarianism as it emerged and developed in particular settings. For instance, Thomas Haskell’s analysis of the rise of ‘the humanitarian sensibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463040">1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463040">1985b</xref>) exemplifies such an approach. Without denying the role played by capitalist relations in contributing to human inequalities and suffering, Haskell argues that these same relations formed the precondition for the emergence of a humanitarian sensibility, as a consequence of the forms of character that the market both presupposes and serves to instil, as ‘an agency of social discipline or of education and character modification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463040">1985b</xref>: 550). Explicitly arguing against a reading of humanitarianism as a mere expression of class interest, Haskell’s historical analysis demonstrates how social, economic and technological changes collectively served to support the emergence of the question of responsibility for suffering as a moral problem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512463040">Luc Boltanski (1999)</xref>, relatedly, suggests that the ‘politics of pity’ emerged and developed as a consequence of the issues raised by this novel awareness of suffering as a moral problem. A communicative aesthetics of ‘pity’ provided a set of responses to this problem through ‘topics’ that served formally to constitute suffering as a relationship ‘in such a way as to affect the sensibility of those more fortunate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512463040">1999</xref>: 11). In both these accounts, ‘humanitarianism’ refers neither to the awakening of a moral conscience that exists as a permanent human potential nor to an ideology defined merely by self-interest, but to the emergence of novel cognitive and emotional relations that were a contingent product of particular historical, social, economic and technological conditions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Boltanski’s work also highlights how humanitarianism serves to constitute a definite <italic>politics</italic> through its production and sustenance of particular relations by the process of constructing and communicating suffering. Although taking a different approach, Calhoun is also concerned with highlighting the political dimensions of humanitarianism when he argues that ‘both humanitarian action and the occasions of suffering that it seeks to mitigate are shaped deeply by their connections with states and markets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">Calhoun, 2008</xref>: 89). What is particular to humanitarianism, however, is the tendency for these politics to be obscured as a consequence of its self-representation as a pure morality, embodied in the ethical act of responding to emergencies. Indeed, Calhoun argues it is this tendency to obscure its own politics that produces its most significant political effect – the paradoxical positioning of emergencies as, simultaneously, exceptional events and a more or less permanent aspect of the modern world:<disp-quote>
<p>In short, emergencies have become normal, both on the TV news and in the budgets and operations of international organisations. I do not mean that these ‘emergencies’ are not real and devastating as they clearly are, nor even that they do not demand urgent attention … But neither are they exceptions to some beneficent, peaceful existence … Today we see not one large emergency dismissed as an exception, but innumerable smaller ones still treated as exceptions but repeated so frequently as to be normalised. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">Calhoun, 2008</xref>: 87)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is particularly pernicious about the emergency imaginary, Calhoun argues, is that it positions emergencies as exceptional, as local aberrations to an otherwise peaceful and beneficent world order, when, in reality, it is precisely the political and economic relations and inequalities of that order that serve to produce many humanitarian catastrophes as well as make particular populations far more prone to the effects of ‘(un)natural disasters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742766512463040">Cottle, 2009</xref>: 43–44).</p>
<p>Such normalization was clearly apparent in the testimonies of our interviewees, who were able to tell us precisely how they ‘typically’ respond to emergencies in organized practices that, while serving to support efficient and effective responses to particular crises, also serve as rituals for the re-enactment and reproduction of an emergency imaginary. In this respect, a paradox of humanitarianism is that while it seeks to work towards the achievement of a world where human needs are met and suffering minimized, it simultaneously serves to render such an ambition unthinkable:<disp-quote>
<p>I can’t imagine a world where there was no need. There are so many factors that create that need. Politics is one of them, but it’s not the only one. Natural disasters in the world will never stop. Unforeseen natural disasters. There will always be people that need our help. The reason that they need our help may change and shift over time and hopefully one can make an in-road in some areas. Eradicating some areas of need. But there will always be people that need help. (National Media Advisor, Australian Red Cross)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It would be unfair to suggest that this quote represents a political quietism, particularly given its acknowledgement of the role played by politics itself in the production of need. Indeed, this might be read as a realistic acceptance that the existence of suffering is a fairly permanent aspect of contemporary reality. Nevertheless, a significant consequence of this acceptance is that the ‘people that need help’ also serve to position the humanitarian agency as a permanent necessity, even as it hopes to ‘make inroads in some areas’. Thus positioned, the possibility that humanitarian agencies, as central contributors to a politics of humanitarianism, might themselves contribute toward the <italic>production</italic> of such permanent suffering becomes, if not unthinkable, at least habitually unthought.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest humanitarian communication practitioners are entirely unaware of the criticisms a pure focus on emergency can attract. Indeed, if the above quote serves again to represent, in part, an ethical justification for a focus on responding to ‘people that need help’, our interviewees also highlighted the emphasis they are compelled to place on longer-term solutions:<disp-quote>
<p>Whether it’s livelihood or establishing classrooms or training teachers or providing medical supplies … It’s not our thing to just go in and provide supplies…and then leave. We are very much devoted to emergency and long-term development. (Acting Communications Manager, Save the Children Australia)</p>
<p>That’s our long-term program, whether it’s HIV and AIDS programming, health awareness programming, disaster awareness or sanitation …We also, overseas, have our emergency response department here, as … something is always going wrong in the Asia-Pacific region. It’s a very disaster-prone region of the world. (International Communication Manager, Australian Red Cross)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, these practitioners are aware of the potential problems associated with a pure focus on emergency relief, although they regard the latter as important and justified. This serves to reiterate a commitment to not only relieve, but also address, the causes of suffering – although, again, ‘something is always going wrong’. However, what these testimonies propose is that the ‘long-term solutions’ embodied in development projects serve as a means to the end of minimizing, if not eradicating, humanitarian emergencies.</p>
<p>In a recent critical analysis of development practices, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512463040">Mark Duffield (2007)</xref> has suggested that this view underestimates the degree to which development itself serves to sustain, rather than address, the conditions within which humanitarian catastrophes are produced. Development, Duffield argues, reproduces and operates on the basis of an imaginary that divides the world into two, into zones of developed safety and underdeveloped ‘risk’. This division is also underpinned, however, by a fundamental difference in perspective on the nature of ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ societies. The developing world is continually represented as populated by ‘self-reliant’ peoples who, unless impacted by adverse circumstance, are normally able to sustain themselves without the need for social support. This strongly contrasts with the representation of the developed world, which has (variably) constructed ‘safety nets’ and systems of social insurance to protect individuals who are subject to the effects of mass phenomena such as unemployment or serious illness. The effect of this is that, effectively, subjects in developed nations are seen to require and have access to a greater level of rights. Despite this, development projects are framed as facilitating a renewed ‘autonomy’, rather than <italic>equality</italic>, as ‘each disaster initiates a fresh developmental attempt to return the population concerned to a new and more resilient condition of homeostatic self-reliance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512463040">Duffield, 2007</xref>: 18). Consequently, Duffield argues, development serves ultimately to insure developed societies against the potentially destabilising instability that unameliorated suffering would inevitably bring to the world order, while contributing to the reproduction of the very conditions that underpin the grossly disproportionate frequency and intensity with which humanitarian catastrophes impact the ‘developing world’. The upshot of this argument is not only that ‘development’ and ‘emergency’ are symbiotically linked, but also that rather than ultimately increasing equality amongst humanity as a whole, discursively organized practices of humanitarianism may themselves contribute to the reproduction of a permanent global division, where each failure of development informs renewed calls for a more ‘effective’ development that, nevertheless, does not break with the paradigm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1742766512463040">
<title>A delimited reflexivity?</title>
<p>Duffield’s critical analysis of the politics of development does not centre merely on humanitarian agencies, but also on the emergence on discourses of ‘human security’ that have increasingly informed the aid and development agendas of governments. Nevertheless, and not least through their reliance on state as well as donor funding, such discourses have also inevitably impacted the NGO sector. In the process, humanitarianism becomes both targeted as a means for producing human security and also re-articulated by it. While human security positions humanitarianism (and, arguably, humanity) as a means to its particular model and imperative of security, it is nevertheless notable that human security represents not merely a heading for an (instrumentally oriented) policy approach, but also adopts an <italic>ethical</italic> register in its advocacy of that approach. In this respect (and to the extent that it has been influential), it exemplifies our broader argument that ‘ethics’ do not stand as independently existing ideals, but rather as historically produced discourses that are materially produced and have material consequences. They do not stand opposed to an instrumental realm of ‘humanitarian practice’, but instead both contribute to and are reproduced and transformed by it. Rather than merely make this point, however, our concern is a wider one: what sort of a difference might an acknowledgement of this make, both for an understanding of and acting within the field itself?</p>
<p>In analytical terms, it involves adopting a stance that remains critical, but avoids the form of critique represented in straightforward moral denunciation. Such denunciation is well exemplified in the form of the critique performed by Costas Douzinas:<disp-quote>
<p>Pity and a sense of superiority unite the humanitarians. The massive pity engineered by humanitarian campaigns supports Western superiority, increases distancing from its targets and breeds disdain. Pity is addressed by a superior to an inferior, it is the patronizing emotion of looking down at the person pitied. The human rights campaigner as rescuer can become deeply egotistical: he is the one who keeps the world together, and, as a bonus, he receives full recognition for his goodness by others both near and far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512463040">Douzinas, 2007</xref>: 16).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While we earlier saw a similar critique applied to humanitarian campaigns, here Douzinas articulates a critique of humanitarianism <italic>itself</italic> as unethical because it serves to position the suffering other as a means to a narcissistic self-regard.</p>
<p>Since humanitarians tend to see a commitment to alleviating suffering as the most significant ethical grounding for their work, it is not hard to find evidence that appears to support such a perspective. Consider, for example, the following comment from the Communications Editor of Oxfam Australia:<disp-quote>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s all about them really. They are the reason I’m there, and the reason I’m trying to communicate something is about poor and vulnerable people around the world that deserve justice and a happy life. That’s why we’re all here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From Douzinas’s perspective the suffering other appears here as merely a means to the end of justifying the ethics of humanitarian practice. The significance of it being ‘all about them’, read thus, is primarily that of ‘why we’re all here’. Indeed, as we have seen, this highlights key paradoxes of humanitarianism. On one hand, the ethical concern to attend to suffering on the basis of human solidarity serves to demarcate a fundamental divide between those who deserve, but do not have justice and a healthy happy life, and those who see themselves as empowered to grant these conditions. On the other, the aspiration of achieving the fulfilment of this condition, as a project, serves to provide the <italic>permanent</italic> basis of humanitarian identity.</p>
<p>There remain, however, several potential objections to an approach that positions such statements as the simple embodiment of a narcissistic and superior stance. Firstly, to suggest that all humanitarian agencies – and each humanitarian – can be positioned through a singular, overarching and highly moralistic denunciation represents a blanket generalization. This underplays the degree to which the humanitarian field is marked by considerable ethical variation and dispute, at both the individual and institutional levels. Secondly, even if one acknowledges the ethical dangers of narcissism, one might question whether a concern to achieve moral integrity and be concerned with how one is viewed by others is <italic>necessarily</italic> narcissistic. Arguably, such a concern is a necessary precondition to a moral reflexivity that pays attention to others’ concerns. It may, in this respect, be not only unfair, but overly simplistic to position such identity-oriented statements as merely narcissistic – and not only, though not least, because such concerns inform actions that do save lives. Thirdly, in its arrogation of moral certainty, Douzinas’s critique serves to produce another divide, namely between practitioners, operating on the basis of an ethical false consciousness diagnosed as actually narcissistic, and the cultural critic whose presumed moral and intellectual superiority provides the licence for such a diagnosis.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to shifts in the ethics and practice of humanitarianism is suggested by Lilie Chouliaraki’s more recent analyses of recent transformations in the field of humanitarian communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463040">Chouliaraki, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463040">2011</xref>). Significantly, Chouliaraki suggests that such transformation occurs in part as a consequence of the reflexive awareness that communication practitioners have of the history of critical debates surrounding their work. However, she argues that emergent ‘post-humanitarian’ campaigning styles have not only developed as a response to such critiques, but also represent a ‘response to the intensely mediatised global market in which humanitarian agencies operate today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463040">2010</xref>: 107). While this emphasizes that humanitarian agencies are neither passive nor unreflexive as contributors to new ethical sensibilities <italic>and</italic> instrumental modes of practice, it also supports a focus on the particular ways in which the field of humanitarian communication has been ‘governmentalized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463040">Foucault, 1991</xref>) in ways that may serve to also <italic>delimit</italic> ethical reflection. As Duffield’s work suggests, as participants in a crowded field that competes for governmental funding, humanitarian agencies are far from immune from the political discourses and agendas of donor states. Likewise, the intense competition for donor funds within the field has contributed to the strong incorporation of forms of marketing expertise and an attendant language that constructs humanitarianism through its technical register.</p>
<p>Across all three agencies we studied, interviewees used the categories of ‘beneficiaries’, ‘donors’, ‘clients’ and ‘products’ to refer, respectively, to the subjects of humanitarian programmes, those who donate money to support these, other agencies with whom the practitioners work, and the vehicles through which donations are secured (such as child sponsorship or Oxfam’s highly successful campaign through which donors’ ‘gifts’ are equated to the purchase of, for example, a goat or a birkad). Indeed, the Communications Advisor of Save the Children Australia went so far as to describe her organization as ‘a business that makes money to pass on to other countries to help people’. While this clearly demonstrates the degree to which corporate language and techniques of marketing have impacted the field, it is striking that such language is not simply visited upon the field from outside, but is actively embraced. Practitioners not only recognize the manner in which the character of their identity and practices have transformed, but tend to regard this as a good thing:<disp-quote>
<p>Not anyone can just come and volunteer here, they have to be well trained and possess the right education and right experience and be able to sign up to something that says ‘I will not violate any code of conduct’. I guess raising awareness of that professionalism – that it’s not just a bunch of hippies – we always joke about the sandal-wearing brigade, the tree huggers that just sort of arrive and just [do] whatever they want. It’s moved on very much from that. (Humanitarian Advocacy Coordinator, Oxfam Australia)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What this quote refers to is how, in the field of humanitarianism, the amateur volunteer impelled by a personal commitment to achieve social change has been displaced and replaced by the figure of the well-trained and disciplined professional. As with examples of professionalization in other sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463040">Aldridge and Evetts, 2003</xref>), such change clearly has implications for the class and educational profile of the volunteer, since only people with certain (socially stratified) backgrounds and trainings fit the mould. Yet, although this quote may appear disdainful of ‘the sandal wearing brigade’ and the ‘tree huggers’, it is worth emphasizing that these comments are <italic>ethically</italic>, rather than merely instrumentally, informed. The need for a delimited humanitarian profile is impelled by the need to ensure ethical codes of conduct are met and that humanitarian work will be maximally effective.</p>
<p>This again suggests that the relationship between ‘value rationalities’ and ‘instrumental rationalities’ is rather more complex than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463040">Calhoun (2008)</xref> appears to recognize when he positions this as a problem of reconciling the instrumental means with the ethical ends of humanitarianism. Rather, what becomes apparent when considering the testimony of humanitarian practitioners is the complex interplay between the two. This is particularly evident in the following comment:<disp-quote>
<p>How do people feel about the fact that you can walk through the Bourke Street Mall of Melbourne and see a wall full of vulnerable children and just go and pick one, instead of another one? … Do people think that the money that they give, ten dollars a month I think – I don’t even know, goes into the hand of that child? I mean it doesn’t work like that at all … And yet, [the] child sponsorship fundraising campaign is just immensely successful. It’s staggering the amount of money that they raise. (International Communications Manager, Australian Red Cross)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidently, this is not the sort of ethically narcissistic humanitarian caricatured by Douzinas, but an humanitarian who displays a deep understanding of and concern about the ethical ambiguities of child sponsorship campaigns. Yet, here, an instrumental rationality does not simply displace an ethical rationality because we are returned finally to the ultimate good that these campaigns produce, through the ‘staggering’ amount of revenue they raise and the work they thereby support, as a case for their moral defence. While a certain tension between ethics and instrumentalism remains in this testimony, child sponsorship is nevertheless ultimately positioned as ‘virtuous’ in the sense that ‘something is necessary because and in so far as good hangs on it’ (Foot, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463040">Couldry, 2006</xref>: 118). As an historically mutable basis of ‘value rationality’, humanitarianism thus stands not only as a check on instrumentalism, but also as its engine.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has, through a critical engagement with work on humanitarian communication and the testimony of practitioners, highlighted a tendency to treat humanitarian ethics as a pre-given and ahistorical ideal that is presented as embodied within and/or compromised by the realities of humanitarian practice. A problematic consequence of this is that, both within the field and in academic analysis, it contributes to a delimitation of analytical and ethical reflection on it. In contrast to approaches that either condemn the field as <italic>un</italic>ethical or propose that its contradictions stem from the constitutive problem of reconciling ‘value rationalities’ and ‘instrumental rationalities’, we argue that a more historically sensitive and politically effective approach must engage with the manner in which both humanitarian ethics and practices are historically mutable and mutually informing. This suggests that, in particular, the conditions, forms and limits of processes of ethical reflexivity themselves deserve greater scrutiny.</p>
<p>In some respects, this argument coincides with Lilie Chouliaraki’s recent analyses of the forms of ethical reflexivity that inform contemporary humanitarian campaigns, which, she suggests, can be read as responses to previous forms of ethical critique to which the field of humanitarian communication has been subjected. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463040">Chouliaraki (2011)</xref> ultimately criticizes the ethics embodied in contemporary NGO campaign aesthetics for (re)producing a form of narcissism that embodies an ‘improper distance’, as communication on suffering becomes increasingly centred on the identity of the (post-)humanitarian self. Nevertheless, unlike the condemnatory approach of Douzinas, her emphasis on reflexivity is not only rather less patronizing, but offers considerably more hope that the moral problems produced by the field might be addressed.</p>
<p>If this offers a potentially more productive critical approach, our analysis suggests it is one that requires not only ethical reflexivity, but also further consideration of the effect of the various influences that contribute to the ethics and practice of humanitarian communication. Indeed, given the manner in which the field not only evolves reflexively, but also develops through its material relations with other agencies, including, notably, government, competitor NGOs, media and forms of marketing expertise, the pursuit of a deeper reflexivity in the field may require further consideration of how such relations impact processes of ethical reflection as much as they shape possibilities of humanitarian practice. This necessarily involves more than ‘best practice’ campaign aesthetics, but a critical process that takes account of the role that is actually (and that may potentially be) played by NGOs in the politics of suffering, as this is shaped by material conditions, institutional practices and sociopolitical relations. To reiterate, this is neither to deny the importance of work that seeks to attend to suffering in the immediate and longer term, nor to simply accuse practitioners of a complacent, unreflective narcissism. Nevertheless, the persuasiveness of work that suggests that NGOs may nevertheless be implicated in the reproduction of a narcissistic ‘politics of pity’ that serves to sustain the reproduction of permanent inequality, should do rather more than just give pause for thought.</p>
