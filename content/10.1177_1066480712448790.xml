<abstract>
<p>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) presents a number of symptoms and adjustment issues for individuals, but it is also associated with a myriad of risks for the larger family system. A systemic perspective is crucial to comprehending the development of BPD. Promoting healthy relationships with one or more supportive adult enables the child to develop an identity apart from the dysfunctional system and successfully persevere in the future. Further, increasing mentalization capacities, also referred to as reflective functioning (RF), within the caregiver in relation to the child is a crucial aspect of a systemic approach. This article reviews the need for a systems perspective, including combining RF within a narrative therapy framework, when considering the development, maintenance, and prevention of BPD.</p>

<p>The family unit constitutes both a risk and protective factor for the development and maintenance of psychopathology. Bioecological systems theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448790">Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998</xref>) proposes that multiple factors at the familial level interact over time to shape an individual’s development; one such factor is parent–child attachment, which facilitates adult relationships. Family systems interventions for recovery, which focus on mutual support, problem-solving abilities, and personal and familial impact on symptoms, have been used in a wide range of psychopathologies, including depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712448790">Crethar, Snow, &amp; Carlson, 2004</xref>), conduct disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066480712448790">Keiley &amp; Seery, 2001</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1066480712448790">Torgalsboen &amp; Rund, 1998</xref>), bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1066480712448790">Mueser, 2001</xref>), and posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1066480712448790">Monson, Rodriguez, &amp; Warner, 2005</xref>). Borderline personality disorder (BPD) also presents a number of clinically significant symptoms and adjustment issues for the individual and family system; yet, treatment approaches for BPD have primarily relied on individually based or group interventions, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP), mentalization-based therapy (MBT), and psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy (SPT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1066480712448790">Levy et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal of family systems interventions includes helping the family to reorganize around the stressor and find more resourceful and healthy coping strategies. Consequently, the family systems recovery approach highlights the importance of accepting personal responsibility while working toward a constructive understanding of both the patient’s and family’s experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448790">Bernardon &amp; Pernice-Duca, 2010</xref>). This article will discuss attachment theory in relation to the development and maintenance of the core clinical features of BPD, and their impact on children, demonstrating the need to adopt a systemic family-based treatment approach. It will conclude with a proposal for using narrative attachment therapy, in combination with reflective functioning (RF), as a key intervention with these individuals and their families.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480712448790">
<title>Overview of BPD</title>
<p>BPD is characterized by unstable interpersonal relationships, affective instability, mood reactivity (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, anxiety), identity disturbances (unstable self-image or sense of self), and impulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712448790">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>). This clinical syndrome often includes chronic self-injurious behaviors (SIBs), frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, and alternations between extremes of idealization and devaluation. To meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD, symptoms must be present by early adulthood and may include a constellation of symptoms comprising the affective, impulsive, and cognitive dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1066480712448790">Paris, 2009</xref>). It has been estimated that approximately 5.9% of the population is living with BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712448790">Grant et al., 2008</xref>) and 20–30% of those with BPD symptoms are involved in a romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712448790">Clarkin, Lenzenweger, Yeomans, Levy, &amp; Kernberg, 2007</xref>). It is difficult to estimate the number of parents of young children who are living with BPD, but current epidemiological prevalence rates have suggested up to 2% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1066480712448790">Lenzenweger, Loranger, &amp; Kessler, 2007</xref>) and 15% of the clinical population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1066480712448790">Hyman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A preferred approach to understanding the etiology of BPD is the biopsychosocial model of psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712448790">Engel, 1980</xref>). This framework integrates and appreciates the influences of biological, psychological, and social factors. The multidimensionality of BPD allows for a number of complex interactions between temperaments, traits, and environmental and social stressors, such as trauma, which can threaten the developmental process of attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448790">Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist, &amp; Target, 2002</xref>). This framework also emphasizes the reciprocal determinism of the developmental process of BPD. For instance, a genetic vulnerability and environmental component is found whereby individuals with BPD have an underlying trait or genetic predisposition, have a parent who suffers from BPD or other personality disorders, and encounter a poor fit between the self and familial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066480712448790">Heard &amp; Linehan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712448790">Lenzenweger &amp; Cicchetti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1066480712448790">Zanarini, Frankenburg, Hennen, Reich, &amp; Silk, 2005</xref>). Children with underlying dispositions may increase the vulnerability of the influence of caregiver characteristics, such as emotional unavailability, unresponsiveness, and conflicted and invalidating messages. Thus, children who are perceived as difficult may face more rejection, abuse, or experience troubling relationships with their families. Studies involving mothers with BPD and infants show a higher incidence of abuse and neglect as children, along with greater preoccupied unresolved losses and/or traumas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448790">Fonagy et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Growing up in an environment with a parent with BPD presents with risks and resilience. Social and interpersonal experiences can serve as protective factors, such as strong support systems where children have alternative sources of attachment figures. In addition, intrapersonal characteristics, positive personality traits, and intelligence can also lead children to seek out other attachment figures. Despite the chronicity of BPD, it is a highly treatable disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1066480712448790">Leichsenring &amp; Leibing, 2003</xref>), and understanding developmental precursors to BPD, including risk and protective factors, is an important consideration for both treatment and prevention.</p>

<title>Attachment, Contextual Risks, RF, and BPD</title>
<p>Attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448790">Bowlby, 1973</xref>) provides a useful framework for understanding the critical features of BPD. It has also supported the use of object relations theory in understanding and treating BPD for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712448790">Clarkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1066480712448790">Kernberg, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1066480712448790">Klein, 1975</xref>). Object relations approach in treating BPD has been the most effective when compared to DBT and psychoanalytically oriented therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1066480712448790">Levy et al., 2006</xref>). From an attachment perspective, BPD results from a severe disturbance in early caregiver–infant relationships, which results in adults’ attachment-related mentalization deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712448790">Fonagy &amp; Bateman, 2006</xref>). Early proximity to a caregiver leads to internal feelings of security and external feelings of others’ availability. However, when threats to this security are experienced, such as abuse, neglect, separation, loss, and/or trauma, aggression and other insecure behaviors are often the resulting coping mechanism.</p>
<p>Mentalization, or the ability to recognize and interpret one’s own and others’ actions in terms of their personal thoughts, feelings, desires, beliefs, and reasons, is also referred to as RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>). RF is theorized as the capacity to facilitate coherent and integrated mental representations of self and other, thereby serving to organize attachment behavior and emotional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448790">Fonagy et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, autobiographical memories involve an individual’s significant and long-lasting accounts of personal life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1066480712448790">Wang, 2007</xref>). The social interactionist theory proposes that these complex memories develop from the collaborative construction of past personal narratives between children and significant adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1066480712448790">Nelson &amp; Fivush, 2004</xref>), as well as the interplay between children and their proximal social settings within the cultural setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1066480712448790">Wang, 2007</xref>). Individuals rely on their ability to remember their past in order to maintain their present life narratives and fulfill their sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448790">Conway &amp; Pleydell-Pearce, 2000</xref>). These memories can form the basis for both risk and resilience in families with BPD. </p>
<p>BPD is characterized by attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1066480712448790">Minzenberg, Poole, &amp; Vinogradov, 2006</xref>). This suggests that those with BPD experience conflicted feelings with regard to desiring intimacy, yet simultaneously fearing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1066480712448790">Nickell, Waudby, &amp; Trull, 2002</xref>). The reduced RF of the individual results in higher rates of preoccupied and fearful-avoidant or disorganized attachment styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1066480712448790">Minzenberg et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, a child operating from this attachment base perceives and interprets the environment with apprehension and unpredictability, thereby threatening the development of self-regulating mental structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712448790">Fischer-Kern et al., 2010</xref>). More than half of insecure attachment styles result from unresolved loss or trauma, with a tendency to maximize attachment strategies, creating a further predisposition toward poor affect regulation, impulse control, internalizing disorders, and BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1066480712448790">Levy, 2005</xref>). Thus, it is children of mothers with BPD, who are at a high-risk for developing BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1066480712448790">Lenzenweger et al., 2007</xref>). </p>
<p>Caregiver aggression compromises the ability to develop realistic views of self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1066480712448790">Levy, 2005</xref>). Those who witness early traumas tend to develop internal working models (IWMs) that include expectations of aggression from others, and aggression toward others and oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448790">Critchfield, Levy, Clarkin, &amp; Kernberg, 2008</xref>). Individuals with BPD often use passive and angry speech when discussing their early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1066480712448790">Kobak, Zajac, &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>). This anger then extends to all interpersonal relationships through depression, unpredicted impulsivity, self-harm (i.e., attachment avoidance), irritability, anger, aggression, and impulsivity (i.e., attachment anxiety; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448790">Critchfield et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1066480712448790">Minzenberg et al., 2006</xref>). All of the reviewed symptoms have implications for familial interactions, especially parent–child relationships.</p>
<p>Parental bonding and skill deficits also represent risks for BPD. Mothers with BPD have a negative self-image, which compromises their parenting capacity. They are angrier, anxious, less competent, overwhelmed, intrusively insensitive, and show less structured interactions with their infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448790">Crandell, Patrick, &amp; Hobson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1066480712448790">Newman, Stevenson, Bergman, &amp; Boyce, 2007</xref>). This early period is crucial for optimal development. Thus, these parenting inconsistencies predispose individuals to develop preoccupied attachment styles, which cause a predisposition toward fluctuations of attachment figure representations. Not surprisingly, individuals with BPD often characterize their caregivers as instable, demanding, overprotective, lacking empathy, insensitive, and inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480712448790">Guttman &amp; Laporte, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712448790">Lyddon &amp; Sherry, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1066480712448790">Nickell et al. (2002)</xref> found bonding to be related to BPD in adults, above and beyond adverse childhood events. In addition, mothers encounter defensive splitting, whereby their child is perceived as “all good” and needing to be protected or “all bad” and needing to be reprimanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448790">Glickauf-Hughes &amp; Mehlman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1066480712448790">Newman &amp; Stevenson, 2005</xref>). The mother’s inability to adequately regulate her own emotions and her fluctuation between idealizing and devaluating her child decreases the positive mother–child relationship, thereby negatively impacting the child’s development of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1066480712448790">Newman &amp; Stevenson, 2005</xref>). Thus, problematic and dysfunctional parental relationships may predispose individuals to developing and maintaining BPD symptoms.</p>
<p>In summary, exposure to these risk factors increases the risk of developing BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). The developmental and attachment theory perspective would thus postulate that BPD results from a series of unsuccessful interactional processes during crucial development periods, with early distorted IWMs resulting in later impaired IWMs, which contribute to the interpersonal and intrapersonal problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1066480712448790">Levy, 2005</xref>). Thus, many of the individual-level factors associated with BPD symptoms can have an impact on the family unit. In addition, early identification and treatment may assist in the prevention of developing BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448790">Barnow, Spitzer, Grabe, Kessler, &amp; Freyberger, 2006</xref>), thus suggesting the need to adopt a systems-based attachment intervention approach for the prevention and treatment of BPD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1066480712448790">
<title>Impact of BPD on Family Subsystems</title>
<p>Systems thinking posits that psychological disorders can be understood as developed and sustained by the family’s homeostatic forces. Although only 11% of first degree relatives of individuals with BPD also have BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1066480712448790">Nigg &amp; Goldsmith, 1994</xref>), symptoms displayed by symptomatic family members can increase the risk of their children developing BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). “A mother’s hostility, rage, and destructive behavior may be disguised as love, [thereby] making it difficult for [her] child to trust his or her own perceptions of reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448790">Glickauf-Hughes &amp; Mehlman, 1998</xref>, p. 296). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie and Swan (2009)</xref> found children of mothers with BPD to have increased fear of abandonment, more parent–child role reversals, and negative parent–child relationship expectations. In addition, these children had shameful and maladaptive self-representations, poorer emotional regulation, and increased boundaries of confusion with respect to fantasy and reality. Due to the recurrent stress and reversed mother–child role expectations, these children also show a higher prevalence of “disorganized” attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448790">Hobson, Patrick, Crandell, Garcia-Perez, &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). As expected in times of stress, these children attempt to use their mother as a “secure base,” but then realize that their mother is also the threat, thereby resulting in the child clinging and pushing his or her mother away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448790">Crandell et al., 2003</xref>). </p>
<p>Mothers with BPD experienced “disorganized” childhood attachment patterns, which extend to adulthood in the form of “enmeshed” and “unresolved” attachment patterns. Similarly, because the quality of the mother–child relationship is reflective of the mother’s ability to mirror and cope with prior trauma, these negative patterns may transmit to their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448790">Crandell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712448790">Crandell, Fitzgerald, &amp; Whipple, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448790">Hobson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448790">Holmes, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712448790">Feldman et al. (1995)</xref> found a generational effect, whereby families with mothers with BPD were significantly less cohesive, organized, and stable than families without BPD. The maladaptive environments were a source of risk for the child, whereby the mother’s traumatic history was replicated in her own family. Developmentally, this affects the infants through decreased attentiveness, positive engagement, and behavioral organization, as well as increased confusion and withdrawal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448790">Crandell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712448790">Hobson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1066480712448790">Newman et al., 2007</xref>). During the preschool and adolescence period, children and adolescents report feeling more unstable and unhappy in their family environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712448790">Feldman et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, they show an inability to cope with frightening situations, verbalize feelings of inadequacy, and have more emotional, behavioral, somatic, interpersonal, and affective regulation difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448790">Barnow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448790">Holmes, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480712448790">
<title>BPD and RF</title>
<p>In order to properly modulate and express emotions, one must recognize and understand certain inner narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>). Decreased RF and an inability to reflect upon and integrate prior experiences with present ones contribute to the mothers with BPD’s lack of emotional availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448790">Crandell &amp; Hobson, 1999</xref>). Children of mothers with BPD are likely to experience defensive splitting and display “emotional needs through denial, acting-out, self-destructive behavior, and role reversals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448790">Glickauf-Hughes &amp; Mehlman, 1998</xref>, p. 300). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie and Swan (2009)</xref> found that the child’s level of emotional regulation was directly correlated with the level of the mother’s borderline features, such as identity disturbance, SIBs, and negative interpersonal relationships. Further, these children were also more likely to represent themselves as the <italic>shameful </italic>child (e.g., child as bad) and behave in incongruent ways (e.g., “child cleans up his room and then trashes it”; p. 1001). The fear of abandonment often expressed in a child’s narratives usually extends to adulthood, as individuals continue to attempt to cope with their intense emotional arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1066480712448790">Linehan, 1993</xref>). Thus, the child who exhibited dysfunctional narratives may continue to identify with transitional objects, such as their “blankie” or teddy bears as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066480712448790">Gunderson, 2001</xref>). This same child may also extend his or her negative parental expectations to current relationships, resulting in their intense, angry, and unstable relationships. Shameful or incongruent representations of the self may also be internalized and extend to adulthood in the form of maladaptive coping strategies, including SIBs and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). Thus, including the larger family system and specific subsystems (e.g., parent–child dyads) is vital for prevention and treatment of BPD. Given that BPD is comorbid with a number of other diagnoses, there is a need to assist mental health consumers with parenting and relationship issues. </p>
<p>The studies reviewed here suggest the developmental pathogensis of BPD that incorporates individual, contextual, and environmental risks. Macfie and Swan’s (2009) study also showed the development of shameful and incongruent self-representations emerging in young children whose parent is living with BPD. A number of interventions supporting positive parent–child interactions among mothers with BPD have emerged over the past several years, one such being dyadic child–parent psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1066480712448790">Leiberman, 1992</xref>). Within this attachment-based procedure, the mother feels validated by the therapist and thus feels confident and secure to explore her own, along with her child’s feelings, beliefs, and needs. This in turn strengthens the mother–child relationship, which assists in altering the attachment bonds and decreases negative narrative representations in maltreated children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). RF capacities mediate attachment styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448790">Arnott &amp; Meins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712448790">Fonagy et al., 1995</xref>) and show promising outcomes in individual therapy among those with BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712448790">Fischer-Kern et al., 2010</xref>). Increasing RF through narrative approaches within a systemic approach is theorized to increase the mentalization capacity and thus can serve as a protective factor in the development of BPD, especially among those with problematic childhood experiences. To date, there appears to be a lack of formal research on family-based approaches. Interventions aimed at altering child–caregiver relationships and IWMs, as well as improving emotional regulation within the entire family system are required to decrease the severe burden of BPD on the individual family system and larger health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). </p>

<title>Incorporating RF in Narrative Family Therapy (NFT)</title>
<p>NFT proposes that all individuals have “narratives” or stories about their lives, which affects their internal and external worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1066480712448790">Morgan, 2000</xref>). Oftentimes, clients with BPD are reluctant to the therapeutic process. Narrative therapy (NT) is a nonthreatening approach which acknowledges that the client does not want to be in therapy, but simultaneously works to find a motivating goal. Clinicians working with children and youth may recognize that a family member may be exhibiting BPD, which is interfering with the child’s functioning. Caregivers who may perceive the child/youth as the identified patient (IP) may also be reluctant to engage in the therapeutic process or be recognized as an essential component of successful treatment. The ultimate goal with the clients is thus non-pathologizing, validating, and educational, where symptoms are explored and revised into successful coping strategies. This flexible approach provides the clients with space to explore, revise, and reconnect with their past, while challenging patterns of living and thinking that are negative, distressing, hopeless, judgmental, and abusive. Although trauma may mediate or amplify underlying traits that may contribute to BPD, NT can be utilized to assist the clients to address traumatic experiences and recognize how the “problem” is contributing to their relationships and well-being. Thus, this collaborative, storytelling and retelling attachment and family approach advocates a recovery-oriented approach. </p>
<p>A vital aspect of BPD is emotional regulation and expression in the psychotherapeutic context. Strategies to integrate RF within the NFT approach have not been outlined previously. The rationale for linking RF to this approach not only stems from the use of discourse analysis in measuring RF (i.e., Adult Attachment Interview (AAI); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1066480712448790">Main, Goldwyn, &amp; Hesse, 2003</xref>) but also allowing greater use of the interpersonal narratives and attachments to naturally occur within NT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066480712448790">Karlsson and Kermott (2006)</xref> proposed the integration of RF in psychotherapy and is one of a limited number of studies applying RF to the therapy process. These researchers also have linked RF to psychological concepts, such as psychological mindedness, mindfulness, empathetic responding, and metacognitive skills, pertaining to understanding one’s own and others’ mental states. Contrary to expectations, Karlsson and Kermott’s (2006) study of RF across three treatment approaches found significant drops in RF at the fourth session. The authors suggest that the drop in RF occurred after therapists began structuring sessions according to the specific treatment approach (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) following the “initial phase of obtaining extensive interpersonal history” (p. 79). This suggests that client’s narratives were cut short to serve the needs of the therapeutic approach, whereas in another study where client’s interpersonal narratives extended throughout the treatment, RF increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712448790">Crits-Christoph et al., 1999</xref>). This also suggests that an important aspect of developing RF is through narratives in the therapy process. Thus, therapies designed to illicit the psychological qualities of insight, attention to unacceptable feelings, and interpersonal narratives are theorized to increase RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448790">Fonagy et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, we contend that NT may provide the therapeutic milieu in which RF can be influenced. </p>
<p>Interventions designed to increase RF among caregivers for BPD within a relational context is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448790">Fonagy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712448790">Heinicke et al., 2000</xref>), particularly for enhancing attachment within early mother–child dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1066480712448790">Newman &amp; Stevenson, 2005</xref>). On review of the relevant literature on RF, NT, and BPD treatment, eight main approaches were identified to support families affected by BPD. These approaches are as follows: (a) identifying the family system’s attachment patterns, (b) joining and strengthening the attachment security, (c) emphasizing and validating family diversity, (d) identifying family beliefs and IWMs, (e) emphasizing family communications and behaviors, (f) telling and retelling the story, (g) reorganization and role alignment, and (h) facilitating the maintenance of attachment changes.</p>

<title>Identifying the Family System’s Attachment Patterns</title>
<p>A key therapeutic goal is to define the family as a whole where each member impacts the system in the present moment. Building a strong therapeutic alliance is difficult with the IP, who has fluctuating representations and moment-to-moment therapeutic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480712448790">Gabbard et al., 1988</xref>). Perceived empathetic failures, recurrent therapeutic ruptures, angry outbursts, treatment inconsistency, goal challenges, decreased in-session collaboration, and premature termination are all common encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1066480712448790">Semerari et al., 2005</xref>). While working to create a therapeutic alliance and accurate family portrait, the therapist defines the attachment figures and IWMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>), thereby strengthening the family’s overall self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1066480712448790">Morgan, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Joining and Strengthening the Attachment Security</title>
<p>To reduce blame and guilt, key therapeutic components include increasing the establishment and sustenance of trusting relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2004</xref>). Attachment theory focuses on past and present danger and threats to security and safety, which affects psychological functioning. In order to protect themselves and their children, women with BPD require a sense of safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>). To promote attachment security, early mother–infant intervention programs should thus aim to increase RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448790">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448790">Cohen, Lojkasek, Muir, Muir, &amp; Parker, 2002</xref>). Children require more positive feedback and support, since they tend to be inhibited and socially withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448790">Barnow et al., 2006</xref>). Using consistent and robust therapeutic interventions, therapists work to assist families to identify and express emotions verbally, so as to increase both emotional regulation and socialization among parents and their preschoolers. In addition, the therapist models coping strategies (e.g., psychological and behavioral availability and responsiveness, empathy, active listening, acceptance, and healthy rules, responsibilities, and interactional processes) that promote greater emotional regulation strategies and secure attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066480712448790">Gunderson, 2001</xref>). Moreover, through the use of modeling and scaffolding, parents can assist children to become active participants in their narratives, thereby facilitating the child’s ability to recognize and represent autobiographical memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1066480712448790">Nelson &amp; Fivush, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1066480712448790">Wang, 2007</xref>). This in turn facilitates the ability to construct coherent, elaborative life stories that integrate the entire family system. </p>

<title>Emphasizing and Validating Family Diversity</title>
<p>An invalidating familial environment (i.e., one that ignores, dismisses, and punishes the child’s expression of internal states) is often implicated in BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1066480712448790">Linehan, 1993</xref>). These families fail to provide children with the skills to develop an understanding and means of communicating their emotional experiences. These skill deficits hinder the therapeutic relationship, resulting in self-invalidating statements, such as “If things don’t go my way, I can’t tolerate it. Others are great; no they’re not” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712448790">Lyddon &amp; Sherry, 2001</xref>, p. 411). Similar to the MBT intermediate level, the therapist’s direct interest in the IP’s emotional states result in the IP’s exploration of their own and others’ emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>). As BPD affects the family system, working to frame the problem in the context of the larger system, while promoting individual differences and creativity, facilitates optimal change. Using DBT techniques, the therapist’s validation and normalization of past actions in the current moment also facilitates optimal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1066480712448790">Linehan, 1993</xref>). For children, play therapy can be used to promote changes in the interactional process. For adults, more discussion-based and experimental therapy enables a less stressed approach to handling the “problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1066480712448790">White, 1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1066480712448790">
<title>Identifying the Family Belief System and IWMs</title>
<p>Examining one’s feelings, expectations, and behaviors in the context of early familial interactions assists in understanding how dysfunctional interactions damage one’s IWMs, thereby causing future attachment difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448790">Bowlby, 1973</xref>). Assessing the preschoolers’ mental states allows for a clearer understanding of the development of their IWMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1066480712448790">Newman &amp; Stevenson, 2005</xref>). Assessing the attachment narratives of children and adults further clarifies IWMs, attachment relationships, emotional regulation, and family boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). Using narratives from the AAI (Main et al., 2003), the therapist can understand how the “problem” developed and its current functions in the IP’s life. For example, the behavior may serve as a self-protective strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>). The importance of listening, accepting, and exploring the family’s description of the problem, as well as challenging the narratives and emphasizing familial connections and communication cannot be underscored. Through the therapist’s support, the IP is able to work through their earlier relationship traumas to achieve a more balanced representation of past negative bonds and therefore current IWMs. This in turn promotes survival rather than victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1066480712448790">White, 1995</xref>). </p>

<title>Emphasizing Family Communication and Behaviors</title>
<p>Mothers with BPD have difficulty expressing their feelings with words, which results in an increase in frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1066480712448790">Newman &amp; Stevenson, 2005</xref>). Oftentimes, because of their reduced capacity to respond to their child’s needs, they project their past traumatic experiences onto the mother–child interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712448790">Crandell et al., 1997</xref>). NFT centering on instructing and modeling empathy and parental skills thus decreases risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480712448790">Guttman &amp; Laporte, 2000</xref>). Treatment focusing on an attachment-based understanding of aggression may also prevent the expectations and perceptions of others as hostile, which inhibits interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448790">Critchfield et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a key goal becomes recognizing and reflecting on discrepant representations. Many times, interactional patterns are mis-attuned. For example, a mother may accurately perceive, but misconstrue and articulate, the meaning of her infant’s behavior (“he’s crying because he hates me”). In this case, interventions focusing on increasing RF and reframing the mother’s understanding are warranted, as they increase the mother–infant interactions, thereby reducing further risk. The mother’s use of more elaborative reminiscing may also facilitate the child’s subsequent ability to represent, rehearse, and report autobiographical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1066480712448790">Nelson &amp; Fivush, 2004</xref>). Promoting the sharing of words between family members enables for a richer understanding of the painful encounters, which connect to the person’s perceptions, beliefs, emotions, memories, and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1066480712448790">May, 2005</xref>). </p>
<p>NT is based on the premise that stories, and not fixed realities, shape our lives. Thus, when the negative stories are changed, the focus is moved from being the victim to the victor, one who survived the negative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1066480712448790">White, 1995</xref>). A key goal of NT is thus to externalize the problem, whereby the person is separated from the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1066480712448790">White, 1995</xref>). This reduces the defensiveness within the IP along with the blame and shame within the family, thereby empowering the IP and family to take responsibility of destructive patterns of interpersonal relationships and emotional reactivity in a nonthreatening manner. With respect to BPD, the tendency to externalize unbearable self-states and the resulting countertransference responses are key issues for the therapist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2004</xref>). Externalization of the self associated with the disorganized attachment is necessary for children who experience a traumatic childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>). Externalization enables individuals to understand and construct more accurate representations of their past experiences while working toward increasing their mentalization capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>). Increasing the IP’s empathy with himself or herself in turn increases his or her ability to empathize with others. Thus, improving RF increases the IP’s ability to observe himself or herself in a noncritical and more accepting manner.</p>

<title>Telling and Retelling the Story</title>
<p>The ability to express one’s “narrative” and emotions is very therapeutic. Angus’ narrative process model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448790">Angus, Lewin, Bouffard, &amp; Rotondi-Trevisan, 2004</xref>) proposes that storytelling is a result of the dialectical interplay between autobiographical memory, emotions, and reflective meaning. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1066480712448790">White (1995)</xref>, the therapist listens to the story, looks for collaborative ways to deconstruct the story, and listens for statements and emotions that have not been identified or “told.” The therapist validates and acknowledges the individual’s experience while encouraging the development of appropriate interpersonal skills, which simultaneously facilitates attachment security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448790">Grossmann &amp; Grossmann, 2005</xref>). Each narrative draws meaning from the previous story themes, and thereby each narrative is a story waiting to be told (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1066480712448790">Morgan, 2000</xref>). Focusing on the individual’s strengths and categorizing behavior as organized and meaningful is beneficial in reducing BPD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>). The child’s history is explained in the context of the family system, which serves to enhance the communication between family members and strengthens the overall emotional connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1066480712448790">May, 2005</xref>). A key therapeutic challenge during this stage is balancing emotional stimulation to achieve a relaxation state. Overstimulation results in panic and SIBs while understimulation results in a level of safety where problems are unacknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>). While challenging perceptions and dysfunctional thoughts, the therapist is able to integrate the AAI memories with the affect, thereby reducing negative IWMs. </p>

<title>Reorganization and Role Realignment</title>
<p>The therapist restructures the family unit to promote healthier functioning. Within the systems perspective, families strive to maintain homeostasis at any cost. In the case of BPD, mothers are at a risk of repeating their past disturbing interactional patterns, which can be traumatic for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1066480712448790">Newman et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, they often struggle with daily routines and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712448790">Feldman et al., 1995</xref>). A key therapeutic goal is thus to alter parents’ perceptions of themselves and their children, especially distorted attributions, which in turn facilitates changes in interactional patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>). In addition, repairing the parent–child relationship, when the parent is the source of trauma, is necessary, as is working toward decreasing the mother’s overprotective, insensitive, and inconsistent parenting strategies. By promoting sensitive interactions, a decrease in parental control and criticism is facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448790">Barnow et al., 2006</xref>). Strengthening sensitivity also promotes attachment security, which in turn results in more structured parent–child interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1066480712448790">Newman et al., 2007</xref>). This in turn creates an environment where routines, structures, and boundaries are maintained, which facilitates a sense of stability, mutual supportiveness, and less cohesion. </p>

<title>Facilitating the Maintenance of Attachment Changes</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1066480712448790">Meyer, Pilkonis, Proietti, Heape, and Egan (2001)</xref> found insecure attachment and BPD to be associated with distress and less favorable treatment outcomes. Consequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712448790">Holmes (2003)</xref> advocated for a stable caregiver relationship as the core feature of treatment maintenance. When experiencing a traumatic event, the child, who attempts to seek proximity to the attachment figure with BPD, is actually traumatized further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448790">Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712448790">Fonagy and Bateman (2006)</xref> indicated that the clinician’s main therapeutic goal is thus activating the attachment system, which ultimately enhances the IP’s RF. Therapists must connect the feelings of self and others during experiences, while simultaneously working toward integrating discrepant IWMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448790">Crittenden &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>), all of which help family functioning. Treatment requires a strong therapeutic alliance where social support systems can activate positive IWMs, thereby healing attachment bonds. </p>
<p>Overall, children require structure, balance, and feelings of security within their family setting. Although much research has centered on individual and group interventions for treating BPD, it is evident that these unidimensional approaches are not sufficient to prevent the transmission of a multidimensional, multifaceted problem, such as BPD. Treatment approaches such as DBT, MBT, and SPT work at treating BPD, whereas an approach such as NFT works at both treating and simultaneously preventing BPD, while positioning the client as the expert in his or her life. Attachment NT combined with family systems therapy and RF offers a positive, friendly, and flexible approach for treating families with and at risk for the development of BPD. It defines the context of the family more broadly and begins early to alter the nature of the attachment relationships. The therapist’s warmth, interest, active listening, empathy, and role alignments works to facilitate changes, thereby promoting more positive family interactions.</p>

<title>Future Research Directions and Questions</title>
<p>Although research has examined BPD in relation to family characteristics and interactional patterns, more outcome research is needed to determine the extent to which the family unit affects BPD symptomatology and the role of treatment for children whose mothers have BPD. Because early environmental conditions interact with genetic vulnerabilities, targeting high-risk families with early intervention programs may prove to be valuable in the large-scale prevention of BPD in children with mothers of BPD. Future research into this area using a systemic family attachment NT approach would provide a foundation for identifying the unhealthy system interactions and subsequent insecure attachment styles that often result in these children. Interventions need to focus on improving the quantity and quality of mother–infant interactions and promote increased empathic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1066480712448790">Newman &amp; Stevenson, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1066480712448790">Leiberman, Weston, and Pawl (1991)</xref> advocated for the need to involve the infants in the therapeutic process, postulating that the infants’ involvement facilitates a greater understanding of how the caregivers’ behaviors affect their child’s development. Future research into these interventions is warranted to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these treatments. Can infants facilitate the treatment process or does their involvement place them at further risk? Do increasing RF capacities from a young age have the ability to alter the developmental trajectories toward BPD or do the risks outweigh the resilience levels? More longitudinal work is also required to understand the narratives and representational and emotional development of children whose mothers have BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712448790">Macfie &amp; Swan, 2009</xref>). In addition, research still needs to clarify the impact of parenting on attachment relationships and subsequent symptomatology in individuals with BPD and whether certain protective factors buffer against these symptoms, such as a supportive significant other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448790">Crandell et al., 2003</xref>), higher RF capacities, or the use of NFT. Future research will need to explore the mechanisms of change within the NT approach in the development, maintenance, and treatment of BPD, and the specific therapeutic techniques that bring about such changes. Thus, future controlled studies using this approach with children from mothers with BPD are recommended to see whether prevention and resilience can develop. </p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Attachment theory is based on the proposition that early relationships pave the way for later interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448790">Bowlby, 1973</xref>), through IWMs of self and others. Consistency and sensitivity in early relationships tends to result in an individual exhibiting secure attachment styles, whereas unresponsiveness and inconsistency in early relationships results in insecure attachment styles. Insecurity of attachment has been found to be associated with a wide range of clinical disorders, including BPD, which is thought to result from early separation, loss, and/or trauma. NT is grounded in postmodern thought and is a collaborative process between the therapist and client to examine and externalize the BPD symptoms as the dynamic maintaining the interactional problems between the family systems. Witnessing the stories and struggles from a standpoint of compassion and understanding enables the family to feel unique, thereby reducing the feelings of blame and shame. Attachment theory, along with NT and RF, is thus a useful framework when attempting to explore and explain the development, maintenance, and termination of relationships and their influence on an individual’s personality development, emotional regulation, socialization, psychopathology, and ultimately the successful treatment of BPD.</p>
