<abstract>
<p>Scholars have noted that United States federal government reforms come in waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312442659">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852312442659">Kettl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312442659">Light, 1998</xref>), often accompanied by values that alternate between rational and normative conceptions of public administration and service. The idea of alternation also suggests the importance of time in gauging the effect of new reforms when previous reforms have accumulated from the past (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2008</xref>). Time is a necessary variable in implementing reforms; time is crucial to know if reform values have taken hold. Extending Paul Light’s (1998) reform waves metaphor, we investigate here whether two predominant management philosophies have influenced and reconfigured the shoreline of values found among federal agencies over a particular period of time. Using empirical methods, we examine how the values of New Public Management and its humanist (post-NPM) counterpart have settled and taken hold among US federal agencies. We followed three lines of inquiry: determining the existence of reform values in the bureaucracy, examining the prevalence of different sets of values, and investigating whether ‘crowding out’ of values occurred, that is, whether there was a detectable shift in the distribution of values as a new wave came on top of others. Our analysis yields evidence for the predominance of certain NPM and post-NPM values and indicates that bureaucracy concurrently holds what may be regarded as competing values side-by-side. Implications for research and future reforms are suggested in the final section of the article.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0020852312442659"><title>Points for practitioners</title>
<p>Practicing public administration requires constantly navigating reform pressures that espouse different, sometimes opposing, value sets. NPM and post-NPM reforms differed in their emphasis on applying rationalistic and humanistic values to the work of government. Based on federal workforce surveys, NPM values appeared ascendant from the reinvention period till the end of the Bush administration, when a more humanist outlook began to emerge. Bureaucratic values are dynamic and change could go faster with network structures. Following previous research, this study suggests that a ‘layering’ of reform occurs; the strongest values are held intact even as newer philosophies of organization and management are introduced. Results suggest that government professionals can adhere to differing values, but further study is required to see how those values actually influence their work.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec1-0020852312442659" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The last few decades have seen several initiatives to reform the US federal bureaucracy. Scholars recognize that certain types of reform have a tendency to alternate or overlap, although there are slightly different approaches to anticipating what will occur next. Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312442659">Light (1998)</xref> typologized US federal management reforms using a tides metaphor, with four types washing ashore alternatingly – scientific management of government offices, a war on wasteful spending, a watchful eye through checks and balances, and liberation management in the executive branch. The tides connote an ebb and flow, guaranteeing the comeback of previous reforms and inevitable depositing of some sediments behind. Other scholars have argued that, in order to objectively assess the current reforms as well as to accurately predict the future directions, we need to look back at what has happened over time and to recognize what theoretical approaches could be well applicable to explain ‘the temporal dimension’ of specific public policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2008</xref>: 30).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852312442659">1</xref></sup> For example, drawing upon a sequential perspective, the path dependency framework explains why some specific policies are more durable and stable than others, ‘despite the changing environments around them’ (2008: 42) whereas theories of cycles or alternations suggest that tides of governmental changes and mechanisms could be observed and identified in different fashions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While reforms often tack the ‘new’ label upon their names, they sometimes resemble a pendulum with discernible interplay between more efficiency-driven initiatives and initiatives that prize values other than efficiency in public service performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312442659">Barley and Kunda (1992: 392)</xref> suggest that, ‘rather than having progressed steadily from coercive to rational and then to normative conceptions of control’, American managerial ideology has been conceptualized in waves that have alternated between normative and rational rhetoric (p. 363). Of late, this has been observed in the shift from corporatist, New Public Management (NPM)-based values to a more normative, post-NPM emphasis on value-laden, knowledge-based, and team-based ethical management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312442659">Christensen and Lægreid, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>NPM reforms emphasize individualism, production (productivity and performance), rationality, and materialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312442659">Fox and Miller, 1995</xref>). The administration of George W. Bush (2001–08) carried out a managerialist agenda with a theme that aligned with NPM. ‘The Bush administration was enamored of practices believed to be common in the private sector where managers typically have greater discretion than their counterparts in the public services in recruitment, selection, management, and retention of employees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312442659">Kellough et al., 2010</xref>: 417). In contrast, post-NPM reforms pursue the antithesis of logical positivism and the post-rationality-based social science approaches, sharing common perspectives with organizational humanism, postmodern public administration, organizational development values, and even the old notion of New Public Administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312442659">Frederickson and Smith, 2003</xref>). These approaches reveal the limitations of rational and public choice models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312442659">Argyris, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312442659">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>), expose the internal contradictions of NPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312442659">Fox, 1996</xref>), and seek ways to ‘enlarge the area of discretion … to increase individual freedom’ and ‘create an open problem-solving climate through the organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2003</xref>: 37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312442659">Golembiewski, 1967</xref>: 305).</p>
<p>The many reform initiatives since the 1980s – privatization, the National Public Review, the President’s Management Agenda, cutback management, and performance and human capital assessment – prompt us to explore the configuration of values in the federal bureaucracy today. Over time, there is a strong likelihood that previous waves of presidential-driven reforms had lingering influence even as newer ones were implemented. What exactly would it look like if the configuration of values were to be mapped with a visual model? Is there evidence that NPM’s strict, market-based values have taken hold? If so, to what extent? Can we also find evidence of so-called post-NPM values, even though NPM reforms have been executed? This last point acknowledges what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852312442659">Pollitt (2008)</xref> observed of time as a neglected but subtly influential variable in assessing the clout of past management initiatives. We speak here of alternation but note the possibility that previous decisions have lasting impact even when newer reforms come about. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312442659">Light (1998)</xref> had remarked that ‘sediment’ build-up from multiple waves of bureaucratic tinkering. Could we sift through these sediments and identify distinctions?</p>
<p>Focusing on the years of the Bush administration, this article investigates salient values among federal agencies in the United States, as reflected by employee surveys from the period. We establish whether a sort of ‘crowding out’ occurred, meaning whether some values predominated over others. We also determine whether a shift in values happened over time. This investigation is significant in practical and conceptual ways. Practically, in light of ceaseless attempts to ‘improve’ the US bureaucracy: is there evidence that some principles have been cherished more than others, or have been more lastingly influential? As more fluid governance arrangements emerge, public administrators need to understand what salient values have taken hold at any point among bureaucratic agencies. In turn, this may subsequently help us determine whether newer structures and governance arrangements align with, or support, existing values. In theoretical terms, this study contributes a bit to the debate on how accurate it is to speak of distinctly NPM or post-NPM reform philosophies. Some scholars have questioned whether or not NPM and post-NPM represented coherent agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312442659">Goldfinch and Wallis, 2010</xref>), and if ‘reforms’ that carried their banners were actually semantic games that hid little substance beyond the rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2001</xref>). To the extent that we test, in our research methodology, certain values as ‘NPM’ and others as ‘post-NPM’, we essentially gear toward two distinctive sets of values. And while we do not directly investigate the coherence issue – that NPM and post-NPM agendas in different places mean different things due to institutional variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312442659">Goldfinch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312442659">Goldfinch and Wallis, 2010</xref>) – the results of our analysis that both sets are identifiable in the US federal bureaucracy allows for an interpretation of a ‘layering’ of reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0020852312442659">Thelen, 2003</xref>), rather than an outright replacement or alternation.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0020852312442659"><title>Interplay of reform values</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0020852312442659">Stone (1997)</xref> defines and compares two different models of society – the so-called <italic>polis</italic> and market models. The <italic>polis</italic> model, which is based on the political community and anti-rational-analytic rationales, can be a useful framework for thinking about government reform, especially when a rationality based, market model might not provide significant, real-life implications for employees. Two influential philosophies behind many federal management reforms are New Public Management (NPM) and post-NPM principles, which have a more humanist bent relative to NPM’s more economic approach to public service and management of bureaucracy. Paralleling the tension between the polis and market society, this section briefly compares the tenets of each reform philosophy.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0020852312442659"><title>New Public Management</title>
<p>Since the 1980s, NPM reforms have emphasized the values of individualism and economic rationality. NPM is known for systems and cultures of productivity improvement, reinvention, process re-engineering, entrepreneurial leadership, privatization, and performance measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312442659">Fox and Miller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312442659">Kelly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312442659">Lane and Woodard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020852312442659">Osborne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 1995</xref>). NPM offers a shift in ‘how we think about the role of public administrators, the nature of the profession, and how and why we do what we do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2000</xref>: 550). It sees ‘citizens as consumers, taxpayers, and customers’, and ‘leads people to evaluate government according to what each individual receives rather than what the community as a whole receives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312442659">King and Stivers, 1998</xref>: 57). The key managerial components of NPM varied from place to place; they boiled down to five according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312442659">Hays and Kearney (1997)</xref> and to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852312442659">Pollitt (1995)</xref>, eight. At its core, we can distill NPM reform values into three sets: (1) performance and results-oriented values (or managerialism and debureaucratization), (2) market and customer-oriented values (downsizing, privatization, and decentralization), and (3) goal and strategy-oriented values (strategic and workforce planning management).</p>
<p>NPM’s most recent incarnation occurred with the Bush administration’s (2001–08) human resources reforms that plugged partially into a strategy pursued since the presidency of Ronald Reagan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852312442659">Milakovich, 1988</xref>). Broad reflections on the civil service legacy of George W. Bush (see for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312442659">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312442659">Durant et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020852312442659">Maranto et al., 2009</xref>) mostly acknowledge his political, ideological, and technical resolve to shape the bureaucracy after conservative values.</p>
<p>At the heart of Bush’s big government conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312442659">Durant et al., 2010a</xref>) were the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), and the personnel management system overhaul of both the Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS) departments. Guided by market-based values, the PMA, for example, focused on improving five management areas: (1) strategic management of human capital, (2) competitive sourcing of government services, (3) financial performance improvement, (4) electronic government, and (5) budget and performance integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0020852312442659">US Office of Management and Budget, 2004</xref>), with competitive sourcing meeting the most resistance from federal employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312442659">Joaquin, 2009</xref>). The Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), launched in 2003, tried to build upon the earlier Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). PART evaluated nearly a thousand federal programs on the basis of (1) program purpose and design, (2) strategic planning, (3) program management, (4) program results, and (5) overall rating scores. As the White House intended it, PART was an opportunity to examine agency factors related to performance, findings that would, in turn, inform the budgetary process, linking tax dollars to program improvements or results.</p>
<p>In addition to the PMA and PART, far-reaching changes were also carried out at the DHS and DOD (e.g. the Max HR and Human Capital Operational Plan in the DHS and the National Security Personnel System in the DOD). The DHS initiatives were intended to create a system that would be flexible, contemporary, and grounded in principles of merit and fitness, equal pay for equal work, and equal employment opportunities. The ascendancy of management rights was considered of paramount importance due to national security concerns, thus enabling management to retain maximum flexibility pertaining to hiring, pay, discipline, job classifications, and labor relations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0020852312442659">Ryan, 2003</xref>: 101–106). The DOD’s National Security Personnel System also shaped a new HR system. It proposed a merit-pay system, an occupational classification, an objective performance appraisal system, as well as labor relations, adverse actions, and employee appeals systems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0020852312442659">Risher and Fay, 2007</xref>: 10). The Bush administration’s confrontational and ideological approach to implementing these reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312442659">Kellough et al., 2010</xref>), however, met union backlash and forced management to modify some of these proposals with a more incremental HR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0020852312442659">Riccucci and Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0020852312442659">Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0020852312442659">Underhill and Oman, 2007</xref>). Still, NPM philosophy was fundamental in the proposed reforms, which some authors observed to be distinguished clearly from traditional principles of public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312442659">Battaglio and Condrey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312442659">Condrey, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020852312442659">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Criticism of NPM includes its neglect of ‘the creation and development of an intense relationship of the individual with the larger issues of community, constitutional government, democratic values, and public service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020852312442659">Perry, 1996</xref>: 7). The market model for society also modified selection processes and incentive systems, adversely affecting the attitudes and performance of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020852312442659">Moynihan, 2008a</xref>). Many critics have noted the lack of convincing evidence that government agencies are inherently less effective than private firms in performing public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312442659">Boyne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020852312442659">Lowery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0020852312442659">Savas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0020852312442659">Sclar, 2000</xref>). The case of the Internal Revenue Service during the late 1990s also showed that the implementation of a radical performance measurement system did not bring about a more positive organizational culture, or a more productive workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0020852312442659">Thompson, 2006</xref>). NPM is also said to undermine democratic and constitutional values, as well as the ‘public ethos’ that provides civil service with a constitutive role in the traditional American governance system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312442659">Berry et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0020852312442659">Thompson, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec4-0020852312442659"><title>Beyond efficiency: post-NPM values</title>
<p>In reaction to the NPM philosophy, newer conceptions of public management arose that shared perspectives with organizational humanism, postmodern public administration, organizational development values, and even the old notion of New Public Administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312442659">Frederickson and Smith, 2003</xref>). Post-NPM approaches point out the limitations of rational and public choice models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312442659">Argyris, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312442659">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>), expose the internal contradictions of the NPM movement in public agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312442659">Fox, 1996</xref>), and seek ways to ‘enlarge the area of discretion … to increase individual freedom’ and to ‘create an open problem-solving climate through the organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2003</xref>: 37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312442659">Golembiewski, 1967</xref>: 305).</p>
<p>Current normative approaches trace their foundations to the work of Chester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312442659">Barnard (1938)</xref>, and later, of Douglas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852312442659">McGregor (1960)</xref>, and organizational humanists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0020852312442659">Roethlisberger and Dickson, 1939</xref>). In the late 1960s, the normative approach informed the thinking of the New Public Administration (NPA). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312442659">Frederickson (1996)</xref> argued that unlike NPM, NPA espoused the importance of humanistic and democratic administration, professionalism, and most importantly, social equity. After NPA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">2003)</xref> conceptualized the New Public Service (NPS), a movement emphasizing democratic governance and civic engagement. The model recognizes public servants not just as employees who crave the security and structure of a bureaucratic job (as typified by the old public administration), or as participants in a market (as they would be considered under New Public Management), but as people whose motivations and rewards are beyond the material or the monetary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852312442659">Perry and Wise, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020852312442659">Moore’s (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312442659">Bozeman’s (2007)</xref> conception of ‘public values’, defined as ‘the desires and perceptions of individuals … citizen’s aspirations, expressed through representative government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020852312442659">Moore, 1995</xref>: 52) and as ‘the content-specific preferences of individuals concerning, on the one hand, the rights, obligations, and benefits to which citizens are entitled and, on the other hand, the obligations expected of citizens and their designated representatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312442659">Bozeman, 2007</xref>: 14), recognize that public goods and services are provided to fulfill public values. In a similar vein, discourse theory, which supports the postmodern participatory and humanistic approach to public administrative reforms, suggests that the role of the public administrator is to act as a facilitator of discourse and communications outside the confines of institutional settings, and to prioritize equality among social groups, humanization of the workplace, intrinsic job involvement, empowerment, and expanded political and social participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312442659">Box, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0020852312442659">Wise, 2002</xref>). In addition, the tenet of social equity further embraces distributive justice, equal opportunities for employment, fair treatment, and the value of diversity, while prohibiting discrimination in the workplace. Finally, democratization values include employee empowerment, greater employee participation, and cooperative management practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0020852312442659">Wise, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These newer perspectives raise expectations for better quality of work life in organizations, and other broad social changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312442659">Ingelhart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312442659">Ingraham and Jones, 1999</xref>). They provide an alternative framework for viewing management reform in public agencies. In light of recent attempts to evaluate the Bush administration’s impact on federal human resources management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312442659">Kellough et al., 2010</xref>), it is useful to take a look at the configuration of values during those years in order to see what the findings suggest about future reforms. Reform, by definition, will never cease from executive or legislative action. Future forms of governance might require that bureaucracy overcome the rigid dichotomy between values of efficiency, and more normative values, in order to effectively address new problems in public administration.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0020852312442659"><title>Research questions</title>
<p>Based on the preceding literature review, this study aimed to identify the configuration of reform values in the federal bureaucracy over a period spanning the last several years. We structured the research questions as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Question 1: What management reform values (pertaining either to NPM or post-NPM) are salient in the US federal bureaucracy? Can we identify those values?</p>
<p>Question 2: Is a particular set of reform values more predominant than other sets? Is there a crowding out of certain values by one set of values over others?</p>
<p>Question 3: Can a trend be detected in changing values over a certain period of time, resulting from differing reform philosophies?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We aimed to capture value presence and dynamics over time. Based on the descriptive literature of NPM-oriented and post-NPM values, we developed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312442659">Figure 1</xref> to guide us in discovering and analyzing values from the results of federal agency surveys.

<sec id="sec6-0020852312442659" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The unit of analysis is the United States federal bureaucracy as represented by agencies whose employees participated in the Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS). Administered by the Office of Personnel Management in 2002, 2004, and 2006, the FHCS project consisted of surveys that contained 71 common questions between the 2004 and 2006 surveys, and 59 common questions between the 2002 and 2006 surveys. The largest federal-level survey of its kind, the 2006 sample covered 390,657 full-time permanent civilian employees from 29 agencies and 59 small/independent agencies (88 agencies in total). The response rate was approximately 57 percent (almost 221,479 responses). The original questionnaire contained 84 questions on employee job satisfaction and work attitudes, leadership, knowledge and diversity management, performance culture, and other personnel and managerial reform issues.</p>
<p>This study required three phases of data analysis to answer our research questions. Our methods consisted of (1) exploratory factor analysis, (2) confirmatory factor analysis, and (3) latent growth curve modeling to operationalize variables, reveal and confirm latent constructs and important factors, and investigate a growth process in federal agencies using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM is a useful tool for testing interrelationships among variables in a multivariate setting and assessing the relative strengths of each variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312442659">Jöreskog, and Sörbom, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To construct the factor structures base, the three sets (years) of FHCS data were collapsed into a single database using the means of the scores. The surveys used a 5-point Likert scale to measure agreement on given survey statements. This study used 14 questions to measure the factorial structure of NPM reform values, and 21 questions for post-NPM values (see Appendix). From there, the instrument revealed various sub-factors for NPM and post-NPM reform values, following in particular the taxonomy of reform values proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0020852312442659">Wise (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>We screened the data for outliers and extreme non-normal distribution patterns. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312442659">Table 1</xref> for the means and standard deviations for all variables. No problematic case of skewness was noted, and all values exhibited a high value of kurtosis (more than absolute 2.0). Missing data were excluded by the listwise deletion function, and the final survey sample amounted to 74,505 valid sample numbers. Since SEM is subject to problems based on missing data, we performed additional missing data analysis using the expectation maximization method. In addition, from KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy results, the adequacy value was 0.970, indicating that the matrix for this dataset is highly acceptable. In other words, the variables in the matrix may share common factors at a high level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020852312442659">3</xref></sup>

<p>First, in order to establish the structure of reform values present in the bureaucracy, exploratory factor analysis was employed on the items initially developed. The method of principal axis factoring extraction was used. To determine the number of factors to extract, the scree plot, Kaiser’s rule of eigenvalues greater than 1, Velicer’s MAP test, and parallel analysis were generated from raw data. The results suggested that six factors should be retained.</p>
<p>Under the assumption that these bureaucratic value constructs would be interrelated, an oblique direct oblimin rotation method was used to produce factors with the smallest number of cross-loadings from a parameter called delta. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312442659">Table 2</xref> shows the results of rotation. The percentage of variance accounted for by these six factors was 53.153 percent. To ensure internal consistency, we employed Cronbach’s alpha scores, which showed that the scores of the subscales had a relatively high degree of internal consistency (all above 0.7) on each of the six factors.

<p>Based on this analysis, we detected evidence to answer our first research question: multiple reform values do exist and are identifiable in the federal bureaucracy during recent years. NPM as well as post-NPM values are held. These results suggest that the six-factor solution extracted six distinctive values according to those having the highest factor loadings (equal to or greater than 0.50). These are market values, work–life balance values, performance values, social equity values, knowledge management values, and democratization. These loadings fit our assumption that an array of values, which are aligned with different philosophies, can be found in the federal bureaucracy. Their distribution is as follows:
<list id="list1-0020852312442659" list-type="simple">

<sec id="sec9-0020852312442659"><title>Distinguishing outstanding NPM and post-NPM values</title>
<p>We tried to determine which values predominate among these values. Confirmatory factor analysis of the type typically used to test the factor structure of an instrument was conducted. Overall fit indices and modification indices were used to identify a best-fit model. We added an error covariance among several indicators and respecified the model for the sake of decreasing the chi-square value. Then we tested and retested all alternative models. In our second-order CFA model, the two sets of reform values of NPM and post-NPM (second-order factors) in federal agencies were explained by six different reform values (first-order factors), indicating that NPM and post-NPM reform values are salient, distinct, and positively correlated (the covariance coefficient is 0.88). Several goodness-of-fit indices indicate that the entire model fits well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020852312442659">Figure 2</xref>). The chi-square value was 1434.06 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
<fig id="fig2-0020852312442659" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The results of the NPM and normative reform value structures (a pooled cross-sectional model)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312442659-fig2.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The results show moderate to high <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for each of the first-order factors (from 0.68 to 0.82). Two reform values stand out among agencies in terms of factor loadings: (1) performance and results-oriented reform values (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.78) on the NPM side, and (2) work–life balance values (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.82) on the post-NPM side. These values predominate among reform values in federal agencies, partially answering our second research question. Thus, an NPM value that emphasizes performance and cultures of accountability, together with a post-NPM value that focuses on employee discretion and flexibility, could be outstanding components of any future reform initiatives. This might indicate that agencies already found ways to balance the conflicting objectives and goals of reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852312442659">Lasseter, 2002</xref>). It also supports the view that post-NPM reforms were not diametrically opposite NPM ones; in fact the latter are an adaptation of the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312442659">Christensen and Lægreid, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312442659">Hood and Peters, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>T</italic>-tests (the critical value is ±2) indicated that all six first-order factors had significant loadings. The second-order factor analysis confirmed that NPM and post-NPM values are distinct, co-variant, and significantly related to each latent first-order factor. This means that differing managerial reform features are blended and preserved in bureaucracies, while remaining distinctive and salient among federal employees, as previous studies predicted (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312442659">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442659">Denhardt and Denhardt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312442659">Kaufman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0020852312442659">Wise, 2002</xref>). The interplay and alternation of reforms do produce layers of sediments on the bureaucratic shore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312442659">Light, 1998</xref>). Although our results do not provide evidence of the complete crowding out of one set of values by another, analysis implies that values from clashing philosophical camps have dually influenced the bureaucracy and may have complemented one another’s strengths. To stretch this to a logical conclusion, one might say that reforms leave a legacy of their best and strongest features, while weaknesses and gaps are filled by succeeding reform movements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0020852312442659"><title>Detecting a shift in bureaucratic values</title>
<p>Next, owing to the influence of time in assessing the impact of any reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2008</xref>), longitudinal analysis was used to address our third research question, if and how bureaucratic values shifted during the period under study, and, if possible, pinpointing when a shift occurred. In latent growth curve modeling, intercept and slope terms are treated as latent variables (factors). This method allowed us to obtain an estimate of the initial level of main outcome variables and the rate of change over time, and to link these parameters of growth to time-varying and time-invariant variables. The maximum likelihood method was used. The covariance matrix was used as input to LISREL 8.72 in order to evaluate the measurement model and full structural model.</p>
<p>The slope (linear change) and intercept (initial status) parameters were measured at each of the three time points: the years 2002, 2004, and 2006. The resulting NNFI (0.960), NFI (0.960), IFI (0.965), RFI (0.955), RMSEA (0.07), and SRMR (0.06) values suggest that this model fits well. The coefficients for intercept and slope were fixed in the equations. The only parameters estimated were the error variances, which showed that the amount of variability in the three time points is not explained by the intercept and slope parameters. The error variances in NPM and post-NPM at time 1 (year 2002), time 2 (year 2004), and time 3 (year 2006) were 0.15, 0.04, and 0.58, respectively. None of these variances was statistically significant.</p>
<p>The results indicate that the levels of NPM reform values in federal agencies diminished over time (negative slope), whereas post-NPM values constantly increased (positive slope) during the same period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0020852312442659">Figure 3</xref>). While one set of values emphasizing democratization, equity, and other normative principles was ascendant in the bureaucracy, it was accompanied by a decline in the more rationalistic, efficiency-driven set of values. At what point did this occur? When we consider the period under study, NPM-based values were more influential in 2002 (after the reinventing government movement peaked) and more prominent in federal agencies. Reforms introduced by the Bush administration carried those values forward. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0020852312442659">Figure 4</xref> illustrates, however, the growth trajectories of the reforms show that after 2002, NPM values marginally but continuously decreased as more normative initiatives gained popularity at the federal level. Regardless, NPM reform values are still principal pillars of current public management reform philosophies. Can we expect that these two schools of reform values will be in constant flux, depending on political and socioeconomic contingencies? Or does this trend mean that with new forms of governance taking hold, public administration is returning to its traditional and long-cherished normative principles before embarking on less conventional arrangements?

<p>Between 2002 and 2006, the United States federal bureaucracy was inundated with NPM-inspired executive orders, directives, and congressional actions. In this study, we have tried to determine the prevalence of certain values by means of analyzing the results of three consecutive surveys of employee perceptions about their agencies. Most observers frequently distinguish NPM from post-NPM management reform initiatives according to the extent to which each prioritizes market-type values. As reforms constantly arise from executive or legislative actions, new forms of governance might require that bureaucracy overcome the rigid dichotomy between the value of efficiency and more normative values, to effectively address evolving problems in public administration. As the findings reveal, bureaucracy, in fact, is well able to blend what the literature often portrays as two extremely differing agendas. We focus our conclusions here on two major concerns: the values that we found to be important from the surveys, and what that suggests about the tireless bouts of ‘reforms’ visited upon the federal bureaucracy. The values that we found to be predominant suggest that diversity management in relation to social equity is crucial in the near future. A labor force with many different characteristics will invariably impact organizational performance. Also, organizational justice, and the way this is perceived by employees, might be related to attitudes about work and the activities of employees and should therefore be explored.</p>
<p>From a human capital perspective, the findings from the knowledge management construct imply that basic human resources development initiatives that many authors have emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0020852312442659">Swanson and Holton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0020852312442659">Werner and DeSimone, 2009</xref>) will remain integral to the goal of a humanized, democratized, and equitable bureaucracy. The direct participation of employees in strategic management, and developmental cultures focusing on people, flexibility, and adaptability may contribute to a high level of motivation, and enhance the level of effective and normative commitment of employees.</p>
<p>That agencies value policies of work–life balance behooves us to ask about the stress felt by agencies due to the relentless criticism of bureaucracy that accompanied NPM. Policies of work–life balance might have mitigated some of the pressures from being cast as inept, free-riding bureaucrats compared to their private sector counterparts, policies that help generate positive employee perceptions of their work and the citizens they serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312442659">Ezra and Deckman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312442659">Facer and Wadsworth, 2008</xref>; Saltztstein et al., 2001). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312442659">Frederickson (1996)</xref> noted, to expect civil servants to be loyal to their work, the bureaucracy must also be loyal to them, and safeguard certain values and principles on behalf of the employees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020852312442659">Moynihan (2008b)</xref> echoed this injunction when he noted that governments must link performance measures to intrinsic values. The pre-eminence of work–life balance values at the same level as performance values must be seen as a good thing. These principles should inform future efforts, although classical organizational principles have already indicated that performance rationality should be tempered with incentives that value the human worker.</p>
<p>These results suggest the importance of finding connections between the normative values and the core characteristics of agencies and employees representing those values (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0020852312442659">Rainey et al., 2008</xref>). For example, when taken as an individual attribute, public service motivation (PSM) is usually associated with serving the public good or public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852312442659">Perry and Wise, 1990</xref>). PSM is expected to influence certain values (e.g. rational/extrinsic and normative/intrinsic values), behaviors (e.g. prosocial behaviors and institutionally grounded behaviors), and cultures (e.g. group or developmental culture) in public organizations (Park and Rainey, 2012). It is necessary to determine whether variations in conceptions and patterns of motivation relate to public values at the individual level, as well as to making meaningful differences in organizations.</p>
<p>What of the interplay of reforms and the values embedded in them? We detected evidence for the concurrent existence of various reform values from different decades in the United States, for one. Two, certain reform values were more emphasized by agencies than others, and some were more ascendant than others. The former dips into the discussion of the appropriateness of discussing how mutually exclusive the post-NPM agenda is from NPM. The results indicate a blending of values, implying the kind of ‘layering’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0020852312442659">Thelen (2003)</xref> argued occurred with decades of reform mindedness. Past policy initiatives might give way to new ones, but, as values go, they could not completely be replaced, or they could influence new ones in ways that new reformers might not easily detect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2008</xref>). Bureaucracy can be an adaptive organism; NPM and post-NPM reforms, like their predecessors, are thrown into the mix and the emerging picture would caution us from declaring that NPM is dead.</p>
<p>The results reveal that some values were ascendant at some point in time. Ebb and flow are present. Again, ascendance is not total crowding out. Methodologically speaking, it can be argued that the factor analysis model is formative and heuristic, rather than reflective, because the model was not specified in advance. We acknowledge this limitation. Nonetheless, the results indicate that despite, or with, the ebb and flow, the shoreline might indeed be shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312442659">Kettl, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852312442659">2002)</xref> – bureaucracy changes each and every time a reform is instituted in ways that NPM or post-NPM categorization cannot contain – and the pendulum of more, and then less, normative value of public administration may have to be transcended in order for bureaucracy to be more capable of meeting twenty-first-century challenges. Despite its limits, this study is necessary in conducting further inquires. For instance, which predictors significantly influence any shift in values? And, does a shift correspond to better results, whichever standards (normative or rationalistic) are used? Our study does not address whether changing values reflect changing party control (from Republicans to Democrats), or rather, fundamental value changes separate from partisan control. The existing literature is replete with accounts of what not to do. It is acknowledged that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ reform strategy or policy never works. Non-incremental approaches do not work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852312442659">Mazmanian and Sabatier, 1989</xref>). Careful planning does not work for dramatic reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020852312442659">Maranto, 2002</xref>: 188). Because the work of governments is complex and increasingly complicated as time passes, any reform efforts should also be able to guide public administrators in a way that enables effective action and efficient use of resources. A focus on exclusive, sectoral goals (cost-cutting) needs to be qualified in the eyes of managers, their program evaluators, the politicians, and the public so that everyone recognizes that efficiency can only be met within limits. As some authors have noted (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0020852312442659">Rainey and Steinbauer, 1999</xref>), there may be no crisis in a bureaucracy, but crisis will sometimes be manufactured so that reforms can be launched. In the same vein, bureaucracy may be as efficient as it can be, but problems will arise when we evaluate efficiency in non-logical ways.</p>
<p>From the results of this study, we know that bureaucracy encompasses normative and managerialist values, despite the clashing tenets at the rhetorical level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0020852312442659">Pollitt, 2001</xref>) or about the substance of reform. Weaknesses in individual pieces of reform, the passage of time, politics, and complications of the dilemma of public administration may have led agencies to adopt these conflicting values side-by-side. We are not certain, but data suggest that the best elements of reforms tend to rise to the top, and leave lasting legacies for employees and agencies, even when an empirical approach is not able to test how, in practice, those values have taken hold or are reflected in agency actions. But what does this imply for future initiatives in public administration? Public management reform has been, and will continue to be, a difficult task if differing reform values are conceived as being mutually exclusive. The challenges of reforming public bureaucracies are increasingly complex and wide-ranging, because governments must simultaneously recognize political leadership and management oversights, they must encompass and balance the competing and contradictory values of citizens, and they must fairly evaluate the performance of their agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312442659">Breul, 2007</xref>). The findings herein impel us to examine the norms that arise with network arrangements and other forms of governance structures, for example, the New Public Governance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020852312442659">Osborne, 2006</xref>). Can network governance accommodate these values, or eschew them for something completely new? Having become accustomed to evaluating bureaucratic improvements in terms of efficiency or democratization, would we uphold these same values when assessing reforms that might fundamentally change bureaucracy to structures of hollow networks? Would the multi-sector service, currently comprising traditional civil servants, contractors, grantees and/or partners, find these same values meaningful? We do not know the answers to these questions. As bureaucracy evolves, however, it is worthwhile to remember historical configurations of values, before everything changes again.</p>

The traditional model is depicted as a centralized, merit-based system with top-down management and uniform enforcement of rules, policies and procedures, where the role of HR managers is to be the ‘enforcers of merit’. On the other hand, NPPM principles may include the other three models which mainly focus on such values as decentralization, multi-directional communication and collaboration, and contract-out systems based on a strategy, effectiveness, and the efficiency management model.</p></fn>
