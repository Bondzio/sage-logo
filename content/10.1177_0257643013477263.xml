        <p>In 1944, a group of Indian businessmen issued <italic>A Plan of Economic Development for
            India</italic>. This came to be known as the Bombay Plan. The attitude of Indian
          industrialists to the economic structure of independent India was encapsulated in the
          Plan. The views of the bourgeoisie were, by this stage, closely aligned with those of the
          Indian National Congress. The Plan therefore contained a strong endorsement of state
          economic intervention and planning. The motives of the bourgeoisie in this endeavour are
          the subject of this article.<sup>1</sup> Rejecting claims that the Indian bourgeoisie put
          forward the Plan as a ruse, the author concludes that the bourgeoisie’s self-interest at
          the time demanded state economic intervention—as did the interests of the nation.</p>

      <title>The Congress and Planning</title>
      <p>Since the 1930s, the Indian National Congress had become identified with a centrally
        planned economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0257643013477263">2</xref></sup> In 1938,
        Congress premiers (in May) and Congress industry ministers (in October) had resolved to set
        up a National Planning Committee (NPC) for the future Indian economy. The Congress
        president, Subhas Chandra Bose, set the tone when he told the industry ministers that India
        needed ‘an industrial revolution’. Would it be gradual, on British lines, or a ‘forced
        march’ as in the USSR? ‘I am afraid that it has to be a forced march in this country’, he
            said.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0257643013477263">3</xref></sup> The industry
        ministers declared that ‘the problems of poverty and unemployment, of national defence and
        of the economic regeneration in general cannot be solved without industrialisation’. For
        this, a national plan was needed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0257643013477263">4</xref></sup> The NPC started meeting in December under Jawaharlal Nehru. Its
        membership included Purshotamdas Thakurdas, A.D. Shroff and Walchand Hirachand from the
        business community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0257643013477263">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Nehru’s guiding ideas were evident throughout the early activities of the NPC. In various
        memoranda and notes to committee members, he set out the principles that underlay his (and
        in general, the Congress’) economic thinking at this time. The first was the need for
        national independence (‘an indispensable preliminary for taking all steps that might be
        found necessary for carrying out the plan’) and national self-sufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0257643013477263">6</xref></sup> Citing the resolutions of the
        1931 Karachi Congress on state ownership and control, Nehru told the NPC, ‘A legitimate
        extension of this principle would be to apply it to all large-scale enterprises … even if
        the State does not own such enterprises, it must regulate and control them in the public
            interest’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0257643013477263">7</xref></sup> He directly
        related the necessities of war-time state regulation to the virtues of post-war
        planning.</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>War has compelled planning, though this planning is for the specific purpose of
          destruction. When the war ends, this planned economy and State control cannot be given up
          and there appears to be no possibility [of] a reversion to pre-war capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0257643013477263">8</xref></sup></p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Thus the NPC’s general objective was ‘a socialistic planned structure’. Nehru added:
        ‘Private enterprise has certainly not been ruled out but it has to be strictly controlled
        and co-ordinated to the general plan’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0257643013477263">9</xref></sup> It followed that the defence industries were first in line for state
            ownership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0257643013477263">10</xref></sup> Beyond
        defence, ‘key industries’ and public utilities were considered. Nehru reported: <disp-quote>
          <p>Regarding Key industries, the majority were of the opinion that they should also be
            State-owned, though a substantial minority considered that State control would be
            sufficient. It was made clear, however, that any control of such industries must be a
            rigid one. Public Utilities, it was also decided, should be owned by some organisation
            of the State.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0257643013477263">11</xref></sup></p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Sub-committees on the key industries elaborated on the theme. The sub-committee on
        engineering industries said that they were essential for both development and
        defence—‘[s]uch a key industry is the foundation for all Planning’. All such industries
        should be state-owned or controlled. In terms of new industries, such was the enthusiasm on
        the sub-committee for central control that it advocated ‘the concentration of … this heavy
        mechanical industry in one National Workshop situated in the coal mining area of
            Bihar–Bengal’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0257643013477263">12</xref></sup>
        Meanwhile the sub-committee on manufacturing industries resolved that ‘all monopolies which
        are injurious to public interests, or whose acquisition is beneficial to public interests,
        should be acquired by the State’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0257643013477263">13</xref></sup> The sub-committees on chemical industries, power and fuel, and currency
        and banking all wanted state ownership or control of the industries in their
            areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0257643013477263">14</xref></sup> In addition,
        currency and banking wanted the state to ‘prevent profiteering and control price levels’,
        while general education proposed one year’s compulsory labour service for all those between
        the ages of 18 and 22.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0257643013477263">15</xref></sup>
        As Nehru wrote a little later, ‘The more we thought of this planning business, the vaster it
        grew in its sweep and range, till it seemed to embrace almost every activity’. The process,
        he said, ‘was inevitably leading us towards establishing some of the fundamentals of the
        socialist structure’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0257643013477263">16</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Congress was not alone in its promotion of state economic intervention. On the other
        side of what was now the communal divide in Indian politics, the Muslim League was promoting
        similar ideas. In March 1943, Muhammad Ali Jinnah had fulminated against ‘landlords and
        capitalists’ who presided over a ‘vicious and wicked system’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0257643013477263">17</xref></sup> At the League’s Karachi session in December,
        Jinnah was authorized to appoint a committee to prepare a five-year plan for development and
        industrialization in the Pakistan zones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0257643013477263">18</xref></sup> Thus was born the All-India Muslim League Economic Planning Committee.
        Its chairman, Ali Nawaz Jung told the first meeting that the need for ‘some form of State
        interference’ was ‘increasingly evident’, especially in defence, key industries, services
        and mineral resources. The Committee’s Draft Plan (submitted to Jinnah) contained much on
        the alleviation of poverty, a list of industries for nationalization and the call for land
            reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0257643013477263">19</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The activities of both the Congress and the League in this regard should be seen as part of
        the process of a new state (now perhaps two states) solidifying within the shell of the old.
        The process was much more advanced in the Congress case simply because its leaders had been
        at it longer—and in India, even an India minus ‘Pakistan’, they had the prospect of a viable
        industrial economic unit that could be centrally controlled and planned.</p>
      <p>But the NPC’s activities were halted by the outbreak of the war. Nehru argued in late
        September 1939 that ‘[t]here is no question of our stopping our work because of this war.
        Indeed our work has to be carried on with greater vigour’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0257643013477263">20</xref></sup> But the resignation of the Congress
        ministries ‘added to our difficulties’, while ‘[b]usinessmen were busier than ever making
        money out of war requirements and were not much interested in planning’. Furthermore, ‘the
        government was not interested in our work and in fact viewed it with great
            disfavour’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0257643013477263">21</xref></sup> The NPC
        meetings of September 1940 would be its last. Nehru himself was arrested in late 1940 and
        the Government of the United Provinces informed the Committee that ‘Government are unable to
        agree to his [Nehru] carrying on the work of the National Planning Committee while he is in
            jail’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0257643013477263">22</xref></sup></p>

      <title>The Capitalist Attitude</title>
      <p>Not surprisingly, India’s industrialists were occasionally disturbed by the more extreme
        statements on state ownership and socialism expressed by Nehru, the NPC and the Congress
        generally. However, in the inter-war period, the economic interests of the Indian
        bourgeoisie had found themselves repeatedly blocked by a political obstacle in the shape of
        the British state. If economic interests were to be pursued from this point, the political
        obstacle had to be removed. A political strategy was therefore economically necessary. This
        began with attempts to pressure the existing state for reforms but developed into the demand
        for a new, Indian national state. In this way, the hard-headed pursuit of profit led to
        nationalist politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0257643013477263">23</xref></sup>
        That being the case, by the end of the inter-war period, the leading elements of the Indian
        bourgeoisie had evolved a series of economic demands that, in their view, were essential for
        India’s economic progress—but which could not be satisfied within India’s existing economic
        structure and political system.</p>
      <sec id="section3-0257643013477263">
        <title>A National State</title>
        <p>For a state to promote development it has to have its own concept of the national
          interest—and that has to have some degree of acceptance by the people at large, including
          the bourgeoisie (unless their expropriation is part of the state programme). The
          Government of India had no such concept—it remained subordinate to the interests of the
          British Government. As Homi Mody told the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
          Industry (FICCI) in 1930, ‘our great grievance is that our government’s outlook on
          economic matters is anything but national with the result that today the industrial and
          commercial community of India are among the strongest critics of the present
              government’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0257643013477263">24</xref></sup> The
          point was made repeatedly by capitalist representatives that, had India a national
          government (rather than a British one), it would do more and better in protecting and
          developing the Indian economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0257643013477263">25</xref></sup></p>
        <p>For economic planning to be effective, there had to be a state that could and would plan,
          on the basis of such a national interest. In his speech endorsing planning in 1934, FICCI
          President Nalini Ranjan Sarkar noted, ‘I fully realise that, in the absence of political
          power, it would be difficult to induce the Government to accept our proposals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0257643013477263">26</xref></sup></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section4-0257643013477263">
        <title>Domestic Economic Policy</title>
        <p>British attempts to deal with the economic problems of the inter-war years were seen as
          self-serving by the Indian bourgeoisie, making the Indian situation worse. That meant that
          those attempts were damaging an economy that the bourgeoisie hoped to inherit. Despite
          negotiations, conferences, commissions and Government of India declarations to the
          contrary, Indian business was not able to exercise control over the domestic economy.
          Without political power, government economic policy could not be held to account.
          Hirachand, speaking on the drop in India’s balance of trade, told FICCI in 1933: <disp-quote>
            <p>[I]n India, unfortunately, the administration not being in national hands, there have
              been no re-adjustments in either the currency or the tariff policy of the Government
              of India whose currency policy has always been subordinated to the interests of Great
                  Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0257643013477263">27</xref></sup></p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Even when, in the negotiations for a replacement for the Ottawa Trade Agreement (against
          which the industrialists had campaigned furiously), the Government of India appointed the
          leading lights of FICCI as ‘unofficial advisers’, it eventually rejected their advice. The
          new agreement was rejected by the Legislative Assembly but put into force by the British
              Government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0257643013477263">28</xref></sup></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section5-0257643013477263">
        <title>International Economic Policy</title>
        <p>In the view of the Indian bourgeoisie, external economic policy was formulated by
          non-representatives of the nation and placed dangerous restrictions on Indian trade in
          order to skew it in the interests of the British Empire. Hirachand told FICCI in 1933 that
          ‘the nation’s rightful representatives’ should attend the next world economic conference
          and ‘express candidly the nation’s point of view before it’. He said, ‘India will have to
          strike out [on] an altogether different path of her own’, even if this meant ‘an honest
          clash of interests between the western nations and herself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0257643013477263">29</xref></sup> The next FICCI president, Kasturbhai
          Lalbhai, objecting to the Government of India’s view that India should concentrate
          economically on the Empire, declared that ‘India, as a substantial producer of raw
          materials [could] not in the long run afford to depend upon one single market—however
          stable—at the risk of losing her place in the other important foreign markets of the
              world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0257643013477263">30</xref></sup></p>
        <p>FICCI therefore campaigned, eventually successfully, for the termination of the Ottawa
          agreement. The Legislative Assembly passed a Congress motion to this effect in March 1936.
          The termination of the agreement, however, did not result in proponents of India’s
          economic interests representing India at future international gatherings, nor did it allow
          India to pursue an international trade policy of her own devising.</p>

      <sec id="section6-0257643013477263">
        <title>State Intervention</title>
        <p>The pivotal issue in carrying out development, initiating planning and instituting
          economic policies in India’s national interest was the question of state intervention. The
          bourgeoisie was well aware of this, despite its devotion to the rights of private
          property. By the end of this period, rather than a begrudging acceptance of a limited role
          for the state in the economy, there was instead a demand from the bourgeoisie for
          full-scale state intervention in heavy and strategic industries, in planning and in
              policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0257643013477263">31</xref></sup> The Indian
          bourgeoisie had before it the example of a number of state-driven war economies (the
          Soviet Union, Italy, Japan, Germany) that appeared to leave previous attempts at
          industrial development in the shade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0257643013477263">32</xref></sup> In a period in which the state in all industrialized nations moved to
          protect its national economy, the Indian bourgeoisie looked for state intervention—and
          found that it had no state. The British state (both in London and New Delhi) was intent on
          protecting the British Empire, industrially and strategically. It would not serve Indian
          purposes.</p>
        <p>In sum, the imposition of British policy preferences economically, politically and
          militarily was too much for the Indian bourgeoisie to accept by the late 1930s. It was
          true that, from the bourgeoisie’s point of view, the British state provided a commercial
          and legal infrastructure, law and order, some tariff protection and some government
              contracts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0257643013477263">33</xref></sup> But
          this was no longer enough. More than that, it was an obstacle to providing those things
          necessary to raise the level of the productive forces in India. Frederick Engels wrote in
            <italic>Anti-Duhring</italic> that: <disp-quote>
            <p>where … the internal state power of a country becomes antagonistic to its economic
              development, as at a certain stage occurred with almost every political power in the
              past, the contest always ended with the downfall of the political power. Inexorably
              and without exception the economic development forces its way through.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0257643013477263">34</xref></sup></p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>For this, however, an alternative political power and a political struggle were necessary
          to burst the fetters holding back the forces of development.</p>
        <p>The industrialists had no substantial objection to the nationalization of defence and
          some key industries. This was, in their view, in the national interest. It reflected their
          basic agreement with the view that in India state intervention was required for
          industrialization and for building a viable national economy.</p>
        <p>As noted above, business was in favour of state economic planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0257643013477263">35</xref></sup> In his 1943 pamphlet,
            <italic>Principles of Planning</italic>, Ghanshyamdas Birla cited the experience of
          planning in the Soviet Union and Germany as well as in mobilization for total war. Even
          under capitalism, the power of the state was expanding into new areas. Economic controls
          would continue after the war. Furthermore, ‘[u]nder the new planned economy the role of
          the capitalist entrepreneur will be different from what it was in the past’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0257643013477263">36</xref></sup> But, he asked, could there
          be planning without socialism—‘For let there be no mistake about it; socialism is
          totalitarian … It is bound to be dictatorial’. Birla advocated a ‘middle way’. State
          ownership of defence industries, basic industries and some monopolies had to be tempered
          by democracy over the state. Meanwhile, ‘private enterprise will function under definite
          limits subject to overall co-ordination by the planning authority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0257643013477263">37</xref></sup> Other business leaders were
          advancing similar ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0257643013477263">38</xref></sup> FICCI was represented on the Government’s Reconstruction Committee and
          its sub-committees. Ardeshir Shroff told the Reconstruction Committee that ‘the business
          community was convinced that during the post-war period, it would be necessary for
          Government to exercise far-reaching control in all fields of business activity—and that
          business would cooperate in the interests of economic development’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0257643013477263">39</xref></sup></p>
        <p>When the Congress set up the NPC, M.A. Master wrote to Hirachand that ‘it is necessary
          for us to establish our contact with this committee’. He suggested that Hirachand should
          become a member, which he duly did, along with Shroff and Thakurdas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0257643013477263">40</xref></sup> Naturally, the business
          representatives were not comfortable with the demands for total nationalization made by
          some of their fellow committee members. Nehru wrote that ‘Big business was definitely
          apprehensive and critical, and probably joined up because it felt that it could look after
          its interests better from inside the committee than from outside’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0257643013477263">41</xref></sup> But the business representatives stuck
          with it—in fact, their ideas may have changed as a result. Nehru again said: <disp-quote>
            <p>The big business element was the biggest single group, and its outlook on many
              matters, especially financial and commercial, was definitely conservative … Yet the
              urge for rapid progress … [was] so great that all of us were forced out of our grooves

      <title>The Bombay Plan</title>
      <p>When the NPC ceased to function, it was the most prominent industrialists who took the
        initiative in advancing the case for a planned economy. J.R.D. Tata proposed a meeting of
        major industrialists to create an ‘informal Post-War Economic Development Committee’. The
        meeting took place in the Tata Board Room on 11 December 1942. Present were Thakurdas, Shri
        Ram, Birla, Kasturbhai Lalbhai, Shroff, John Mathai and Tata himself. Thakurdas was elected
            chairman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0257643013477263">43</xref></sup> This
        committee eventually produced <italic>A Plan of Economic Development for India</italic>— the
        Bombay Plan—the first part of which was published in January 1944, and the second a year
        later. The Plan envisaged extensive state intervention. Baldev Raj Nayar comments: <disp-quote>
          <p>[T]here was something inherently contradictory in a group of businessmen devoted to the
            pursuit of private profit proposing a program of economic development on the pattern of
            the Bombay Plan, with its firm invitation to the government for the state regulation of
            the business community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0257643013477263">44</xref></sup></p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>The Plan was received with some enthusiasm in business circles and by the political elite.
        FICCI welcomed it as ‘a remarkably constructive contribution’ and endorsed its essential
            principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0257643013477263">45</xref></sup> The
        second part of the Plan was given varying degrees of editorial approval by <italic>The
          Hindustan Times</italic> (17 January 1945), <italic>The Bombay Chronicle</italic> (18
        January 1945), <italic>Amrita Bazar Patrika</italic> (19 January 1945) and <italic>The
          Hindu</italic> (21 January 1945).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0257643013477263">46</xref></sup> Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya (former Diwan of the princely state of
        Mysore and a prominent member of the All India Manufacturers’ Organization) declared himself
        ‘in general agreement’ with it, while C.D. Deshmukh (Reserve Bank governor and future
        Finance Minister) said: ‘I welcome the second part of the Bombay Plan as an expression of
        the readiness of acknowledged leaders of industry and commerce to submit to much wider
        restraints on business in the interests of planning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0257643013477263">47</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Plan gave rise to a series of alternative plans: from the Indian Federation of Labour
        (under the influence of M.N. Roy), the All-India Manufacturers’ Organization and from
        Visvesvaraya himself. Industries left out of the Plan wanted to be included. M.A. Master and
        G.L. Mehta met with Tata in June 1944 ‘in regard to the omission of shipping from the
        15-year Plan of the industrialists’. Tata admitted the oversight.</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>Mr Master stated that the question of a mercantile marine for a country like India was of
          vital importance in any scheme of national planning, not merely from the economic point of
          view but also from the point of view of national defence … a proper freight policy could
          be evolved so as to encourage industries and develop export markets only if shipping was
          under national control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0257643013477263">48</xref></sup></p>

      <p>The British meanwhile, whose hostility to the capitalists had steadily increased during the
            war,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0257643013477263">49</xref></sup> regarded the
        Plan as a conspiracy on their part to make money. The Intelligence Bureau told the
        Government of India that the Plan was ‘to the moderate benefit of India’s millions and to
        the immense profit of Indian “Big Business”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0257643013477263">50</xref></sup> The bellicose former Finance Member of the
        Government of India, now British Secretary of State for War, Sir Percy Grigg, told the War
        Cabinet: <disp-quote>
          <p>This is a wild and chimerical scheme for spending thousands of non-existent crores
            [tens of millions of Rupees] in no time on lines very similar to the Soviet 5-year
            plans, except that in India the industrialists and they alone are to be exempted from
            totalitarian control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0257643013477263">51</xref></sup></p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Such a view was entirely mistaken. If the Plan was ‘totalitarian’ (which it was not), then
        the capitalists had declared their willingness to be placed under its ‘totalitarian’
        controls. In fact, the Bombay Planners’ extensive concessions to state intervention and a
        state-run economy simply demonstrated their alliance with (not their domination of) the
        future Congress state.</p>
      <p>Sections of the Indian left voiced their disapproval of the Plan as well. The Communist
        Party of India criticized it for not taking up the question of income distribution before
        denouncing it as simply a plan for building capitalism (which indeed it was).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0257643013477263">52</xref></sup> The Radical Democratic Party
        (Royists), declared that the Plan (which they called ‘the capitalist plan’ or ‘the Big
        Business Plan’) ‘frankly postulates a dictatorship of big business’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0257643013477263">53</xref></sup> India’s Trotskyists considered that the
        bourgeoisie had been ‘frightened out of their wits by the revolutionary energy of the masses
        in 1942’ and were now trying ‘to by-pass political power through an economic
            weapon.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0257643013477263">54</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Such arguments have by no means gone out of fashion. Vivek Chibber levels similar
        criticisms against the Plan and the bourgeoisie in his account of Indian economic
        development, <italic>Locked in Place</italic>. First, he says, the Bombay Plan was a
        ‘manoeuvre’ by the capitalists, panicked into action by the Quit India movement and designed
        to forestall socialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0257643013477263">55</xref></sup>
        Second, the bourgeoisie were in fact against state control and only prepared to accept
        ‘capitalist planning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0257643013477263">56</xref></sup>
        Third, the bourgeoisie retreated even from this position at top speed after 1947.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0257643013477263">57</xref></sup> Finally, this position of the
        bourgeoisie inhibited the construction of a ‘developmental state’ (à la South Korea) in
        India after 1947.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0257643013477263">58</xref></sup> Before
        turning to my own views on the Bombay Planners’ motives, let me take up each of these points
        in turn.</p>
      <p>If the Bombay Plan was a mere ruse, it was certainly a most elaborate one—a charade played
        out as much between its authors as for the benefit of the mass movement. There is no hint of
        this in the notes, letters, memoranda and drafts preceding the Plan available in Indian
        archives. The Plan was not a reaction to the Quit India movement. The mass phase of that
        movement had been repressed ‘within a period of six or seven weeks’ of its commencement in
        August 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0257643013477263">59</xref></sup> The first
        meeting of the Planners’ committee was held at the end of the year (and there is no mention
        of Quit India in its proceedings). The first part of the Plan was published in January 1944.
        In fact, the bourgeoisie was not unduly alarmed by the mass movement. They were concerned
        about the advance of ‘socialism’—though what this could possibly have meant in Indian
        conditions remains unclear. At any rate, Chibber himself tells us that ‘[b]y 1945 the Old
        Guard [i.e., the Congress Right] was firmly and visibly in control of the party machinery
        again’—so why at this point the industrialists should be pretending to be state capitalists
        is a mystery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0257643013477263">60</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Indian bourgeoisie had evolved steadily <italic>in favour</italic> of state
        intervention, planning and state control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0257643013477263">61</xref></sup> One hundred years of Indian business
        history—of calls for state intervention, acceptance of a war economy, of agreement with
        Congress economic policy—all stand against Chibber on this point. He argues that the
        bourgeoisie, while furiously resisting ‘socialist planning’, was prepared to accept
        ‘capitalist planning’. It is hard to understand what is being discussed here. In Indian
        conditions, socialism was an impossibility. Capitalist (and state) planning was all that was
        on offer. Chibber says that the Bombay Plan was not ‘a clarion call by a nationalistic
        bourgeoisie to its peers, exhorting them to join in the forward march of national progress’.
        On the contrary, he continues, it was ‘a document … opening the way for
          <italic>capitalist</italic> planning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0257643013477263">62</xref></sup> In India, in the late 1940s, these two things were one and the
        same.</p>
      <p>Chibber produces very little evidence for the bourgeoisie’s ‘complete
          <italic>volte-face</italic> [against ‘a disciplinary planning regime’] within a two-year
        period, between 1945 and 1947’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0257643013477263">63</xref></sup> Even then he admits, ‘[i]t is not clear if their [the Bombay Planners’]
        views regarding the necessity of some degree of control had veered to a contrary
            position’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0257643013477263">64</xref></sup> And in
        the end, ‘the future direction of industrial development was still to be guided by the
            state’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0257643013477263">65</xref></sup> No doubt
        some sections of business reacted adversely when they realized the extent of the Congress
        state’s economic control. But the relationship of the bourgeoisie to the new state would
        evolve slowly over the next four or five decades. It did not snap smoothly into a ‘state
        versus capital’ confrontation in 1947.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0257643013477263">66</xref></sup></p>

      <title>What Lay behind the Plan?</title>
      <p>Why <italic>did</italic> they do it? Clearly, Indian capitalists wanted some input into
        independent India’s economic policy. Tata said that the Plan ‘started with a feeling that
        Indian businessmen must prepare themselves for what was to happen after the war …
        Businessmen and not only the Government should play a role’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0257643013477263">67</xref></sup> A further consideration was certainly a fear
        of state socialism which seemed to be advancing on all fronts after the war. In a memorandum
        for the first Post-War Economic Development Committee meeting, Mathai, noting developments
        in Eastern Europe and China, wrote: <disp-quote>
          <p>The inevitability of a change in the direction of a socialist economy even in a country
            like India must now be recognised and leaders of industry would be well advised to take
            this into account and be prepared to make such adjustments as may meet all reasonable
            demands before the socialist movement assumes the form of a full-fledged
                revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0257643013477263">68</xref></sup></p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>The approach was to accommodate rather than confront socialist demands. The committee did
        not want to be seen as vindicating capitalism. Indeed, ‘[t]he enquiry should begin with a
        study of the defects of capitalism, particularly in respect of planning and distribution’.
        Then it should look into ‘what modifications are necessary to enable [capitalism] to render
        the best possible service to the country’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0257643013477263">69</xref></sup> The Plan itself argued that ‘the distinction
        … between capitalism and socialism is somewhat overdone’ and called for a ‘judicious
        combination’ of both. While continuing to defend private enterprise, it said it had to be
        ‘enterprise which is truly enterprising and not a mere cloak for sluggish
            acquisitiveness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0257643013477263">70</xref></sup>
        The Plan, Birla told FICCI after the release of the first part, sought ‘to mobilise and
        harness the good will of all sections of the society, be he the leftist or the rightist, of
        all progressive minded citizens’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0257643013477263">71</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Plan was characterized by the essential features of what had become the bourgeois

            <p>Economic uplift and the reduction of inequality. The Plan recognized that the

              private ownership had ‘failed to bring about a satisfactory distribution of the
              national income’. It pledged to double per capita income within fifteen years while

              capital goods’. Basic industries were to be given ‘priority over the other type of
              industries in the earlier years’. Otherwise, ‘we shall naturally be at the mercy of
              foreign countries’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0257643013477263">74</xref></sup></p>

              The Bombay planners acknowledged that ‘the State should exercise in the interests of
              the community a considerable measure of intervention and control’. These controls
              would be similar to those of the war economy, ‘to which the country has become more or

              There should be state ownership of defence industries and of new industries important
              to public welfare or security. Key industries should be state controlled, and here the
              Plan warned: ‘[t]he rights attaching to private property would naturally be greatly

              also be extended into the zamindari areas. The aim was ‘the establishment of a class
              of peasant proprietors’. To help in this process, there should be ‘a large extension
              of model farms’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0257643013477263">78</xref></sup></p>

      <title>The Interests of the Bourgeoisie</title>
      <p>Some comments about the class nature and class interests of the bourgeoisie are appropriate
        here. The political leaders of the Indian bourgeoisie became aware of the need for a mass
        political organization to fight against the existing state, as well as a new political elite
        to replace it. For this reason the political leadership of the bourgeoisie turned towards
        the Congress. It is necessary to make two qualifications at this point. First, the
        bourgeoisie’s relationship with nationalist politics (a relationship between capital and a
        future state) was a coincidence of interests. The bourgeoisie did not endorse nationalist
        politics <italic>because</italic> they represented the nation’s good (except in individual
        cases) but because they furthered their own. Second, this did not, of course, place Indian
        business in the militant vanguard of the Civil Disobedience Movement. The moderation of the
        bourgeoisie’s anti-colonialism has often been pointed out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0257643013477263">79</xref></sup> They worked for ‘a non-revolutionary pattern
        of anti-imperialist struggle … [a] stage by stage (or step by step) advance towards a
        bourgeois nation state and independent economic development’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0257643013477263">80</xref></sup> This was hardly surprising given the
        bourgeoisie’s objective class interests (what Bipan Chandra calls ‘the capitalist character
        of the Indian capitalist class’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0257643013477263">81</xref></sup> Those interests and the evolving nature of their position can account
        for the timidity of their initial approach, for the differences in approach between them and
        their preference for moderate tactics. But these factors and their unwillingness to adopt a
        more radical road for India (‘socialism’, for example) should not blind us to the
        bourgeoisie’s support for the Indian national movement. Economic interest ensured that
        support. Questions of law and order did not at any stage permanently deter it.</p>
      <p>As the leaders of the bourgeoisie were compelled to enter the world of nationalist
        politics, they were also compelled to express their class interests as the interests of the
            nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0257643013477263">82</xref></sup> Karl Marx
        and Frederick Engels drew attention to this phenomenon in a different historical context: <disp-quote>
          <p>For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is
            compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interests as the
            common interest of all the members of society … it has to give its ideas the form of
            universality and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0257643013477263">83</xref></sup></p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>For Marx and Engels, there is clearly an element of deception or even trickery here. The
        bourgeoisie (for that is whom they are discussing) is ‘compelled’ to ‘represent’, to ‘give
        its ideas the form’ of general aspirations. For this, the bourgeoisie has been, from then
        until now, lambasted by Marxists (and others) for entrancing their followers with false
        consciousness. There is, however, a period in historical development—the era in which the
        bourgeois revolution allows and pursues progress in society—when the interests of the
        progressive bourgeoisie really do coincide with the interests of society as a whole.
        Countering their own implied accusations in <italic>The German Ideology</italic>, Marx and
        Engels also point out that the bourgeoisie can portray its aims as universal precisely
        because ‘its interest really is more connected with the common interest of all other
        non-ruling classes, because under the pressure of hitherto existing conditions its interest
        has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular
            class’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0257643013477263">84</xref></sup> At the stage
        of the development of India’s productive forces with which we are concerned, the interests
        of the Indian bourgeoisie<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0257643013477263">85</xref></sup> actually did represent those of Indian society at large.</p>
      <p>The Indian struggle for independence was the beginning of the bourgeois revolution in
        India. It brought into being a new, independent state power, dominated by the Congress, with
        worked-out ideas on a new economic structure for India in which the state would figure
        strongly. It was aided in this venture by a politically conscious bourgeoisie prepared to
        accept a state-dominated economic structure. It established national independence; the
        authority of a central state over (most of) India; a national market; and the conditions for
        reorganizing the economy—most importantly, conditions in which Indian industry and Indian
        business could flourish.</p>
      <p>It differed from the ‘classical’ bourgeois revolutions in that, while it enjoyed the
        support of a mass movement for 40 years or so, it was achieved by an alliance between the
        leadership of a new state and that of the bourgeoisie. Economically and numerically, the
        Indian bourgeoisie recognized its own weakness. A political leadership, capable of
        mobilizing masses, and a new state, capable of organizing the economy, were vital to its
        future. It found both these things in the Congress and therefore, subordinated itself to the
        future Congress state.</p>
      <p>Given events in the rest of the world, the state-directed path to development seemed
        overwhelmingly plausible, despite the whimpers of private enterprise. Post-independence
        euphoria, the towering popularity of the Congress and the widespread enthusiasm for planning
        and for the idea that the state should triumph over private interests were hard to beat.
        Many of these sentiments existed within the Indian bourgeoisie itself. The capitalists found
        themselves both dominated by, and profoundly entangled with, the new Congress state. The
        Indian state produced capitalism of a sort. But it was a capitalism largely subject to the
        state’s political will, not one devoted solely to the pursuit of profit.</p>
      <p>The Bombay Plan was, most decidedly, a capitalist plot—but not in the sense denounced by
        the British, the Indian left or modern analysts like Vivek Chibber. It was not a trick—a
        piece of statist camouflage designed to hoodwink the masses and the Congress leadership.
        Such a view completely misunderstands the relationship between the Congress and the
            capitalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0257643013477263">86</xref></sup> To
        raise the level of India’s productive forces it was necessary to initiate the bourgeois
        revolution. In India’s case this meant breaking the power of the British state and replacing
        it with an Indian state which could take the necessary economic measures to move forward.
        The Indian capitalist class had realized that their interests, along with those of the
        nation, were for the moment bound up with that state. The Bombay Plan represented an
        acceptance of that fact.</p>

          <p>This article is framed by the twin concepts of historical materialism and the bourgeois
            revolution. In it, the terms capitalist, industrialist and bourgeois are used
            interchangeably. They are used to describe a particular class—that is, a group of people
            who share a common relationship to labour and to the means of production. They are used
            in the Marxist sense: ‘By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern Capitalists, owners
            of the means of social production and employees of wage labour’ (Note by Frederick
            Engels to the 1888 English edition of the <italic>Manifesto of the Communist
              Party</italic> by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1966),
            39. According to Marx and Engels, such a class develops together with the elements of
            industrial society. As ‘industry, commerce, navigation, railways’ developed, ‘in the
            same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the
            background every class handed down from the Middle Ages’ (Marx and Engels,
              <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>, 42). In India during the period covered by this
            article, this was still an ongoing process. Indian capitalists did not dominate the
            economy. They were a class coming into being (from the late nineteenth century onwards)
            and into consciousness (in terms of their common position and interests). British
            domination had become ‘no longer compatible with the already developed productive
            forces; they became so many fetters’ (Marx and Engels, <italic>Communist
              Manifesto</italic>, 47). The task of ‘bursting those fetters asunder’ was coming to
            fruition.</p>

          <p>Nehru, <italic>First 60 years I</italic>, 693. Vivek Chibber suggests that bourgeois
            opposition to state control and intervention on the NPC was much more trenchant and this
            ‘played an important part in the demise of that body’, with the bourgeoisie withdrawing
            funds (Vivek Chibber, <italic>Locked in Place: State-Building and Late Industrialization
              in India</italic> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006), 87, 90). In fact,
            their opposition to state control was not strong enough to make them leave the committee
            and their objections to general nationalization were hardly surprising. However, those
            objections were by no means absolute. The NPC sub-committee on Manufacturing Industries
            recommended total state ownership or control (see above)—despite the fact that it was
            chaired by Ambilal Sarabhai, a leading industrialist (Chibber, <italic>Locked in
              Place</italic>, note 13, p. 276). The NPC stopped functioning at the outbreak of the
            war partly as a result of Nehru’s arrest and partly as a result of the resignation of
            the Congress ministries, which had provided funds and facilities—not because of
            capitalist intransigence. The business community was eager to send along representatives
            when NPC meetings restarted in September 1945.</p>

          <p>Tata enquired whether Master’s company, Scindia, would monopolize the shipping industry

          <p>In part, this was because the British believed that ‘Big Business’ now controlled the
            Congress; see Sir Henry Twynan’s notes for the Viceroy, 26 July 1943 in Nicholas
            Mansergh and Penderel Moon (eds), <italic>The Transfer of Power, 1942–7. Volume 4: The
              Bengal Famine and the New Viceroyalty, 15 June 1943–31 August 1944</italic> (London:
            HMSO, 1973), 118, 122; Amery to the Viceroy Lord Wavell, 7 December 1944 in Mansergh and
            Moon, <italic>Transfer of Power</italic> Volume 4, 291. It was also because they feared
            that Indian business was pro-Japanese. The Viceroy sent a ‘Most Secret and Personal’
            letter to the Provincial Governors in November 1942 along these lines; see British
            Library (henceforward BL): India Office Record (henceforward IOR), L/PJ/8/618A. He
            argued that, since business feared the destruction of their property in a Japanese
            invasion, they wanted a government that would either be friendly to Japan or would be
            willing to make terms with them. A ‘clique of financiers’ was using Congress to this
            end, so that business could ‘establish for themselves a position of financial domination
            in India comparable to that obtained by the “Big Four” in Japan.’ If that were the case,
            ‘it may well be … that “Big Business” is the fons et origo of the recent disturbances
            and the real link between the Congress and Japan.’</p>

          <p>Chibber’s final point concerns his over-arching thesis on developmental states and
            their relationship to the bourgeoisie in South Korea and India. Space prevents me from
            dealing with it adequately here; for a treatment of the issues in a different context
            see David Lockwood, <italic>The Destruction of the Soviet Union: a Study in
              Globalization</italic> (Macmillan: Houndmills, 2000). Chibber argues that the Indian
            bourgeoisie ‘blocked the building of a successful developmental state’ by resisting it
            and thereby ensuring that India remained committed to ‘Import-Substituting
            Industrialization’ rather than ‘Export-Led Industrialization’ (Chibber, <italic>Locked
              in Place</italic>, 29, 85). The commitment to the latter, he says, was the reason for
            South Korea’s success. However, following the Korean War, the South Korean military
            state did not set boldly out on the road to exports. The state, strong because the war
            had crippled other domestic actors and because the threat from the north remained, set
            out instead on the path of militarized autarchy. It was only later, due to the changes
            in the global economy (from the 1960s) that the state changed course, adopted export-led
            industrialization and forced South Korean capitalists to follow it. See Lockwood,
              <italic>Destruction of the Soviet Union</italic>, 164–8; Alice H. Amsden,
              <italic>Asia’s Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization</italic> (New York:
            Oxford University Press, 1989), 72. It was the state that engineered the change in
            strategy, not the South Korean bourgeoisie. In India, it was the state that clung to
            import-substituting industrialization–not because of, but despite, the Indian
            bourgeoisie.</p>

          <p>Although the issue of ‘INDUSTRY: (i) State ownership and/or control’ was first on the
            ‘List of Subjects for the Committee’s first meeting’, it did not appear in the first
            part of the Plan and was obviously the subject of intense discussion before being
            covered in the second part. See ‘Papers for first Post-War Economic Development
            Committee’ 8 December 1943; ‘Final Draft of the Economic Committee’s report’, c. 30
            December 1943; and the report by Tata’s Statistics Department (21 July 1943), which
            concluded that ‘on the whole a cautious attitude is desirable’ (NMML: PT Papers File
            Number 291 Part 1).</p>

            working together in a partnership of convenience with no illusions on either side’,
