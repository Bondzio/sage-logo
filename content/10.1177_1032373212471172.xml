<p>There are three primary objectives for this article. The first is to describe the administrative and accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire during the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE. A survey of the specialized accounting history journals reveals that there have been no previous studies focusing on the Byzantine Empire, even though this empire was the dominant political, economic and military power in the European world in the early Middle Ages. The second objective is to contribute to the body of accounting history research which seeks to demonstrate that ancient civilizations possessed well developed accounting practices. It is argued that the accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire during the fourth through sixth centuries were sufficiently well developed to serve the administrative needs of a vast empire extending over a territory throughout the Mediterranean world and most of southern Europe. The third objective is to examine whether the concept of “governmentality”, which has been extensively used in accounting history research in recent years, might be applied to research focusing on ancient civilizations such as the Byzantine Empire.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A survey of the specialized accounting history journals (i.e. <italic>Accounting History</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1032373212471172">1</xref></sup> <italic>Accounting Historians Journal</italic> and <italic>Accounting History Review</italic>) reveals that there have been no previous studies focusing on the Byzantine Empire, even though this empire was the dominant economic, political and military power in the European world for several hundred years, beginning in the fourth century CE. As a result, there is a significant need for accounting historians to study the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, the first objective of this article is to begin this effort by developing a description of the administrative and accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire during the fourth through sixth centuries CE.</p>
<p>The second objective of this article is to contribute to the body of accounting history research which argues that ancient civilizations possessed well developed accounting practices. In the last forty years there has been an on-going debate among accounting historians on whether ancient civilizations possessed well developed accounting practices, by which they generally mean “double-entry bookkeeping”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1032373212471172">2</xref></sup> For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1032373212471172">ten Have (1976)</xref> asserts: “Common sense and knowledge of bookkeeping are sufficient to show that the Romans did not have <italic>a system of accounts</italic> and that nothing was in existence that constituted a beginning of double-entry bookkeeping” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1032373212471172">ten Have, 1976</xref>: 10, emphasis added).</p>
<p>A contrasting stream of accounting history research argues that accounting practices prior to the thirteenth century were well developed in many parts of the world, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Rome, India, and the Byzantine Empire. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1032373212471172">Schmandt-Besserat (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1032373212471172">1983</xref>) has described accounting practices in ancient Mesopotamia in the second millennium BCE. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373212471172">Ezzamel (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1032373212471172">2002</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1032373212471172">Ezzamel and Hoskin (2002)</xref> have described the use of sophisticated accounting practices in ancient Egypt, particularly with regard to taxation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1032373212471172">Oldroyd (1995)</xref> has also contradicted ten Have’s argument that ancient civilizations contributed virtually nothing to the advancement of accounting practices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1032373212471172">Oldroyd (1995)</xref> indicates that accounting records dating from the first century CE in the Roman Empire reflected financial controls as a component of state administrative practices, and that accounting records were intertwined with private accounts maintained by the imperial household. Moreover, Oldroyd argues that imperial accounts were a natural extension of domestic accounting and budgeting and that they were based on the normal practices of propertied Roman households. In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1032373212471172">Rathbone (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1032373212471172">Macve (2002)</xref> have endeavored to put “the ghost of the ‘primitive’ nature of ancient accounting to rest” (p.456), by describing the accounting practices of the Appianus estate in Roman Egypt in the mid-third century CE. The purpose of these accounting practices was to enable the central administration of the estate to monitor the cost of production in the different units and to measure the efficiency and performance of the units in financial terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1032373212471172">Macve, 2002</xref>: 458). Thus, it can be observed that the accounting practices of many ancient civilizations were well developed. To contribute to this argument, this article demonstrates that the accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire in the fourth through sixth centuries were sufficiently well developed to serve the administrative needs of a large empire extending over a vast expanse of territory stretching from the Middle East to Spain, at a time when the accounting practices of neighboring kingdoms and states were largely undeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1032373212471172">Gibbon, 1902</xref>).</p>
<p>The third objective of this article is to examine whether the concept of “governmentality”, based on the work of Michel Foucault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373212471172">Miller and O’Leary, 1987</xref>), can be extended to research on ancient civilizations like the Byzantine Empire. Foucault’s ideas about history and historical research have been highly influential in accounting history research in recent years (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1032373212471172">Carmona et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1032373212471172">Hoskin and Macve, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1032373212471172">Miller and Napier, 1993</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet et al. (2002)</xref>, the concept of governmentality arises as a method for analyzing government, assuming that governing is done in a rational way.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1032373212471172">Foucault (1991)</xref> contended that the eighteenth century witnessed a change in ideas of how to govern that implied the development of a strategy of vigilance, rationalization and schematization of human behavior, and the functional sharing out of individuals in strict and stable spaces, where each one must play a pre-established role. It meant the creation of a new way of government based on discipline and knowledge: discipline in space and knowledge about space; discipline and knowledge of individuals’ bodies; and discipline and knowledge of individuals’ minds. In this way, knowledge, or truth; discipline, or power; and ethics in Foucauldian terms are the three pillars of governmentality. (p.420)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Various studies using Foucault’s concept of governmentality have demonstrated the importance of accounting practices in order to manage populations at a distance and to achieve desired governmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373212471172">Miller and O’Leary, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1032373212471172">Miller and Rose, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>). In the sections that follow, there will be an investigation concerning whether Foucault’s concept of governmentality can be applied to a historical study of an ancient civilization such as the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The next section discusses the rationale for focusing on the Byzantine Empire in the fourth through sixth centuries. The second section discusses changes to the structure of the land tax in the Byzantine Empire in the fourth century CE, including a description of surviving tax registers, evidence for the existence of property markets, and fees for property litigation. The third section discusses the administrative hierarchy of the Empire, including the organization of the civil service, with an emphasis on fees charged by civil servants for facilitating legal actions in the imperial courts of Constantinople. The fourth section discusses the internal control practices established by the Byzantine Empire during the sixth century CE related to excise taxation and the control of trade in the port of Constantinople. A final section offers a discussion and concludes the article.</p>
<p>One of the primary difficulties facing accounting historians when dealing with ancient civilizations is to identify surviving records that describe accounting practices during the periods in question. This study has been aided by compilations of translations and commentaries pertaining to original documents, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373212471172">Bagnall (1979)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1032373212471172">Bandy (1983)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury (1923)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1032373212471172">McCrindel (1897)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373212471172">Dewing (1940)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1032373212471172">Sijpesteijn and Worp (1978)</xref>. The primary sources for the article are English language translations of original documents written in Greek during the sixth century CE, including works by Ioannes Lydus (490–c. 578),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1032373212471172">3</xref></sup> Cosmas Indicopleutes (c. 500–c. 560),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1032373212471172">4</xref></sup> and Procopius of Caesarea (c. 500–c. 565).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1032373212471172">5</xref></sup> Other sources include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury (1923)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1032373212471172">Sijpesteijn and Worp (1978)</xref>, which contain photographs and descriptions of primary documents including tax records from the fourth century CE.</p>

<title>Why the Byzantine Empire?</title>
<p>There are several reasons for studying the Byzantine Empire. First, the Byzantine Empire has been under appreciated by historians in a general sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1032373212471172">6</xref></sup> This is unfortunate, because the Byzantine Empire was arguably the most important political, economic and military power in the European world during the early Middle Ages. The capital of the Empire, Constantinople, was one of the world’s largest cities and an important center of cultural, intellectual and commercial activity throughout the period studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1032373212471172">Threadgold, 1997</xref>). Second, there have been no previous accounting history papers dealing with the Byzantine Empire. Third, in contrast to the views expressed by some historians (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1032373212471172">De Ste Croix, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1032373212471172">1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1032373212471172">Finley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1032373212471172">ten Have, 1976</xref>), the historical evidence demonstrates that the accounting practices of both the later Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire were well developed and served the administrative needs of both civil and military affairs, as well as commercial and trading activities in a widely dispersed territory. For these reasons, a discussion of the administrative and accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire contributes towards filling an important gap in the accounting history literature, as well as expanding our knowledge about accounting practices in ancient civilizations.</p>

<title>A brief historical background</title>
<p>The Byzantine Empire existed from the fourth century until the mid-fifteenth century CE. As such, it was one of the longest lasting empires in world history – spanning a period of over one thousand years. While the Empire was generally known to its Western contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks, to its inhabitants it was considered to be a continuation of the Roman Empire. The Byzantine Emperors viewed themselves as successors to the Emperor Augustus, who ruled in the first century CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1032373212471172">Mango, 2002</xref>). At its peak in 565 CE, the Byzantine Empire encompassed most of the Middle East, all of Anatolia, Greece and the Balkans, all of Italy, parts of Spain, and all of North Africa, including Egypt (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1032373212471172">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>While there is no consensus regarding the precise date when the Byzantine Empire began (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1032373212471172">Table 1</xref> for certain key dates), many historians consider Constantine the Great (306–337 CE) to be the first Byzantine Emperor. Others suggest that it was not until the reign of Justinian I, in the 6th century CE, that the Byzantine Empire began. In 330 CE, Constantine relocated the capital of the Roman Empire to the small trading port of Byzantium, situated on the Bosporus in Anatolia. When Constantine died, the name of the capital was changed to Constantinople, a name which remained unchanged until the end of World War I. By the fifth century CE, Constantinople was one of the largest cities on earth with more than one million inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1032373212471172">Fisher, 1969</xref>). Constantine chose Byzantium to be the site of his new capital because of its strategic location along the major trading routes between East and West. Byzantium was also closer than Rome to the highly populated regions of the Empire in Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1032373212471172">Gibbon, 1902</xref>).</p>

<p>The following three sections of the article describe the administrative and accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire using the concept of governmentality as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373212471172">Miller and O’Leary (1987)</xref>, along with a model which encompasses three key functions of government (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1032373212471172">Wilson, 1889</xref>), namely: the raising of revenues through taxation; the administration of the state through a civil service; and the control of imports and exports using excise taxes and customs duties.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section4-1032373212471172">
<title>A first function of government: Revenue raising through taxation</title>
<p>By the end of the third century CE the Roman Empire had reached a crisis point. The Emperor Diocletian (284–305 CE) had attempted to control rampant inflation with price controls on services and commodities. However, because currency in the form of metallic coins had become scarce, a new system of taxation was introduced based on collecting taxes in the form of goods and services rather than money. Calculations were made regarding the amount of grain, cloth, oil, weapons or other goods necessary to sustain a single Roman soldier for a year. This amount was called an <italic>annona</italic>. Thus, central to the first function of governmentality was a domain of calculation and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>: 175). This form of calculative practice was essential in order to determine the amount that the taxpayers were capable of providing to the state in terms of goods and services. The calculative practice necessitated a complete census, not only of people but of resources, in particular cultivated land. This meant the creation of a new form of calculation based on knowledge about spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet, 2002</xref>: 420). Consequently, the most important source of tax revenue for the Empire was the land tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury, 1923</xref>). The amount of the land tax, and its distribution among the provinces, was calculated and announced through a special order of the Emperor, known as an “indiction”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1032373212471172">7</xref></sup> The land tax was not fixed; instead it was re-calibrated and re-announced through a decree by the Emperor on an annual basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373212471172">Bagnall, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury, 1923</xref>). Thus, the amount of the tax could be adjusted according to the needs of the imperial government (that is, calculation and control at a distance, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373212471172">Miller and O’Leary, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1032373212471172">Miller and Rose, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller (1992</xref>: 175) argue: “Knowledge is central to the activities of government and to the very formation of its objects, for government is a domain of cognition, calculation, experimentation and evaluation”. Knowledge of land value in the Byzantine Empire, which determined the amount of the land tax, was determined by a sophisticated calculative practice. All of the territory of the Empire was surveyed, and each parcel of land was taxed according to its value in terms of producing a particular type of agricultural crop, such as grain, wine or oil. In effect, the annona was a tax on the income producing capability of the land. The tax was calculated based on a unit of arable land called an <italic>iugum</italic>. The amount of land in an iugum varied according to the fertility of the soil and the type of crop. This required a precise knowledge of the income producing capacity of each piece of property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373212471172">Jones, 1964</xref>). Thus, the calculative practice with respect to the land tax required a knowledge of land values in a way that was central to the ability of government to levy the tax.</p>
<p>Agricultural land was predominantly cultivated by tenants who paid rent to the owner of the land. The names of the tenants were entered into accounting registers, thereby making the tenants liable for the tax (that is, “discipline and knowledge of individuals’ bodies”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet (2002</xref>: 420)). In addition, there were landowners who cultivated their own property. These landowners were also responsible for the tax. Imperial domains and the private estates of the Emperors were subject to the annona, but the tax was paid by the tenants who leased the land. This was also true with respect to land held by religious and monastic communities.</p>
<p>When monetary currency was re-established during the reign of Constantine in the fourth century, the land tax was converted into a monetary payment. Tax collection in each province was placed in the hands of the provincial governor, but the collection was carried out by officials appointed by the <italic>decurions</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1032373212471172">8</xref></sup> of each town. In this way, discipline and knowledge of individual bodies, based on calculative practices became the pillars of governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet, 2002</xref>: 420). The tax collectors delivered tax receipts to a representative of the provincial governor, and a large portion of the tax collected in each province was paid to the military authorities in that province. The residual amount was sent to the treasury of the Praetorian Prefecture in Constantinople. The Praetorian Prefecture then paid the salaries of the provincial governors and their staff. By the end of the fourth century, it is estimated that there were about 500,000 soldiers in the Empire who were paid from the annona. When the land tax was converted into coin, it was valued at approximately 25 <italic>solidi</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1032373212471172">9</xref></sup> per year per soldier. Thus, the annual amount of the annona was about 12.5 million solidi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury, 1923</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1032373212471172">
<title>Registers for the collection of land taxes</title>
<p>Much of what is known about the Byzantine Empire concerning its administrative and accounting practices is based on papyri records written in Greek and dating from the fourth century in Roman Egypt. The papyri records are located in various archives in university museums in Europe and the United States. The archives are widely dispersed and, as a result, scholars of the late Roman and Byzantine periods have endeavored to photograph the records and translate them, and to prepare commentaries on the translations. Two surviving mid-fourth century papyri record the names of persons who owned property in the Egyptian sub-province of Fayum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1032373212471172">Cockle, 1984</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1032373212471172">Figure 2</xref> for location). This sub-province was under the direct administration of the Praetorian Prefecture headquartered in Constantinople. The towns and villages in this sub-province were referred to as <italic>nomes</italic>. Two of the surviving registers list land holdings in the Hermopolite nome, which was located on the Nile River in the upper part of the Fayum area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1032373212471172">Bowman, 1985</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1032373212471172">Figure 2</xref> for the location of Hermopolis and Antinoopolis).</p>

<p>Both of the registers distinguish between landholders in Hermopolis and those in nearby Antinoopolis. The earlier of the two registers lists the landowners’ names in alphabetical order. Each entry also includes a detailed description of the landholdings, noting for each individual plot its size and location, and its classification for taxation purposes as “public” or “private” land. The register was prepared in the form of a book rather than scroll. Each page held two columns of text and was numbered. Pages 7–38 of the book survive. These pages reflect the details of 320 landholdings. The second register (compiled at a later date) is in similar form. Some entries have marginal audit notes and tick marks (for example a capital Z) indicating that an entry requires further investigation. Other audit marks (//) indicate that the entry was checked against another type of record, or had been transferred from the book of original entry to a comprehensive accounting ledger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1032373212471172">Cockle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373212471172">Kelly, 2004</xref>). These surviving documents provide evidence of auditing practices pertaining to property accounting and tax records of the Byzantine Empire during the fourth century. The records indicate that the accounting practices were relatively sophisticated, even though they did not constitute double-entry bookkeeping, and that they were used to obtain direct knowledge of individual bodies through calculative practices, thus achieving the ends of governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Property markets</title>
<p>In the surviving tax registers, various individuals were listed as property holders, including bishops, municipal magistrates, military officers, professionals (for example, doctors, lawyers and educators), artisans, and tradesmen (for example, silversmiths, builders, potters, and dyers). Of the 203 landowners, about one fifth of them owned property larger than 100 <italic>arouras</italic> in size (one aroura = 2,756 square meters). The majority of the landholdings were between 11 and 100 arouras. Differences between land registers compiled at two different time periods indicate a greater change in ownership than would be expected as a result of inheritance or gifts. This provides evidence of an active property market. For example, two landowners reduced their holdings from 150 to 58 arouras, another from 80 to 75; a third added 4.5 arouras to a holding of 12. Finally, one senior official reduced his holdings from 466 arouras to 8 arouras. These registers also indicate that the persons who owned the land also resided there (that is, they were not absentee landowners) and that property ownership was not concentrated in large landholdings. Moreover, the land was owned by a diverse group of persons who differed in rank, profession, and trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373212471172">Kelly, 2004</xref>: 149–150).</p>

<title>Property litigation</title>
<p>In the fourth century, the emperors issued decrees regarding the regulation of prices concerning legal actions. One of the most comprehensive examples of the administration of legal fees was inscribed on a limestone slab found in Timgad, Algeria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1032373212471172">10</xref></sup> This is another form of discipline and control at a distance. The fees associated with litigation were expressed in terms of the cash equivalent of a bushel of wheat. To begin an action, the plaintiff had to pay 5 <italic>modii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1032373212471172">11</xref></sup> to the <italic>exceptores</italic> (the officials who staffed the provincial governor’s court) for the registration of a <italic>postulation simplex</italic> (the initial pleading), and 5 modii to the <italic>scholastici</italic> (barristers) for the presentation of the <italic>postulation simplex</italic> in the court. If the <italic>postulation</italic> was successful, the plaintiff would receive a judgment entitling the plaintiff to summon the defendant to a public hearing before the governor. To issue a summons, the plaintiff was required to pay 5 modii to the <italic>Principes officii</italic> (the head of the governor’s staff) and 2½ each to the two senior subordinates, the <italic>cornicularius</italic> and the <italic>commentariensis</italic>. The <italic>executor</italic> (the official appointed to serve the summons and execute the judgment) received 2 modii. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were required to pay other fees. The lowest amount of fees charged through all stages of a legal action was 81 modii for the plaintiff and 59 modii for the defendant. If the litigation was conducted in a location away from the provincial capital, additional fees were charged. As a result, it was not feasible for poor landholders to pursue litigation. Litigation was, therefore, reserved for wealthy individuals and landholders, and court cases dealt primarily with land disputes and disputes regarding taxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373212471172">Kelly, 2004</xref>). Publishing the fees in the form of stone inscriptions was central to enforcement in that publication exposed non-compliant officials to charges of corruption. One could therefore argue that the publication of the fees in a permanent and visible form was evidence of discipline and control at a distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>A second function of government: Administration of the state through exports</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet (2002</xref>: 421) indicates that an important aspect of governmentality involves the creation of “subjects who manage political rationalities and who are known as <italic>experts</italic> because of the <italic>truth</italic> that they possess” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1032373212471172">Foucault, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>). This important aspect of the concept of governmentality is illustrated by the administrative hierarchy and the organization of the civil service in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>At the end of the third century, the Empire was divided into four Prefectures: <italic>Gaul, Italy, Illyricum</italic>, and the <italic>East</italic>. The Prefecture of Gaul, which included present-day France, Spain, and the north-west part of Africa, was lost to the gothic armies during the fourth century and it was not part of the Byzantine Empire after that period. The Prefecture of Italy included the Italian peninsula, the provinces between the Alps and the Danube, and the north-western portions of the Balkans; this prefecture was lost to gothic armies and then re-conquered during the early sixth century. The Prefecture of Illyricum included the provinces of Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, which was part of the Byzantine Empire during the sixth century, having never been lost. The Prefecture of the East included Thrace in the north and Egypt in the south, as well as Anatolia, Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Because of its large population, the Prefecture of the East was the most important part of the Empire. The Prefectures were sub-divided into <italic>dioceses</italic>, each headed by a <italic>Vicarius</italic>. The dioceses were sub-divided into provinces. Thus, the administrative hierarchy consisted of four levels: the Emperor at the top, followed by the Prefects, the Vicarii, and the provincial governors. The functions of the Prefects included administrative, financial, judicial, and legislative powers. The Vicarii and the provincial governors were appointed at the recommendation of the Prefects, and they could also be dismissed by the Prefect, subject to the Emperor’s approval. The Prefects received regular accounting and other administrative reports from the Vicarii and the provincial governors. The Prefect was also the supreme judge of appeal in legal cases brought before his court from a lower tribunal, and he could issue edicts on his own authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury, 1923</xref>).</p>

<title>Organization of the civil service<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1032373212471172">12</xref></sup></title>
<p>Most of the civil servants of the Empire were employed in the Praetorian Prefecture, under the supervision of the Emperor. The Praetorian Prefecture was responsible for judicial and financial affairs, army recruitment, and public works, and the oversight of more than fifty provinces in an area encompassing the current territory of the Balkan states, Anatolia, the Middle East, and North Africa (including Egypt and Libya). The civil servants were divided into exceptore (focusing on legal matters, and thus lawyers) and <italic>scriniarii</italic> (focusing on accounting and financial affairs, including taxation). There were several ranks within each of these divisions, ranging from entry level to senior level. These were the subjects who managed political rationalities within the Empire and who were known as experts because of the truth that they possessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The day-to-day administration of the Empire was conducted through a highly educated set of experts who were literate in both Latin and Greek (the exceptores, or lawyers), and a somewhat lesser educated cadre of finance and accounting experts who were known as <italic>scriniarii</italic> (who might only know Greek). To become an exceptor, an individual had to be privately educated at the expense of his family. Admission to the position as an exceptor was obtained by passing a difficult written examination based on classical Greek and Latin texts. The number of civil servants, both exceptore and scriniarii, was small in comparison with modern governments, reaching only 35,000 for an Empire with a population of approximately 50 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373212471172">Kelly, 2004</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the imperial government did not provide education, housing, health or social welfare. The primary purpose of the imperial government was military administration, along with the construction of roads, aqueducts and other public facilities.</p>
<p>The imperial palace in Constantinople was designed for administrative purposes, and it included audience halls, council chambers, judicial tribunals, imperial secretariats, and state archives. Most of the civil servants lived and worked in the imperial palace, and they wore uniforms indicating their rank and grade that identified them as expert civil servants. Although an exceptor in the Praetorian Prefecture received a small salary, it was anticipated that they would earn most of their income from fees paid by persons who wanted to institute legal proceedings or obtain a particular legal action from the imperial government. The higher the rank of the exceptor, the higher the fees they could earn. An exceptor on the judicial side of the Praetorian Prefecture could earn 1,000 solidi per year. This level of earnings can be compared with the official salary of a newly appointed exceptor which was 9 solidi per year. Exceptore were not expected to live on their salaries. Most expert civil servants assumed that they would derive a major portion of their annual income from fees. The cornicularius (the most senior official on the legal side of the civil service) earned about 1,900 solidi per year. Civil servants came from prosperous and well educated provincial backgrounds, and because they were the experts who managed the political rationalities of the Empire they expected to have a much greater standard of living than ordinary citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373212471172">Kelly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1032373212471172">
<title>Conflicts between Latin and Greek in the administration of the Empire</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller (1992)</xref>, a political rationality is a discursive practice which needs a language in order to explain the rationales that underlie it. The continuity of the discursive practices of government through time may be compromised if the language of government changes. In the fourth century, legal cases coming before the highest tribunals in Constantinople were required to be summarized in Latin by two separate officials. These court documents were written in a special script that could only be used by the exceptors of the <italic>sacra scrinia</italic>. This special script was intended to guard against forgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1032373212471172">13</xref></sup> The mandatory use of Latin was intended to assure that the exceptores who managed political rationalities continued to be recognized as experts because of the truth that they possessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>), in other words the knowledge of Latin and the special script of the law courts.</p>
<p>During the fifth century, legal judgments and other official documents began to be issued in Greek rather than Latin. Greek had been part of the administrative practices of the Byzantine Empire for several hundred years. Gradually it became the language of court hearings and many standard legal documents, such as bills of sale, as well as various accounting records, including tax and land registers, even though Latin was the legally recognized language. This reliance on Latin as the language of law and administration began to diminish towards the end of the fifth century. From the mid-fifth century onward, most legislation was promulgated in Greek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373212471172">Kelly, 2004</xref>: 34). In effect, Greek, which was already the language of everyday trade and commerce, replaced Latin.</p>
<p>This change in the language of government affected many aspects of governmentality. The civil servants in the administrative hierarchy objected to the demise of Latin as the language of law and administration. As a group, the exceptors took great pride in their linguistic competency in both Latin and Greek, and they believed that only persons with appropriate language skills ought to be allowed to perform legal and administrative functions. It was argued that there was danger in allowing administrative tasks to be conducted by persons who were not properly educated in Latin. Documents could be issued even though those responsible did not understand what the documents said.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Whenever significant difficulties arose for the taxpayers because the documents had not been processed according to the proper procedures, the Prefect grew angry and sentenced to death those who did not understand the force of the documents which had been so carelessly and haphazardly issued. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1032373212471172">Bandy, 1983</xref>: 3.68)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In effect, the administrative and accounting errors of administrators, who did not understand Latin, led to failures to warn taxpayers about the serious consequences of the tax documents that pertained to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1032373212471172">14</xref></sup> Thus, experts could formulate discourses about governmentality and also create problems for the practices of governmentality through the articulation of discourses (that is, mandatory documents in Latin) about what they called <italic>truths</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471172">Álvarez-Dardet, 2002</xref>: 421).</p>

<title>A third function of government: Control of trade</title>
<p>Technologies of governmentality are employed to discipline the activities of a population at a distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>). The technologies of government include techniques, apparatuses, calculations, documents and procedures though which authorities seek to embody and give effect to governmental ambitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>: 177). This aspect of the concept of governmentality can be illustrated by efforts to control trade in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>Commercial transportation and trade within the Empire was primarily conducted by Syrian and Greek merchants who established trading centers not only in Constantinople, but in Alexandria, Rome, Naples, Carthage, Marseilles, and other ports along the Aegean and Black Seas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1032373212471172">Bréhier, 1950 [1903]</xref>). Ships transported a variety of products, such as silk and linen garments from factories in Lebanon, pistachios from Damascus, wine from Gaza, papyrus and grains from Egypt, and furs from Cappadocia. Customs duties were levied on all goods transported through the port of Constantinople, which constituted the largest percentage of the total commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury, 1923</xref>). External trade between the Empire and the east was primarily conducted by non-Byzantine merchants, including Persians, Abyssinians (Ethiopians), and the Himyarites of Yemen. The Persians secured a monopoly in the silk trade, while products from India were transported by Abyssinian traders to markets in Adulis (located near the mouth of the Red Sea), or to Byzantine ports in Suez. Because the Mediterranean region had fewer products to offer to Indian and Chinese traders, exports were insufficient to offset imports desired by the West. Consequently, the balance of trade was negative, resulting in transfers of gold to the East. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury (1923)</xref> estimates that the negative balance of trade was at least 1.6 million solidi per annum.</p>
<p>Trading activity between the Byzantine Empire and East Asia is described in the surviving manuscript written by Cosmas Indicopleustes in the sixth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1032373212471172">McCrindel, 1897</xref>). It is believed that Cosmas reached modern day Sri Lanka, which at that time was a major trading center between the Byzantine Empire and China, India, and Arabia. The ports of Sri Lanka served as an emporium for merchandise in transit. While the bulk of the Chinese and Indian products imported into the Empire passed through Sri Lanka, this did not include silk. Most of the silk that reached the Empire came from China through Persia, along the overland silk route. The Emperor Justinian I wanted to break the Persian monopoly in the silk trade, and in 530 CE he established an industry for the production of raw silk within the Empire. Silkworm eggs were transported to Constantinople from “Serinda”, which was the Byzantine name for the kingdoms located along the silk route.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1032373212471172">15</xref></sup> A silk production industry was established in several regions of the Empire, including Greece and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Procopius describes how the growing demand for silk was controlled through the issuance of sumptuary laws restricting the use of silk fabrics to religious ceremonies and for the garments of important dignitaries and officials of the imperial court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373212471172">Dewing, 1940</xref>). Fines were levied against silk traders, and there were various attempts to regulate the prices of raw and manufactured silk fabrics and garments. There was also a silk monopoly controlled by the imperial treasurer. Efforts to control the silk trade emerged when silk traders and manufacturers began charging higher prices for their products, which they said were necessary because the Persians were charging them a higher price for the raw materials. As a result, the Emperor Justinian I attempted to fix the price of raw silk. The silk traders resisted this edict because they had bought their silk at higher prices, and they were unwilling to sell below their cost. Consequently, they stopped importing silk, and they sold their inventories to wealthy consumers in a black market. When the Empress Theodora became aware of these transactions she ordered the inventories to be confiscated and imposed a fine of 100 pounds of gold on the black marketers (Procopius, <italic>The Secret History</italic>, Chapter 25). These government efforts to control the silk trade illustrate the complex of techniques and procedures though which the authorities sought to embody and give effect to governmental ambitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section12-1032373212471172">
<title>Customs duties and tolls</title>
<p>In his <italic>Historia Arcana</italic> (<italic>The Secret History</italic>), Procopius also described abuses of the customs tolls system during the reign of Justinian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1032373212471172">16</xref></sup> These abuses concerned customs duties on imports and exports from the Empire. There are two ways to reach Constantinople by sea; the Hellespont, which goes from the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosporus, leading from the Black Sea to Constantinople.</p>
<p>According to Procopius, there was no customs house on the Hellespont. Instead, a magistrate commissioned by the Emperor was stationed at Abydus, a village on the Hellespont, to observe whether ships bearing arms traveled towards Constantinople without the Emperor’s consent, and also whether ships coming from Constantinople had a permit and a seal, thus constituting an accounting control. It was illegal for a ship to leave Constantinople without being released by a magistrate who collected a toll from the ships. A second customs agent was stationed at Hieron, on the Bosporus near its opening into the Black Sea. Part of this customs agent’s function was to see whether any products that were not permitted to be exported were transported to foreigners living in the Black Sea region. This agent did not collect a toll; rather he was paid a salary by the Emperor. In order to increase customs revenues, the Emperor established a customs house on each strait and appointed two separate customs agents with no salary. He then directed them to make as much money as possible from the tolls. To demonstrate their loyalty to the Emperor, these agents would plunder the entire cargoes of some shippers. Many ships’ captains were unwilling to continue in the maritime trade and burned their ships instead. Those who continued in the shipping trade collected fees from merchants in order to take on cargoes; the merchants would then pass on these costs to the consumers of the goods (Procopius, <italic>The Secret History</italic>). Thus, there was a technology of government which intervened in the practices of a population and exerted a disciplinary force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The first objective of this article was to describe and discuss the administrative and accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire, with a particular focus on the fourth through sixth centuries CE. A survey of the specialized accounting history journals reveals that there have been no previous studies focusing on the Byzantine Empire, even though this Empire was the dominant political, economic, and military power in the European world in the early Middle Ages. In this article, the calculative practices and techniques of government of the Empire have been described, including the system of land taxation, the organization of the civil service, and the implementation of controls pertaining to excise taxation and customs duties. In each of these discussions, evidence was presented regarding accounting practices for tax assessment and collection, as well as evidence of markets in real property and trade in goods and services.</p>
<p>The second objective of the article was to contribute to the debate among accounting historians as to whether ancient civilization possessed advanced accounting practices. The surviving historical records indicate that the accounting practices of the Byzantine Empire were well established to serve the needs of commercial and administrative practices at a time when countries adjacent to the Empire were relatively primitive and undeveloped. This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1032373212471172">Oldroyd’s (1995)</xref> questioning of Finley’s argument that the ancient empires contributed virtually nothing to the advancement of governmentality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1032373212471172">Bowman (1985)</xref> also supports the relative sophistication of the tax assessment and collection procedures of the Byzantine Empire during the fourth century. In addition, based upon the first-hand accounts of Ioannes Lydus, the system of fees charged by expert civil servants dealing with the processing of litigation has been illustrated. Finally, based upon the <italic>Secret History</italic> of Procopius, issues associated with control at a distance with respect to the silk trade and excise taxation of goods entering and leaving the Empire were discussed. Consequently, the debate during the last forty years among accounting historians regarding the nature of accounting practices in ancient civilizations in which some authors have argued that ancient civilizations did not possess well developed accounting practices appears to be incorrect. Furthermore, there is a clear gap in the accounting history literature regarding the period from the fourth century to the sixth century CE. This article contributes to filling that gap. Despite the arguments of accounting historians who have maintained that accounting practices of the ancient world were not well developed, there is ample evidence that accounting practices in the Byzantine Empire were, in fact, well developed.</p>
<p>Finally, the third objective of this article focused on the concept of “governmentality”, derived from the work of Michel Foucault. An attempt has been made to show how the concept of governmentality might be extended to research on ancient civilizations. Various studies using Foucault’s concept of governmentality have demonstrated the importance of accounting practices with respect to managing populations at a distance and to achieving desired governmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373212471172">Rose and Miller, 1992</xref>). It is therefore concluded that the concept of governmentality can be applied to a historical study of an ancient civilization such as the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>Other accounting historians are encouraged to build upon this description of administrative and accounting practices in the Byzantine Empire and to explore how the concept of governmentality might be used in exploring administrative and accounting practices in a general sense.</p>

His works include <italic>The Wars of Justinian, The Buildings of Justinian</italic>, and <italic>The Secret History</italic>. The collected works of <italic>Procopius</italic> have been edited by HB Dewing and can be found in the Loeb Classical Library, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University (1940), in both Greek text and English translation.</p>

<p>Indictions initially began with the Emperor Diocletian, who imposed a 15-year cycle of land taxes. In later periods, indictions ranged in number from 1 to 15. The year spanning the period from 1 September 312 to 31 August 313 was considered to be indiction 1. By the late fourth century, indictions were also used to date documents throughout the Empire. All documents were required to be marked with the indiction and the year within the indiction. The first day of the indiction year was originally 23 September, the birthday of Augustus. During the last half of the fifth century, the first day of the Byzantine year shifted to 1 September, where it remained until the end of the Empire. In 537 CE, Justinian decreed that all dates used in documents had to include the indiction and the year within the indiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1032373212471172">Bury, 1923</xref>).</p>

<p>A decurion was a member of a city legislature or senate. Decurions were drawn from the wealthy middle-class citizens of a town. Consequently, decurions were the most powerful political figures at the local level. They were responsible for tax collection, issuance of public contracts, religious rituals, entertainment, and ensuring public order.</p></fn>

<p>The evidence for this section is derived from a first-hand account written by Ioannes Lydus (490–c.578 CE) in a memoir entitled <italic>De Magistratibus Republicae</italic>. The only surviving copy of this document is located in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, France. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1032373212471172">Bandy (1983)</xref> has prepared a translation of, and commentary regarding this document. Ioannes Lydus was born in the city of Philadelphia in Lydia on the western coast of Asia Minor (western Turkey) around 490 CE. At the age of 21, after completing an expensive private education, which included the study of Latin and Greek literature, he moved to Constantinople to seek a position in one of the imperial secretariats (<italic>sacria scrinia</italic>). This position involved working in the imperial palace and dealing with issues related to administrative and judicial matters pertaining to the administration of the Empire. While waiting for a suitable position, Joannes furthered his education by attending lectures on Aristotle and Plato at the university in Constantinople. In 511, Joannes was offered a position as an entry level exceptor in the Praetorian Prefecture. Ioannes owed his position to a friend of his father, who had been appointed to be the Praetorian Prefect by the emperor Anastasius in 510. Ioannes worked as an exceptore in the Praetorian Prefecture for 20 years, until a new prefect was appointed by the emperor Justinian in 531. The new prefect favored the accounting and finance oriented scrinaii rather than the classically educated legal oriented exceptores. The new prefect implemented reforms which weakened the power and income of the exceptore. Although Ioannes Lydus remained in his position at the Praetorian Prefecture for another 20 years, he was also appointed by the emperor Justinian to a chair in Latin Language and Literature at the State University of Constantinople (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1032373212471172">Maas, 1992</xref>). In 552, after 40 years of service, Joannes retired from the Prefecture, having achieved the rank of cornicularius, the highest rank among the exceptore. Thereafter, until his death around 578, he devoted himself to writing histories, essays, and memoirs.</p>

<p>Procopius’ <italic>Secret History</italic> was not published during his lifetime, and it appears to have been intended as a denunciation of the Emperor. The manuscript was discovered in the Vatican Library, and it was eventually published in 1623. The <italic>Secret History</italic> covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the History of Justinian’s Wars published in 550 CE.</p>
