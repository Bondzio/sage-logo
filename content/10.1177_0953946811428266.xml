<abstract>
<p>Herbert McCabe uses football (soccer) as an analogy for Christian ethics, the sports game being an illuminating abstraction from the concreteness of moral life. This paper explores three authorities in the life-abstraction that is sport: the referee, the coach, and the exemplary player. (1) The referee bears practical epistemic authority: he declares what counts as a play within the rules, and what shall be excluded as an invalid (non-rule-following) play. There are interesting authority-problems that arise when referees err. In ethics, epistemic authority is found in casuistry. (2) The coach bears social authority: she works to make her team function as a team, and at the same time to draw each player to her own excellence. Christian ethics values social authority in every truly human dimension. (3) The exemplary player is a personal authority. He demonstrates excellence of play, which goes beyond conformance to the rules and also goes beyond coaching. A complexification here is the relation of deliberate rule-breaking to excellence of performance. In Christian ethics, exemplary authority is held by the saint living in <italic>koinonia</italic>. The paper closes with the disanalogy that Christian ethics hopes for excellence in every person.</p>

<p>Herbert McCabe describes morality as ‘the least abstract approach’ to the study of human behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946811428266">1</xref></sup> He contrasts morality with the abstraction that is sport. Morality ‘is concerned with the good life for a human being taken as a whole’ (189), whereas, in sport, the concern is only ‘with an isolated abstract feature of human living’ (189). But McCabe works this contrast also as an analogy, in which by looking at sport we can see better what morality is about. The latter, he says, is to do well in ‘the endeavour to be a human being’ (189). Part of the work of the analogy is to argue that there is such a thing as striving to be human, that we can speak of succeeding (or not) at being a human being, just as we can speak of striving and perhaps succeeding at being a footballer.</p>
<p>In the game of football,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946811428266">2</xref></sup> what counts as ‘successful activity, well-performed’ (190) is knowable because humans created football. This might seem a disanalogy with human life, because McCabe quite wisely does not take the view that we created human life. Nonetheless, he holds, we are capable of knowing what ‘the point of human living’ is, and that it is ultimately ‘in God’ and penultimately to live well with one another (191). For human beings, and apparently uniquely so, to live well with one another involves culture, language, and thus having life-stories, being characters. The point of human life is to live with one another in friendship, <italic>philia</italic>, which involves ‘<italic>communicatio</italic>, sharing’, particularly ‘<italic>koinonia</italic>, sharing a common life’ (191).</p>
<p>So both the abstraction of sport and the concreteness of human life have as given a notion of what will count as successful activity done well. To reach their respective goals, each has two analogous stages. The first is to know the rules. The ‘Football Authorities’, according to McCabe, have determined ‘what counts as <italic>inadmissible</italic> play’ (192; emphasis McCabe’s). They have established boundary conditions. To catch the ball with your hands is, in this sport, inadmissible play; do that, and you have ceased playing football. Analogously, there are rules for ‘being God’s people’ (which is the same thing as being ‘human people’) and these are rules for ‘living in friendship’ (192). These rules make specifications about what counts as inadmissible play when you are trying to succeed in the task of being a human being. McCabe considers the Decalogue to be ‘an <italic>outline</italic> of friendship’ (192; emphasis McCabe’s). Its negative commands specify that murder, stealing, adultery, and false witness are inadmissible plays: do them, and you are failing to play the human game. Just as catching the ball with your hands is not playing football, committing adultery is not playing human.</p>
<p>Yet the avoidance of fouls in football does not mean you are playing football well. To play well also requires dedicated practice as you build up the disposition of a football player, a practical disposition that is shown forth in skilful play. Good play in football is the solution of practical problems presented on the field; these practical solutions are not first worked out intellectually and then put into action, but are rather worked out precisely as the play proceeds. Knowledgeable observers will recognise skilful play, even if they had not anticipated that the practical problems on the field would be resolved <italic>that</italic> way. The analogy with concrete human life holds, McCabe says, at all these points. To play the human game well requires practice that leads to the virtues which are then demonstrated in the practicalities of living together. Knowledgeable observers might not have anticipated it, but they will know when they have seen an instance of someone loving her neighbour as herself, someone, that is, who is succeeding at being human, which is to say, succeeding at living in friendship with others.</p>
<p>Within this analogy of abstract sport and concrete ethics I see three authority figures doing essential work: the referee, who exercises epistemic authority; the coach, who exercises social authority; and the exemplary player, who exercises personal authority. The referee defines a play and declares when it is inadmissible. The coach summons forth the development of the skills and virtues of play. And the exemplary player demonstrates to all of us successful or excellent or, perhaps we should say, simply ‘good’ play. In each case there are complexifying factors, but the complexifications do not remove the necessity of these authorities to sport. Just so, I suggest, epistemic, social, and personal authority are essential to Christian ethics, whose subject is human life in its concreteness, sharing a common life (<italic>koinonia</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946811428266">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0953946811428266">
<title>The Referee: Epistemic Authority</title>
<p>Sport requires referees, epistemic authorities who are able to state what is the case with a matter at hand. Referees (I use the word inclusively to include umpires and so forth) function as epistemic authorities when they declare that a given play is inadmissible, or what kind of play it is. Their expertise is definitional, not qualitative, and it appears at boundary conditions.</p>
<p>The interesting and complexifying cases with epistemic authorities arise in disputed situations. In various sports challenges are handled variously and sometimes, in one sport, variously according to altered expectations and/or improved technology. In baseball, the home plate umpire calls the strikes. He makes the determination of what counts as a strike and what counts as a ‘ball’. Now to pitch a ball is not, <italic>per se</italic>, inadmissible play, but a pitcher may not pitch balls exclusively: after four balls, the batter walks; after four such walks, you have a scoring run; and with only balls, the inning would never end. So there must be some pitches within the strike zone, or we don’t have baseball. That strike zone is an imaginary rectangular box above home plate whose height extends ‘from the hollow below the batter’s kneecap to just below his shoulder’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946811428266">4</xref></sup> There is an expertise to calling strikes. Batters are of different heights; the ball moves with a velocity approaching 100 miles per hour and does not move in a straight line. The traditional and current practice is to accept the umpire’s call without appeal. Television cameras sometimes show replays of pitches with the strike zone marked out as a rectangle imposed upon the image; in those replays, it may appear that the umpire made an incorrect call. Nonetheless his call stands. His authority is recognised as necessary (strikes must be called), and generally correct. It is also implicitly recognised, I think, that the two-dimensional video replay may not itself accurately lay out the three-dimensional strike zone. In particular cases, the matter is even more complicated; for instance, a given umpire may tend to have a small strike zone. This too is accepted, with the expectation that he will apply the reduced zone to both teams without distinction. While the particular calls of an umpire are unappealable, a pattern of erratic or recognisably wrong calls will bring about his replacement, not in a particular game, but in the long run.</p>
<p>By contrast, technology is more integrated into the work of referees in tennis and in American football. Video capture is used to determine line faults in tennis; and referees in American football can sometimes ask to view a replay before finalising the call. Such technology reduces the referee’s fallibility, but importantly does not eliminate it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946811428266">5</xref></sup> Technology can at best improve accuracy, but its use may interrupt, slow down, and hinder play; and no technology is free from a margin of error. If the game is to proceed, epistemic authority must be exercised in good time, even without the certainty that it is being exercised correctly.</p>
<p>We can thus see that an important feature of sport is the necessity of the epistemic authority exercised by referees who declare what particular instances of play are, and whether they count as admissible play. Thereby the practice of sport requires that its players and observers take in a lesson about authority. If the game is to be played, referees are necessary. In particular, one must learn that it is better to keep playing than to quit when one disagrees with a particular call (for that latter situation is unavoidable).</p>
<p>These conclusions apply analogously in the concreteness of human life. Michael Polanyi has shown that all knowledge is ineluctably personal. There is always an inescapable and irreducible ‘tacit dimension’, something that we know that nonetheless it is impossible to articulate. Polanyi makes his case in several book-length treatises,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946811428266">6</xref></sup> but a quick grasp of the point can be obtained from his essay, ‘The Unaccountable Element in Science’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946811428266">7</xref></sup> Polanyi hones in on something Kant noticed on occasion, but passed over; ‘a skill … deeply hidden in the human soul’ (in Kant’s words) whereby we identify the class to which a particular belongs. How do we do that? It is not unlearnable, and it need not be totally opaque to our understanding; but it necessarily goes beyond our understanding (it is an infinite regress to attempt to have rules for the application of rules to cases!). We recognise that there are people particularly gifted in particular fields: Polanyi’s short, suggestive list goes from scientific intuition to music, politics, and boxing (!). It is my view that such people, when they have a position over their peers (for instance, as academic peer-reviewers), are rightly seen as epistemic authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946811428266">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>So to Christian ethics, and human life in the concreteness of <italic>koinonia</italic>: As the plate umpire can call strikes without being able completely to explain his call (he ‘knows’ when he sees one), so there are persons whose particular skill is to draw the moral line around human actions and to identify those actions that are inadmissible. Such a person is a casuist, who can discern the difference between an act of love and an act of thievery (to take a notable topic of scholastic discrimination). Every human being is a casuist, to the extent that he would recognise the forbidden actions of the Decalogue as always and everywhere wrong. But to know when a particular action is or would be an instance of, say, theft, requires a skill of discrimination, the development of which requires apprenticeship and trust in those who already have the skill, a certain ability to see relevant analogies and to pick out the appropriate details from the mass of data in the case at hand. These skills are inevitably tacit and inarticulable to a degree, and cannot be exercised infallibly. Yet the fact that we cannot state, infallibly, whether some particular action is or is not theft does not mean that theft is an empty category—to use one sort of language, it does not mean that there are not actions that are ‘always and everywhere wrong’. In the concreteness of life as in sport, epistemic authorities are both necessary and fallible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946811428266">
<title>The Coach: Social Authority</title>
<p>Once we have granted the distinction between admissible play and good play, there remains the matter of developing the skills of good play. Let us return to football. There are skills needed by every player on the team, and there are particular skills needed by certain players on the team. It is the coach’s task in a broad sense to see that those skills are developed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946811428266">9</xref></sup> It is particularly the coach’s task to pull those skills together and train the players for the sake of playing the game excellently. There are many ways to play well in a game, and consequently there need to be determinations that on <italic>this</italic> occasion we will play <italic>this</italic> way. Thus the coach as social authority determines the means to the team’s common good. She also has charge of seeing to its common good materially, which allows her players to focus on more limited elements of that common good (staying on top of <italic>this</italic> opponent, blocking <italic>this</italic> shot, and so forth). When each player has to be concerned for the whole, she is less able to do well at her part of the whole.</p>
<p>The team is an abstract society wherein the coach, with social authority, has an eye to the team’s common good and another eye to the development of excellence in its individual members. Thanks to the coach’s social authority, the individual players commit themselves to the common good of the team while concerning themselves with their particular tasks. The social authority of a coach can midwife extraordinary individuals: Joe Montana, for instance, emerged as a phenomenal quarterback in American football thanks to his coach, Bill Walsh, and particularly the ‘West Coast offense’ strategy that Walsh instituted.</p>
<p>But a single team cannot achieve its good on its own: it needs other teams, and usually the institution of a league, not to mention ancillary matters like financing. The coach’s social authority is thus socially located in complex relationships with the authorities in other societies. Particularly, a team, to develop well, needs opponents who are worthy. Its own good requires that the games it plays be good. It would be possible for a team, with opponents always weak, to win every game and yet fail to achieve its good. This would thwart the purpose for which the coach has authority. Here we can see the difference between excellence and winning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946811428266">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sport (unlike some other abstractions from our concrete humanity) conflict is given a necessary and subordinate place in the pursuit of the good. Necessary it is, for without opponents, there is no game. Yet it is subordinate, as shown in the recognition of the distinction between excellence and winning. Thus sport incorporates <italic>difference</italic> (conflict, plurality) as essential to its good, while also showing that the good aimed at is a performance that contains difference. Conflict, that is to say, is not the last word.</p>
<p>Working the McCabean analogy: in the concreteness of Christian ethics, since the human being is a cultured animal living socially and politically, authority is needed in every sort of society to call forth (e.g., through training) the excellence of individuals and to see that the common good is pursued. We cannot flourish as human beings without engaging in corporate activities. We not only need colleagues (the analogue to teammates and sporting opponents), we also need persons who exercise authority (the analogue to the coach), who both determine how we shall achieve common goods and also attend to the common goods with such focus and specificity that allows us to flourish in our individuality. Christian ethics thus has an appreciation for rulers and governors of all sorts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946811428266">11</xref></sup> as carrying out essential functions, so that society can be rich and textured, can be a matrix out of which individuals emerge. As in sport, so in concrete life: social authority is indispensable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0953946811428266">
<title>The Exemplary Player: Personal Authority</title>
<p>The theoretical intellect enjoys mastering the rules of a sport and understanding good coaching, but most of all it thrills to witness excellent play. So if one wants to know what it means to play football, the best answer is not given by rules or by coaching, but simply by pointing to a good footballer. ‘Watch him’, we might say, ‘and you will see what it means to play football.’</p>
<p>The relationship of excellence of play to the rules of play is a complex matter. In basketball, a strict avoidance of the personal foul would inhibit a player’s development; he would be holding himself back. It is necessary to risk personal fouls in order to become the sort of player who can play aggressively well without crossing the line into a foul. In addition, sometimes an excellent player fouls deliberately and accepts the penalty, in order to advance a team interest (for instance, interrupting the opponents’ momentum of play). In many sports, including basketball, the use of a deliberate foul is expected and encouraged. One might ask here a meta-question: whether in this respect sport is a helpful or misleading abstraction from moral life—the hoary old question whether it can be right to do wrong.</p>
<p>Golf provides a strong counter-example of an ethos in which excellent play falls strictly within the rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946811428266">12</xref></sup> Golfers who slightly move their ball to obtain a better shooting position are scorned, even if they elude detection. Every one of a multitude of rules is scrupulously followed; and the player who fails to follow them is frequently presumed to have done so out of ignorance (and derided for lack of study!). The ethos, that is, assumes ignorance rather than badness. A world-class golfer who signs an incorrect card, on which his score is recorded as one stroke higher than it really was, will gracefully accept the consequences (which may be defeat) rather than make any sort of appeal to his ‘real’ score. When one asks to see an excellent golfer, that sort of example is part of what one points to.</p>
<p>Unexpected, even surprising, performance often characterises an excellent player.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946811428266">13</xref></sup> Out of a structured (i.e., rule-defined) context, through apprenticeship and guidance, excellence emerges. In my view we may rightly say that the excellent person becomes <italic>a personal authority</italic> on all that has come before.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946811428266">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Christian practices of baptism and Scripture-reading provide a template for the emergence of personal authority. In baptism (taking adult baptism as normative) the candidate rises out of the community to proclaim the Christian faith as her own. And in lectionary reading of Scripture (e.g., in Anglican Morning and Evening Prayer), the Bible is set forth in anticipation that the hearer will rise to practise it as her own (as she will proclaim again the baptismal creed). The authority of the baptised arises out of the matrix of these practices, and goes beyond them without confounding them. In the terms of the abstraction of sport, the rules are followed, practices have been formative, but the personal authority that emerges is more than could have been expected.</p>
<p>In the concreteness of human life, as McCabe suggests, one may live within the boundaries of the human game (e.g., by staying within the ‘outline’ of the negative precepts of the Decalogue), and still not do very well as a human being. One needs parents, teachers, and friends to come to excellence. But what one then does excellently cannot be foretold in its particularity. For it is possible to declare, truthfully, that one has not committed adultery, murder, thievery, or false witness, within a given period of time. Yet it is never possible to declare, truthfully, that one has accomplished the task of loving one’s neighbour as oneself. At best, one can point to acts of love, of friendship put into play in thoughtful, even breath-taking, ways. But given the open-endedness of love, one can never say one has achieved satisfaction. One may say, ‘I have loved, but I could have loved more’. One must say, ‘I have more to do’.</p>
<p>Excellent human beings show us ways we can live in friendship with others, the shared life God has created us for, actualised in his Son, and given us as an eschatological promise in the Spirit. They are authorities in this matter: we can trust what we see in them. They may, also, become arbiters of boundary conditions or coaches; that is, they may exercise epistemic or social authority. But it is as personal authorities that they exercise a teleological function, not to show us what we must do in particular, but what it is possible for human beings to do.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the personal authority on the concreteness of human being is a saint, and that we might be able to interpret the varieties of sainthood as (admittedly quite diverse) exemplifications of living in friendship with other human beings. Since sin manifests itself in isolation and division, successful human living is such as to overcome isolation and division. How we do this cannot be prescribed from the outside in, but must be discerned by the well-trained human heart from within each given situation. A successful, exemplary, authoritative human being commands our awe and attention, and may draw forth from us a desire to do likewise. We might ask, not ‘What would Beckham do?’ but ‘What would Teresa or [insert your favorite saint] do?’ But the authoritative player of the human game does not personally command us. We are not told we must act as he or she does. This authority does not lay down the rules for us, does not apply the rules to us, nor does she command us as a coach would command. Her example presents us with a gift realised of the Holy Spirit, God’s own future (as Robert Jenson has it<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946811428266">15</xref></sup>), who may through her inspire us to new expressions of <italic>koinonia</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946811428266">
<title>A Disanalogy: The Scope of Excellence</title>
<p>Sport is not a perfect abstraction from concrete human life. I noted above the ambiguous relation of some sports to rule-breaking (although that has also been debated in Christian ethics<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946811428266">16</xref></sup>). Another disanalogy is the scope of ethics. In sport, we do not expect every human being to be excellent. Indeed, given our human bodily constitution, merely a few individuals can attain the personal authority of an athlete. (Similarly, only a few can have the skills of epistemic and social authority in sport, although the possibilities are wider.) Such a limitation will be true, <italic>mutatis mutandis</italic>, of any abstraction from the concreteness of human life—say, in performing arts or commerce or any other activity in which some but not all human beings participate. Not all can play; of those who can, only a few can achieve authoritative excellence.</p>
<p>But the matter is different which we consider human life in its concreteness. For here the point of activity is the universal common life of <italic>koinonia</italic>, foreshadowed in the Eucharistic fellowship and of which the church is a sacrament. Under conditions of sin, only a few human beings arise as saints, notable examples of how to love one another. But sin is not to be a permanent condition. Human excellence as exemplified in the practices of divine friendship has a scope ever-expanding—indeed, universal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946811428266">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>These characteristics of a coach’s social authority apply to society broadly, according to the mid-twentieth-century Thomist philosopher Yves Simon. An authority, Simon says, accomplishes two necessary tasks: she determines the means to achieve the common good, and she takes on the task of bringing about the common good materially, which allows other participants in the society to focus subsidiarily on other goods (while acceding to authority’s determination of what’s necessary for the common good).

<p>It might be objected that golf is an individual rather than a team sport. But individual competitive sports still have team considerations. The field is important: each golfer wants those he plays with to be worthy opponents; the organisers of tournaments have social authority that they use responsibly to elicit a field of excellent players; and so forth. Golfers are individuals who arise out of societies—as all athletes do.</p></fn>

<p>I have argued elsewhere that all authority is necessarily personal, in that authority is essentially performative, existing only in its exercise. Thus epistemic and social authorities are necessarily persons. Here, my use of ‘personal’ refers only to such authority as is held by persons who arise within the context of other authorities (epistemic and social), who then perform in ways that surpass rules and directions. Personal authorities, in this sense, embody the society and its understandings that have made them possible while at the same time going further with some unexpected novelty in their performance.</p></fn>
