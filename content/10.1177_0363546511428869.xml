<abstract>
<p>Elbow injury is encountered less frequently than are other joint conditions. The bony architecture, muscle, ligament, and nerve anatomy are complex, and the forces leading to injury in the athlete’s elbow are unique. Appreciating the pathomechanics leading to injury and a detailed knowledge of elbow anatomy are the foundation for conducting a directed history and physical examination that achieves an accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in physical examination have improved our ability to accurately diagnose and treat athletic elbow disorders. This article reviews general and focused physical examination maneuvers of the elbow in a systematic anatomic fashion.</p>

<title>Functional Anatomy</title>
<p>The elbow is a complex modified hinge joint consisting of 3 individual articulations: the ulnohumeral, radiocapitellar, and proximal radioulnar joints. These congruent bony articulations function in concert with ligamentous attachments and surrounding musculature to provide static and dynamic stability to the elbow and to allow motion in flexion-extension and pronation-supination.</p>
<p>The joint capsule circumferentially encloses all 3 elbow articulations and offers additional stability, mostly in extension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511428869">24</xref></sup> The 2 main ligamentous complexes are essential to elbow stability: the medial collateral ligament (MCL) complex and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511428869">Figure 1</xref>). The MCL consists of the anterior bundle, the posterior bundle, and the transverse bundle. The LCL consists of the radial collateral ligament, the lateral ulnar collateral ligament, the annular ligament, and the accessory LCL. The 4 main muscle groups are also critical to stability: the elbow flexors, the elbow extensors, the wrist extensor-supinators, and the wrist flexor-pronators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511428869">33</xref></sup></p>

<p>Knowledge of nerve anatomy and function is essential. The ulnar nerve passes through the intermuscular septum at midarm and descends under the arcade of Struthers (if present), approximately 8 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle. The nerve enters the cubital tunnel passing posterior to the medial epicondyle, bordered by portions of the MCL and capsule as the floor and the arcuate ligament as the roof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511428869">Figure 2</xref>). It then enters the anterior compartment by passing between the 2 heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris.</p>

</fig>
<p>The median nerve courses anterior to the elbow, medial and parallel to the brachial artery, beneath the bicipital aponeurosis, and over the brachialis to dive between the 2 heads (humeral and ulnar) of the pronator teres muscle before passing under the fibrous arch of the flexor digitorum profundus. It gives off the anterior interosseous nerve approximately 2 to 5 cm distal to the medial epicondyle and travels along the interosseous membrane.</p>
<p>The radial nerve emerges from the spiral groove between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps to pierce the lateral intermuscular septum 8 to 12 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle. It passes between and innervates the brachialis and brachioradialis and enters the radial tunnel just proximal to the capitellum. The radial nerve continues as the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) in the radial tunnel after a superficial sensory nerve branches off. The PIN is deep and splits the heads of the supinator through the arcade of Frohse.</p>

<sec id="section2-0363546511428869">
<title>Relevant Biomechanics</title>
<p>Throwing imposes extremely high valgus stresses across the elbow during the late cocking and acceleration phases of the overhead throwing motion approaching 60 to 65 N·m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428869">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511428869">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546511428869">41</xref></sup> Valgus stability is provided by the osseous anatomy of the olecranon and humerus, dynamic muscle forces, and the MCL complex. The interlocking bony anatomy of the olecranon with the olecranon fossa provides stability at less than 20° of extension and greater than 120° of flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511428869">26</xref></sup> Within the functional arc of throwing, from 20° to 120°, ligamentous restraints provide the majority of elbow stablility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428869">8</xref></sup> The majority of stress is placed on the anterior bundle of the MCL complex, which is the primary restraint to valgus forces. Throwing load can exceed the tensile failure capacity of the MCL complex, which has been shown to be 33 N·m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428869">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546511428869">41</xref></sup> The flexor carpi ulnaris has also been shown to perform as a primary dynamic stabilizer, whereas the flexor digitorum superficialis functions as a secondary dynamic stabilizer in the cadaveric model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511428869">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overall valgus stress to the elbow generates tensile loads on the medial aspect of the elbow and compressive loads on the lateral and posterior aspects of the elbow. With overhead throwing motion or axial load in weightbearing sports, the lateral elbow and radiocapitellar joint absorb much of the axial and shear stress. These forces combine to produce injury to the MCL complex, tendinopathy of the flexor-pronator musculature, traction neuropathy of the ulnar nerve, and lateral compression and shear injuries, such as capitellar osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) and radiocapitellar arthropathy. Posteriorly, the olecranon can impact the posteromedial humerus, causing a constellation of injuries collectively known as valgus extension overload (VEO) syndrome including posteromedial impingement, inflammation, chondromalacia and loose bodies, osteophyte formation at the fossa or olecranon tip, and olecranon stress fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428869">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511428869">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428869">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511428869">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Varus stability of the elbow is provided primarily by the LCL complex, and damage to this complex causes a predictable pattern of injury. Posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) is a spectrum of injury due to sequential failure of the soft tissues of the lateral to medial elbow caused by a supination, axial compression, and valgus moment; PLRI can also result from iatrogenic injury to the LCL complex during open or arthroscopic surgery for lateral epicondylitis or from the Kocher approach to the elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511428869">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511428869">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511428869">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Microtrauma and inflammation may occur with repetitive gripping in sports such as tennis, archery, or driving. Shear stresses from wrist extension at the deeper attachment of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) on the lateral epicondyle are responsible for lateral epicondylitis or “tennis elbow.” Shear stresses from the medial flexor-pronator mass are distributed more generally to their attachment at the medial epicondyle, causing medial epicondylitis or “golfer’s elbow.” Repetitive traction stress can contribute to triceps tendinitis, olecranon traction spurs, stress fractures, or apophysitis in younger athletes.</p>
<p>The biceps and triceps tendons are vulnerable to both partial and complete rupture, particularly with forceful eccentric contraction. Tendon injury due to this type of loading occurs with a higher frequency in muscles that cross 2 joints. These muscles and their tendinous attachments are prone to varying degrees of injury and failure when subjected to high-stress eccentric loading, as they are rarely used in their full physiologic capacity and therefore fail at excessive loads outside of their usual range of function.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546511428869">
<title>History</title>
<p>Evaluation of elbow pain in an athlete begins with a thorough history, including sport or vocation, hand dominance, location and severity of pain, onset, duration, effect on performance, and associated symptoms. An athlete’s description of grip, swing, throwing phase, or motion leading to or aggravating symptoms is important. Recent changes or modifications to mechanics or in equipment should also be determined. Pathomechanics and stress to the elbow vary depending on sport, and certain diagnoses are more common, such as MCL injury in overhead throwing sports or lateral epicondylitis in racket sports.</p>
<p>Any prior surgical history is extremely important in determining possible iatrogenic or resultant injury to the elbow, as well as for any future surgical planning. Nerve injury after elbow arthroscopy or previous ulnar nerve transposition is essential knowledge for examination and future procedures. Prior ulnar nerve transposition may preclude creation of a medial portal in future elbow arthroscopy or careful anterior capsulectomy to avoid iatrogenic injury. Medial or lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve injuries may be due to prior procedures such as MCL reconstruction or a single-incision distal biceps repair, respectively.</p>
<p>Exact localization of symptoms such as pain can be very suggestive of specific injuries, whereas poorly localized, vague pain may represent neurological or vascular origins. Anterior elbow pain with traumatic onset and sensation of a pop are suggestive of an acute distal biceps rupture. Insidious onset of anterior elbow pain with flexion or supination activities may indicate a partial biceps tear.</p>
<p>Medial elbow symptoms are often associated with MCL injury, flexor pronator injury, cubital tunnel syndrome, stress injury to medial epicondyle or sublime tubercle, or posteromedial impingement. Overhead athletes are particularly vulnerable to medial injury. Medial pain that occurs during the late cocking or early acceleration phase of throwing is often the primary symptom in MCL injuries, whereas pain that occurs during follow-through can be associated with VEO syndrome. Athletes with MCL injuries also report loss of velocity, accuracy, or throwing stamina. Symptoms of concurrent ulnar nerve irritation are common, as the nerve is subject to both static and dynamic compression and traction with the throwing motion. Symptoms include tingling along the ulnar forearm, hand, and ring and small fingers during activity, advancing to paresthesias, weakness, or atrophy as insult to the ulnar nerve progresses. Athletes may also experience symptoms of median nerve compression in the painful pronator syndrome or anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, a purely motor disturbance. Stress fractures may occur at the bone tunnels created from prior MCL reconstruction and present with medial pain.</p>
<p>Lateral elbow symptoms are often related to radial head or capitellum injuries, plica injuries, PLRI, or radial tunnel syndrome. History of surgery to the lateral side may be a source of iatrogenic injury to the LCL. History of landing on an outstretched hand with immediate lateral elbow pain may indicate traumatic LCL injury. Clicking or locking can alert the examiner to possible loose bodies, chondral injury, osteophytes, plicae, or instability episodes. Radial tunnel syndrome is also a cause of persistent lateral elbow pain without motor deficit, whereas PIN syndrome results in weakness greater than pain.</p>
<p>Posterior elbow symptoms can result from triceps tendinitis or rupture, posterior impingement, and olecranon stress fracture. Acute pain with eccentric extension and extension weakness suggests a triceps injury. Insidious posterior pain with extension activities may indicate triceps tendinitis. Posterior pain that occurs with the elbow approaching terminal extension such as in the follow-through of pitching is common in olecranon stress fractures and posterior impingement. Loss of extension and relation to pain should be noted.</p>

<sec id="section4-0363546511428869">
<title>Physical Examination</title>
<p>Preliminary examination includes an examination of the cervical spine and entire affected upper extremity. The examiner should observe posture, any asymmetry, atrophy, edema, ecchymosis, or other deformities. Assessment of the cervical spine should include palpation, range of motion, and basic provocative testing, such as the Spurling test to evaluate for radiculopathy due to foraminal compression. The shoulder and scapulae should also be assessed, as an affected shoulder or dyskinetic scapula can lead to improper mechanics of the kinetic chain at the elbow. Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit can affect valgus stability of the elbow and, therefore, the MCL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428869">13</xref></sup> Shoulder palpation, range of motion, strength, and stability testing should be performed.</p>
<sec id="section5-0363546511428869">
<title>Inspection</title>
<p>It is essential to examine the affected and the unaffected extremity for comparison. The normal carrying angle is approximately 11° to 14° of valgus in adult men and 13° to 16° in adult women. A flexion contracture may make correct assessment of carrying angle difficult. Variations in carrying angle may be due to previous trauma, developmental abnormality, injury, or adaptive changes. In the immature athlete, repetitive overhead throwing with increased valgus stresses can cause medial epicondylar hypertrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428869">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511428869">19</xref></sup> In professional throwers, valgus angles greater than 15° are common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511428869">21</xref></sup> Ecchymosis and swelling may be localized to an area of acute injury. Fullness to palpation at the anconeus soft spot (triangular area between the radial head, olecranon tip, and lateral epicondyle) indicates a joint effusion or hemarthrosis related to synovitis, infection, fracture, or intra-articular injury. Differences seen in muscle mass may be due to injury or to hypertrophy in the dominant arm of an athlete. Changes in muscle contour may be seen with complete biceps or triceps rupture, and ecchymosis can indicate chronicity of the injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546511428869">
<title>Range of Motion</title>
<p>Active and passive range of motion should be assessed. Normal range of motion is approximately 0° of extension and 140° of flexion. Hyperextension is defined as extension beyond 0° of extension. Functional range of motion for most activities of daily living is 30° to 130°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511428869">25</xref></sup> Supination and pronation motion is approximately 80° in both directions. To determine pathologic differences, range of motion should always be compared with that in the contralateral side.</p>
<p>Hyperextension of 0° to 15° may be due to ligamentous laxity. Pain with hyperextension may be due to overload or posterior impingement at the olecranon and olecranon fossa, often seen in throwers and gymnasts. Full extension is often the first motion lost after injury and may signal intra-articular injury, although throwing athletes may present with flexion contractures of up to 20°, which may be developmental or pathologic if symptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428869">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Painful loss of motion may be due to soft tissue swelling, effusion, or bony impingement. Crepitus, locking, catching, or other mechanical symptoms may indicate loose bodies or chondral injury. Firm, mechanical blocks to range of motion may indicate osteophyte formation in the anterior coronoid fossa with flexion, in the posterior coronoid fossa, or on the olecranon with extension. Soft end points may be the result of capsular contractures, effusions, or soft tissue swelling. Pain that is elicited at the end points of motion is due to osteophytes and impingement, whereas pain during the midarc of motion is often due to osteochondral lesions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546511428869">
<title>Palpation and Examination Maneuvers</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546511428869">
<title>Anterior</title>
<p>Anteriorly, the pronator teres, lacertus fibrosus, brachialis and brachioradialis, and the distal biceps tendon can be palpated within the antecubital fossa. A visible defect, change in muscle contour, or proximal retraction of the muscle belly indicates a distal biceps rupture, accompanied by weakness and pain in supination and, to a lesser degree, flexion. Ecchymosis related to an acute injury such as a distal biceps rupture may not be present initially but often develops several days later. In the case of a partial biceps rupture, ecchymosis may not appear, as the hematoma is confined by the intact lacertus fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428869">7</xref></sup> Direct palpation of the antecubital fossa for integrity of the distal biceps can be misleading, as the lacertus fibrosis may still be intact medially or the brachialis can be mistaken as an intact biceps. The hook test is sensitive and specific for distal biceps ruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428869">31</xref></sup> The patient abducts the shoulder, flexes the elbow to 90°, and actively fully supinates the forearm while the examiner attempts to hook his or her index finger laterally under the tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511428869">Figure 3</xref>). The test has a negative result if the finger can be inserted 1 cm beneath the tendon and positive result if no cordlike structure can be hooked. In 45 patients, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were all 100%, including a negative test result for partial tendon ruptures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511428869">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The biceps squeeze test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511428869">34</xref></sup> is similar to the Thompson test for Achilles tendon ruptures. The examiner squeezes the biceps brachii muscle belly with the elbow flexed to 60° to 80°. A lack of forearm supination is considered a positive test result, indicating rupture of the biceps tendon or muscle belly.</p>
<p>Partial biceps tendon ruptures or tendinitis may exhibit tenderness of the distal biceps tendon and pain on resisted supination with a negative hook test result. Often, resisted elbow flexion with the elbow at maximal extension will elicit pain at the biceps insertion. Clicking with forearm rotation near the insertion of the tendon may be due to an inflamed radial bursa located between the distal biceps tendon and radial tuberosity and may be associated with impending rupture.</p>
<p>Palpation of the anteromedial humerus may elicit tenderness and pain in the setting of humeral periostitis (humeral shin splints) or humeral stress fracture. Stress at the humeral periosteal insertion of the pectoralis major may be seen in gymnasts or weight lifters and may be seen bilaterally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428869">10</xref></sup> Stress fractures can occur in overhead throwing athletes, such as baseball pitchers or javelin throwers.</p>
<p>If an MCL reconstruction is anticipated, the presence of the palmaris longus is assessed. Schaeffer test is performed by having the patient flex the wrist while opposing the thumb and small finger. If present, the palmaris should be easily visible and palpable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511428869">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Athletes involved in sports with forearm rotation and elbow extension, such as pitching, rowing, racket sports, or weight lifting, may be vulnerable to pronator syndrome. Pronator syndrome is a median nerve compression, with vague aching or pain in the volar forearm, often aggravated with grasping and pronation and accompanied by tenderness over the pronator mass. Paresthesias in the median nerve distribution may occur. The median nerve may be compressed under the ligament of Struthers, at the lacertus fibrosis, or most commonly between the heads of the pronator teres. The nerve may also be compressed by the flexor digitorum superficialis with gripping or muscular hypertrophy and tested by pain with resisted long finger flexion while the others are held in hyperextension. Conversely, anterior interosseous nerve syndrome is purely motor, affecting the radial-sided flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus but may be accompanied by vague proximal forearm discomfort.

<title>Medial</title>
<p>The flexor-pronator mass originates from the medial epicondyle, but tenderness is most often elicited anterior and distal to the epicondyle at the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis with resisted wrist flexion, radial deviation, and forearm pronation in medial epicondylitis. The MCL is palpated with the elbow in 50° to 70° of flexion to move the overlying medial muscles anterior to the MCL. The MCL should be palpated from its origin on the inferior aspect of the medial epicondyle moving distally to the sublime tubercle of the proximal ulna. Pain along the ligament can indicate a range of ligament disorders, from attenuation to complete rupture. If the athlete has had a prior MCL reconstruction, special attention should be given to palpation of the sublime tubercle and medial epicondyle, as stress fractures at the bone tunnels after reconstruction are possible (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511428869">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Directed testing to examine the integrity of the MCL includes the valgus stress test, milking maneuver, and the moving valgus stress test. The classic valgus stress test is performed by stabilizing the humerus at 30° of elbow flexion to unlock the bony restraint of the olecranon from the fossa and applying a valgus stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511428869">27</xref></sup> The test has a positive result if the medial joint space opens and the patient reports pain. Pseudovalgus instability, subtle posterolateral instability that can be present when the forearm is supinated, is eliminated as a confounding factor of possible medial laxity when the forearm is pronated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511428869">30</xref></sup> Therefore, valgus instability is tested by placing a valgus stress on the elbow with the humerus stabilized and the forearm in a pronated position at 20° to 30° of flexion.</p>
<p>The milking maneuver involves the athlete stressing his or her own elbow by flexing the elbow to 90°, grabbing the affected thumb with the opposite hand passed under the affected arm, and pulling to stress the medial elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511428869">39</xref></sup> Again, it is important to examine the contralateral extremity for comparison, keeping in mind that athletes may demonstrate more laxity in their throwing elbows at baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511428869">14</xref></sup> The moving valgus stress test is perhaps the most sensitive and specific for MCL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511428869">35</xref></sup> This test takes into account shoulder position, is similar to the position of throwing, and can account for eliminating bony stability structures at greater than 120° of flexion. The shoulder is placed in abduction and external rotation while the examiner holds the thumb with one hand and supports the elbow with the other. The elbow is gently flexed and extended while applying a valgus stress. A positive test result will elicit pain from the athlete at the arc of motion between 80° and 120°<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511428869">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511428869">Figure 5</xref>). The examiner can simultaneously palpate the MCL for tenderness and localize the discomfort elicited from the valgus stress. Pain present in positions near full extension with the moving valgus stress test may signal chondral damage at the posteromedial trochlea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511428869">29</xref></sup></p>

<p>Moving valgus stress test for medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury. With the shoulder abducted and externally rotated, the examiner grasps the thumb to move the elbow from extension to flexion while exerting a valgus stress on the elbow, using the opposite hand to support the elbow and palpate the MCL. Pain in the shear range of 80° to 120° is a positive test result.</p>

</fig>
<p>The flexor-pronator mass should also be evaluated for injury, as these can occur in isolation or in concurrence with an MCL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428869">12</xref></sup> Tenderness at the medial epicondyle that increases with resisted wrist flexion signals flexor-pronator injury; MCL injury can be differentiated from medial epicondylitis by the valgus stress test performed with the wrist in passive flexion and pronation to relax the flexor-pronator mass. Continued medial pain more likely indicates an MCL injury. The medial tennis elbow shear test elicits pain with the elbow flexed, forearm pronated, and wrist flexed as the fist is extended, mimicking a punch to test for medial epicondylitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511428869">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Importantly, the ulnar nerve should be evaluated at the medial elbow. Ulnar neuropathy may be due to traction injury, such as with dynamic pitching or static growth disturbance, anatomic changes, nerve subluxation, or compression at the cubital tunnel. Percussion along the nerve may elicit a Tinel sign. A positive elbow flexion compression test result may elicit tingling radiating toward the small finger or pain at the elbow or medial forearm when manual pressure is directly applied over the ulnar nerve between the posteromedial olecranon and the medial humeral epicondyle as the elbow is maximally flexed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428869">28</xref></sup> A Froment sign, hyperflexion of the thumb interphalangeal joint when attempting key pinch as the flexor pollicis longus is used in place of a paralyzed adductor pollicis, or Wartenberg sign, the inability to adduct the small finger due to unopposed ulnar insertion of the extensor digiti quinti, can signal more advanced ulnar neuropathy. Atrophy of the interossei or hypothenar eminence can be difficult to observe in well-developed athletes. Clumsiness or loss of fine dexterity may occur. Inspection and palpation of the nerve should be performed along its course at the cubital tunnel to determine its location and stability. Ulnar nerve hypermobility has been identified in 37% of elbows and can be determined by having the patient actively flex the elbow with the forearm in supination, then placing a finger at the posteromedial aspect of the medial humeral epicondyle and having the patient actively extend the elbow. The nerve is noted to dislocate if trapped anterior to the examiner’s finger, to be perched if beneath the finger, or to be stable if not palpable in the groove.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428869">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distal band of the medial triceps tendon may also subluxate over the medial epicondyle with elbow flexion and is called “snapping triceps syndrome,” causing pain or ulnar nerve symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511428869">37</xref></sup> Tenderness can be elicited along the medical triceps muscle. By placing a finger firmly over the medial epicondyle, bringing the elbow from extension to flexion may produce subluxation of the ulnar nerve first and then the medial triceps in 2 separate “snaps.” Resisted extension with the elbow fully flexed may also elicit a snapping sensation from the medial triceps subluxating before reaching 90°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511428869">37</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546511428869">
<title>Lateral</title>
<p>Palpation of the lateral epicondyle, the radial head, and the olecranon tip assists in defining underlying anatomy. The anconeus “soft spot” located between these 3 bony landmarks should be palpated for fullness, indicating a joint effusion, hemarthrosis, or even a subluxated or dislocated radial head. The radiocapitellar joint can be easily palpated. There may be tenderness and associated clicking over the radial head with rotation seen in fractures, arthrosis, a symptomatic posterolateral synovial plica, or radial bursa. Tenderness with crepitus that can be exacerbated with forceful flexion and extension may indicate radiocapitellar overload or loose bodies. Pain can be reproduced with the plica impingement test performed with a valgus load on the elbow and passive flexion with the forearm in pronation. This is to elicit symptoms for an anterior radiocapitellar plica, whereas the posterior plica can be examined by the extension-supination maneuver, bringing the elbow to full extension while applying a valgus stress with the forearm in supination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428869">6</xref></sup> A palpable painful snap over the radiocapitellar joint is a positive test result (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511428869">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Examination for capitellar OCD demonstrates tenderness over the radiocapitellar joint and commonly loss of 15° to 20° of extension. The active radiocapitellar compression test is positive for OCD lesions and elicits pain in the lateral compartment of the elbow when the patient pronates and supinates the forearm with the elbow axially loaded in extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511428869">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546511428869">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Palpation eliciting tenderness directly over the lateral epicondyle can be due to trauma or LCL injury. Tenderness due to lateral epicondylitis is just anterior and distal to the epicondyle, at the origin of the ECRB, although the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), and extensor carpi ulnaris may be involved. Tenderness slightly more anterior to the lateral epicondyle at the epicondylar ridge may signal ECRL tendinosis at its origin, whereas the EDC originates slightly posterior to the lateral epicondyle. This pain is also reproducible with maximum passive wrist flexion, gripping, and resisted wrist extension with the elbow extended. Pain with resisted middle finger extension relates to ECRB tendinosis, whereas pain with resisted index finger extension can relate to ECRL tendinosis.</p>
<p>Radial tunnel syndrome is characterized by deep pain and aching, with tenderness to palpation centrally at midforearm, distal to the area typical of lateral epicondylitis. Repeated stressful pronation and supination cause intermittent or dynamic compression on the nerve and put certain athletes, such as swimmers and tennis players, at risk. The PIN, which is not directly palpable, is commonly irritated or compressed at the arcade of Frohse, which is the palpable leading edge of the supinator approximately 2 cm anterior and 3 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle, just distal to the radial head. Radial tunnel syndrome may be difficult to discern from lateral epicondylitis and may be simultaneous up to 5% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511428869">17</xref></sup> Pain with resisted supination can demonstrate nerve entrapment at the supinator. In differentiation, PIN syndrome is a pure motor deficit without pain. The attitude of the hand and wrist shows ulnar deviation as the extensor carpi ulnaris is affected, but the more proximal ECRL is not, with loss of extension of the digits with the EDC affected.</p>
<p>Focused tests for PLRI are often challenging to perform, and true instability may be difficult to elicit in the awake patient. The posterolateral rotary apprehension test is also called the lateral pivot-shift test. The patient lays supine with the arm overhead. A valgus stress and axial load are applied by the examiner with the forearm supinated while the elbow is brought from extension to flexion. The radial head may be prominent, and a dimple may be observed at the radiocapitellar joint while in extension. As the elbow is gently flexed, the radial head may reduce with a clunk, often at greater than 40° of flexion, or when awake, the patient feels apprehensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546511428869">Figure 7</xref>). The posterolateral rotary drawer test is also performed with the patient in supine position. The arm is overhead and the examiner stabilizes the humerus while translating the forearm posterolaterally at 40° to 90° of elbow flexion, similar to a Lachman test of the knee. The test has a positive result if instability allows the ulna to translate and the radial head to subluxate or dislocate due to pivoting around an often intact MCL.</p>

<p>The push-up test and stand-up test can be performed by the patient. In the push-up test, the patient attempts a push-up in prone position with the forearms maximally supinated and repeats a push-up with the forearms maximally pronated. If symptoms occur with the forearms supinated but not pronated, the test has a positive result. In the stand-up test, the patient attempts to stand up from a seated chair using his or her arms to push against the chair with forearms maximally supinated. A positive test result will reproduce the patient’s symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546511428869">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Posterior</title>
<p>Posteriorly, palpation is focused on the triceps tendon and olecranon tip. Posteromedial olecranon tenderness may indicate posteromedial impingement, VEO, and associated osteophyte formation. Posterolateral or posteromedial tenderness may indicate an olecranon stress fracture or olecranon apophysitis in the young athlete. Tenderness over the tip with warmth, fluctuance, or distension may be due to olecranon bursitis or gout. At about 30°, the triceps muscle is relaxed and the olecranon tip more easily palpable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511428869">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Triceps tendon injuries are rare. Ruptures most often occur at the origin of the lateral head of the triceps. As the initial swelling and ecchymosis subside, a palpable gap is pathognomonic for rupture. A triceps squeeze test, similar to the biceps squeeze test, has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511428869">40</xref></sup> Extensor weakness can often be observed, but extension may still be possible due to the anconeus triceps expansion with the aid of gravity. By placing the elbow overhead, the athlete must extend the elbow against gravity and will exhibit weakness against resistance.</p>
<p>Specific examination of the posterior elbow should be performed if concern of injury is directed posteriorly or medially in an athlete, as MCL injuries and VEO syndrome are often associated. Loss of full extension or symptoms may be attributed to osteophytes, or fractured and nonunited fragments, in the olecranon fossa or at the olecranon tip. The extension impingement test places a continuous valgus stress on the elbow while quickly extending from 20° to 30° of flexion to terminal flexion repeatedly. The test is then repeated without valgus, and the posteromedial olecranon is palpated for tenderness to differentiate impingement due to instability versus pain over the medial olecranon without instability. Frank crepitus may also be present with extension testing due to loose bodies or synovial reaction over osteophytes.</p>
<p>The arm bar test is extremely sensitive and has the patient’s hand on the shoulder of the examiner with the elbow extended and shoulder internally rotated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511428869">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0363546511428869">Figure 9</xref>). The examiner then pulls down on the olecranon to simulate forced extension and reproduces the pain associated with posteromedial impingement. There may also be tenderness at the posteromedial olecranon tip. It is important to note that overhead athletes may have mild loss of extension as compared with their nondominant elbows. In addition to overhead athletes with repetitive extension, gymnasts and wrestlers are also vulnerable to olecranon stress fractures because of their weightbearing sports and sudden extension forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511428869">23</xref></sup> Pain is often noted more distal and lateral on the olecranon with stress fractures, but tenderness may be palpable medially and posteromedially, as impaction of the medial olecranon onto the medial fossa occurs because of the valgus load during the overhead throwing motion. Suzuki et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511428869">38</xref></sup> described tenderness that may be present over the MCL and olecranon as MCL insufficiency contributes to oblique olecranon stress fractures, whereas triceps traction and extension forces contribute to transverse-type olecranon stress fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428869">2</xref></sup> The extension impingement test and arm bar tests usually have positive results if a stress fracture is present. Testing can also carefully elicit an increase in pain with increasing resistance to elbow extension due to traction from the triceps.</p>

<title>Pediatric/Adolescent Considerations</title>
<p>The young athlete’s immature elbow differs in open physes and pathoanatomy of injury. There is a greater degree of cartilaginous elasticity with less bony rigidity for stability through congruency or interlocking of the olecranon or coronoid. These, in addition to increased laxity, allow hyperextension of the elbow from 10° to 15° in children. Dislocation therefore occurs more frequently without a fracture. Hyperextension also contributes to increased load laterally and stretching of the medial capsule and MCL. Repetitive stress, such as in throwing, can lead to OCD of the radial head or capitellum laterally or apophysitis medially.</p>
<p>Medial epicondylar apophysitis is more common than are MCL injuries in children because of the open physis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428869">11</xref></sup> There is often tenderness over the medial epicondylar apophysis, swelling, and possibly a flexion contracture on examination. Medial collateral ligament injuries are uncommon but may occur and are usually acute in adolescents. Physical examination is the same as in adults.</p>
<p>Panner disease, an osteochondrosis of the capitellum, is often seen in younger children and may cause pain, stiffness, and poorly localized tenderness over the lateral elbow on examination; OCD is more often seen in adolescents and presents with pain and stiffness, which may be accompanied by locking or catching sensations due to loose bodies. On examination, there is lateral elbow tenderness globally over the radiocapitellar area with loss of range of motion, usually more in extension, and a positive radiocapitellar compression test result.</p>
<p>Posteriorly, olecranon apophysitis occurs with repetitive traction stress, whereas stress fractures of the olecranon apophysis are more common in adolescents with closed physes. Examination may reveal tenderness over the olecranon and pain with resisted extension or forced extension. As a young athlete reaches skeletal maturity, posteromedial impingement may develop due to VEO syndrome. Examination is similar to that in adults, with pain on terminal extension and a positive VEO test and arm bar test result.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A thorough understanding of elbow anatomy, biomechanics, and pathology can assist in performing a focused physical examination to determine an accurate diagnosis. Knowledge of specific tests and implications of a particular sport or athlete’s skeletal maturity are important. Correct assessment of elbow injury and appropriate treatment will help return an athlete to play most effectively.</p>
