<abstract>
<p>The authors assessed the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination to develop an evidence-based national immunization program in Korea. A Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and clinical outcomes of vaccination versus no vaccination. The birth cohort of 493189 infants in 2007 was followed until the age of 5 years. Korea-specific data for epidemiological characteristics and economic burden of rotavirus diarrhea were used for the modeled estimation. Efficacy of RotaTeq® was based on a recent clinical trial. Rotavirus vaccination would prevent 181238 symptomatic cases (reduction rate = 63.2%) over 5 years after birth. From the societal perspective, at a vaccination cost of 100000 Korean won (KW; 1 US$ ≈ 1200 KW) per dose, universal vaccination would cost 375 620 KW per case averted. The breakeven price of vaccine was 56061 KW. Rotavirus vaccination would reduce the burden of the disease substantially and be a cost-effective strategy to prevent rotavirus diarrhea in Korea.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute diarrhea or gastroenteritis among young children worldwide. In the first 5 years of life, about 90% of children experience at least 1 episode of rotavirus infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511416806">1</xref></sup> Each year, rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for 440 000 deaths, about 2 million hospitalizations, and 25 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511416806">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511416806">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite substantial improvements in sanitation and hygiene worldwide, the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis has not decreased markedly during the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511416806">2</xref></sup> Also, the proportion of rotavirus gastroenteritis among diarrhea illness of infants and young children requiring hospitalization in developed countries is not different from that in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511416806">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511416806">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511416806">5</xref></sup> These facts suggest that immunization may be the most promising preventive strategy.</p>
<p>In Korea, rotavirus gastroenteritis rarely causes mortality, but it causes significant morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511416806">6</xref></sup> A recent population-based study in Korea has estimated that the annual incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis accounts for 56.9 cases per 1000 children less than 5 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416806">7</xref></sup> The decision to adopt rotavirus vaccines as a part of a national immunization program in a geographic region would be primarily influenced by the burden of the disease and the expected health benefits of the vaccine. Also, the potential economic benefit by avoiding health care and societal costs resulting from vaccination could be a critical consideration. Although the economic impact of rotavirus diseases and vaccination has been examined in several countries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416806">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416806"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511416806"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511416806"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511416806"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511416806">13</xref></sup> there has been no research done to assess the impact of a national rotavirus immunization program in Korea. It is expected that systematic appraisal on the national burden of rotavirus infection and potential public health and economic benefits of rotavirus vaccination for children in Korea will assist health policy makers to set a priority for the prevention of this disease. Thus, this study was conducted to estimate the economic impact of universal vaccination with rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq®; Merck, West Point, PA) administered orally in 3 doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age for preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis among Korean children younger than 5 years of age from the perspectives of health care system and society and thereby to assist in developing an evidence-based national immunization program in Korea.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539511416806">
<title>Decision Analytic Model</title>
<p>A decision analytic model incorporating Markov cohort simulation was used to project the expected clinical and economic burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis and to estimate the economic impact of routine childhood rotavirus vaccination for the 2007 birth cohort of 493 189 Korean infants. The analysis follows a single infant cohort from birth to 5 years of age, a period during which most cases of rotavirus diarrhea occur and vaccine would be protective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511416806">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511416806">14</xref></sup> Outcomes and costs for each health intervention strategy (ie, no vaccination or vaccination) were evaluated on each Markov cycle over 5 years. In each cycle, the model projects the expected numbers of rotavirus events based on the number of at-risk children and age-specific risks of rotavirus events as well as vaccine coverage and effectiveness. For each strategy considered, the model yields expected total numbers of symptomatic rotavirus gastroenteritis (ie, of any severity), rotavirus events requiring medical care (including hospital admissions, emergency department [ED] visits, and outpatient visits), and expected total costs. Then, the impact of adding rotavirus vaccine to routine infant immunizations was quantified as the cost per case avoided and the cost per hospitalization avoided from the health care system and societal perspectives. While the health care system perspective only takes direct medical care costs into account, the societal perspective includes direct medical care costs as well as nonmedical care costs (eg, travel to and from health care facilities) and indirect costs such as parental work loss to care for children when they are sick.</p>
<p>The model is defined with 6 mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive health states: “Never experienced rotavirus,” “1st rotavirus episode,” “Without rotavirus (1 prior episode),” “2nd rotavirus episode,” “Without rotavirus (2 prior episodes),” and “Death” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539511416806">Figure 1</xref>). Within each health intervention strategy, all individuals began the simulation in the health state “Never experienced rotavirus” and moved among the 6 health states in Markov cycles for any specified time horizon from birth to the age of 5 years. Due to the lack of data on the incidence rate of asymptomatic rotavirus gastroenteritis, it was assumed that all the incidences were symptomatic. Because the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea varies depending on the age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416806">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416806">9</xref></sup> we used age-dependent cycle length, that is, monthly cycle from birth to 6 months and then quarterly from 7th month to 5 years. Using different lengths of cycle allowed age-dependent transition probabilities between health states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511416806">15</xref></sup> In this model, the probability of hospitalization and ED visits and the proportion of children experiencing primary infection of rotavirus diarrhea were age dependent.</p>

</fig>
<p>The subjects would enter the states of “1st rotavirus episode” or “2nd rotavirus episode” if they encountered rotavirus infections. Once children entered the rotavirus episode state, they were managed through hospitalization, emergency visits, or outpatient visits. Deaths related to rotavirus infections are not considered in the model because they are rare in Korea. But the model accounts for overall mortality including nonrotavirus disease, which serves as an absorbing state of the model. The model assumes that children may encounter up to 2 episodes of rotavirus gastroenteritis during the first 5 years of life.</p>
<p>The transition probabilities of the Markov model from one state to another are based on vaccine efficacy from the REST trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511416806">16</xref></sup> and underlying rotavirus epidemiology among Korean children retrieved from published data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416806">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511416806">18</xref></sup> The cost information to treat rotavirus gastroenteritis was obtained from a hospital cost survey of sampled Korean hospitals and the Korea National Health Insurance (NHI) claims data. The model assumes universal vaccination with a 100% coverage rate. Number of cases, health care utilization, and costs of rotavirus infection occurred in the future were discounted at 5% per year.</p>

<title>Baseline prevalence and health care utilization of rotavirus infection</title>
<p>Age-specific cumulative proportion of the birth cohort with primary infection of rotavirus gastroenteritis over the first 5 years of life was provided by a local epidemiologic study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416806">7</xref></sup> The total number of hospitalization per year in the nation due to rotavirus infection was estimated by multiplying the total number of hospital admissions with gastroenteritis or diarrhea by the percentage of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections. The total number of hospital admissions with gastroenteritis or diarrhea among children aged less than 5 years in 2007 was 114 530, which was derived from the NHI claims data and defined as the insurance claims of hospital admissions with diagnosis of gastroenteritis or diarrhea (International Classification of Diseases [ICD], 10th version: A00–A09). The percentage of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections among the hospital admissions with gastroenteritis or diarrhea, 26.14%, was obtained from the hospital cost survey.

Thus, we assumed that incremental administration costs (ie, charges for outpatient visits, transportation costs, and productivity loss costs of caregivers) did not occur. The results from earlier trials suggest that the safety of the rotavirus vaccine is equivalent to that of a placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511416806">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511416806">19</xref></sup> Therefore, costs associated with adverse events are not incorporated into the model. As a consequence, only vaccine acquisition cost was considered in calculating the cost of vaccine administration. We used the current market price of 300 000 Korean Won (KW; 1 US$ is approximately equal to 1200 KW) per completed course for a base case analysis.</p>
<p>The economic cost of rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as costs associated with medical encounters due to rotavirus diarrhea, such as hospitalization, nonemergent outpatient visits, and ED visits. For each type of encounter, costs were measured by direct medical and nonmedical costs and indirect costs. Major data sources for the cost of treating rotavirus diarrhea were hospital cost survey from the sampled hospitals and the NHI claims data.</p>
<p>Based on the retrospective medical record review, patient-specific information on medical costs and length of stay for hospitalization with rotavirus gastroenteritis was collected from sampled patients of selected study sites. We chose 3 general hospitals—Severance Hospital, Kangnam Severance Hospital, and Wonju Christian Hospital—all of which belong to the Yonsei University Health System. All children aged less than 5 years who were admitted to each of the 3 study hospitals between June 1, 2005, and July 31, 2008, with a diagnosis of rotavirus enteritis (ICD-10 code: A08.0) and a record of positive test results for rotavirus were included in the data collection. To exclude nosocomial cases that were initially hospitalized with other causes and got infected with rotavirus during hospitalization, we restricted the inclusion criteria to only cases that underwent laboratory tests to confirm rotavirus infection prior to the 3rd day of the admission. As a result, a total of 1456 hospital admissions attributable to rotavirus diarrhea were identified from the 3 study sites.</p>
<p>The average length of stay (LOS) per hospitalization was 5.33 days (standard deviation = 2.93). From the health care system perspective, the average cost per admission was 1 134 291 KW, composed of insurance-covered (724 840 KW) and noncovered medical costs (409 451 KW). From a societal perspective, the average cost per admission was estimated to be 1 478 682 KW, including medical costs (1 134 291 KW), transportation costs to travel to hospitals (34 528 KW), and caregiver’s productivity loss costs occurred during the hospital stay of their children (309 863 KW). Based on the assumption that at least 1 parent visits the hospital each day during the hospital stay, transportation cost was calculated by multiplying the average LOS by the average round-trip transportation cost (6483 KW).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511416806">20</xref></sup> Caregiver’s productivity loss cost was computed as a product of the average LOS and the average daily income of Korean women aged 20 to 39 years in 2008 (58 184 KW),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511416806">17</xref></sup> based on the assumption that the primary caregiver of children is the mother and the age range for mothers of children aged less than 5 years is 20 to 39 years.</p>
<p>For the cost data of outpatient visits, all NHI outpatient claims records for children aged less than 5 years with diagnoses of rotavirus enteritis (ICD-10 code: A08.0) were retrieved. The average insurance-covered medical cost per visit was calculated as 43 090 KW. Noninsurance covered medical cost (24 341KW) was estimated by applying the ratio of insurance covered to noncovered costs per hospitalization from the hospital cost survey (0.6390:0.3610). As a result, the average cost per outpatient visit from the health care system perspective was estimated to be 67 431 KW. For transportation cost per visit, average round-trip transportation cost (ie, 6483 KW) was applied. Assuming that a parent spent one third of a day for an outpatient visit for their children, productivity loss cost for an outpatient visit was calculated as one third of the average daily income of Korean women aged 20 to 39 years. By summing up all these costs, the average cost per outpatient visit from the societal perspective was 93 309 KW.</p>
<p>Using the same method, all claims records of ED visits for children aged less than 5 years who had diagnosis of rotavirus enteritis were retrieved from the NHI claims data in 2007. The average cost per ED visit due to rotavirus diarrhea was 203 316 KW and 229 195 KW from health care system and society perspectives, respectively.</p>

<title>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</title>
<p>As a result of the Markov cohort simulation, we calculated net costs, defined as the cost of a national rotavirus immunization program less the present value of costs attributable to treat rotavirus diarrhea that would be prevented by the immunization program. We estimated the number of adverse outcomes associated with rotavirus diarrhea (ie, outpatient visits, ED visits, and hospitalization) averted by vaccination. Finally, we calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is the ratio of the net costs divided by the number of cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis prevented or rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalization averted by an immunization program.</p>
<p>Threshold analysis was undertaken to provide the breakeven price of the vaccine. Starting from the base case scenario, we performed univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses to take into account the uncertainty in the estimates of selected parameters. Data ranges for sensitivity analyses are as follows: proposed vaccine price ±10%, average cost per health care utilization ±10%, discount rate of 3% to 7%, percentage of children experiencing primary infection of rotavirus diarrhea ±10%. Three estimates for the overall childhood vaccination coverage in Korea in 2008 were used as bases for the sensitivity analysis for rotavirus vaccine coverage. Among the Korean children aged between 0 and 2 years in 2008, 96.8% completed the required childhood vaccination, 79.3% did the optional childhood vaccination, and 76.2% did both required and optional vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511416806">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>The prevention of rotavirus events and their associated health care utilization result in the reduction of health care expenditure. From the societal perspective, which incorporates medical costs, transportation costs, and productivity loss costs, approximately 82.95 billion KW is avoided over 5 years after birth for the 2007 birth cohort. However, full vaccination for the entire birth cohort results in extra spending of 147.96 billion KW. By subtracting the cost avoided due to reduced rotavirus events from extra spending for the national vaccination program, the expected net cost of vaccination is 65.01 billion KW (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539511416806">Table 4</xref>).

<p>Threshold analysis for vaccine price revealed that the breakeven price of vaccine for the base case was 56 061 KW per dose or 168 183 KW per recipient. This implies that if we set the vaccine price below 56 061 KW per dose, the extra cost of vaccine administration and costs avoided due to reduced cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis resulting from vaccination will be offset and consequently there will be no extra cost for the rotavirus vaccine program in our society.</p>

<sec id="section12-1010539511416806" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study evaluated the potential health and economic impacts of the routine childhood rotavirus vaccination with a 3-dose schedule at 2, 4, and 6 months after birth for Korean children aged less than 5 years. The base case analysis showed that the ICER was 375 620 KW per case averted and 2 668 274 KW per hospitalization averted from the societal perspective. The vaccine would be cost saving at a price less than 56 061 KW per dose or 168 183 KW per recipient. If the Korean government adopts the national immunization program of rotavirus vaccination, the Korean society will have benefits of preventing symptomatic cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis by 63.5% with extra spending of 375 620 KW to prevent 1 rotavirus case with any severity. Similarly, the vaccine administration can prevent serious cases (ie, hospitalization) by 90.5% and require the investment of 2 668 274 KW to avoid a serious case.</p>
<p>Since the vaccine price of 100 000 KW per dose used in this analysis is for private market use, it includes not only vaccine acquisition cost but also additional costs such as delivery, storage, consultation, and administration fees in private clinics. If the national immunization program for rotavirus vaccine is implemented, these additional costs other than vaccine acquisition costs could be saved.</p>
<p>Compared with the NHI claims data, which have limited clinical information such as diagnosis and the record of laboratory test, but no test results, the hospital records have more comprehensive information including test results as well. Therefore, it is considered that we could identify rotavirus gastroenteritis cases more accurately and completely by using hospital cost survey data. However, because only selected hospitals were included in the hospital cost survey, the cost information obtained from the survey may have a limited generalizability. Thus, we compared the average insurance-covered cost per hospitalization with rotavirus diarrhea calculated on the basis of hospital cost survey with that calculated on the basis of the NHI claims data. From the NHI claims data in 2007, the average insurance-covered cost for a diagnosis of rotavirus enteritis was computed as 717 435 KW in 2008 value. Since 2 cost values (724 840 vs 717 435 KW) are very similar with only 1.02% difference, we concluded that the average cost per hospitalization based on the hospital cost survey is representative for Korean children in the nation.</p>
<p>The hospital cost survey based on sampled hospitals revealed that the laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections accounted for 26.14% of the hospital admissions with gastroenteritis or diarrhea. This is within the range of the results from earlier studies showing that rotavirus accounted for 25% to 50% of all hospitalizations for diarrhea in children aged less than 5 years in both industrialized and developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511416806">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511416806">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In most respects, our analysis is conservative leading to underestimation of the health and economic impacts of rotavirus vaccination. First, the model did not account for any effect of potential herd immunity expected from the vaccination program, and this may cause underestimation of the health and economic impacts of rotavirus vaccination in our society. Transmission of vaccine strains results in the reduction of rotavirus incidence not only in young children but also in older and unimmunized age groups, as rotavirus is transmitted by infants and children within families and in day care and health care settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511416806">23</xref></sup> Also, some evidence suggests that the costs of hospitalization for rotavirus disease among vaccinated children may be lower than for those of unvaccinated children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511416806">24</xref></sup> Second, due to the sparse information about the disutility associated with rotavirus infection, the health benefit of the vaccination in terms of the improvement of quality of life was not evaluated in our study. There have been few studies that had measured quality-of-life gain as a result of rotavirus immunization primarily because a consensus on how to best measure children’s quality of life has not been reached yet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511416806">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539511416806">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, our analysis did not include parents’ out-of-pocket spending such as complementary therapy, extra diapers, special foods, and over-the-counter and complementary medications, because the major data sources for cost information were hospital cost survey and the NHI claims data. Also, rotavirus cases that do not have medical encounter were not considered in our model, because the incidence rate is unknown. According to 2 recent population-based studies, the incidence of home care cases has been estimated to be 3- to 4-fold higher than the incidence of medical consultations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539511416806">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511416806">28</xref></sup> Thus, the cost-effectiveness ratios for rotavirus vaccine would be improved if we included parents’ out-of-pocket spending and home care cases in our model.</p>
<p>In conclusion, implementing a rotavirus vaccination strategy would reduce the burden of the disease substantially in Korea. Routine rotavirus vaccination would likely be cost saving if the price of the vaccine is below the breakeven price of 56 061 KW per dose. These results may be useful for evaluating rotavirus vaccination programs in Korea.</p>
