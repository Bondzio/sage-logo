<p>Cartilage grafts are an integral part of rhinoplasty surgery. Dorsal nasal grafts present a specific challenge in that they support the soft-tissue envelope of the nose at its thinnest region over the rhinion and are therefore more likely to produce visible contour defects if they become warped or misplaced. A significant percentage of cartilage grafts (taken from the septal, conchal, or rib cartilage) placed in the radix or middle part of the dorsum become unattractively noticeable with time. To address this problem, a surgical technique of diced cartilage micrografts wrapped in an enclosing sleeve was developed. With this advancement, noticeable edges of the graft were avoided, and the problem of long-term cartilage warping following the placement of a single fragment was solvable.</p>
<p>In a study involving more than 2300 rhinoplasty surgeries, Erol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496250">1</xref></sup> presented his experience with diced cartilage wrapped in Surgicel (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey). However, the reported favorable results in this single series (resorption in only 11 patients) were not easily reproducible. Later, Daniel and Calvert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496250">5</xref></sup> popularized the use of autologous fascia for wrapping cartilage micrografts. Once enclosed within this autologous sleeve, the composite grafts were used for half- and full-length dorsal constructs, and excellent and stable outcomes were reported. Since then, Guerrerosantos et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496250">6</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13496250">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13496250">9</xref></sup> have shared their positive experiences with grafts composed of diced cartilage wrapped in fascia (DC-F), and this technique has gained widespread popularity in the past decade. Unfortunately, all of the data published to date describe only the open rhinoplasty approach for placing and shaping of these grafts, and no information is available regarding experience via the closed approach.</p>
<p>In this article, we review our current technique for repair of secondary deformities of the nasal dorsum with DC-F composite grafts via the endonasal (closed) approach.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X13496250" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between January 2008 and September 2011, a total of 18 patients (11 women and 7 men) underwent repair of secondary deformities of the nasal dorsum with DC-F composite grafts via the endonasal approach. For all patients, indication for surgery was secondary deformity of the nasal dorsum after previous rhinoplasty.</p>
<p>The technique employed for preparation of the grafts closely followed the one previously described by Daniel and Calvert,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496250">5</xref></sup> albeit modified to suit the endonasal approach. Cartilage harvested from the septum, rib, or concha was diced into 0.5- to 1-mm cubes using a No. 11 blade and packed into the cylinder of a 1-mL syringe with its hub amputated. A rectangle of deep temporal fascia (approximately 5 × 5 cm) was harvested by means of a single V-shaped incision overlying the temporal fossa. After harvesting, the fascia was wrapped around another 1-mL syringe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13496250">Figure 1A</xref>) and secured in place using 5-0 PDS (Ethicon) sutures. In this manner, formation of a hollow and sausage-like sheath was possible. The fascial cylinder was then filled with the desired amount of diced cartilage and sutured closed at both ends to prevent extrusion of the inserted contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13496250">Figure 1B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13496250">D</xref>). Two 3-0 PDS sutures were left in the cephalic edge of the composite graft to assist in its precise placement later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13496250">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>The dorsum of the nose was accessed via the endonasal approach. The receiving pocket was dissected through a small unilateral intercartilaginous incision, and the dorsum was rasped to facilitate the take and future vascularization of the graft. As with all secondary endonasal rhinoplasties, the size of the dissected pocket was of paramount importance. It was kept tight and precise dimensions were maintained (no larger than necessary to house the graft). This maximized stable positioning and reduced the risk of graft misplacement and/or drifting.</p>
<p>The graft was pulled percutaneously into the pocket through the intercartilaginous incision with the help of the 2 PDS sutures placed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13496250">Figure 1E</xref>). Adjustments to the final position and form of the graft were carried out by external manual manipulation after the nose had been closed. A 1:1 volume of graft-to-defect ratio was used, with no overcorrection. The incision was closed with 5-0 Vicryl sutures (Ethicon). Steri-Strips (3M, St Paul, Minnesota) and a malleable thermoplastic splint were placed over the nasal pyramid to help maintain the graft in its position and were left in place for 1 week. In all cases, prophylactic antibiotic treatment with cefazoline was given for 5 days. At 7 to 10 days postoperatively, the bandages were removed to assess and make, if necessary, minor changes in the dorsal contour by gentle manual pressure on the graft. By 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively, the construct solidified to an extent that further influence on its shape was not possible.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 18 patients in this series, 11 were women and 7 were men. The minimum follow-up period was 15 months, and the average follow-up period was 17 months. The average patient age was 32 years (range, 17-48 years). The donor site for cartilage harvest was conchal in 8 patients, septal and conchal in 6 cases, and costal in 4. Deep temporal fascia was used in all cases. In all patients, DC-F composite grafts maintained their volume and shape throughout the whole 15-month postoperative period. Three patients experienced complications, all of which were visible bulging of the graft in the rhinion area. One of these 3 patients required revision that included leveling of the protruding part of the graft. The other 2 patients had smaller dorsum irregularities that were corrected by punching the grafts with a 23-gauge needle, as described by Daniel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250">3</xref></sup> Resorption of the graft was not observed in any of the cases, as judged by serial physical examination, serial photography, and input received from the patients.

<p>(A, C, E) This 18-year-old woman presented with a low radix, a supratip deformity, an underprojected tip, and a hanging columella. The patient’s frontal and lateral views also reveal an inverted-V deformity with collapse of the middle vault and malposition of the alar crura. (B, D, F) Fifteen months after rhinoplasty in which a composite graft (diced cartilage wrapped in fascia, or DC-F) was placed via the endonasal approach. The procedure included tip refinement through a moderate resection of the cephalic portion of the alar cartilages performed through intracartilaginous incisions, dorsal augmentation with the DC-F graft, enhancement of tip projection via the tongue-in-groove technique (which also repaired the hanging columella), and middle vault deficit correction via insertion of bilateral spreader grafts. Additionally, narrowing of the nostrils was carried out via alar wedge resections. Adequate continuity from the upper part of the nose down to the tip was achieved via insertion of spreader grafts. Postoperatively, the patient has a regular and smooth dorsum, and the nasal tip is slimmer and adequately projected above the anterior septal line.</p>

<p>(A, C, E) This 28-year-old man presented after 2 previous rhinoplasty surgeries with a very thin and feminine nose that did not complement his face and height. Due to overresection of the dorsum, the bony vault and a significant portion of the cartilaginous bridge were nearly absent. He also had deficiency of the middle vault and malposition of the alar crura. (B, D, F) Fifteen months after rhinoplasty in which a composite graft (diced cartilage wrapped in fascia, or DC-F) was placed via the endonasal approach. The procedure included alar wall grafts that addressed the collapsed tip, spreader grafts applied to the middle vault, and placement of a DC-F graft (from rib cartilage) to augment the dorsal line. The DC-F composite graft was inserted through a unilateral intercartilaginous incision into a precisely carved-out supraperichondrial pocket. Tip grafts were used to further elevate tip projection. The postoperative result shows aesthetic improvement of the dorsal height and noticeable correction of the collapsed tip. The overall shape of the patient’s nose is more masculine and appropriate for his facial anatomy and lines.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many authors have popularized the use of diced cartilage grafts over the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496250">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13496250">9</xref></sup> With this technique, rib, conchal, or septal cartilage is harvested, diced into small fragments (0.5-1 mm), and subsequently placed on the nasal dorsum for appropriate augmentation. The small fragments of cartilage allow easy manipulation and help surgeons to avoid the complications (such as warping) commonly seen when single and larger solid-cartilage grafts are inserted. Moreover, diced cartilage grafts revascularize more quickly due to the increased surface area available. The main challenges with this method of grafting are adequately controlling the insertion of the composite graft onto the nasal dorsum and maintaining the postoperative stability of its position. Both temporalis fascia and Surgicel (oxidized methylcellulose) have been described for enveloping the diced cartilage fragments and constructing a cylindrical composite graft.</p>
<p>Erol’s technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496250">1</xref></sup> described earlier, utilized small pieces of diced cartilage wrapped with Surgicel (an oxidized, regenerated methylcellulose hemostat product) in a technique he termed “Turkish delight.” The diced cartilage wrapped with Surgicel was placed on the bony roof in primary or secondary rhinoplasty and formed a smooth surface that could be manipulated via external manual pressure. Common complications reported with this technique were early postoperative swelling and resorption of the graft beyond the expected amount. One histological study showed a mosaic-type alignment of graft cartilage with fibrous tissue connections among the fragments. Despite the overall success of his reported experience, Surgicel wraps appeared to incite an inflammatory response, with subsequent absorption of the cartilaginous contents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496250">4</xref></sup> Erol’s results were therefore difficult to reproduce.</p>
<p>Daniel and Calvert,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496250">5</xref></sup> Guerrerosantos et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496250">6</xref></sup> Kelly et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13496250">7</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13496250">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13496250">9</xref></sup> have used composite grafts consisting of fragmented and crushed conchal cartilage wrapped with temporalis fascia for reconstruction of nasal dorsum deformities. Histological studies proved there was good harmony between the graft and its surroundings, and macroscopic structural integrity was documented at 6 months after placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13496250">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13496250"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13496250"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13496250">15</xref></sup> The most common complications were local erythema and resorption of the fascia envelope.</p>
<p>In this study, we have described a modification of Daniel’s technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496250">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496250">3</xref></sup> of using diced cartilage within autologous facia by applying temporalis fascia for the envelope and inserting of this composite DC-F graft via the endonasal (closed) approach for secondary rhinoplasty. Full discussion of the advantages of the endonasal approach is beyond the scope of this article, but several compelling arguments made by Constantian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13496250">16</xref></sup> include adequate visual assessment of undisturbed external soft-tissue parameters such as skin-sleeve movement, balance changes, and surface effects of reduction. With the open approach, these external parameters are much less accessible for evaluation, and there is no evidence within the literature that the open approach leads to a lesser incidence or severity of secondary deformities. Despite greater exposure of underlying structures with the open approach, dissection is slower, and postoperative morbidity is higher. Additionally, when the columellar skin is separated from the medial crura, the nose loses an important component of tip projection and stability, despite suboptimal options for correction such as a columellar strut. In general, the open approach forces surgeons to relinquish, to an extent, details about external nasal shape and balance. Despite the common belief that to achieve optimal results, the surgeon must have complete exposure to all underlying structures, there is wide agreement that secondary deformities result mainly from overall inaccurate appreciation of anatomic variants, tissue characteristics, and functional/structural interrelationships. Seeing the undisturbed nasal surface completes the critical second half of the correction feedback loop.</p>
<p>When DC-F grafts are placed via the endonasal approach for secondary rhinoplasty, as was done in this study, integrity and smooth continuity of the nasal dorsum are achievable with minimal adverse effects and overall satisfactory results. Of the 18 patients treated with this technique, 3 presented with some extent of residual nasal deformity, and the majority of these were corrected with simple interventions. Furthermore, due to the large quantity of small fragments and the time needed for complete solidification, manipulation of the graft is still possible at 1 week postoperatively, when the bandages and splint are removed. At the end of our postoperative follow-up period of 15 months, no resorption of cartilage was observed, and the overall shape and integrity of the nasal dorsum were maintained. Although a larger volume of patients and a longer follow-up period are necessary to garner more conclusive and significant results, our study shows that this technique holds promise as a viable surgical option.</p>

<sec id="section9-1090820X13496250" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Inserting cartilaginous fragments wrapped in an autologous sleeve for correction of the nasal dorsum is not new, and success with this technique in the past 10 years has been documented in the literature with the open approach. In this study, we reproduced the technique for correction of secondary defects of the nasal dorsum via the endonasal approach. Our study provides initial evidence that this technique is comparably successful when closed rhinoplasy is chosen as the surgical method.</p>
