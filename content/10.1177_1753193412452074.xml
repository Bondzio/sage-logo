<abstract>
<p>Our goal was to investigate and compare the mechanical properties of multifilament stainless steel suture (MFSS) and polyethylene multi-filament core FiberWire in flexor tendon repairs. Flexor digitorum profundus tendons were repaired in human cadaver hands with either a 4-strand cruciate cross-lock repair or 6-strand modified Savage repair using 4-0 and 3-0 multifilament stainless steel or FiberWire. The multifilament stainless steel repairs were as strong as those performed with FiberWire in terms of ultimate load and load at 2 mm gap. This study suggests that MFSS provides as strong a repair as FiberWire. The mode of failure of the MFSS occurred by the suture pulling through the tendon, which suggests an advantage in terms of suture strength.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past several decades, many suture techniques and suture materials have been described in an effort to improve the outcomes of primary flexor tendon repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412452074">Amadio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412452074">Barrie et al., 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412452074">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412452074">Bhatia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412452074">Bunnell, 1929</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412452074">1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412452074">Dona et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412452074">Gelberman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412452074">Gill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412452074">Greenwald et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412452074">Hatanaka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412452074">Hoffmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412452074">Ilahi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412452074">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412452074">Lawrence and Davis, 2005</xref>). These repairs need to withstand a rehabilitation protocol that generates forces during active range of motion exercises between 34 N and 123 N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412452074">Schuind et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Two factors that have been shown to be important in determining a repaired tendon’s ability to withstand these forces are the ultimate load and load needed to produce a 2 mm gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412452074">Gelberman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412452074">Lindsay et al., 1960</xref>). In turn, these factors are dependent on a number of variables, which include the suture material used for the repair, number of strands crossing the repair site, and method of attachment of the suture to the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412452074">Bhatia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412452074">Taras et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412452074">Thurman et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Composite polymer sutures have become popular due to improvements in stiffness and strength, but are still not ideal. It has been shown that when a composite suture is used in a locking stitch, the repair typically fails by rupture of the core suture, usually at or close to the knot. This suggests that if a stronger suture were available, a higher force may be achieved. Additionally, polymer sutures have been shown to untie unless knots with more than five throws are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412452074">Ilahi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412452074">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412452074">Waitayawinyu et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, a multifilament stainless steel suture (MFSS) (Core Essence Orthopaedics, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, USA) has been developed that may exhibit several advantages over composite polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412452074">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our goal was to investigate the mechanical properties of flexor tendon repairs performed using this MFSS and compare these to repairs using FiberWire (FW; Arthrex; Naples, Florida, USA).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Flexor digitorum profundus tendons were dissected in the index, long, and ring fingers of 16 fresh frozen cadaver hands. Each tendon was cut transversely with a scalpel 1 cm distal to the A2 pulley to create a complete tendon laceration, and then repaired with either a 4-strand cruciate cross-lock repair or a 6-strand modified Savage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412452074">Barrie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412452074">Dona et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412452074">Savage and Risitano, 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412452074">Figure 1</xref>). The 4-strand repairs were performed with 4-0 and 3-0 MFSS, and 4-0 and 3-0 FW. The 6-strand repairs were only performed with 4-0 MFSS or 4-0 FW because these 6-strand repairs performed with 3-0 suture were found to be too bulky, especially with the number of throws needed to be tied securely. Each repair configuration had a total of eight samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412452074">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>All repairs were followed by a running epitendinous stitch using 5-0 nylon and performed by a single experienced hand surgeon. Repairs using FW were tied using a surgeon’s knot with three additional throws, for a total of five throws. Repairs with MFSS were tied using a surgeon’s knot with one additional throw for a total of three throws, which we found in prior studies to be adequate to prevent untying of this suture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412452074">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The MFSS used in this study was made from 49 filaments of 316L stainless steel. The filaments in the 3-0 size are 0.034 mm in diameter, creating a suture with an overall diameter of 0.31 mm. The 4-0 filaments are 0.024 mm in diameter and the total suture diameter is 0.21 mm. The suture is arranged in seven bundles of seven filaments each.</p>
<p>After repair, the tendon ends were harvested, wrapped in gauze, and hydrated with physiological saline solution. Each end was placed in a custom clamp that was attached to a servo-hydraulic testing machine (Mini-Bionix 858; MTS, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA). The tendons were cyclically loaded 10 times from 5 to 10 N, then immediately tested to failure at 1 mm/s. Gap formation at the repair site was recorded using a digital video camera (HV20; Canon, San Jose, California, USA) at 30 frames/s. Load data were recorded using a load cell (INTERFACE SSM-500; Scottsdale, Arizona, USA). The load at 2 mm gap and ultimate load were recorded for each specimen. The load at 2 mm gap was determined by analyzing the video frame by frame until a 2 mm gap was observed. The corresponding load at that time point was determined to be the load to produce a 2 mm gap.</p>
<p>Data were assumed to follow a non-normal distribution due to the small sample size. Ultimate load and load at 2 mm gap were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s post-hoc adjustment for multiple comparisons. Significance was defined as <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The mode of failure was also recorded.</p>

<title>Mode of failure</title>
<p>The primary mode of failure of the 6-strand MFSS 4-0 repair was rupture of the core suture. The 6-strand repair with 4-0 FW also failed by suture breakage in over half of the specimens. The 4-strand MFSS with 3-0 failed exclusively by pulling through the tendon, and the 4-strand repair with 3-0 FW failed both by pulling through the tendon and by the suture breaking in equal numbers. The 4-strand 4-0 MFSS failed in equal numbers of core suture rupture and suture pulling through the tendon. The 4-strand 4-0 FW showed the most variation in mode of failure by pulling through the tendon, the suture breaking, and also untying (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412452074">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Monofilament stainless steel was used in the early days of flexor tendon repair, but ultimately fell out of favour with improvements in strength and stiffness of polymer suture, which was easier to handle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412452074">Bunnell, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412452074">Lawrence and Davis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412452074">Trail et al., 1989</xref>). The MFSS used in this study is made from 49 individual filaments, which makes it easier to handle and tie. Previous work by our group has shown that MFSS has superior strength and stiffness compared with FW, Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA), and Supramid (S. Jackson Inc., Alexandria, Virginia, USA). However, it has not been tested in a tendon repair until this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412452074">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of strands crossing the repair site predicts the strength of a repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412452074">Gill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412452074">Savage, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412452074">Thurman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412452074">Waitayawinyu et al., 2008</xref>). In our experiment, the 4-0 MFSS supported this finding with the 6-strand repair having a significantly higher load at 2 mm gap than the 4-strand repair. The 4-0 MFSS 4-strand repairs failed in equal numbers of pulling through the tendon and breaking at the knot. The 6-strand MFSS 4-0 repairs failed by suture breakage in all but one specimen. This suggests the 4-0 MFSS is weaker than the anchor point in the 6-strand modified Savage repair and that the 4-0 MFSS was right at the limit of strength of the 4-strand cross-lock repair strength.</p>
<p>The 4-0 FW repairs, however, did not show a significant increase in load at 2 mm gap with additional strands crossing the repair site. Although a conclusive reason for this result is difficult to determine, it may be explained by examining the differences in mode of failure. In general, the FW repairs showed the greatest variation in mode of failure; this was evident with the 4-0 FW. The 4-0 FW 4-strand repair was the only configuration to have specimens fail by the knot untying, which occurred in two of eight specimens. The remaining specimens failed in equal numbers by pulling through the tendon and by the suture breaking at the knot. The knotted strand proved to be the weakest link in the repair. The 4-0 FW 6-strand repairs failed by suture breakage at the knot in five of eight. This suggests that, despite having more strands cross the repair site, the load was not able to evenly distribute across all strands. When considering 3-0 suture in the 4-strand repair, there was no statistical difference between the MFSS and FW with regard to ultimate load or load at 2 mm gap. However, there was a difference with respect to mode of failure. All MFSS repairs failed by the suture pulling through the tendon while five of eight FW repairs failed by sutures pulling through the tendon. The remaining 3 FW repairs failed by the suture breaking at the knot, suggesting the suture anchor point was the weak point in the repair. Others have found that when a strong suture is used, the mode of failure is the suture pulling through the tendon, while weaker sutures fail by the suture breaking at the knot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412452074">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, the 3-0 MFSS has the potential for a stronger repair, but only when a more secure attachment of the suture to the tendon is used.</p>
<p>Taras et al. investigated the effect of suture calibre on the tensile strength of flexor tendon repairs. Using three different repair techniques and 4 suture sizes, ranging from 5-0 to 2-0, investigators found tensile strength increased as suture size increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412452074">Taras et al., 2001</xref>). When the 4-strand repairs in our study were compared, we saw significant differences in the load at 2 mm gap and ultimate load with both the MFSS and FW when increasing the suture size from 4-0 to 3-0. Although the larger suture size can provide a stronger repair, it remains to be seen whether the size of suture in the repair site will adversely affect friction and tendon healing. This is especially concerning with the FW repairs, which require at least five throws to resist untying.</p>
<p>In 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412452074">Lawrence and Davis (2005)</xref> investigated the tensile properties of 4-strand repairs using 4-0 suture materials including Ethibond, FW, and a braided stainless steel. They noted that when a locking stitch was used, all the repairs failed by rupture of the core suture. This is in contrast to our study, in which none of the repair groups failed exclusively by the suture breaking. Although there could be many reasons for this difference (i.e., tendon size between the two experiments), the results underscore the advancement of suture materials. Their study showed that with a strong attachment, the suture becomes the weakest link of the repair. Our study builds on this by showing that, in a similar repair performed with MFSS, the weakest link has shifted back towards the tendon attachment, especially in 3-0 MFSS.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that a locking stitch with either a composite polymer or MFSS suture may be strong enough for early active range of motion rehabilitation protocols. However, MFSS may have benefits in terms of mode of failure. Studies investigating other methods of tendon attachment, the ability of this suture to pass easily through the pulley system, and its effect on tendon healing and functional outcomes will govern whether MFSS is clinically preferable to available polymers.</p>
