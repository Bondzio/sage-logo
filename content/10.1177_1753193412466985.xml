<p>The human hand manifests the symptoms and signs of many psychological disorders. At one end of the scale there are people with disorders such as the ‘psycho-flexed hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412466985">Frykman et al., 1983</xref>); a condition in which the subject’s fingers adopt a position of deformity in the absence of a physical illness as a representation of underlying mental disorder (‘conversion hysteria’, now classified by the International Classification of Diseases, ICD 10, in the group of Dissociative Disorders) and factitious disorders of the hand and upper limb as described eloquently in this Journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412466985">Burke, 2008</xref>). Towards the other end (perhaps) of this spectrum are a sub-group of patients with conditions that <italic>do</italic> have genuine underlying physical pathology, but who do <italic>not</italic> get better after that pathology has been treated surgically. Classical examples of this are carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition in which mental state may have a part to play in some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412466985">Katz et al., 2001</xref>) … and ganglia!</p>
<p>It is heartening to read the article by Peters et al. – in a surgical journal – looking at psychological aspects of a very common condition that we all know is harmless and which we are all under pressure from patients to treat surgically.</p>
<p>The authors have been extremely thorough in their assessment of the subjects and have applied statistical tests rigorously. However, I think we need to be a bit wary of including A1 pulley ganglia (so-called ‘pearl’ or ‘seed’ ganglia) and distal interphalangeal joint cysts (‘mucous’ or ‘myxoid’ cysts, which are owing to degenerative change): I note that almost a quarter of the patients in the study were in one or other of these groups. Pearl ganglia are really quite painful and troublesome to those people whose daily work involves gripping objects tightly and I do not think that the sophisticated psychological tests employed in this article are really relevant in their case.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to see that people with a degenerative condition resulting in a mucous cyst do not necessarily have much pain. It may be because these patients are older and perhaps more resilient than the young. Another fascinating aspect is that this group had lower ‘pain catastrophizing’ – again a feature (maybe) of the more mature person.</p>
<p>It is the young who experience more pain and expect surgery. As the authors hint, perhaps it is in their nature – by virtue of their youth – to be more impetuous and expect a quicker and more dramatic recovery. Education also seems to be a factor and, again, this is not a surprise but well worth noting.</p>
<p>The most telling comment is: ‘Operative treatment did not result in less pain intensity or disability, or higher satisfaction, compared with non-operative treatment’.</p>
<p>So … what is the message?</p>
<p>Answer: be wary of offering surgery to young, less educated patients with dorsal volar or wrist ganglia. The surgery is often unrewarding for both the surgeon <italic>and the patient.</italic></p>
