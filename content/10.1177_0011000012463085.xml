<abstract>
<p>This was a Presidential Address for the Society of Counseling Psychology delivered at the 2012 American Psychological Association Annual Convention in Orlando, Florida. It was based on interviews with 10 informants, as well as my own experience, regarding our personal and professional journeys as immigrant counseling psychologists in the United States. The purpose of the presentation was to increase awareness of the obstacles, triumph, and contributions of immigrant counseling psychologists. I discussed our upbringing experience, family support for career decisions, obstacles and sources of strength, influential persons, relation between immigrant experience and work as counseling psychologists, contributions to counseling psychology, and wisdom to share with the counseling psychology profession.</p>

<body>
<p>I want to begin my presentation by thanking everyone who has volunteered their talent and precious time for the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP) during my presidential year, as well as those who have provided consultation and emotional support to me. When I first told people I was going to do three presidential projects, some thought I was a bit too ambitious. I’m glad that I persisted with my dreams for my presidential theme, “The Future of Counseling Psychology Campaign.” It is most gratifying to see the three presidential projects coming to fruition at the 2012 American Psychological Association (APA) Annual Convention here in Orlando, Florida. I am forever grateful to members of the three Special Task Groups: Leadership Academy, Globalization, and Video Campaign, particularly to the cochairs Rosie Bingham and Linda Forrest, Johanna Nilsson and Lifei Wang, and Derek Iwamoto and Michael McAllister. I believe that these projects help enhance the future of counseling psychology by sustaining leadership development among students and early career professionals, by promoting international collaborations to advance counseling psychology globally, and by efforts to increase public awareness about counseling psychology through videos. In addition to these three presidential projects, there were three other Special Task Groups that were commissioned this year: <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic> Editor Search, Counseling Psychology Specialty Renewal Petition, and Website Redesign. I had the privilege to be kept informed of all the people and their work in these projects, and I continue to feel that the most rewarding part of being Division 17 President is to have the opportunity to work with these amazingly talented and committed Division 17 members. It is because of these volunteers that SCP is a strong organization, and that the future of counseling psychology is full of potentials and opportunities.</p>
<p>As you can imagine this past year has been quite busy for me. In addition to being SCP President, I was also a department chair. I went through a job transition from Northeastern University to Indiana University, and we just moved from Boston to Bloomington last week. I would not recommend any President to be doing all these in a given year, but I’m happy that I did what I did. I have learned tremendously during this process, and I thank all of my colleagues, especially the Presidential Cabinet: Tania Israel, Andy Horne, and Toti Perez. The support from Debbie Nolan, Sam Rehtorik, and Michael Mobley has also been invaluable. Of course, I could not have done any of these without my loving partner, Joel Smith. He has supported me in any way a human being can ever give to another, from managing our household to listening to me every day—and you know that we psychologists <italic>love</italic> to process. He even knows all the acronyms such as SCP, Council of Counseling Psychology Training Programs (CCPTP), Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest (BAPPI), or what Divisions 17, 44, and 45 stand for. I love you Joel—you make me a better person and President than I ever could be without you. I should also acknowledge the contributions of our dog, Jake. Although he is not very good at filing papers, he loves to answer phone calls, and he specializes in shredding papers. Seriously though—whenever I have a stressful day, I can just come home and rub his head, then I feel much better, and so does he.</p>
<p>Okay, onto the topic today—“Immigrant Counseling Psychologists.” You may wonder why I chose a title for my Presidential Address that is quite different from my presidential projects. Since I have spent the past two years working on the presidential theme and projects, I decided to discuss a topic today that is more personal. For those who heard my New Fellow’s Address at the 2008 APA Convention in Boston, you may remember that I said I fight three battles: racism, heterosexism, and ESLism. ESLism refers to discrimination against those who speak English as a second language. Most of my professional work addresses racism and heterosexism, but somehow I have not done much professionally on ESLism, even though I struggle with it almost daily in my personal and professional lives. Therefore, I decided to talk about the experience of immigrant counseling psychologists, to increase awareness of the obstacles, triumph, and contributions of immigrant counseling psychologists. Immigration has always been an important issue since the beginning of this country where most citizens and residents are first-generation immigrants or their offspring. Ironically, throughout history there have been persistent hostilities and biases against legal and illegal immigrants. The uproar of recent political debates and controversial immigration laws in our country, as well as APA Past-President Melba Vasquez’s presidential task force on immigrant issues, provide a backdrop of my Presidential Address.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012463085">
<title>My Informants</title>
<p>I did not want to make the presentation all about me (even though I was tempted to), so I consulted 10 colleagues who are first-generation immigrant counseling psychologists. I focused on first-generation immigrants because they often face unique issues such as ESL, adapting to a foreign culture, and separation from their family of origin. Interesting enough, one colleague I interviewed said she never thought of herself as an immigrant, but a visitor. She thought this might be why she never feels she fits in. I interviewed these 10 colleagues (or informants) using a standard set of 11 questions. I did not intend to approach this as a formal research project, although I did apply for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval just to be well covered. My presentation today is based on my synthesis of responses from my informants, as well as direct quotes from the informants. Therefore, my Presidential Address is somewhat nontraditional in that it will be presented in a collective voice, using a “storytelling” approach which is a historical and cherished tradition of intergenerational communication in many cultures. Imagine that this presentation is almost like a fireside chat, except that there is no fire, and my panel of informants remains offstage and anonymous.</p>
<p>My informants included 5 men and 5 women from China, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Japan, Taiwan, and Turkey. They first arrived in the U.S. as young adults between 19 and 32 years old, with the exception of 2 who spent a few years of their childhood in the U.S. (when they were 5 and 6 years old, respectively) prior to reentry as adults. As adults all informants came to the U.S. as international undergraduate or graduate students. Ultimately all received a doctoral degree in counseling psychology. Upon graduation, they stayed in the U.S. for various reasons—the advanced development of counseling psychology in the U.S., the need for multicultural and multilingual psychologists in the U.S., marrying an American, career outlook for themselves or their partner, a good education for their children, preference for the American lifestyle, or cultural and political climate in their country of origin. There were 3 assistant professors and 7 associate professors, with 6 in the Midwest, 2 in mid-Atlantic region, 1 in the South, and 1 from the West Coast. I acknowledge that the demographics of these 10 informants don’t represent the spectrum of immigrant counseling psychologists in the U.S. But as I said earlier, this is not intended to be a research project. And John Westefeld told me that I can do whatever I want with my Presidential Address. In the following I will discuss the informants’ upbringing experience, family support for their career decision, obstacles and sources of strength, influential persons, relation between immigrant experience and work as counseling psychologists, their contributions to counseling psychology, and their wisdoms to share with everyone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011000012463085">
<title>Upbringing Experience</title>
<p>I asked my informants about significant experiences when they were growing up that shaped who they are today. The most common experience mentioned was their family’s emphasis on the value of education. Regardless of the socioeconomic level of their families, the informants were encouraged and supported to pursue education. They also mentioned the values imparted on them by their family or societal culture, such as gender equality, individual freedom, the importance of family, morality and integrity, work ethics, and focusing on meaning of life rather than materialism. These values influenced their approach to life, and their career as counseling psychologist. In their own words,
<disp-quote>
<p>We didn’t have much money, so it was really important to prioritize things/resources. My family always prioritized our education and encouraged us to travel. My parents wanted me and my sister to be fluent in two languages. They believed that we must expand our worldview if we want to do anything and be successful with it.</p>
<p>My parents were not well educated. When I was an elementary school student, my mom paid a lot of attention to how I performed at school. It implanted the idea in me that education is important and is a viable way, and perhaps the only way from my parents’ point of view, to move upward in the societal hierarchy.</p>
<p>My parents kept pushing me not to be discouraged by the societal norms as a girl/woman. They kept telling me to pursue my happiness, and communicated the following statement over and over again, “nothing in the world can make you happy if you are not happy with yourself.”</p>
<p>My parents worked multiple jobs to support their children. Back then, they didn’t have much of a choice, but working hard to put dinner on the table and get what their kids needed. “Working hard” seems to become a theme later in my own life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned values, one informant reported that her parents were role models as helping professionals. She said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I grew up in a family where both parents were physicians. They were great role models in helping others. I remember many meaningful conversations about their passion and devotion to saving lives and relieving pain for others. My parents believed in “leading” than “correcting” in shaping positive behaviors, and were very positive in seeing their children and others.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There were some unique identity and relational issues for the two informants who spent several childhood years in the U.S. There was feeling of marginalization because of not fitting in any cultural group, or due to acculturation and English proficiency differences from their parents.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Due to the cross-cultural experiences of living and being educated in both the U.S. and my country of origin, I constantly struggled with my identity and felt a lack of belongingness. Now I still find myself not feeling fully connected with Asian Americans in the U.S., and also have some different experiences and perspectives compared to the typical East Asian international students. But I have accepted that I am uniquely shaped by my cross-cultural experiences and have come to embrace it.</p>
<p>I first arrived in the U.S. at age 6, and as the older child, I was the very first in the family to become fluent in English. I probably felt at the time that I could not rely on anyone, including my parents. The avoidance of shared experiences with my family was perhaps what significantly shaped who I am today, in that I consider myself quite self-reliant.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I was fascinated by the stories I heard from my informants. Although we are all counseling psychologists, we come from very different backgrounds and experiences that collectively shaped our individuality, and our approach to life and counseling psychology. I grew up in a poor family of seven in Hong Kong. In my earliest memory, my family lived in a small studio appointment with a bunk bed. All five children slept on top, and my parents on the bottom. My older siblings started working at a very young age to help support the family. I’m the only one in the family who went to college, let alone graduate school. I am grateful to my family for their sacrifice. As a kid growing up I didn’t have many toys, so I learned to improvise. That’s why I got a smile on my face when one informant told this story:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I was growing up, the SES of my family was lower-middle, and we lived in a poor neighborhood. Finding ways to have fun without costing too much money was one of the themes during my childhood. Things like swimming in a small river, fishing frogs with homemade bamboo sticks, and tracing grasshoppers made up important memories of my childhood.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011000012463085">
<title>Familial Support for Career Decision</title>
<p>Most of the informants’ parents had little knowledge of what psychology is, let alone counseling psychology which literally is a “foreign” concept. However, they all supported their children’s decision to pursue a doctoral education and to work in the U.S. after graduation. Although it was difficult to be living so far away from their children, these parents were very happy for their children’s educational and career achievements in the U.S. Here are some examples:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was very challenging for my family to let me go and for me to leave them behind. But not even once did they communicate that they would like me to move back and be with them. As long as they know I am happy, they are happy and super supportive.</p>
<p>Our families in Taiwan did not really know what counseling psychologists are about. They knew I completed a doctoral degree in psychology and were in support of our decision to stay though.</p>
<p>Both of my parents understand my occupation as a university faculty rather than a counseling psychologist. When I told my father that I want to study psychology, he stated, “Psychology? What is there to study? I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>When I told them I planned to stay in the U.S. to work as a counseling psychology faculty member, they supported me and were proud and happy for me. Yet I know that my family has been waiting for me to come home—to find the right moment to go back to my roots.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Well, my own experience is similar. My parents have no clue what I studied, or what I do in my work other than being a university professor. This lack of understanding is very frustrating, because there is so much I want to share with my parents about what I do and what I accomplished, yet I know they won’t understand. One time I told my brother that I was elected President of the National Career Development Association. Then my mother called me, and said she heard from my bother that I was elected a state governor. However, ultimately I know that nothing pleases my parents more than being proud of me, and I know that they are. So that’s all that matters.</p>

<title>Obstacles and Sources of Strength</title>
<p>One night a few years ago, I had a really bad dream that I woke up in the middle of it. In that dream I was visiting my parents in Hong Kong. I was telling my mother how I was doing in America, and somehow I burst into tears. I held her hand and kept telling her, “It’s so hard to be an immigrant.” I was surprised by that dream because I never thought I had that kind of emotion about my immigrant experience. Assuming that dreams reveal one’s repressed or subconscious thoughts and emotions (I know there are psychodynamic folks out there in the audience), maybe that dream was telling me something. I’m well aware of the almost daily hassles in my personal and professional lives—being made fun of because of my accent, being perceived as intellectually inferior because of nonstandard English usage or not knowing some cultural icons in the U.S., being ignored or passed over for opportunities, being invalidated or slighted with racist or foreigner slurs, or having to work 2 or 3 times as hard as others in order to be recognized for the same level of achievements. Recently I had a conversation with a counseling psychologist. She made a comment to the effect that I’m not an American. I said I <italic>am</italic> an American. She said, “But you’re not <italic>American</italic> American, are you?” I said, “I’ll take that as a micro-aggression.”</p>
<p>I asked my informants what barriers they face in their professional development as a counseling psychologist, and how they cope with them. The number one obstacle mentioned was language and cultural issues. It is difficult enough trying to adapt to a different language and culture on a day to day basis, let alone trying to succeed in a profession where language and culture play a paramount role in practice, education, and research. I have heard stories about some clients refusing to see a counselor with a “non-American” name or accent, or they may terminate counseling prematurely after the first session. During my first practicum one of my clients would check in with the receptionist, saying he had an appointment with Mr. Chung-Chang-Chun. I’m also aware of incidents where international students are treated by faculty in culturally insensitive ways, or are evaluated in culturally unfair manners. In the words of my informants regarding language and cultural barriers,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I first came to the U.S., some instructors questioned my English proficiency and it was not easy to find financial support.</p>
<p>Staying “very Chinese” in many ways may not be well understood or appreciated by others.</p>
<p>Needing to learn about structures and systems that most others would be familiar with. I still do not know how to navigate some of the systems.</p>
<p>I felt having less social capital compared to those originally from the U.S. Without the experience of growing up in the U.S., I often felt that I lacked the frame of reference for things my clients talk about. Overall, I feel less secure around understanding how interpersonal relationships and various systems function. There has always been the feeling of “not belonging” that comes and goes throughout my time in the U.S. I find it harder to feel like an equal being with my peers and colleagues.</p>
<p>The sense of not fitting in, or being an outsider, because of different worldviews and/or priorities has been one of the barriers or challenges to my professional development.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the two informants who had spent some childhood years in the U.S., their experience was somewhat different from those who came as adults. One informant cited the barrier to conform to what is considered “Asian” in the U.S.:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had to “learn” many of the stereotypes that people in the U.S. have, including Asian Americans, as to what it “should mean” to be Asian or Asian American.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One informant from Europe has a somewhat different experience. She said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It took a while for me to find a place as an immigrant. Because I am a White European, I am often perceived as from the majority culture. I learned to share the cultural differences more clearly and more intentionally.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Besides language and cultural barriers, some informants mentioned the difficulty of lacking colleagues with similar research interests related to their international background, or lacking access to populations they want to study. They also indicated experiencing a lack of appreciation for the kind of research they do, such as challenges with getting published in an area that is not seen as important. One informant also mentioned having to adapt to the current culture of counseling psychology in the U.S. being stereotypically White female, which values very explicit, verbal, low-context communication, as well as affect over cognition.</p>
<p>In facing the aforementioned obstacles, my informants applied a variety of coping strategies and resources, such as working extra hard; learning cultural differences; grounding in one’s ethnic identity; believing in oneself and one’s work; being open-minded; cognitive restructuring; connecting with people with similar backgrounds and interests; utilizing social support from family, friends, colleagues, and mentors; and religious and spiritual support. Wait a minute—aren’t these some of the interventions we use with our clients? Sounds like my informants really practice what they preach. And I believe this makes them solid practitioners, educators, and researchers. In their own words,
<disp-quote>
<p>I work as hard as I can, and accept that English is my second language. In my writing, I will just write my thoughts without concerns about grammatical errors. Then I can proofread what I wrote later. I increased my awareness of how different Chinese and English language structures can be related to my mistakes in English.</p>
<p>I study, learn, whenever and wherever I can. With time, it becomes less and less of an issue. I want to understand the role of culture in counseling and/or psychological phenomena. This will give me an understanding about my relationship with the American society and culture. Having a perspective is a great way of coping. Being able to articulate this perspective can make it an educational experience for all.</p>
<p>Being comfortable with who I am allows me to use my knowledge of Chinese culture and its differences with American culture to facilitate my work—be it teaching, research, or counseling. I enjoy self-reflection and discussions with my husband, which helps me gain perspectives about what I see and experience—making sense of the world.</p>
<p>Chinese philosophy served as an internal resource to increase my resiliency. When I face difficult times, I have found that Chinese philosophies or sayings would come up naturally to help me regulate my stress and feelings. I know any difficulties I encounter eventually foster positive growth. I strongly believe that I will grow as a person after I overcome these challenges and difficulties. In particular, my job is to help others overcome their life difficulties. Thus, I believe I must practice what I preach.</p>
<p>Having a different perspective and cultural background from the typical U.S.-born counseling psychologist, and also learning the U.S. perspective and worldview, have widened my horizon and made me a more open-minded person than I was when I first entered the U.S. I think immersion in two cultures and worldviews has facilitated my development and has made me a better psychologist than I would have been without the experience.</p>
<p>I connected with the few others from my country of origin. I developed a listserv to help others in similar situations; make it a point to mentor others. I challenge the tokenization, but also use my position to my advantage for advocacy.</p>
<p>Talking to my wife about these issues, utilizing psychotherapy, praying, and making friends were ways that I coped with the challenges.</p>
<p>I tend not to see obstacles as barriers; they are simply opportunities for change. I did the best I can, after that I let go of my desire to control the result. And, of course, having a good support system (e.g., talking to friends, advisors, mentors) always helps.</p>
<p>I am interested in minority research studies. However, the lack of minority populations in my community is a limitation for my research and applications for grant funding. The way I deal with this limitation is to collaborate with minority colleagues to conduct my research in different states.</p>
<p>It helps to appreciate the history that the U.S. is built on immigrant foundation, and that I can continue to be a part of it.</p>
<p>The experience of being an immigrant helps me understand other immigrants.</p>
<p>The power of prayer gave me the mental power to fulfill my potential. Being an immigrant counseling psychologist, some challenges are beyond my control. My family prays a lot for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but just reading these comments gives me a great sense of empowerment. These immigrant counseling psychologists faced a lot of barriers in their personal and professional development. But they also turned these obstacles into triumph. They overcome hardships by turning challenges into opportunities for growth; by sorting through and embracing cultural differences; by utilizing the best of different cultures; by turning inward with constant self-reflections; and by falling on the support of family, friends, colleagues, mentors, and spirituality. And gosh they work so hard. Their lived experience as immigrants makes them unique in their perspectives about counseling psychology, contributing to their special contributions to education, research, practice, and advocacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000012463085">
<title>Influential Persons</title>
<p>I am who I am today because of many influential persons in my life. These people are my teachers, supporters, sounding boards, role models, and inspirations. All of my informants mentioned that they benefited from their support network. So I asked them who the influential people are in their development as a counseling psychologist. They mentioned a lot of people, including parents, partners, siblings, children, extended family, advisors, teachers, professors, clinical supervisors, mentors, students, colleagues, and clients. At the risk of omitting someone, I do think it is empowering to publicly acknowledge some of these influential persons. Here is an incomplete list of persons who have played an important role in the lives of my informants and myself: Lynette Bikos, Sharon Bowman, JoLynn Carney, Shing-Shiong Chang, Lillian Chiang, Edith Chung, Jim Croteau, David Dixon, Louise Douce, Sif Einarsdóttir, Helen Farmer, Linda Forrest, Larry Gerstein, Betty Gridley, Lenore Harmon, Puncky Heppner, Andy Horne, David Jepsen, Shuh-Ren Jin, Mark Leach, Sue Lease, Bob Lent, Michael Mobley, Carole Pistole, Mark Pope, Jeff Prince, Mark Savickas, Tom Sayger, William Sedlacek, Ronald Serlin, Bob Slaney, Terry Tracy, Bruce Wampold, and Meifen Wei. In their own words, my informants described how they were influenced by these people:
<disp-quote>
<p>My doctoral advisor came to my home institute for a semester and spent one afternoon going though APA-accredited counseling psychology programs with me. His support has been just amazing and life changing! I came to the U.S. to be his advisee. He died shortly after I graduated.</p>
<p>My students! A large portion of my professional identity is being a teacher. I have been learning to be a good teacher all these years—the journey is continuing. My students have been patient with me and helping me learn how to teach! And my clients—they taught me about counseling!</p>
<p>My academic advisor always believed in my abilities way more than I did. My instructor in supervision class noticed and highlighted my strengths. She helped me see what I had rather than what I didn’t have.</p>
<p>Two of my internship supervisors were Taiwanese immigrants who allowed me to see how they integrated who they are culturally with their counseling work in the U.S.</p>
<p>My colleague is a great mentor who showed incredible interests and respect for my Taiwanese culture.</p>
<p>All of the above individuals are my advisors/mentors. I would not be where I am today without their unwavering support.</p>
<p>All of these faculty members have supported and accepted me for who I am. I have also been influenced a lot by my students since I became a faculty member, especially my doctoral students who have helped me get used to being on the faculty side of the equation. All of my students have contributed tremendously to who I am today as a counseling psychologist and a person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011000012463085">
<title>Immigrant Experience and Work as Counseling Psychologist</title>
<p>I asked my informants whether there was any relation between their experience as an immigrant and the kind of work they do as a counseling psychologist. Most said, “Definitely!” They reported that their identity and experience as an immigrant influenced their research, teaching, and practice. Some of them study immigrant and/or international issues; some acknowledged that their psychological perspectives are influenced by their international experience. They also reported that their immigrant experience influenced their relationships with students and clients. In their own words,
<disp-quote>
<p>A large part of my research focuses on the adjustment and well-being of Asian immigrant populations and cross-cultural comparison studies; both are directly related to my experience as an immigrant person in the U.S.</p>
<p>Absolutely! My professional interest is closely related to my being an immigrant. My experiences as an immigrant color my perception and understanding of social and psychological phenomena, and undoubtedly influence my research from topic selection, study design, to interpretation of results. In teaching, my Asian or Chinese perspectives also influence how I present information and what information I choose to present. Even in my work with my advisees or supervisees, my “Chinese-ness” influences my relationship and interactions with them.</p>
<p>I feel like fish in water when I work with international student populations and immigrants. I also enjoy conducting outreach programming for international students. I currently study cross-national adjustment processes. I feel like I can be myself, utilize my experiences, and provide more unique contributions in working with the international student populations.</p>
<p>Immigrant experience provides a critical lens to evaluate the cultural applicability of what I learn in psychology, especially in theory and assessment.</p>
<p>My cross-cultural experience and the counseling training I received in two different countries definitely have impacted my teaching style, research, and the way I conceptualize clients’ presenting issues. Especially in the field of counseling, I am the most important tool I have in doing my job. Having said that, I also constantly remind myself the biases I may have derived from my past experience.</p>
<p>When mentoring students or interacting with colleagues, I stress the importance of multicultural perspectives and appreciation of individual/group differences, which I believe are directly influenced by my immigrant experience.</p>
<p>I operate with the Asian communication style—using implicit and positive messages when seeing things that need to change, versus explicitly tell students what they did wrong and need to correct.</p>
<p>I always see everything through the lens of an immigrant woman, and a person of color. I can’t separate my identity from my work. I bring it into my research, teaching, as well as sharing experiences. This is especially helpful with international students and other persons of color.</p>
<p>My immigrant experience gives me more patience and flexibility while I mentor others. My experiences of going through challenges related to cross-cultural situations have helped me become more aware of the gap between my own frame of reference and those of others around me. This sensitivity has made me more culturally competent with people from similar and different cultural backgrounds.</p>

<p>As for me, the relation between my immigrant experience and my work cannot be more obvious. I chose to present on “Immigrant Counseling Psychologists,” didn’t I? I think my international experience has the most impact on my professional leadership and service, as well as my mentoring of students. In my presidency with the National Career Development Association and the Society of Counseling Psychology, I developed initiatives that targeted international issues and collaborations. I gave a number of presentations in Asia and Europe, and I always tried to plant some seeds in international collaborations during those trips. I also realized that most of my advisees are ethnic minorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons, or international students. There were times when I advocated for the needs of international students. It was not easy sometimes, but I’m glad I was in a position to do something for them. I was an international student before, and it makes sense to give back.</p>

<title>Contributions to Counseling Psychology</title>
<p>One form of cultural oppression is ignoring or distorting historical facts to undermine the contributions of a cultural group. This kind of oppression renders a cultural group to be perceived as insignificant, inferior, or worthless; and this perception can even be internalized by the cultural group members themselves. Therefore, I thought it would be important to publicly acknowledge my informants’ contributions to counseling psychology as immigrants. This will serve to promote awareness of the impact of immigrant counseling psychologists, and to help international or immigrant students and early career professionals to build confidence about their own destiny.</p>
<p>I collected the curricula vitae from 8 of my 10 informants. Let me tell you their vitae are simply amazing. There is no way I can adequately present the scope of their achievements. So I will just give you a summary. In total, the 8 informants have presented 531 papers (averaging 66 papers each), and published 196 journal articles and 81 book chapters (averaging 25 articles and 10 chapters each, respectively). They received a total of 70 grants and 90 awards or recognitions. All but one served on journal editorial boards (averaging 3 editorial boards each). Some have served on Division 17 or APA committees, or leadership roles in other professional organizations. They have mentored countless students in counseling and counseling psychology. Finally, there are 3 Fellows of APA and Division 17. Now remember that these are all early and midcareer professionals. Aren’t these amazing contributions to counseling psychology?!</p>
<p>I asked my informants what they thought they have contributed to counseling psychology. They named the following areas: innovative practice, advocacy, policy development, leadership positions, mentoring students (particularly international and minority students), presentations and publications, consultation, professional service, and research and measure development on multicultural, immigrant, and international issues. In their own words,
<disp-quote>
<p>My contributions are being culturally and ethnically different, and bringing different perspectives to understanding psychological phenomena. I really think my major contribution is in this area—modeling and teaching a different cultural perspective in my professional role as a faculty member.</p>
<p>I have been the bridge between many international students and their American supervisors. There have been multiple times when I’ve advocated for international students and helped resolving cross-cultural misunderstandings.</p>
<p>I am one of a few who study South Asian issues.</p>
<p>Frequently internship and practicum sites are afraid to accept students with accents that are not English or American. It is important for us to address this with our colleagues who tend to be short-sighted by not wanting to work with these students.</p>
<p>My professional contributions that make me the proudest are the ones that have contributed to making international issues a more salient topic in counseling psychology. I have actively fought for international issues to be considered worthwhile and appreciated in counseling psychology.</p>
<p>I am a messenger for those who enrich my experiences here in the United States. My personal, professional, and clinical experiences here have given me a lot of research ideas. I translate these experiences into research questions, empirically validate these experiences, and help readers to understand these experiences.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Well, if you ask me what my contribution to counseling psychology is, I would say it is to be able to stand before you today, to deliver this Presidential Address which caused me agony for the past two years, especially on July 4th when I found out that my USB thumb drive crashed, causing me to have to rewrite my presentation. So this presentation is an achievement of a lifetime for me.</p>

<title>Wisdoms to Share</title>
<p>My last question for the informants was whether they had some advice or motto they wanted to share with international or immigrant students and early career professionals, as well as everyone else in counseling psychology. Here is what they said:</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude, I want to point out that my Presidential Address actually has some relevance to my three presidential projects: leadership academy, globalization, and videos. First, immigrants <italic>can</italic> be counseling psychology leaders in the United States. When I was elected President of Division 17, several international and Asian American colleagues told me that it meant a lot to them that I was elected. It made them feel that immigrants can be accepted and embraced as leaders of the counseling psychology profession. I have devoted much of my career and presidential year to leadership development in counseling psychology. I was blessed to have met great mentors. I want more students and early career professionals to have these opportunities, including immigrants and persons of color. Second, immigrant counseling psychologists play a significant role in globalization efforts in counseling psychology. They participate in the Globalization Special Task Group and its many workgroups, edit the International Forum of <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic>, serve as a bridge between American and overseas colleagues, conduct international research, provide international outreach when disasters strike, and advocate for human rights and psychological needs globally. Finally, you may wonder what immigrant counseling psychologists have to do with videos. I’m glad you asked. I’m going to show you a video of some of our immigrant colleagues. They are not necessarily the ones I interviewed for this presentation. You will see pictures of their childhood, their families, their countries of origin, and their work as counseling psychologists in the U.S. Ladies and gentlemen, the following video is a tribute to our dear colleagues, our immigrant counseling psychologists.
