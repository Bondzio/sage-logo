<title>Background</title>
<p>Although the value of occupation for health and well-being is fundamental to the occupational therapy profession, this view is not well recognized in the field of public health.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>In this article, we argue that occupational therapists have a unique and valuable perspective to bring to the field of public health, particularly with respect to the importance of occupational engagement in promoting the health and well-being of Canadians.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Key Issues</title>
<p>There are many compelling reasons for public health advocacy, including the need to increase awareness of the health benefits and risks of occupational engagement for individuals and communities. Challenges that lie ahead, however, include issues related to terminology, the complexity of occupation, the need to consider multidimensional outcomes, and diversity of evidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Implications</title>
<p>To move forward, the profession of occupational therapy in Canada needs to position health promotion messaging in a way that clearly captures the complexity and value of occupation and resonates with Canadians of all ages and abilities.</p>

<title>But</title>
<p>Dans cet article, les auteurs défendent l’argument selon lequel les ergothérapeutes peuvent mettre à contribution une perspective unique et judicieuse dans le domaine de la santé publique, particulièrement en ce qui concerne l’importance de la participation occupationnelle pour favoriser la santé et le bien-être des Canadiens. </p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Questions clés</title>
<p>De nombreuses raisons impérieuses peuvent justifier la promotion de la santé publique, notamment le besoin de sensibiliser davantage les différents intervenants aux avantages et aux risques associés à la participation occupationnelle pour la santé des individus et des collectivités. Toutefois, il reste de nombreux défis à relever, notamment les enjeux associés à la terminologie, la complexité de l’occupation, le besoin de considérer les résultats multidimensionnels et la diversité des données probantes.</p>

<title>Conséquences</title>
<p>Pour aller de l’avant, la profession de l’ergothérapie au Canada doit transmettre des messages sur la promotion de la santé qui expliquent clairement la complexité et la valeur de l’occupation et qui interpellent tous les Canadiens, quels que soient leur âge et leurs capacités.</p>

<p>The history of occupational therapy is rooted in an understanding of the important influence of occupation on health and well-being (Canadian Association of Occupational <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413482271">Therapists, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008417413482271">Polatajko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008417413482271">Wilcock, 2006</xref>). There is a growing body of research, both within and outside our profession, providing evidence-based support for this relationship. Although occupational therapists have been writing about the health-promoting potential of occupational therapy for many years (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008417413482271">Finlayson &amp; Edwards, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008417413482271">Jaffe, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008417413482271">Reitz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008417413482271">Scaffa, Van Slyke, &amp; Brownson, 2008</xref>), there is relatively little awareness in the broader public health field regarding the role of occupational engagement in promoting health and well-being.</p>
<p>Health promotion campaigns in Canada have typically focused on lifestyle changes related to diet, smoking, and exercise, a focus that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008417413482271">Nettleton (2006</xref>) describes as the “holy trinity of risk” (p. 241). The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), for example, professes a broad focus on health with its Integrated Pan-Canadian Healthy Living Strategy, yet the primary area of emphasis is on diet and exercise (Secretariat for the Intersectoral Healthy Living Network [SIHLN], Federal/Provincial/Territorial [F/P/T] Healthy Living Task Group [HLTG], &amp; F/P/T Advisory Committee on Population Health and Health Security [ACPHHS], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008417413482271">2005</xref>). The three key indicators of success in implementing the strategy are physical activity, healthy eating, and healthy body weights (SIHLN, F/P/T HLTG, &amp; F/P/T ACPHHS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008417413482271">2005</xref>). One of the drawbacks of this narrow focus on specific, individual behaviours is that it fails to take into account the complex yet powerful impact that many forms of occupational engagement can have on the health and well-being of individuals and communities. Occupational therapists can make an important contribution to the field of public health through our unique perspective regarding the value of enabling occupation. An occupational perspective focuses on individual and collective patterns of engagement, considering “how people live and seek identity; how people organize their habits, routine and choices to promote health; and how systems support (or do not support) the occupations that people want or need to do to be healthy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0008417413482271">Whiteford &amp; Townsend, 2011</xref>, p. 67). This perspective adds an important dimension to the discussion in public health regarding the nature of healthy living. We believe that occupational therapists have a role to play in advocating for the value of enabling occupation for Canadians of all ages, and all abilities, in all communities.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to advance a dialogue within our profession about health promotion from an occupational perspective, considering current research in the field as well as challenges and opportunities at a national level. Our position is grounded in a process of knowledge translation and stakeholder engagement that has unfolded over the past 2 years, involving decision makers from the public health community, potential knowledge users from the general public, and academic leaders from occupational therapy and the field of occupational science. At an early stage in the stakeholder engagement process, individual meetings with representatives from the PHAC as well as provincial health promotion advocates were scheduled to gauge their receptivity to initial ideas about health promotion from an occupational perspective. A follow-up meeting was scheduled approximately a year later with the PHAC to update the staff regarding our work to date. In addition, three focus group meetings (two in person and one via teleconference) were scheduled at an early stage with 20 potential knowledge users from the general public. A purposeful sample of participants was recruited to gather a range of perspectives from groups who could speak to experiences of marginalization and disruption in activity patterns. We included perspectives of high-risk youth, new immigrants, injured workers, seniors, veterans, and individuals from the First Nations, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender/queer, and disability communities. We purposively recruited representatives from local, provincial, and national consumer organizations. In the focus groups, we asked participants to discuss ideas related to the links between occupational engagement and health, the relevance and importance of these messages in their community, and the ways in which the ideas could be communicated. In addition to policy and knowledge user representatives, we felt that it was important to gather input from leaders in the occupational therapy and occupational science communities to develop an occupational perspective to inform public health. Virtual and in-person focus group meetings were held with 14 occupational therapists from across Canada who had been involved in education or research related to occupational engagement and public health. The purpose of the focus group was to gather feedback about emerging ideas and suggestions about positioning the ideas to public health policy makers and knowledge users. Input from all stakeholders contributed to our understanding of the challenges and opportunities for translating knowledge regarding the health-promoting potential of occupational engagement in the context of public health.</p>
<p>In this article, we will draw on the research literature as well as input from the stakeholder engagement process to (a) discuss how an occupational perspective could contribute to the field of public health, (b) consider compelling reasons for moving forward as well as challenges that we will face, and (c) discuss future directions for a leadership role in the field of public health.</p>

<title>Public Health</title>
<p>To situate our work within the field of public health, it is important to understand the scope of practice and central perspectives in the field. Public health has been defined as “the science and art of promoting health, preventing disease and prolonging life through the organized efforts of a given society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008417413482271">Marchildon &amp; McNut, 2007</xref>, p. 45). Rather than focusing on individuals, public health policies and programs tend to focus on the health of populations and communities, considering complex interactions between multiple social determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008417413482271">Tilson &amp; Gebbie, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Canada, the federal government has recommended six core functions for public health: population health assessment, surveillance, disease and injury control and prevention, health protection, emergency preparedness and response, and health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008417413482271">Deber, McDougall &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>). Administration and delivery of public health services is shared between the provincial and federal governments. The PHAC has a broad mandate to promote health, reduce health inequalities, and prevent and mitigate disease and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008417413482271">Aglukkaq, 2012</xref>). It provides various public health services and coordinates public health initiatives with the provinces and territories and the volunteer sector. The infrastructure for public health service delivery varies from one province/territory to the next. Most jurisdictions have a chief public health officer as well as some centrally administered public health services through the respective ministries of health, but many public health services are administered at the regional health authority level with local health units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008417413482271">Marchildon &amp; McNut, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Health promotion is one of the foci of public health. Health promotion, as defined in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, is “the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0008417413482271">World Health Organization [WHO], Health and Welfare Canada, &amp; Canadian Public Health Association, 1986</xref>, p. 1). It considers social and personal resources as well as individual capacities. The focus, therefore, is not only on healthy lifestyles but on creating the conditions necessary for health at individual, structural, social, and environmental levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008417413482271">Trentham, Cockburn, &amp; Shin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Potential links between health promotion and occupational therapy have been proposed by a number of sources within the occupational therapy community. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008417413482271">Wilcock (2006</xref>) argues for an occupation-focused approach to health promotion involving the following elements:<disp-quote>
<p>The application of medical, behavioral, social and occupational science to prevent physiological, psychological, social and occupational illness, accidents and disability; and to prolong quality of life for all people through advocacy, mediation and occupation-focused programs aimed at enabling people to do, be and become according to their natural health needs. (p. 282)</p>
</disp-quote> An American Occupational Therapy Association report on occupational therapy’s role in health promotion highlights three potential contributions of occupational therapy: promoting healthy lifestyles, emphasizing occupation as an essential element of health promotion strategies, and individual and population-level interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008417413482271">Scaffa et al., 2008</xref>). Examples cited in the report include falls prevention programs for seniors; consultation to workplaces regarding promotion of emotional well-being; consultation with contractors, architects, and city planners regarding accessibility and universal design; and advocating for full inclusion of children with disabilities in schools and day care programs. Similar examples of occupational therapy and health promotion exist in Canada, including initiatives related to falls prevention for seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008417413482271">Woodland &amp; Hobson, 2003</xref>), injury prevention for older drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008417413482271">Craik, 2011</xref>), workplace mental health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008417413482271">Moll &amp; Pond Clements, 2008</xref>), and community development in primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008417413482271">Trentham et al., 2007</xref>). A number of authors have advocated for increased occupational therapy contributions to the field of health promotion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008417413482271">Dyck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008417413482271">Filiatrault &amp; Richard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008417413482271">Finlayson &amp; Edwards, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008417413482271">Thibeault &amp; Hébert, 2006</xref>). Although there are examples of interventions with specific populations, there does not seem to be a unified set of principles within the profession of occupational therapy to guide health promotion practice. There is no national position statement in Canada outlining the role of occupational therapy in health promotion or public health. Advancing our role in the field of public health requires clear communication of how our occupational perspective might add value to current and future initiatives.</p>
<sec id="section2-0008417413482271">
<title>Why Promote Occupation as a Public Health Issue?</title>
<p>There are compelling reasons for occupational therapists to promote the value of an occupational perspective in the realm of public health and to advocate for the health-promoting value of occupation. A primary reason is that we can increase awareness of the benefits associated with occupation and its potential as a tool for health promotion as well as highlight the ways in which occupation can be a risk factor for ill health. Through increased awareness, we have the potential to engage in knowledge translation activities that could improve the health and well-being of Canadians.</p>
<sec id="section3-0008417413482271">
<title>Occupation as protective of health and well-being</title>
<p>A key impetus for occupational therapists to promote the importance and value of occupation is rooted in evidence that occupational engagement can improve health and well-being across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008417413482271">Wilcock, 2006</xref>). The value of occupation in promoting and protecting health and well-being is central to the identity of our profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0008417413482271">Townsend &amp; Polatajko, 2007</xref>). There is a growing body of empirical evidence both within and outside the profession that confirms the impact of meaningful occupation on health and well-being at all stages of life, even after controlling for other personal and environmental factors. For example, there is compelling evidence that youth engagement in structured extracurricular activities has a significant impact on a range of behavioural, health, and well-being outcomes. According to a comprehensive review of quantitative, peer-reviewed research conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008417413482271">Centre for Excellence in Youth Engagement (2003</xref>), youth engagement in extracurricular activities leads to reduced rates of delinquent behaviour, reduced alcohol and drug use, improvements in school attendance, increased physical activity, and improved family and community relationships. Although the majority of the data in this report was concurrent and correlational, additional large-scale longitudinal studies have confirmed these findings. One national longitudinal study of adolescent health explored the impact of active behaviour patterns versus sedentary behaviour patterns, reporting that engagement in a range of physical activities is positively associated with reduced risk behaviour, higher self-esteem, and higher academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008417413482271">Nelson &amp; Gordon-Larsen, 2006</xref>). Similar findings were reported in multiple waves of another longitudinal study of positive youth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008417413482271">Zarrett et al., 2009</xref>). The positive impact of quality after-school and school-based activity programs is particularly evident among low-income youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008417413482271">Terzian, Andrews, &amp; Moore, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>At the other end of the age spectrum, it has been argued that continued participation in social, economic, cultural, spiritual, and civic affairs as people age can enhance health and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0008417413482271">WHO, Ageing and Life Course Programme, 2002</xref>). For example, several review studies of older adults who engage in volunteer work report lower morbidity rates, higher physical function, higher self-reported health, lower depressive symptoms, and longer survival rates compared to those who do not volunteer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008417413482271">Gottlieb &amp; Gillespie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008417413482271">Onyx &amp; Warburton, 2003</xref>). Longitudinal research supports the finding that volunteering among older adults predicts better future health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008417413482271">Tang, 2009</xref>). Although it could be argued that health is a prerequisite for volunteering, several studies controlled for the effects of health, reporting that good health does enable volunteering but also that volunteering improves health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008417413482271">Morrow-Howell, 2010</xref>). In addition to evidence regarding the value of volunteer work, activities that promote physical, sensory, and mental fitness are linked to improved health and well-being among older adults. Findings from cross-sectional and case-control studies support the importance of active engagement in activities as a way of preserving cognitive, motor, and perceptual abilities during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008417413482271">Kattenstroth, Kolankowska, Kalisch, &amp; Dinse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008417413482271">Wang, Karp, Winblad, &amp; Fratiglioni, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0008417413482271">
<title>Occupation as a risk factor for ill health and reduced well-being</title>
<p>In contrast to the health-promoting benefits of occupation, it is important to raise awareness of the potential health and well-being risks associated with some patterns of occupation. There are limits to the health-promoting value of occupational engagement that require careful consideration of the social and political context within which it occurs. Changes in patterns of occupational engagement as a result of advances in technology or sociopolitical pressures may precipitate public health challenges at a population level.</p>
<p>Research cited in the previous section, regarding the value of occupational engagement for youth and seniors, needs to be critically examined in light of the context and nature of participation. For example, the extent to which youth benefit from extracurricular activities may be shaped by the skill of the coach or group leader, by relationships with peers, or by their ability to meet performance expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413482271">Larson, 2000</xref>). Some youth may experience anxiety associated with pressures to perform, and their self-esteem may decrease rather than increase if they are not able to meet expectations of themselves or others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413482271">Larson, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the amount of time spent in extracurricular activities needs to be considered. For example, concerns have been expressed about overuse injuries and burnout in children who are pushed to train in sports-related activities without an adequate break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008417413482271">Brenner, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The dangers of “overdoing it” are also mentioned in the literature related to older adults. Volunteering, for example, has many benefits, yet there are concerns that extensive hours spent volunteering could undermine well-being through role strain or role overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0008417413482271">Windsor, Anstey, &amp; Rodgers, 2008</xref>). Data from a longitudinal survey of Australian adults between the ages of 60 and 68 years showed that the highest rates of well-being were reported for those who engaged in at least 100 hours, but fewer than 800 hours, of volunteer work per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0008417413482271">Windsor et al., 2008</xref>). Concerns have also been expressed about pressures that older adults may feel to engage in an active lifestyle that is beyond their means or abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008417413482271">Laliberte Rudman, 2006</xref>). The societal image of the older adult as an active, autonomous consumer is pervasive, making it difficult for individuals who are not able to meet the societal ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008417413482271">Laliberte Rudman, 2006</xref>). A balanced approach therefore is needed to understanding the benefits and risks of occupational engagement.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of literature highlighting risks associated with changing patterns of occupational engagement across the life span. Technological advances have led to significant changes in how people do business and how they experience their leisure time. For children and youth, excessive “screen time” has been identified as a growing problem and one of the contributors to rising rates of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008417413482271">Anderson, Economos, &amp; Must, 2008</xref>). In Canada, the number of youth who exceed the recommended 2 hours of screen time per day rose from more than 54% in 2003 to more than 63% in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413482271">Brooker &amp; Hyman, 2010</xref>). Recommendations for the prevention of childhood obesity call for children to be active daily and to spend less time in sedentary pursuits, such as watching television and movies and playing video and computer games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008417413482271">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>). From an occupational perspective, these recommendations translate not necessarily to simply increasing physical activity but instead to a broader need for children to actively engage in their actual world through “doing.”</p>
<p>Technology has also changed how adults connect with their work and has resulted in important changes to the workplace. Rather than the traditional daytime schedule onsite at a workplace, the virtual workplace is increasingly common. Some concerns have been expressed regarding the decreased social contact and isolation of virtual workplaces, which can result in decreased mental and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0008417413482271">White, Hill, McGovern, Mills, &amp; Smeaton, 2003</xref>). Mobile devices that enable workers to be connected to their work 24/7 can lead to blurring of boundaries between work and home life and result in a negative impact on health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0008417413482271">White et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>All of these examples point to the ways in which patterns of activity engagement (or disengagement) can lead to significant public health concerns. These examples also point to opportunities for prevention through recognition of the important links between activity patterns, health, and well-being.</p>

<title>Occupation and public health benefits for society</title>
<p>An occupational perspective has the potential to not only improve the health and well-being of individuals but to also have a broader impact on society. One example is the report on Healthy Aging in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008417413482271">Healthy Aging and Wellness Working Group, F/P/T Committee of Officials [Seniors], 2006</xref>), which encourages communities to create age-friendly physical and social environments that will support older citizens to participate in their communities. Age-friendly communities are inclusive and accessible and recognize the important contributions of older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008417413482271">PHAC, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008417413482271">Trentham et al. (2007</xref>) provide an example of how occupational therapists have applied principles of health promotion and community development within a primary health care setting. Drawing on their work within a community health centre, they describe initiatives that began as a response to individual health concerns and evolved into a collective response to shared health experiences resulting in broad social action. A group of older adults was formed to improve neighbourhood accessibility and to make the local community more age friendly. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008417413482271">Parnell and Wilding (2010</xref>) describe the potential of an occupational perspective to enhance the development and implementation of pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure by prompting reflection about how and why people will use the pathways. Such a perspective can promote health and well-being by “enabling healthful doing” within the local community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008417413482271">Parnell &amp; Wilding, 2010</xref>, p. 346). When individuals are able to participate, they bring valuable skills, knowledge, and experience that can support important social initiatives and enhance the quality of community life.</p>

<title>Challenges to Promoting Occupation</title>
<p>Although there are many compelling reasons to propel us forward, there are also a number of challenges ahead in advancing ideas about occupational engagement within a public health framework. Challenges include the language that we use to communicate our ideas, the complexity of occupation, the multidimensional nature of occupational outcomes, and the diversity of evidence supporting the value of occupation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0008417413482271">
<title>Terminology</title>
<p>One of the initial challenges relates to the language or terminology that we use to communicate our ideas. <italic>Occupation</italic> is not currently in the lexicon of public health. When we used the term <italic>occupation</italic> with public health leaders, they immediately associated it with jobs. Even with an explanation of how occupational therapists conceptualize occupation, it was difficult to shift their thinking, and they advised us that the term would be confusing to the Canadian public. Alternative terms, such as <italic>activity</italic> and <italic>participation</italic>, seemed to be equally problematic since there was a strong association with purely physical activity. The current discourse in public health is rooted in language related to physical exercise rather than a broader interpretation of activity engagement (SIHLN, F/P/T HLTG, &amp; F/P/T ACPHHS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008417413482271">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As our project progressed and we gained more experience meeting with stakeholders outside of the profession, we avoided terminology such as <italic>occupation</italic> and <italic>activity</italic>. Instead, we talked about “doing” and found it effective to begin discussions by asking stakeholders to reflect on the things that they do to enhance their sense of well-being. A similar strategy was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008417413482271">Parnell and Wilding (2010</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>When people reflect upon their experiences of everyday doing, many understand that what they do can contribute to their health. For example, if people consider how they feel when they are doing their favourite occupations, it quickly becomes apparent to them that performing these occupations enhances their lives. However, it is rare for people to make this link automatically. (p. 346)</p>
</disp-quote> Although grounding ideas in personal experiences is helpful, the links between doing and well-being were still closely tied to behaviours related to diet, exercise, and smoking. A paradigm shift is needed to expand the discourse of health promotion to include a broader perspective on the health-promoting value of a range of activities or occupations, from taking care of ourselves to contributing to society and experiencing pleasure and joy. Whatever term we decide to use, it needs to not only be easily understood by the general public but clearly explained and positioned within the lexicon of public health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0008417413482271">
<title>Complexity of occupation</title>
<p>A second challenge in promoting ideas within a public health community relates to the complexity of occupation as understood within our profession. It is challenging to communicate the multidimensional, multifaceted aspects of occupation into clear, understandable ideas that will be understood by the general public. Our traditional categorization of self-care, productivity, and leisure, for example, may not be the most effective way to capture the health promoting nature of occupation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0008417413482271">Whalley Hammel (2009)</xref> criticizes this categorization as based on faulty assumptions that fail to consider cultural and class-based differences. She argues that we need to consider universal perspectives regarding meaningful activities and their links to health and well-being. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008417413482271">Jonsson (2008</xref>) argues that we should “seek alternative and complementary ways to conceptualize occupation” that “open new possibilities” to better enable us to develop knowledge about the relationships between occupation, human development, health, and well-being (p. 3). He argues that we need to “investigate alternative ways to classify occupations based on how people experience them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008417413482271">Jonsson, 2008</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<p>Positioning occupation as an agent of health and well-being, therefore, requires clear communication of our occupational perspective, considering the multifaceted dimensions of occupational engagement that are rooted in the experiences of all Canadians, regardless of age, gender, cultural background, or ability. Translating our beliefs about the nature and importance of day-to-day patterns of occupational engagement will require identification of simple, yet powerful, ideas that will resonate with the Canadian public and also capture the nuances of the health-promoting dimensions of occupation (e.g., choice, meaning, cultural relevance). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008417413482271">Wilcock (2006</xref>) proposed the dimensions of “doing, being, becoming, and belonging” as a way of capturing the dimensions of occupational engagement that affect health. This is one example of an alternate system of categorization that departs from our traditional classifications of self-care, productivity, and leisure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0008417413482271">
<title>Multidimensional outcomes</title>
<p>A third challenge relates to the importance of promoting outcomes that move beyond physical illness and disability to outcomes that reflect broader dimensions of health and well-being. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0008417413482271">WHO (n.d.)</xref>, health is more than the absence of disease; it is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. This definition is helpful in that it moves beyond a narrow view of health and considers multiple dimensions of well-being. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008417413482271">Canadian Index of Wellbeing (2012</xref>) is a promising population health initiative that advances a broad perspective on the quality of life of Canadians, including comparisons of well-being to other nations. The index cites dimensions of well-being, such as time use, participation in leisure and cultural activities, and democratic engagement, all of which are consistent with an occupational perspective. In this way, an occupational perspective on health and well-being may present an important opportunity to explicitly integrate biomedical perspectives and social perspectives on health.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of occupation, a single occupation or discrete activity will have multiple outcomes, and the meaning and value of occupation will most likely vary from one person to the next. There are many dimensions of experience that can shape well-being, such as activating one’s mind and body, expressing personal identity, connecting with others, developing capacities and potential, contributing to society, and experiencing pleasure or joy. The complexity of occupation becomes a strength in that any single occupation or discrete activity has the power to embody multiple experiences of well-being. Gardening, for example, can be a form of exercise, a method of relieving stress, a form of creative expression or sensory stimulation, a way of connecting with others, a place for learning new skills, or a vehicle for spiritual healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0008417413482271">Unruh, Smith, &amp; Scammell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008417413482271">Söderback, Söderström, &amp; Schälander, 2004</xref>). The health and well-being impact of engaging in gardening, or of any other discrete occupation, may vary depending on the personal and social context within which it is embedded, the nature of the occupation itself, and the social conditions in which it is performed. An occupation may be health promoting for some while providing limited meaning or value to others. Even within the same individual, the meaning and value of a particular occupation may evolve over time. An occupation such as cooking a meal, for example, could initially be an exercise in skill building but later become a work or leisure activity.</p>
<p>The complex, multidimensional nature of occupation makes it impossible to translate the accumulating evidence about the link to between occupation, health, and well-being into simple and prescriptive guidelines for occupational engagement, equivalent to Canada’s Food Guide or the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008417413482271">Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 2012</xref>). Rather than specific prescriptions regarding the type and amount of occupation, it may be more helpful to develop a set of guiding principles to facilitate reflection on activity patterns and options for occupational engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0008417413482271">
<title>Diversity of evidence</title>
<p>A fourth challenge concerns the diversity of evidence regarding the links between occupation, health, and well-being, from large scale population-based research to qualitative studies that capture the experience of occupational engagement. Many of the occupational therapy stakeholders we met with during the course of this work emphasized the value of personal stories that illustrate the unique meaning and value of occupational engagement and the power of sharing these stories with a range of audiences. They explained that stories prompt reflection and can establish shared understanding about the experience of occupational engagement and its potential to promote health and well-being. While personal stories can be powerful, it is important to note that public health interventions are typically based on a population-health approach. Action is directed at the health of an entire population, or subpopulation, rather than individuals (SIHLN, F/P/T HLTG, &amp; F/P/T ACPHHS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008417413482271">2005</xref>). There is a need to gather evidence that moves beyond individual stories to group and population-based outcomes and then to strategically translate this evidence for different audiences. Strategically focusing on population-level issues that have been identified as a priority may be a way to move the agenda forward (e.g., youth or seniors).</p>
<p>However, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008417413482271">Dutton, Campbell, Elliot, and McLaren (2012</xref>), translating even robust evidence to decision makers might be insufficient to ensure adoption and implementation of approaches and policies that could promote health and well-being. Drawing on lessons learned from the history of public health in Canada, Dutton et al. highlights the particular challenge of health promotion where the potential benefits are far upstream as individuals and populations maintain or improve their health. It will be important for us to draw on evidence to highlight short-term, medium-term, and long-term outcomes to engage with stakeholders and decision makers.</p>

<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>An occupational perspective has the potential to enhance the current discourse in public health regarding the nature of healthy living and strategies to promote health through occupation. The profession of occupation therapy has long embraced the relationship between occupation, health, and well-being; therefore, we have an opportunity for our profession to take a leadership role in advocating for the health-promoting potential of occupation at a national level. The road forward, however, must be carefully negotiated to ensure success.</p>
<p>First, we need to build a framework that will be understood by the general public as well as policy makers regarding the links between occupation, health, and well-being. The language needs to be easily understood yet capture the complexity of the concept of occupational engagement and the multidimensional links to the health and well-being of individuals and communities. Rather than being prescriptive, the framework needs to inspire reflection on the nature of our engagement in everyday occupations and facilitate identification of strategies for optimizing these patterns of engagement. The ideas need to be compelling and resonate with Canadians of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p>An important aspect of any knowledge translation initiative is engaging stakeholders in the process, including leaders from the public health and health promotion community as well as user groups from the general public. We need to be strategic about using concepts and ideas that resonate within existing public health frameworks. The Pan-Canadian Healthy Living Strategy, developed in 2005 (SIHLN, F/P/T HLTG, &amp; F/P/T ACPHHS, 2005) and strengthened in 2010, outlines a framework for promoting overall health outcomes and reducing health disparities among all Canadians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008417413482271">PHAC, 2010</xref>). The overall vision of preventing chronic disease and promoting good health is congruent with our values; therefore, there is an opportunity to position our efforts as an extension of the current strategy. Partnerships with organizations such as the PHAC as well as national, provincial, and local user groups may lead to a greater impact than if we act alone. In the next few years, we will expand the discussions we have begun with diverse groups across Canada about the concept of occupation and its relationship to health and well-being. These discussions will continue to inform our efforts in positioning the concept of occupational engagement within the discourse of public health.</p>
<p>Another key element as we move forward is building a strong base of evidence to support our ideas. The burgeoning field of occupational science when combined with rigorous research from occupational therapy and other fields will contribute to the evidence base required for education and advocacy. There are many forms of evidence from diverse sources that can be critically reviewed and synthesized to build understanding and support.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to be bold in advancing these ideas within the field of public health. We do not “own” the ideas or evidence regarding occupation, but we can take a leadership role in educating others about the value of and strategies for enabling occupation. Just as dieticians are recognized as experts and consultants regarding diet recommendations in the Canadian Food Guide, occupational therapists have the potential to be expert consultants with respect to recommendations in a “National Activity Guide.” Rather than “giving away” our expertise regarding occupation and health, we believe that a national guide will strengthen our position as leaders in the public health field. We can fill a gap in the public health domain and are well positioned to add a unique occupation-based perspective to the field. As described by an occupational therapist who participated in one of our focus groups:<disp-quote>
<p>As occupational therapists, we believe in occupation and participation but I don’t think we have succeeded yet to give this message to the whole population. I see it more than just promoting our profession. I see it as a vision for the society.</p>
</disp-quote> This call to action has exciting implications not only for our profession but for all Canadians.</p>
