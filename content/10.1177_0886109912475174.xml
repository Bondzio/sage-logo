<p><italic>Offending Women Power, Punishment, and the Regulation of Desire </italic>offers the reader an unvarnished vista into the harsh daily realities of incarcerated women who are housed with their children at alternative, community-based prisons. This is a candid and sometimes disturbing account of Haney’s critical ethnographic research within two California penal institutions that began in the 1990s at Alliance and concluded a decade later at Visions.</p>
<p>Throughout <italic>Offending Women,</italic> Haney candidly explicates the gendered practices of these two California penal institutions (Alliance and Visions) in the 1990s and again in 2002. Her analysis encompasses a decade in U.S. history that was rife with transformations on both the state and national levels. The analysis is premised on the startling development that the United States is now the worldwide leader in imprisonment and that there has been a 650% increase in the number of women in prison in the United States since the 1980s. The additional transformations that Haney integrates into her account are welfare reform, “three strikes” drug enforcement legislation, state devolution, and privatization. Haney’s analysis identifies and responds to how these critical changes have affected the lives of poor women, women who have historically had their lives regulated by the state either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><italic>Offending Women </italic>focuses on the women’s time in the penal system, which has added another layer of regulation, one that Haney describes lasts for years after the women have served their time.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Haney crisply integrates feminist insights to explain better how state institutions govern women through restrictions of their rights and their continual narrowing of how these women are able to define and meet their needs. This insidious narrowing of individual need is evidenced by Alliance’s sole discourse on dependence and Vision’s singular focus on the regulation of desire as their primary methods of intervention. Throughout, Haney uncovers the “gendered underpinning” of these methods of control and intervention that are currently used in our correctional system.</p>
<p>Alliance and Visions can be viewed as two modes of state regulation that evolved from California’s state government response to the need to “correct” its traditional corrections programs. Alliance viewed all dependence as emanating from the women’s historical dependence on men and a paternalistic state welfare system without addressing the complexity of poverty or engaging in efforts to gain further education or training, while Visions relied on the discourse of desire to define what women should want and where they should find pleasure.</p>
<p>Although the programs shared a similar ideology in their attempts to empower and embolden their charges against the “real” threats to leading independent and successful lives, Haney astutely posits that these programs’ gendered focus and their lack of understanding and integration of the broader systemic, institutional, and societal inequalities will undoubtedly further these women’s sense of disenfranchisement and disentitlement.</p>
<p>The book is well written, interesting, and engaging. Haney’s brilliant analysis offers the reader insights into the complexity of the issues that affect women and children who are living in alternative, community-based prisons.</p>
