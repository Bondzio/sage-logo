<abstract>
<p>Research suggests that lesbians turn to the Internet for information regarding their sexual health. However, limited research has examined the availability of online sexual health resources for this population. This study evaluated the volume, scope, and readability of sexual health information available to lesbians on the Internet. The top three Nielsen-rated search engines were used to identify websites generated using the search term “lesbian sexual health.” A content analysis was conducted of 25 unique, functioning websites (46 webpages total) and Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch–Kincaid grade levels were calculated. Nearly one third of the websites were located outside the United States; two were U.S. government sites. Although most sites provided information about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS (52% to 72%), fewer provided information about safer sex practices (12% to 56%), reproductive cancers (24% to 36%), intimate partner violence (16%), family planning issues (0% to 12%), or other preventive health practices, such as mammograms and gynecological exams (4% to 44%) for lesbians. Readability of websites was much higher than recommended for health materials. Lesbians are in need of comprehensive and reliable sexual health information on the Internet. In particular, sexual health messages written in plain language are needed to encourage safer sex and other preventive practices among lesbians.</p>

<p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are often assumed to be less prevalent among sexual minority (nonheterosexual) women, particularly lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910390314">Bell, Ompad, &amp; Sherman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910390314">Marrazzo, Coffey, &amp; Bingham, 2005</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that STIs are a significant health issue for lesbians and that lesbians are more frequently diagnosed with a variety of STIs, particularly bacterial vaginosis, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, genital herpes, and Chlamydia, compared with heterosexual women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910390314">Bauer &amp; Welles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910390314">Evans, Scally, Wellard, &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910390314">Fethers, Marks, Mindel, &amp; Estcourt, 2000</xref>). In fact, researchers have reported between 13% and 44% of lesbians being diagnosed with an STI in the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910390314">Bauer &amp; Welles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910390314">Evans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910390314">Fethers et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of STIs, many lesbians do not perceive themselves to be at risk for, and in some instances feel “invulnerable” to, infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910390314">Marrazzo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524839910390314">Stevens &amp; Hall, 2001</xref>). This perception is primarily because of a general lack of knowledge of the potential for STI transmission between women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910390314">Marrazzo et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, lesbians receive fewer gynecological exams that include Pap tests than heterosexual women, despite recommendations that cervical cancer screening in lesbians not differ from screening recommendations for women in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910390314">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910390314">Marrazzo, Koutsky, Kiviat, Kuypers, &amp; Stine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839910390314">Matthews, Brandenburg, Johnson, &amp; Hughes, 2004</xref>). In some instances, health care providers themselves have misperceptions regarding the sexual behaviors in which lesbians engage, causing them to underestimate STI risk and/or fail to discuss STIs, reproductive cancers, safer sex, and/or other preventive health practices with their lesbian patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910390314">Marrazzo, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Considered a critical aspect of STI prevention, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have reframed STI prevention efforts to promote sexual health more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524839910390314">WHO, 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524839910390314">WHO (2002)</xref>, “sexual health” is
<disp-quote><p>A state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity . . . which requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences free of coercion, discrimination, and violence.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Moreover, “sexual health” is one of six key concepts listed within the <italic>Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education</italic> and includes seven topics: reproductive health; contraception; pregnancy and prenatal care; abortion; sexually transmitted diseases; HIV and AIDS; and sexual abuse, assault, violence, and harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910390314">National Guidelines Task Force, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To promote sexual health among lesbians, effective health communication strategies that address the broad range of sexual health topics are needed. Previous research suggests that targeted health communication messages can increase people’s awareness of health risks and promote positive health behaviors. Health communication campaigns have been effective in raising the general population’s awareness of hypertension risk, increasing physical activity, improving smoking cessation rates, increasing seatbelt use, and promoting HIV/AIDS prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910390314">Berkley-Patton, Goggin, Liston, Bradley-Ewing, &amp; Neville, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839910390314">O’Connor, Warttig, Conner, &amp; Lawton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524839910390314">Yap, Hemmings, &amp; Davis, 2009</xref>). The effectiveness of communication about HIV/AIDS prevention has also been explored among specific populations, including gay men, injection drug users, African American adolescents, and rural African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910390314">Horner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910390314">Kelly et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839910390314">Myrick, 1999</xref>). However, limited research has explored HIV, STI, or sexual health messages developed for the lesbian community. Thus, very little is known about sexual health communication with this population of women.</p>
<p>One channel frequently recommended for connecting with hard to reach populations is the World Wide Web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910390314">Christensen &amp; Hickie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910390314">Monaghan &amp; Wood, 2010</xref>). Using the Internet as a vehicle for health communication has been particularly successful as it allows people to search anonymously for information on sensitive topics, including sexual health and preventive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839910390314">Rideout, 2002</xref>). Moreover, access and speed of access to health information on the Internet has increased dramatically in recent years. For instance, more than 72 million households in the United States had access to the Internet in 2007 and 80% of Internet users (or 113 million Americans) searched for health information online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910390314">Fox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524839910390314">U.S. Census Bureau, 2007</xref>). Today, close to 50% of adults seek health information from the Internet before contacting their health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910390314">Fox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910390314">Hesse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524839910390314">U.S. Census Bureau, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Internet use is also high among gays and lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910390314">Harris Interactive, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910390314">2004</xref>). In 2001, it was estimated that 10.6% of the 127 million Internet users were gay or lesbian and that these individuals spent more time online and engaged in proportionately more e-commerce than did nongay users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910390314">Harris Interactive, 2001</xref>). A more recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910390314">Harris Interactive (2004)</xref> poll found that the top two uses of the Internet among gays and lesbians were to stay connected with friends and family and to seek general news and information. The Internet offers an excellent means of reaching gays and lesbians, particularly young gays and lesbians, for reliable health information, programming, and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390314">Drabble, Keatley, &amp; Marcelle, 2003</xref>). In fact, access to lesbian-specific information on the Internet, as well as from health care providers, was a recurrent request among diverse groups of lesbians (aged 22-63 years) in a recent investigation of their health care preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524839910390314">Seaver, Freund, Wright, Tija, &amp; Frayne, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers and educators have successfully incorporated Internet-based messages within health marketing campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910390314">Drabble et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839910390314">O’Connor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524839910390314">Yap et al., 2009</xref>). There are credible consumer-oriented websites containing women’s health resources (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://women.webmd.com/lesbian-health">http://women.webmd.com/lesbian-health</ext-link>); however, the extent to which tailored information regarding sexual health issues is available to lesbian women is unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the volume and scope of sexual health information available to lesbians on the Internet.</p>
<p>The <italic>Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education</italic> (third edition) was used to identify topics that websites should ideally include when addressing “sexual health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910390314">National Guidelines Task Force, 2004</xref>). Developed by experts in the fields of adolescent development, sexuality, health care, and education, the <italic>Guidelines</italic> have been used for more than two decades to help educators create new and/or evaluate existing sexuality education programs and curricula and have been used as a framework of topics that sexuality programs should ideally include (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910390314">National Guidelines Task Force, 2004</xref>). For this investigation, the sexual health topics assessed included the following: STIs (including HIV, modes of transmission, and safer sex practices); reproductive health (exams, vaccines, and reproductive cancers); contraception (birth control pills and condoms); pregnancy and prenatal care (as well as artificial insemination and childbirth); abortion (and adoption); intimate partner violence; and communication with partner(s) and health care providers. Readability of online information was also calculated to determine the difficulty level of web-based sexual health resources for lesbians.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The top three Nielsen-rated search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and MSN) were identified and used to identify popular websites generated using the search term “lesbian sexual health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524839910390314">Sullivan, 2006</xref>). Previous research demonstrates that Internet users explore only the first links on search engines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910390314">Eysenbach &amp; Kohler, 2002</xref>). Thus, the top 100 English-language websites from each of the three search engines were identified on August 28, 2008. From these 300 websites, advertisements, blogs, books, and Wiki sites were excluded. Each remaining unique site was then assigned a score depending on its placement within the search engine results. For example, if a website was the first site identified on the search engine, it received 100 points. The next site was given 99 points and so forth. This type of scoring system has been used previously to locate and analyze health-related content across multiple search engines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390314">Friedman, Hoffman-Goetz, &amp; Arocha, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910390314">Friedman &amp; Kao, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Content analysis is a widely used method for studying public health communication, specifically for identifying and assessing the volume and scope of health messages and the characteristics of these messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910390314">Kreps &amp; Maibach, 2008</xref>). In this investigation, each website’s home page, along with up to three additional links from the home page (i.e., internal webpages), were examined and coded to determine whether information was provided regarding the variety of sexual health topics as defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839910390314">National Guidelines Task Force (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>A comprehensive coding sheet was developed containing the following categories and subcategories/response options and used by the authors to evaluate the content of each website. Webpages were coded whether information was provided about STI types (bacterial vaginosis, Chlamydia, genital herpes, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus [HPV], pubic lice, syphilis, and trichomoniasis); modes of STI transmission (from sharing sex toys, from woman to woman, through body fluids, through direct contact, through fingering, via sex, via anal sex, via oral sex, via vaginal sex); safer sex recommendations (cleaning sex toys, not sharing sex toys, using condoms on sex toys, using condoms with male sex partners, and using dental dams); reproductive cancers (breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer); preventive health care recommendations (annual gynecological exams, breast self-exams, HPV vaccination, mammograms, and pap smears); relationships and communication (the importance of communication with partners and health care providers about safer sex, STIs and sexual health, and intimate partner violence); and family planning (artificial insemination, adoption, abortion, birth control pills, prenatal care, pregnancy, and childbirth).</p>
<p>To confirm consistent and accurate coding, 5 website home pages and 15 webpages within these 5 sites were randomly selected. All three authors independently conducted coding and then met to discuss the coding of topic subcategories. The result indicated a high degree of coding agreement. The authors added codes when needed based on website content and discussed the few coding differences until they were in complete agreement before coding of all 25 websites was conducted.</p>
<p>Two validated and common readability tools used to assess the reading difficulty level of print and online health content are (a) the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910390314">Flesch, 1948</xref>), ranging from 100 (very easy to read) to 0 (unreadable) and (b) the Flesch–Kincaid (FK) grade level formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910390314">Kincaid, Fishburne, Rogers, &amp; Chissom, 1975</xref>), a modified version of the FRE that generates a reading grade level based on word and sentence length. Computer software programs (e.g., Microsoft Office Word) calculate the FK and the FRE by estimating the number of syllables per passage. Content from the study websites was entered into Word and readability calculated. Both FK and FRE have been used to assess the reading difficulty of other web-based health information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390314">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910390314">Friedman, Tanwar, &amp; Richter, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Website Characteristics</title>
<p>From the 300 websites identified using “lesbian sexual health” as the search term on the selected search engines, 25 unique and functioning websites were included in this analysis (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524839910390314">appendix</xref>). Of the 275 websites that were excluded, 65% were advertisements and 35% were websites providing links to other sites that were books, blogs, or Wiki sites. Of the 25 websites included in the analysis, 6 (24%) had domains of .org, 6 (24%) were .com, and 5 (20%) were .edu, and two (8%) were United States government sites as indicated by their .gov address. A total of 8 (32%) sites originated outside of the United States. Four (16%) originated in Canada (.ca), 2 (8%) originated in the United Kingdom (.uk), and 2 originated in Australia (one is listed as an .edu and one as an .org site).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839910390314">
<title>Sexual Health Information on the Websites</title>
<p>HIV was the most frequently discussed sexual health condition, as it appeared in 72% of the websites. Approximately two thirds of the sites discussed other STIs, including bacterial vaginosis (68%), Chlamydia (68%), genital herpes (68%), hepatitis B (64%), and HPV (64%).</p>
<p>However, notably fewer sites (24% to 52%) discussed gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, or pubic lice (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910390314">Table 1</xref>). Most of the websites discussed that STIs could be transmitted “from woman to woman” (76%), via “sex” (76%), through “direct contact” (72%), and through “body fluids” (68%). A total of 60% discussed that STIs could be transmitted via “oral sex” and fewer than half the sites discussed that STIs could be transmitted from “sharing sex toys” (48%), via “anal sex” (48%), or through “fingering” (inserting fingers into the vagina and/or rectum; 32%).</p>

<p>Methods for preventing the transmission of STIs via specific safer sex practices were not frequently discussed in the websites. Just more than half the sites discussed using condoms on sex toys and using dental dams during oral–vaginal or oral–anal sex (56% each), whereas 48% of the sites recommended that lesbians use condoms when having vaginal intercourse with men. Notably fewer sites discussed the importance of cleaning sex toys when sharing them with sex partners (36%), and only 12% discussed not sharing sex toys as a means of preventing the transmission of STIs.</p>
<p>Information about reproductive cancers among lesbians was much less prevalent in these websites than was information about STIs. Just more than one third of the sites (36%) discussed cervical cancer, whereas 28% discussed breast cancer and 24% discussed ovarian cancer. With regard to preventive health practices, including those associated with early detection of reproductive cancers, few were discussed. A total of 44% percent of the websites recommended that lesbians obtain annual gynecological exams and Pap tests, respectively, whereas only 20% of the sites recommended monthly breast self-exams, 16% recommended mammograms for women older than 40 years, and 4% recommended the HPV vaccination as a means of preventing HPV and/or cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Overall, 44% of the sites recommended that lesbians communicate with their health care provider about their sexual health and sexual behaviors, whereas fewer recommended that they communicate with their partner(s) about STIs (20%) or safer sex (16%). Only 16% of the sites discussed intimate partner violence among lesbians. Few family planning issues were discussed in these websites. In all, 16% of the sites discussed lesbians’ use of the birth control pill, whereas 12% discussed artificial insemination, adoption, and pregnancy, respectively. Only 4% of sites discussed abortion or prenatal care for lesbians who were pregnant, none of the sites discussed childbirth.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from this study revealed that limited sexual health resources are available to lesbians on the Internet. Of the 300 websites identified in response to the search term “lesbian sexual health,” only 25 were unique, functioning sites that were not advertisements, books, blogs, or Wiki sites. Moreover, nearly one third of the websites did not originate within the U.S. and only two were U.S. government sites. Clearly, additional online sexual health resources are needed for this population, developed by reliable health sources.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, lesbians have been diagnosed more often than heterosexual women with bacterial vaginosis, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, genital herpes, and Chlamydia. Our study found that most of the sites (52% to 68%) did address these STIs. However, it is important to note that one third to nearly one half of the sites did not mention these STIs at all. Furthermore, HIV, which has not been as prevalent in the lesbian community as the other aforementioned STIs, was the most frequently discussed health condition by these sites. The lack of comprehensive STI information by most of these sites may explain, at least in part, why there is a lack of knowledge and/or underestimation of STI risk among lesbians.</p>
<p>Other gaps and inconsistencies in the sexual health information provided to lesbians on the Internet were found with regard to HPV. For example, HPV was discussed as an STI with which lesbians should be concerned in nearly two thirds of the websites assessed. However, notably fewer sites discussed the link between HPV and cervical cancer, the importance of regular (annual) gynecological exams and Pap tests for the early detection of cervical cancer, or the availability of the HPV vaccine for lesbians. To prevent HPV and/or cervical cancer among lesbians all of this information must be provided to them.</p>
<p>Additional gaps could be found with regard to STI transmission and safer sex recommendations for lesbians. Although most sites broadly discussed STI transmission “from woman to woman,” “direct contact,” and “body fluids,” many did not address STI risk with regard to specific sexual behaviors in which lesbians are most likely to engage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910390314">Koh, Gomez, Shade, &amp; Rowley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910390314">Marrazzo et al., 2005</xref>). For example, fewer sites discussed STI transmission via oral sex, anal sex, from sharing sex toys, or through fingering. Similarly, although most sites discussed the use of condoms with male partners, using condoms on sex toys, and using dental dams for oral–vaginal and oral–anal sex, few discussed the importance of cleaning sex toys or not sharing sex toys for the prevention of STIs. This suggests that lesbians may not be receiving complete information pertinent to their STI risk and/or safer sex practices beyond the use of barrier methods.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, very few websites discussed lesbians’ risk for reproductive cancers, particularly breast cancer. In fact, only 28% of sites discussed breast cancer, 20% discussed breast self-exams, and 16% discussed mammograms for older lesbians. This was particularly surprising as there is a perception that breast cancer is an epidemic in the lesbian community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524839910390314">Solarz, 1999</xref>). This assumption of higher risk for breast cancer among lesbians is primarily based on previous research indicating that certain cancer risk factors, such as higher rates of smoking, alcohol use, greater body mass index, and lower likelihood of childbearing, occur at higher levels or with greater frequency in lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524839910390314">Solarz, 1999</xref>). However, no epidemiological studies have supported a conclusion that lesbians are at greater risk for breast or other cancers than their heterosexual counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524839910390314">Solarz, 1999</xref>). Regardless, breast cancer remains the second most common cancer in and killer of women in the United States and an important health issue about which lesbians should be aware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910390314">American Cancer Society, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Family planning information was virtually nonexistent (≤16%) for lesbians on these sites. Although lesbians may be less likely than their heterosexual counterparts to use birth control pills, experience a pregnancy and/or have children, many do use birth control pills, both to prevent pregnancy and/or to regulate their menstrual cycle, and many lesbians and lesbian couples do wish to have children and are in need of family planning information, including information about artificial insemination, adoption, prenatal care, and childbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524839910390314">Solarz, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the Internet, health care providers are an important source for information regarding lesbians’ sexual health information. However, very few websites discussed the importance of lesbians communicating with their health care providers about their sexual health and/or risk behaviors. Moreover, the importance of lesbians communicating with their sex partners about STIs, safer sex, and/or sexual health was virtually nonexistent on these sites. As with other populations, it is vital that lesbians are provided with information and specific examples of how they can initiate conversations regarding STIs, safer sex, and sexual health with both their partners and health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839910390314">Politi, Clark, Armstrong, McGarry, &amp; Sciamanna, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839910390314">Sales et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the readability of the 25 websites identified for analysis, most were written at an advanced reading level, well above the recommended fifth to sixth grade reading level for health communication materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910390314">Meade, McKinney, &amp; Barnas, 1994</xref>). Other readability analysis of web-based health content demonstrates similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390314">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910390314">Friedman et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, the two U.S. government sites had the lowest reading ease and highest grade level of all the sites evaluated. This is of particular concern, because although these sites are reliable sources for health information, they were written at a difficult level, using medical jargon that many women may find difficult to understand. To effectively communicate with a broader audience of lesbian women, these online resources must be rewritten in clear language.</p>
<sec id="section7-1524839910390314">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>This was the first study to examine the volume, scope, and readability of Internet resources available for lesbians addressing their sexual health. Thus, results may be helpful to health professionals providing sexual health information online to lesbians and/or different populations of women. However, it is also important to note the limitations of this study and to encourage caution when interpreting results.</p>
<p>First, the search for websites evaluated in this investigation was conducted on one specific date in 2008. New websites and updated information that were developed and posted online since that date are not included in the analyses of this investigation. Moreover, some of the sites that were included in the analyses may no longer be working or their search engine placement may have changed, possibly resulting in a different list of websites selected using the website scoring system. Second, the only search term used in this investigation was “lesbian sexual health.” Other search terms or key works such as “lesbian sex,” “lesbian health,” “lesbian safer sex,” and so on, which may have identified additional websites, were not used. Third, other populations of sexual minority women (SMW), particularly bisexual women, were not included in this investigation. Thus, it is possible that websites targeting other SMW addressed sexual health issues not included in this investigation. Lastly, the search in this investigation was limited to three search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and MSN). Additional websites addressing lesbian sexual health not identified by these three search engines were not included in this investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839910390314">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This research indicates that not only is there a lack of sexual health information available to lesbians on the Internet but also the information that does exist is often incomplete and written at an advanced level. Health professionals should take note of these findings and begin to create or re-create sexual health materials for this population. Additionally, any sexual health information that is created needs to be both comprehensive and written in plain language. Most sites evaluated in this study did not include complete information about a variety of sexual health issues for lesbians, including STIs, safer sex practices, reproductive cancers, preventive health practices, intimate partner violence, or family planning. Therefore, future sexual health resources published on the Internet should include this information.</p>
<p>Future research is needed to inform the development of a reliable Internet website for lesbians with complete, accurate, and up-to-date sexual health information. This research should include formative, qualitative interviews and/or focus groups conducted with different subgroups of lesbians (i.e., different racial/ethnic and age groups in different geographic locations) to determine the types of health information lesbians are seeking, and their ideas and opinions for the delivery of online sexual health messages. Once such a website is created, evaluations must be conducted with these groups of sexual minority women to determine if the site is useable and if the information is relevant and culturally appropriate.</p>
