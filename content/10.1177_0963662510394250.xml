<abstract>
<p>This article reports on a media study on the coverage of sociobiology (SB) in the German media. The analyses show a decoupling between the academic discussion and the German media coverage: when the scientific debates about SB were at their height (late 1970s), nearly no reporting occurred in the German press, whereas from the middle of the 1990s onwards, when the academic discussion had settled, SB was presented increasingly often. The case reveals the importance of cultural contexts in shaping popular science coverage, making SB a non-issue in the German media at the times of its most intense scientific debate. Factors contributing to this particular situation in German academia and popular culture are discussed. Comparisons with other studies show how the late renaissance of SB in Germany in the late 1990s is due to media attention towards the new biosciences.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>This article tackles a blind spot in Public Understanding of Science (PUS) and science communication research: the absence of science in the public sphere. It is, so to speak, an article about something that did not happen: the sociobiology debate in Germany. Since the late 1970s sociobiology (SB) had become a major scientific controversy, especially with regard to human social behaviours. Criticism centred around SB’s contentious claim that genes play an ultimate role in human behaviour and therefore traits such as aggressiveness, gender roles and sexual attraction and even homosexuality can be explained by evolutionary theory. The idea of asserting a genetic basis for the most social of human behaviours, or, as Wilson put it, that ‘genes hold culture on a leash’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0963662510394250">Wilson, 1978</xref>), evoked adversely critical responses to SB, defending human behaviour as the consequence of social processes. Wilson’s enterprise included a harsh confrontation with the social sciences: ‘One of the functions of sociobiology is to reformulate the foundations of the social sciences … Sociology and the other social sciences, as well as the humanities, are the last branches of biology, waiting to be included in the Modern Synthesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963662510394250">Wilson, 1975a</xref>: 4). The popular topic of ‘human nature’ and the related controversy among famous scientists secured SB intensive media attention in the USA and the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662510394250">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0963662510394250">
<title>Sociobiology and the media</title>
<p>The debates about the interplay between biology, human behaviour and culture have a long history. At the end of the 20th century, they took place with the controversies surrounding SB and, later, evolutionary psychology. In this context, Edward O. Wilson’s book <italic>Sociobiology – The new Synthesis</italic> (1975) immediately evoked a heated, at times even physically executed controversy centring on the impact of inherited versus acquired traits in human development and sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662510394250">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>). Although the book itself did not pose any new theory (it was a summary or ‘synthesis’ of advances in the field from previous decades), it resulted in a highly politically motivated academic debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510394250">1</xref></sup> At the height of the controversy in the late 1970s, Wilson was attacked by Marxist intellectuals who accused him of reviving eugenic thinking and racist theories with an ultimate genetic determinism, even referring to Nazi crimes and Hitler’s genocide (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510394250">Allen et al. 1975</xref>). On the other hand, Wilson was, in his sacrificial role for ‘scientific freedom’, compared to Galileo Galilei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662510394250">Nelkin, 1995</xref>) and, according to <italic>Time Magazine</italic>, counted among the 25 most influential persons in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0963662510394250">Wright, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the heavy ‘ideological burdens’ connected to eugenics, race theory and social Darwinism, the debates about SB offer an outstanding case for studying ‘cultural indicators of popular science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510394250">Bauer, 2000</xref>: 157). They show how cultural contexts act on and constrain science communication in the public sphere, similar to the features that Bucchi termed <italic>deviations</italic> from ‘normal expository practice in the public arena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510394250">Bucchi, 1996</xref>: 382). In this article, I exemplify this dynamic relationship between science and society with a case study of SB in the German public media and through it show how ‘[s]cience coverage in the media exposes <italic>cultural trends</italic> that indicate the changing position of science in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510394250">Bauer et al. 2006</xref>: 101).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510394250">2</xref></sup> In the USA, the academic discussion was deeply intermingled with the popular media coverage of SB. Scientists actively engaged in the broader debate and used it to publicly voice their concerns and strengthen their position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662510394250">Nelkin 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662510394250">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662510394250">3</xref></sup> SB meets some of the typical criteria for newsworthy media coverage such as personalization and sensation (famous scientists debating ‘human nature’), the controversial issues of race-, gender- and other ‘sexy’ topics in the USA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662510394250">Nelkin, 1995</xref>: 21–25) and Social Darwinism (which had nothing to do with Charles Darwin’s original ideas). However, studies of the reception of SB in other countries indicate that the cultural climate for making SB a public issue may have differed substantially depending on the wider political context (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510394250">Bereczkei, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510394250">Jianhui and Fan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662510394250">Sakura 1998</xref>). Germany in this respect, with its dark legacy resulting from the misuse of eugenics and social Darwinism theories under the Third Reich, becomes a highly interesting case for studying how a specific cultural context constrains the public communication of SB. Even in the more recent debates about the use of human embryonic stem cells or cloning one could see signs of a ‘heightened level of alarm’ because of frequent references to Nazi crimes and the ‘spectre of eugenics’ in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662510394250">Weingart et al., 2008</xref>: 384/94).</p>
<p>In this article I show how the coverage of SB in the public media illustrates how toxic a topic this was in post-Nazi Germany up to the 1990s. Using quantitative and qualitative media data, the article analyses how the academic discussions about SB, expected to result in a high volume of press coverage as in the USA and UK, did not get ‘translated’ into the public sphere in Germany.</p>

<title>2. The study: Methods and samples</title>
<p>This study analyses the relationship between the international academic discourse about SB and the public media presentation in Germany. Using text samples from academic and popular databases, the communication processes are followed over the time period from 1975 to 2003. By analysing the two journals <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Science</italic> I first show how SB has been discussed in the international scientific community. These well-established publications are regarded as the most prestigious scientific journals worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510394250">Braun et al., 1989</xref>) and meet high-impact criteria in citation databases with regard to natural science discussions such as those on SB. Because of their orientation towards an audience external to specialized peers and their intense PR efforts they function as <italic>gatekeepers for science</italic> and <italic>gateways for the mass media</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510394250">Franzen, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510394250">in press)</xref>. Consequently, they represent the dominant source of science coverage both in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510394250">Kiernan, 2003</xref>) and German public media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510394250">Blöbaum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510394250">Kohring, 2005</xref>: 187–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662510394250">Pahl, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662510394250">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scientific discussion of SB was evaluated in connection with the wider academic field that deals with evolutionary aspects of human and animal behaviour (behavioural ecology).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662510394250">5</xref></sup> In addition to manually conducted topic-searches on this theme in <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Science</italic>, all articles authored by the main participants of the SB controversy were recorded (Edward O. Wilson, Richard Lewontin, Stephen J. Gould and Richard Dawkins). From 1975 to 1980 and from 1990 to 1995 the content tables of all issues were examined, summing up to 1200 issues, producing a sample of 590 articles on behavioural ecology and 39 on SB specifically. The time periods were chosen to record the first six years of the scientific discussion on SB and to get a comparable sample for a period in the 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662510394250">6</xref></sup> Additional data from the <italic>ISI-Web-of-Science</italic> (SCI and SSCI), covering the whole period 1975–2003, serve to ensure the findings of manually collected data.</p>
<p>The media samples were obtained using key word searches for ‘sociobiology’ and truncated ‘sociobiol*’ because the study aims to investigate the specific discourse associated with the term SB itself and the affiliated debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662510394250">7</xref></sup> An additional cross-check for different terms connected with the topic (<italic>Darwinismus, Biologismus, Evolutionsbiologie</italic>) confirms that the findings are also representative in relation to the broader discourses associated with SB (see Section 4). The German media articles were collected via electronic archive searches for the 1990s. Before that (1970s and 1980s), a set of different search mechanisms were applied, using (1) manually accessible archives (topic folders with newspaper companies); (2) special orders to professional archive services; and (3) the ‘Spiegel Register’, which indexes specific keywords appearing in the magazine <italic>Der Spiegel</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662510394250">8</xref></sup> This methodology serves to get the most representative sample of the SB coverage over the studied period. Yet it cannot be guaranteed that all articles that mentioned SB before the electronic archives were available are incorporated in the sample. However, cross-checks of the different search mechanisms applied gave equal results and also indexing the sample against a neutral word (<italic>Haus</italic>) showed no correlation with SB coverage. The sample is therefore regarded as representative and largely unaffected by the mechanics of archiving.</p>
<p>The results are presented in two steps, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses: First, quantitative trends of discussions on SB in the scientific journals and in the German ‘quality-press’ are shown from 1975 to 2003 using a corpus of four German national daily newspapers and one weekly magazine: <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Welt, Süddeutsche Zeitung, tageszeitung</italic> and <italic>Der Spiegel</italic>. For a comparison with the US context, the SB coverage in the <italic>New York Times</italic> (NYT) is presented. This is followed by an in-depth content analysis of the SB coverage in the daily newspaper <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic> (FAZ) over the same period. This content analysis pursued the following questions:</p>

<title>The academic discussion</title>
<p>The most intense scientific discussions about SB took place in the late 1970s, as the frequencies of publications in <italic>Nature and Science</italic> show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662510394250">Figure 1(a)</xref>). In the 1990s, almost no publications specifically about SB can be found. The few articles that still appeared in the 1990s related to SB as an historical (although still relevant) incident. A comparison with the discussions in the broader discipline of Behavioural Ecology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662510394250">Figure 1(b)</xref>) clearly indicates that this decline is a characteristic for SB itself and not for the general field, where no significant changes in quantity occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662510394250">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>Analysing data from the ISI Web of Science<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0963662510394250">10</xref></sup> shows that although the term existed for some time before 1975, a significant discussion did not emerge until Wilson’s book was published in 1975. This discussion increased in frequency until the early 1980s and then persistently decreased until the end of the time period investigated here. These results thus underpin and confirm the data from <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Science</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0963662510394250">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0963662510394250">
<title>The popular media discourse</title>
<p>The focus of this study is how the German media reacted to this academic discussion. A comparison with a major US print media might, however, be instructive to expose the particularities of the German press coverage. The NYT shows an intense presentation of SB and its debate from exactly 1975 onwards, which from the early 1980s decreased until the end of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662510394250">Figure 2(a)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0963662510394250">12</xref></sup> Hence the media discourse in the NYT runs by and large parallel with the academic discussion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0963662510394250">13</xref></sup></p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0963662510394250-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>From looking at the German print media, a very different picture emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662510394250">Figure 2(b)</xref>). All quality-press media analysed reveal only negligible covering of SB during the 1970s and 1980s, whereas a massive increase occurred during the 1990s, appearing most pronounced in the second half of the decade with a peak around the year 2000 followed by a decrease. This trend appears contrary to the academic discussion and the NYT coverage. The surprising result is thus that the German media coverage of SB took place approximately 20 years after its most intense scientific discussion.</p>
<p>With regard to the peculiarity of the German media discourse on SB, two main questions arise: Why did the media in this country not respond to the international academic controversy about SB during the late 1970s and early 1980s? And which factors might have contributed to the sudden media uptake of SB during the 1990s despite a parallel academic debate? To address this twofold question, a content analysis of SB in the German national daily newspaper FAZ is presented in the following section, highlighting the changes that occurred during the 1990s by using examples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0963662510394250">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0963662510394250">
<title>Content parameters of the German press coverage</title>
<p>In all daily newspapers investigated here, SB was mentioned with increasing frequency from the mid 1990s until 2000/01, after which there was a decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662510394250">Figure 2(b)</xref>). This pattern is notably represented by the FAZ: from a total sample of 85 texts mentioning SB, only 13 articles were published during the first 21 years of this analysis (1975–95), while 72 texts appeared during the remaining eight years from 1996–2003. The FAZ coverage will therefore serve to exemplify the changes that occurred with respect to: (1) locations of the articles in the newspaper; (2) sources used in reporting on SB; (3) general contexts of SB citations; and (4) attitudes and the tone of treatment expressed towards SB’s claims (see the list of questions in Section 2 earlier).</p>
<p>The quantitative shift in reporting on SB around 1995/96 suggests dividing the analysis of the FAZ-coverage into to phases: <italic>Phase I</italic> from 1975 until 1995 (13 articles) and <italic>Phase II</italic>, from 1996 onwards, when most texts from the sample (72) were published and, as shown below, a new kind of reporting can be determined.</p>
<sec id="section9-0963662510394250">
<title>Locations and sources of SB in the FAZ</title>
<p>The shift in SB coverage during the 1990s is reflected by the position of the articles within the newspaper. The dominant location until 1995 was the science section <italic>Natur und Wissenschaft</italic> (7 articles/54%). Between 1993 and 1995 three articles appeared as book reviews (<italic>Sachbuch</italic>, 23%), two texts appeared in the economics section (<italic>Wirtschaft</italic>) and one in the feature pages (<italic>Feuilleton</italic>). This is consistent with the science-based style of reporting during <italic>Phase I</italic> revealed below.</p>
<p>The allocation of science-oriented pages in the newspaper changed radically with the increase in coverage of SB from 1996 onwards. From the 72 articles in <italic>Phase II</italic>, only six still appeared in the science section (8%) while most of the texts are to be found on the feature pages (25 articles/35%). A large number of texts were also published in the book review section (24 articles/33%) as well as on a special page for the humanities, appearing as a weekly supplement (<italic>Geisteswissenschaften</italic>, 15 articles/21%). This points to the shift in numbers that occurred in the 1990s, from a rather constant frequency of reporting on SB in the science section to picking up the issue in domains of the newspaper that were normally (previously) devoted only to cultural life and events. The trend reveals an increased detachment from the scientific context in the press citing SB.</p>
<p>This is even more clearly reflected by the sources of reporting, i.e. the journalistic reasons for reporting. A tripartite category system is used for this evaluation: (1) purely scientific sources (direct connections to scientific events, e.g. publications, conferences, lectures); (2) books reviewed; and (3) cultural references (primary culturally or socially relevant connections, no identification of a scientific event).</p>
<p>More than half of the articles until 1995 referred directly to scientific sources (7 articles/58%). The reminder reviewed books, also drawing major connections with academic discussions as sources for reporting (5 articles/42%). All texts published during <italic>Phase I</italic> thus contain direct connections to academia either by citing scientific publications and books or referring to other events such as lectures.</p>
<p>During <italic>Phase II</italic> these direct links to scientific sources became weaker. Only a quarter of the articles from 1996–2003 drew primary connections to academic sources while more and more connections were made towards cultural life and events (20%). From 15 articles still referring to scientific events, only three cited natural science contexts and were published on the science pages. The other 12 reports in this category referred to intersections between biology and the social sciences and were published on the humanities page.</p>
<p>Concurrently with the changing location of SB from science- to the culture-domains of the newspaper (<italic>Feuilleton</italic>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0963662510394250">15</xref></sup> the sources equally mirror crossing points between scientific and broader societal concerns, i.e. the award of prizes to prominent scientists (FAZ, 29 May 1996; FAZ, 5 February 2000), research policy decisions such as the shutdown or foundation of institutes (FAZ, 10 July 1997; FAZ, 17 April 1999) or exhibitions outside of the subject area (FAZ, 20 October 1998). Another feature of this shift are more common references to other national and international press reports (e.g. FAZ, 06 August 1997; FAZ, 16 April 1998).</p>
<p>During the height of the debate about the new biosciences (from 2000 to 2002), a number of articles do not connect to specific occasions as sources for reporting (e.g. FAZ, 11 November 2000; FAZ, 16 December 2000; FAZ, 29 January 2001; FAZ, 03 February 2001). The broad media-debate about the new biosciences in Germany seems to have been a reason in itself for an increased reporting, done not only by science journalists but various kinds of writers.</p>
<p>The most important replacement for the former scientific references in reports on SB is now the market for general science books (<italic>Sachbücher</italic>). While the books reviewed before 1996 all contained primarily academic sources, these ‘hardwired’ connections to science became more and more diluted later. Instead of direct associations with scientific or broader academic discourses, new ties to cultural and social life as well as to society in general now exist. These new book reviews in the FAZ range from the humanities and social sciences to scientific textbooks while, especially around 2000/2001, numerous popular science books were presented. However all these articles refer only marginally to SB by citing it as a historical case for the general debate about the impact of <italic>nature</italic> versus <italic>nurture</italic> on human development and sociality.</p>

<title>Contexts and contents of SB coverage</title>
<p>While the sources refer to the specific reason for the article (journalistic selection criteria), this section analyses the specific contexts of SB quotations as well as the general content of the media texts. The first article on SB in the FAZ appeared on 24 March 1976 and referred to a longer publication one week before in <italic>Science</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963662510394250">Wade, 1976</xref>). The second, much larger piece followed two years later by the same author and represented E.O. Wilson in more detail, introducing his book <italic>Sociobiology</italic>, its academic reception as well as the debate that it evoked in the USA (FAZ, 25 July 1978). These two first articles were the only ones reporting <italic>on</italic> SB and the accompanying debate itself. All the subsequent ones only touched upon SB in different contexts, e.g. by referring to another <italic>Science</italic> article and a new book from Wilson (<italic>Genes, Mind and Culture</italic>, FAZ, 15 July 1981), a lecture he gave in Zurich (FAZ, 07 January 1987), or by presenting other studies, either from biology (FAZ, 19 May 1993; FAZ, 11 May 1994) or psychology (FAZ, 23 February 1994). The remaining articles in <italic>Phase I</italic>, connected SB either with economic issues or reviewed books, one again from Wilson (<italic>Der Wert der Vielfalt</italic>, FAZ, 14 November 1995). All articles until 1995 can be depicted as primarily of academic content and, with a few exceptions (sociology, psychology and economy), referring only to natural science. Up to the mid 1990s, SB was hence presented as a <italic>scientific concept</italic> that had provoked a debate and political furore in the USA.</p>
<p>This academic contextualisation of SB disappeared with the increased reporting in the middle of the 1990s. From 1996 onwards, the spectrum of contexts unfolded and SB was now cited in a variety of situations: On the one hand (still frequently) via its founder E.O. Wilson, mentioned in other circumstances (e.g. biodiversity), and on the other hand more broadly as a historical reference case for an ever-present debate about <italic>human nature</italic>. The themes of the press reports range from the above-mentioned reviews of popular science books to rather general discussions about the relationship between biology, morality and religion in current debates on ethical issues of modern biotechnology.</p>
<p>A new theme, dominant in the public media around the turn of the millennium, is entitled ‘Darwinism and the new biosciences’ and focused on evolutionary arguments in connection with various issues raised by the modern biosciences such as human cloning. SB is cited here as a reference case for a discussion about biological arguments and their impacts on human behaviour, social life and society. In this context, SB is mentioned without any reference to its original scientific discussion and appears completely disconnected from the academic discourse.</p>

<title>Tone of treatment</title>
<p>The coverage in the FAZ shows a clear tendency of the journalistic treatment not to interpret, judge or evaluate the concept of SB in itself. Only in one of the two first reports published in the 1970s, the non-occurrence of a debate of SB in Germany is reflected with suspicion:
<disp-quote>
<p>are the struggles around the behavioural sciences already battled out in this country? … It’s rather frightening that there is no controversy about these issues in Germany. Not because the simplistic conceptions of a biologically inherited altruism would denigrate human dignity too much, but rather because the plain acceptance of such theories prove the deficiencies in the level of literacy on which the belief in science is based these days. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510394250">Flad-Schnorrenberg, 1978</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Except for this single statement, SB is quoted in neutral or even slightly illuminative contexts, especially with regard to applications, i.e. in economic theories or psychology. In more than half of the articles in both time periods, SB is cited in a way that does not allow the identification of any evaluation or judgement (63%). When SB is quoted with a negative tone, this is done via citations of a third-party evaluating it, for example Steve Fuller expressing his concerns about SB: ‘Steve Fuller (Warwick) called this [combination of gene-technology and SB] during the only outstanding discussion on the issue an “eugenic bio-liberalism”’ (FAZ, 11 October 2000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0963662510394250">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared to the US context, the most striking finding of the media sample evaluated here is the absence of reactions from the humanities and social sciences towards SB. These voices, known prominently from the Anglophone debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662510394250">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>), seem to be lacking in both German academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510394250">Euler and Voland, 2001</xref>) as well as in the public discourse. Contrary to all expectations, also the book reviews from humanities and social sciences contained either neutral or even slightly positive attitudes towards SB (e.g. FAZ, 02 November 1999; FAZ, 08 July 2000).</p>
<p>The large amount of neutral SB quotations raises questions over whether the controversy as such was portrayed at all. Similar to the indistinct tone of treatment, three-quarters of the articles quote SB without referring to any controversy, while the reminder only mentions that there has been a debate without discussing any details. In line with the central outcomes of this study, this evaluation shows that – except for negligible coverage in the 1970s – there has been no public discussion of the SB debate in Germany. Nevertheless, a huge amount of SB quotations from the middle of the 1990s onwards refer to it as if there had been one (e.g. FAZ, 11 October 2000; FAZ, 04 November 2003).</p>

<title>4. Comparison with other science coverage</title>
<p>This section compares the coverage of SB in the German press with other studies on science in the media. Only a few studies, mostly from the Anglo-American context, provide a broader picture of the quantitative and qualitative developments of science in the media over the 20th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0963662510394250">17</xref></sup> Comparing longitudinal studies of science in the media faces methodological difficulties because scientific topics and even disciplines change internally over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510394250">Bauer, 2000</xref>: 168), as well as culturally, for example in relation to what counts as ‘science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510394250">Cassidy, 2005</xref>: 131). This section therefore serves to contextualise the findings presented above instead of providing a quantitative comparison.</p>
<p>One important question is whether the pattern of media coverage discovered here applies only to SB or to the evolutionary topic and Darwinism in general. Three topic-related keywords (<italic>Evolutionsbiologie, Biologismus, Darwinismus</italic>) were tested to cover this broader theme with the database for the 1990s (same newspaper sample as in Section 3). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662510394250">Figure 3</xref> shows, the constant increase during the 1990s as well as the peak around 2000 is characterised by all these terms, with ‘Darwinism’ being the most cited one and most similar to the pattern of SB. Hence the trend does not only account for SB but for the evolutionary topic in general.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is interesting to see how far-reaching this pattern of media coverage actually is. The finding that SB was a ‘non-issue’ in the German media until the 1990s is also detected by a study from Harald Euler and Eckhart Voland about the uptake of SB and evolutionary psychology in textbooks on anthropology and psychology from 1975 to 2000. They conclude that until 1996 there was ignorance about the topic but from then on a change can be found. The authors explain this late acceptance of SB concepts with the arguments:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sociobiology thus encountered three hurdles in German Anthropology: (1) A scepticism towards ‘biologistic’ concepts founded in the experience with social Darwinism, (2) the great influence of classical ethology in German speaking countries, with its staunch adherence to the concept of group selection, and (3) a rigidly paralysed discipline unable to innovate itself as the biggest hurdle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510394250">Euler and Voland, 2001</xref>: 284)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several long-term studies about the intensity of biotechnology in the press give insights into the wider context of the findings on SB presented here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0963662510394250">18</xref></sup> These analyses reveal that biotechnology was not a major issue for the German press until the mid-1990s, while a shift occurred both quantitatively and qualitatively around the year 1996. Due to this distribution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510394250">Hampel et al. (2001)</xref> focus on the ‘watershed of late 1996 and early 1997’ and describe the changes in biotechnology coverage with respect to the ‘pre-watershed years’ (1992–96) as well as to the ‘post-watershed years’ (1997–99) in more detail. During the first phase, the coverage is rather heterogeneous, mainly about biomedicine and GM food, making direct connections to scientific sources. After the watershed, from 1997 on, a new attention to biotechnology can be found with two predominant characteristics: <italic>renaissance</italic> and <italic>normalisation</italic>. On the one hand, a ‘renaissance of an ethical and philosophical debate can be seen from the framing of the stories … concerning specific consequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510394250">Hampel et al. 2001</xref>: 197), while ‘on the other hand the media treated modern biotechnology as a normal and promising industrial technology alongside other technologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510394250">Hampel et al. 2001</xref>: 197). The authors also see the evolutionary topic arising: ‘At the same time the frame nature/nurture reaches a considerable proportion (8 percent) for the first time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510394250">Hampel et al. 2001</xref>: 197).</p>
<p>The study from Hampel et al. shows the wider context of biotechnology in relation to SB in the German media: the increased coverage goes along with a decreased scientific contextualisation and an increase in uncontroversial reporting pronouncing the benefits and user aspects of the modern biosciences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0963662510394250">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only one long-term analysis is known to examine the coverage of biology/ biomedicine in the German print media covering the turn of the millennium and beyond. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662510394250">Peter Weingart et al. (2008)</xref> investigated how biomedical research was presented in the German media debates from 1995 until 2004. Their analyses show a peak for ‘red biotechnology’ around the years 2000 to 2002 while they distinguish three debates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0963662510394250">Figure 4</xref>): (1) <italic>Cloning</italic> with an initial peak in 1997 reflecting the presentation of ‘Dolly’ the cloned sheep to the press; (2) the <italic>human genome</italic> debate triggered by the announcements about the ‘cracking of the code’ in 2000; and (3) the <italic>stem cell debate</italic> from 1998 to 2002 with an emphasis in 2001/02 around the legislation for research on human stem cell lines. All these debates focus on the conflicts between new knowledge and established ethical values. The stem cell issue reached most unanimous opposition, which can ‘be explained partly with the “spectre of eugenics”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662510394250">Weingart et al., 2008</xref>: 394).</p>

<p>Studies from other countries show that this media awareness is not singular to Germany (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510394250">Marks et al., 2007</xref>). Of particular interest, however, is an analysis of evolutionary psychology in the UK media, studied from 1990 to 2002 by Angela <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510394250">Cassidy (2005)</xref>. Cassidy observed that in the UK media the new label ‘evolutionary psychology’ developed in a similar pattern to SB in Germany (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0963662510394250">Figure 5</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0963662510394250">20</xref></sup> In the UK, SB was being discussed at low but consistent levels before the term ‘evolutionary psychology’ entered the public domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510394250">Cassidy, 2005</xref>: 120). Cassidy thus concludes, ‘the new label does not seem to supersede the old one, but instead prompts a slight increase in usage of “sociobiology”, which then stabilizes at a slightly higher but consistent level of discussion.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510394250">Cassidy, 2005</xref>: 120). The attention of bioscience, high levels of scientific optimism, and the ‘gender’ and ‘sexual’ politics of New Labour are regarded to be responsible for the UK coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510394250">Cassidy, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>5. Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of this study is the change in media coverage of SB during the mid-1990s. The locations and sources of the coverage as well as the evaluation of the contexts and the tone of treatment expressed towards SB in the FAZ show a clear-cut shift from a (quantitatively marginal) science-oriented reporting during the 1970s and 1980s to a new kind of coverage of SB in the 1990s, which is detached from the original academic debate. SB is cited then as a neutral concept with reference to a debate about human nature and the influences of genes vs. environment on human sociality.</p>
<p>A strong coherence exists between the renaissance of SB in the German media and discussions about the societal impacts of the so-called ‘modern life-sciences’ (Section 4). The connection between SB and this new bio-debate (cloning, stem cells, biomedicine) reveals how the occurrence of SB has been aided by a wider atmosphere of positivity or even ‘hype’ surrounding biotechnology and genetics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0963662510394250">21</xref></sup> This new ‘embedding’ of SB in the German media becomes most notable when common associations between cultural, evolutionary and genetic causes of human behaviours were discussed. In most of these cases, SB is mentioned merely as a metaphor for a debate about genes determining human behaviour, which is not defined or explained in any way. In the FAZ, such references are often framed in a neutral or slightly optimistic perspective linking SB to current ‘hot issues’ in the biosciences, such as, for example, human cloning: ‘Sociobiology stresses our genetic heritage and its impact on our social integrity and the fears that it evokes stem from the same sources as the ones towards cloning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510394250">Benford, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The shift in SB coverage raises two questions: What factors led to the non-reception of the SB debate in Germany during the 1970s and 1980s? And what circumstances account for its surprising renaissance during the bio-debates of the late 1990s and early 2000s?</p>
<p>When comparing the present results with other studies, three main aspects emerge that have certainly contributed to the absence of the SB debate in the German media during the 1970s and 1980s. These factors are neither mutually exclusive nor shall they be seen as ultimate explanations for the media analysis presented here. They rather propose some speculative – though plausible – thoughts on the issue in need of further research. First, within academia, Konrad Lorenz and classical ethology has had a significant influence on German behavioural biology. Despite considerable similarities between Lorenz’s ethology and SB, Lorenz was strictly opposed to Wilson’s SB and deemed it ‘nonsense’ from the very beginning, with regard to the different conceptions about the units of natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510394250">Bischof, 1991</xref>: 25–9). Because of Lorenz’s disciplinary despotism there was hardly any chance to seriously discuss or even take up sociobiological concepts and ideas in German biology, as Lorenz’s scholars retrospectively admit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510394250">Bischof, 1991</xref>). This situation existed in a similar way in Japan with the holistic evolutionary doctrine of Kinji Imanishi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662510394250">Sakura, 1998</xref>). However, there is another, somewhat hidden, political aspect to Lorenz’s lack of engagement with the SB debate. Lorenz freely applied for membership in the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) in 1938 and finally became a member in the Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Policy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510394250">Föger and Taschwer, 2001</xref>). During the Third Reich he published some, rhetorically highly problematical, statements about an elimination (<italic>Ausmerzung</italic>) of morally and genetically inferior people and spoke in favour of eugenic thinking and its practice in Nazi Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510394250">Brigand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510394250">Burkhardt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662510394250">Taschwer and Föger, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0963662510394250">22</xref></sup> When the SB debate emerged in 1975 in the USA, E.O. Wilson was immediately connected to Nazi Germany and criticised for reviving theories that ‘led to the establishment of gas chambers in Nazi Germany’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510394250">Allen et al., 1975</xref>). From this perspective it appears wise for Lorenz not to have touched upon this already heated issue, especially since he just had experienced a period of harsh criticism because of his Nazi past from the non-German press when receiving the Nobel Prize in 1973.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0963662510394250">23</xref></sup> The special situation with Konrad Lorenz as both the leading academic as well as a highly prominent popular figure could perhaps be seen as a circular circumvention of the SB debate in Germany: By not taking up the SB controversy himself, Lorenz did not develop any larger public attention for the topic and vice versa; because the public media did not make SB an issue, he was not required to do so.</p>
<p>The second aspect that could have seriously hindered a debate about SB in Germany was a resistance from the humanities and social sciences to get involved in the controversy up until the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510394250">Euler and Voland, 2001</xref>). No contributions exist from the social sciences on the SB debate during the late 1970s and early 1980s – a situation very different from the Anglo-Saxon academic context. The first comments on SB came as late as 1985 and surprisingly from theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0963662510394250">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>This refusal of the social sciences to engage with the SB debate links to the third aspect for its absence in the German media: During the decades preceding the German reunification one might have witnessed an atmosphere of scepticism for discussing biologistic concepts in public spaces rooted in the special German history with social Darwinism and eugenics during the Nazi regime. This ‘spectre of eugenics’ may have hindered any serious discussion about SB, and probably biological explanations of social life in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963662510394250">Weingart, 1997</xref>). Particularly as Wilson had been attacked with references to the Third Reich, it appears reasonable that people in both academia and public life resisted discussing the issue in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0963662510394250">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overall non- and thus un-controversial handling of SB in the German public media at this time can be seen as a consequence of lacking a culture to debate such issues during the 1970s and 1980s. This ‘impasse-situation’ seems to be as result of the absence of the critical voices that would have been needed to build up a debate. Anthropology for example, a strong antagonist to SB in the USA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662510394250">Sahlins, 1976</xref>), ‘was too weak to even refute sociobiology by its own efforts’ in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510394250">Euler and Voland, 2001</xref>: 283). With regard to an attempt to engage social and natural scientists for a joint discussion on the issue in 1991, Peter Weingart summarises the wide-ranging reluctance inside the German social sciences tellingly:
<disp-quote>
<p>Social scientists would not only point to the catastrophic consequences of ‘biologization’ during the Nazi regime in Germany, they would also warn against reductionist effects of any attempt to explain social phenomena in terms of biology. The sociobiology debate still looms large. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963662510394250">Weingart 1997</xref>: vii)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0963662510394250">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following this insider perspective from the German social sciences, there was simply no culture to debate the issues raised by SB, as there was in other countries. This turns us to the crucial second question: <italic>How</italic> did this reluctance to discuss SB and related issues in the German public change so suddenly in course of the 1990s? The analysis of the FAZ sample above reveals a new way of dealing with SB from 1995/96 on. Contrary to the expectations from the well-known Anglophone debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662510394250">Segerstråle, 2000</xref>), the voices from the social sciences and humanities also appear to be scarcely negative, but often rather optimistic about sociobiological ideas.</p>
<p>Looking at the content of the SB media coverage since the mid 1990s, one is given the impression that a kind of <italic>ideological liberation</italic> has taken place, moving away from previously taboo biological explanations of social life. This may be related to a more self-conscious and public exploration of the recent history by (reunified) German society. Furthermore, an intensified relationship between science and the media (<italic>science-media coupling</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662510394250">Weingart, 2001</xref>) appeared very pronounced with the mass media coverage of the new biosciences around the turn of the millennium. With the issues of cloning, stem cells and the deciphering of the human genome, the attention towards biology, biomedicine and biotechnology reached a new level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662510394250">Weingart et al., 2008</xref>). The content analysis of the FAZ coverage presented here reveals how the treatment of SB has to be seen in the light of this special media attention, aided by the wider atmosphere of positivity or even ‘hype’ towards biotechnology, genetics and adjacent issues around the turn of the millennium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0963662510394250">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>6. Conclusion</title>
<p>This article revealed how the German media coverage of SB was constrained by a specific cultural context, both inside and outside academia. Contrary to the international academic discourse and media coverage elsewhere, SB was presented most intensely with the publicity of the modern biosciences around the turn of the millennium. In this period, SB was cited as a reference for a debate about genetic influences on human behaviour (the <italic>nature–-nurture</italic> debate), which had not previously happened in this country, as compared to in the Anglophone world.</p>
<p>Although the heated debates about SB met the typical criteria for intensive media coverage (personalised sensation, controversy, emotional/sexy topics, etc.), the German press coverage exposes how the linear ‘diffusion’ concept does not apply. As a result of the absence of actors needed to mediate or ‘translate’ between the SB controversy and the German public, the debate remained silent for about two decades until it appeared in a national context within the framework of the modern biosciences’ publicity during the late 1990s. The broader debate about human embryonic stem cell research in Germany can be seen as a counter example, because it was carried out on a large scale in the public media, and in advance of scientific events, by involving a wide diversity of actors. This public debate finally resulted in legislation that seriously impacted scientific progress in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662510394250">Weingart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662510394250">Sperling, 2008</xref>). Here a new scientific practice, deployed in many other countries and on the way to its implementation in Germany, evoked an internationally unique, broad and long-lasting debate about the ethical, legal and social implications of the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510394250">Bender et al., 2005</xref>). This, for many people unexpected, controversy and its consequences might be seen as a kind of ‘backlog’ effect stemming from a lack of experience of debating similar issues in the public sphere in Germany. The findings therefore call for more research on how social, cultural and political contexts act on and constrain the ways in which science is portrayed in public.</p>
<p>Despite elaborate discussions and abundant studies about theory, practice and normativity in the public communication of science and technology (PCST; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510394250">Bucchi and Trench, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510394250">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>), the instances and potential effects of <italic>non</italic>-communication – as with SB in the German media – have not yet been considered thoroughly. But what are the tangible consequences when issues such as the SB debate do <italic>not</italic> get dispersed within the public sphere? The concepts of the ‘knowledge society’ and the ‘knowledge economy’ rest on the idea of integrating and engaging the public in a more reflexive use of research-based knowledge for processes of social and economic changes in our societies. However, this learning process must also include the social, cultural and political dimensions of communicating science to adequately respond to the widely recognized problem of a ‘public unease with science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510394250">Felt and Wynne, 2007</xref>: 6). The tangible consequences of the missing SB debate in Germany might, on the one hand, come to the fore with an unbalanced and fragmentary media presentation of more recent research from the field, such as the provocative statements from Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer about an adaptive evolution of human rape (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510394250">Blech, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0963662510394250">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, the enormous intensity of the stem cell debate in Germany might mirror a pent-up demand for societal discussions on the issue, which was not seen in the same way in countries such as the UK or USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510394250">Bender et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Cases such as SB and the stem cell debate therefore point to the important role of cultural contexts for science in the media and make the case for incorporating these contexts into the study of PCST and PUS with regard to the governance of science, research and innovation in our ‘knowledge societies’.</p>

<label>6.</label><p>A later period in the 1990s (beyond 1995) would not be suitable for this analysis because new terms such as ‘evolutionary psychology’ had been established by then and would certainly have influenced the comparison with the 1970s, as well as the splitting up of <italic>Nature</italic> into different sub-journals such as <italic>Nature</italic>-<italic>Medicine, Nature</italic>-<italic>Genetics</italic> and <italic>Nature</italic>-<italic>Biotechnology</italic>.
