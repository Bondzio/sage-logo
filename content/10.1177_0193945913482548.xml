<p>You’re writing your grant proposal. The deadline looms, but no worries, you’re cruising, you’re going to make it, and with time to spare. And then it happens. You get to a certain place and find yourself writing and rewriting. Or worse, you stop writing altogether because you’ve painted yourself into a methodological corner. Waves of self-doubt begin to wash over you, and you start second-guessing yourself regarding the feasibility of the entire project. The proposal that once seemed so logical, so doable, so significant, so <italic>competitive</italic>, now starts to seem like none of those things. You really didn’t want to be here, but here you are nonetheless. You have just entered the what-was-I-thinking stage of grant proposal preparation.</p>
<p>This much-dreaded stage can happen at any point during proposal preparation, but investigators experience it most often while writing the “Method” section. They may, for example, discover that the methodology that best addresses the research question is prohibitively expensive, which will render the application unattractive to the funding agency. Or investigators may realize that the method with the strongest internal validity will lead to enormous difficulties recruiting and retaining participants.</p>
<p>Going into multiple drafts of the specific aims page is another hint that challenges within the project are going to be larger than initially thought. While investigators may be able to readily identify the broader purposes of the project, they may find themselves unable to articulate any specific aims or quantifiable research questions. Or they find themselves unable to convey the impact of the work beyond vague general statements that the work will inform practice or increase awareness of a problem within the discipline. Or they find themselves utterly unable to explain what exactly is innovative about the work they are proposing. When confronted with any of these obstacles, investigators may begin to question the validity of the entire project.</p>
<p>Of course, the easy way out of this predicament is to just abandon the proposal entirely. (Given the stress involved in preparing grant proposals, many of us have found this to be a tempting solution!) Serious examination is required to determine whether the proposal is truly fundamentally flawed, first by determining whether specifics regarding scientific impact and innovation can be stated. If this cannot be done, then the project should probably be jettisoned.</p>
<p>However, if the what-was-I-thinking stage arises as a result of methodological issues, for example, then this is the perfect time to get other members of the research team involved working on the proposal. The principal investigator can meet with team members to have tightly focused discussions regarding specific issues. For particularly tough problems, several team meetings may be necessary to hammer out a solution. Co-investigators can assume responsibility for revising selected grant sections or take over searching the literature for solutions to specific problems. While the what-was-I-thinking stage can be an uncomfortable experience, it certainly doesn’t have to be a solitary one.</p>
<p>Another team-related approach is to examine the composition of the team itself. The need for specific kinds of expertise may not be apparent until grant writing is far advanced, and the input from new team members with the required expertise may help get the proposal back on track. Likewise, as the project becomes more focused, some team members’ contributions may no longer be relevant. These members should be winnowed because large teams can be unproductive and distracting. Also, expanding the circle of grant application readers beyond the research team can be quite helpful at the what-was-I-thinking stage. Investigators may avoid this strategy out of concern that new readers will just find new problems, but new readers may also think of new solutions.</p>
<p>Implementing effective time-management strategies will increase the proportion of time that can be devoted to finding solutions to vexing problems in the proposal. Strategies include setting aside specific periods to work exclusively on the grant application, minimizing distractions, and delegating other responsibilities until the application is written. Delegation of some daily responsibilities is especially helpful when in this stage of grant preparation. Trying to maintain the same daily workload while also working through rough spots in the grant usually means the grant gets relegated to the evening hours, the time of day when most of us are at our least creative. Balance between work and home can also foster creativity; having (at least some) personal life provides diversion and gives the mind a rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913482548">Chase et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913482548">Conn, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, the single best strategy to avoid the what-was-I-thinking stage altogether is by doing very early advance planning. This means identifying major challenges well before writing the grant—or even well before committing to writing the grant. The project budget should in particular be addressed very early on to determine whether the proposal is even financially feasible. For example, if the only way to conduct a valid study requires more funds than the agency allows, there is little reason to go to the effort of writing an application at all.</p>
<p>Despite the best laid plans, even the most experienced investigators will inevitably go through the what-was-I-thinking stage a few times over the course of their grant-writing careers. The key to getting through this stage with your nervous system intact is to manage your time well and get help with the hard parts. Both you and your grant may end up better for the experience.</p>
