<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 22-year-old male roof-fitter presented with a circular saw injury to his right index finger distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, with soft tissue and bone loss, including the base of the distal phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412458627">Figure 1</xref>). There was a 13-mm defect between the distal end of the middle phalanx and distal phalangeal tuft; a K-wire was inserted to hold the soft tissues to length. The patient expressed a strong desire to preserve as much of the finger length as possible.</p>

</fig>
<p>Six weeks later, a bone graft 15 mm in length was harvested from the medial femoral condyle of his right knee as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412458627">Sakai et al., 1991</xref>). The pedicle was 4 cm and vessels 1.5 mm in diameter. A K-wire was passed across the defect under fluoroscopic control, holding the bone graft in place, and an anastomosis with the radial digital artery and a dorsal vein was performed at the level of the proximal phalanx. He was discharged the next day, fully weight-bearing, and returned to office work at 2 weeks and normal duties at 8 weeks. A radiograph at 8 weeks showed bone union (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412458627">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>At 1 year, he reported no pain during normal use. He experienced some sensitivity to extreme cold, but was working with no restriction and no particular need to wear gloves. He could bring his index finger tip into his palm and apply a normal pinch pressure. The patient was pleased with the outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412458627">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Vascularized grafts in the wrist and hand are most commonly used to treat recurrent nonunion, but may be indicated as a primary procedure to fill bony defects when the prognosis for healing is poor. In this case, there was only a small tuft of distal bone available for reconstruction, suggesting that a nonvascularized graft would have failed.</p>
<p>Vascularized grafting in the distal fingers is a challenge. Pedicled flaps from the radius or metacarpals do not reach, defects tend to be short, and common free vascularized bone grafts (such as the fibula or iliac crest) provide bone segments that are too bulky. Potential options reported in the literature include toe phalanx or metacarpal transfer.</p>
<p>The medial femoral condyle cortico-periosteal flap has been used in the treatment of nonunions of the proximal and middle phalanges, and failed arthrodesis at the DIP joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412458627">Grant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412458627">Rodríguez-Vegas and Delgado-Serrano, 2011</xref>). It provides a small segment of bone, with a pedicle length and vessel diameter ideal for anastomosis to digital vessels, and can be transferred with a skin paddle. Dissection of this vascularized autograft is relatively simple and quick, with acceptable donor site morbidity. It should therefore be considered for the reconstruction of small bone defects in the distal finger.</p>
