<abstract>
<p>Magris’s text addresses the circuitous and lengthy creative process that led to the conceptualization and writing of his latest novel <italic>Alla cieca</italic> (2005; <italic>Blindly</italic>, 2010). It offers, at same time, a reflection on the core dialectical binary of the work: the relation between inventing History and creating History and thus on the relationship between History and the contemporary novel. Magris sheds light on his own formal and stylistic approach to his text and on his ethical quest among the ideological utopias and individual tragedies of pre- and post-WWII Europe.</p>

<p>Every text is wiser than its author, who is not always the one best qualified to speak of it, let alone interpret it. Perhaps he can only tell how and why it came about.</p>
<p>The gestation period of <italic>Blindly</italic> might seem long to the point of absurdity, given that I first thought of it in 1988. I did, of course, do other things in the interim. I wrote other books, and a lot of things happened to me, both good and bad. But <italic>Blindly</italic>, whether now taken up or now laid aside, nevertheless remained the basic project.</p>
<p>The first vague notion of the novel came to me in 1988. I was in Antwerp to launch a translation of <italic>Danube</italic>, and had seen some ships’ figureheads. I was struck by their open, dilated gaze, directed at what lies beyond as if perceiving calamities invisible to others. At that moment, in that Flemish square, I got the idea of writing something about those figureheads, even though I was uncertain as to what I wanted from them. I followed various lines of research: I went to look at museums – those figurehead cemeteries; I went to the Scilly Isles, where for centuries the sea had carried those figures to the shore from shipwrecks; I collected stories, legends and so on. For I must confess that I am, in general, obsessed with exactitude, because I consider that reality, human reality in particular, is more original than invention. ‘Life is original’, said Svevo. And Mark Twain: ‘Truth is stranger than fiction’. I believe that every individual existence deserves the same respect accorded to the great figures of History, and is entitled to the same philological attention (‘philology’ etymologically contains love). This exactitude, which is born out of love and respect for reality and for the imaginative allure of its creations, is nurtured by an ethical sense of respect for each individual life. At the imaginative level it becomes also a grotesque, maniacal dilation, which contributes to the meaning of the world’s delirium. When I write a book it is as if I were making a mosaic; each individual tessera corresponds to a piece of objective reality, to a real existence or a real story, but the figure these tesserae compose is totally imaginary.</p>
<p>I thus began to write a book on figureheads – unsuccessfully, but it nevertheless served me as a quarry of material to be reworked in the novel. There the figurehead became an ambiguous symbol: a female figure set on the storm-ridden prow, as if to be the first to receive the buffets of life and History. It was an image of femininity outraged and culpably ruined by the protagonist; the face(s) of his love story; the symbol of the violence and reification so often inflicted by men upon women and, in my book, dramatically interwoven with the story of the protagonist’s love – passionate but at the same time guilt-ridden.</p>
<p>However, in drafting my book I did not stay on the track of the figurehead for long. My years-old interest in the incredible story of Goli Otok proved in the end far more pervasive. Soon after the Second World War, when the moment of revenge had arrived for what Fascist Italy had inflicted upon the Slavs, some 300,000 Italians, having lost everything, left Istria and Fiume – by then part of Yugoslavia – for Italy, the West. At the same time 2000 Italian workers from Monfalcone, a small town near Trieste– militant communists, many of whom had experienced the Fascist prisons, the lagers and the Spanish Civil War – voluntarily left Italy for Yugoslavia, where, inspired by their faith in it, they wanted to contribute to the construction of communism in the nearest communist country. These can be considered two veritably intersecting counter-exoduses. And then, in 1948, Tito broke with Stalin, so that these revolutionaries became – in Tito’s eyes – potentially dangerous Stalinist agents. They, on the other hand, regarded him as a traitor. They were deported to the beautiful but terrible islets of the Upper Adriatic, Goli Otok (Bald Island) and Sveti Grgur (St Gregory), where they were subjected, as in gulags and lagers, to every kind of persecution. They heroically resisted in the name of Stalin – that is to say, in the name of one who, had he been victorious, would have turned the entire world into a gulag for the likes of them.</p>
<p>They lived in those hells ignored by all: Italy took no interest in what was happening on its eastern borders; Yugoslavia kept quiet about its own infamy; the Soviet Union spread every sort of lie about Tito’s Yugoslavia but said nothing about its gulags since it had many more of its own; and the British and the Americans, reluctant to weaken Tito, their precious anti-Soviet pawn, cared little for the misery of a mere few thousand people. When, years later, the survivors returned to Italy they were regarded with suspicion by the Italian police as dangerous communists arriving from the East. The Italian Communist Party too opposed them as embarrassing witnesses of the Stalinist politics it had embraced years earlier and now wished to forget. Some of these deportees found that their houses in Monfalcone had in the meantime been handed over to Istrian exiles. At times History really is an extraordinary coordinator.</p>
<p>I had more than once, in previous books, referred to this story. I speak of it, briefly, in my novels <italic>A Different Sea</italic> and <italic>Microcosms</italic> (1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047244112460005">1997</xref>). It moved me profoundly because its protagonists always found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. They fought for a cause – Stalin – that I myself consider misguided, but did so with an extraordinary determination to sacrifice their own individual destiny for a universal cause – for what they believed to be the good of humanity. Such capacity constitutes an invaluable moral legacy, which we ought to accept and make the most of, even if we do not follow the red flag for which those workers fought and even if they too are guilty of having sacrificed others and themselves to their ideal. The protagonist of my novel, the narrating ‘I’, an obviously invented figure, is precisely one of those men who passed through the storms of History to end up in Goli Otok. As his name – Salvatore Cippico/Čipico/Cipico – suggests, he belongs to that composite Italo-Slavic world on the eastern borders of Italy.</p>
<p>I would say that <italic>Blindly</italic>, while both tragic and disenchanted, a desperate voyage through the gloom of the century, nevertheless retains the sense that the world must be changed. It may be a book about ideals that have crumbled and been lost, but it is also a book about loyalty to those ideals or, better still, to the needs they express, in the same way as the twentieth century witnessed innumerable barbarities, but also great achievements.</p>
<p>However, the book is not simply the story of Salvatore Cippico/Čipiko/Cipico’s deportation to Goli Otok. It is also the story of Jorgen Jorgensen, the king–convict, with whom Salvatore often identifies, indeed confuses himself, to the point where he raves (hopes, fears, denies) that he is the same person, his double, his clone. It was in a Paris bookshop, many years ago, that I discovered by chance the existence of this extraordinary character, whose life coincided with the birth of Australia and Tasmania by way of the prisons (those terrible prisons which, in my novel, merge with the lagers and gulags they so closely resemble). Jorgen undertakes the same odyssey as those convicts who, between the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, were transported from England to Australia and Tasmania to become their first population, apart from the Aborigines. Jorgen is an incredible character: a Dane in the service of England, a sailor who had crossed the seven seas, the founder of Hobart Town, the capital of Tasmania. Many years later, in the same Hobart Town, he would be sentenced to hard labour for life, as if Romulus had ended up as a Roman slave.</p>
<p>I set myself on the track of Jorgensen, going all over in search of him – Denmark, England, Tasmania. I went into libraries, and especially to the places where he had lived. I needed to behold the sea that he had beheld at the other end of the world; I needed to find out the colour of that sea, beside which he had lived and died.</p>
<p>Jorgensen had also written: texts of all sorts, including novels (I traced their manuscripts, written in pencil in English) and a series of stories dilating and reinventing his life, already full of such incredible incidents as – to give but one example – the three weeks in which he was proclaimed, by way of a bizarre revolution, either King or Protector of Iceland: an extraordinary destiny, and in my book (for his, too, is a narrating voice, or rather a voice which the protagonist, in his delirium, makes his own) it blends with that of Salvatore. Likewise, Jorgen’s voyage to the Antipodes becomes the emigrants’ voyage to Australia after the Second World War; the Australian prisons interweave with the lagers and the gulags; and the ‘black war’, which completely wiped out the Tasmanian aborigines, is one with the horrors of the twentieth century. When the last Tasmanian, a woman – Trucanini – died, she begged not to have her skeleton exhibited in a museum like the skeleton of an extinct animal. But her skeleton was exhibited – until 1947, two years after the end of the Second World War. Many children were also sent to these terrible penitentiaries, and in Port Arthur I have seen the so-called ‘Puer Point’, a high rock from which a lot of these children, tormented beyond endurance, hurled themselves into the sea.</p>
<p>The grotesque revolution of Jorgen in Reykjavik – a mixture of generosity, foolish and comic performance, fraudulent and dramatic adventure, noble utopia and parody – gave me the opportunity, like a distorting yet revealing mirror, to portray both the greatness of revolution and its misery.</p>
<p>I tried to write Jorgen’s story directly, to the point where it almost naturally intertwined and fused with that of Salvatore. However, before that could happen I needed to deal with what was at the root of the novel’s structure, namely the myth of the Argonauts and the quest for the Golden Fleece, one of the fundamental archetypes of our imagination – a primordial, archaic myth. At the same time it is a vast modern and postmodern marketing operation, one of the most brilliant promotional ploys ever created around a commercial enterprise. Above all, though, it is the story of a terrible clash of civilizations: the Greek Jason on the one hand, and the Eastern barbarians, the Colchians, on the other. This theme of the East, ever feared, scorned and rejected, recurs throughout my book – the mysterious East, long identified with communism too. In Europe every country has its East to refuse. <italic>Jason</italic> means ‘healer’, he who cures, who saves, like <italic>Salvatore</italic>. Jason carries into those nebulous lands the greatest civilization that ever existed, the Greek, but he also comes to rob, plunder and deceive. The story of Jason and Medea is the story of this clash, and of the tragic nexus between the bringing of civilization and its destruction – a theme, by the way, that also fascinated Pasolini.</p>
<p>And then there is that incredible episode in the <italic>Argonautica</italic> of Apollonius Rhodius: the Argonauts, in their voyage to Colchis, stop over at an island inhabited by the Doliones, a friendly people with whom they spend a marvellous evening of fraternal feasting. Then they set off again, but during the night a storm sends them back to the same island. Unaware of this, however, they think they have been tossed onto a hostile shore, while the Doliones, in turn, believe they are being attacked. In the dead of night these two brotherly peoples slaughter each other. In my book this episode becomes a striking symbol of those fratricidal conflicts that have also blighted revolutionary movements, in particular the clash between communists and anarchists in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>I had begun to write a traditional, linear novel. But it did not work, even though in part it merged – albeit totally transformed – into the final version. It could not work because in a narrative the ‘how’, namely the style, the structure, the writing, must correspond – better still, must <italic>identify</italic> – with the ‘what’, with the event and with its meaning or non-meaning. One cannot write in a traditional, ordered, rational and harmonious manner on a subject of delirium, of the disintegration of all sense, of abnormal disorder: disorder and tragedy are in the things and in the words.</p>
<p>I was sucked into a creative and critical whirlpool – the great Conradian sea, which is the modern, contemporary novel whose structure derives from the breaking up, contrasting or altering of the way meaning is revealed and time and History relate. These themes have also appeared in my critical work, for instance in the essays on Hoffmann, and in my fiction too, in particular in <italic>Blindly</italic>. The essential point in the writing of that book, together with the difficulties I encountered, concerns the relationship between the contemporary novel and History, between writing History and writing stories, between narrating reality and inventing it. The destruction of the linear concept of time and the eclipse of a central meaning capable of bestowing unity and rationality upon events, both individual and collective, have made a violent assault on the way story-telling relates to the meaning of History. Here is a contradiction we cannot avoid confronting. A genuine novel of our time cannot recount History unless it is like the nightmare of which Stephen Dedalus spoke, or like the grotesquely contorted series of events, disjointed and irrational, in Gunter Grass’s <italic>The Tin Drum</italic>, or like fragments scattered in a vortex in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to detect any meaning. I believe we cannot avoid feeling embroiled in this disintegration.</p>
<p>Equally necessary and obvious at this point, it seems to me, is the rejection of the fraudulent, ‘postmodern’ cult, and with it the illusion of having stored away once and for all in ‘official files’, or relegated to the attic, the tragic, still open wound of the Modern, with which we have yet to come to terms.</p>
<p>While writing <italic>Blindly</italic>, I was grappling, on the one hand, with that form of truth which the novel (if it wishes to be genuine) can search for only through distortion, and that other form of truth which in the ethical-political context, for example, can be reached only by trusting that very reason and rationality upon which the surging breakers of the epic seem to have dissipated.</p>
<p>But what can, what <italic>must</italic> an honest and at the same time imaginative intelligence do when confronting the world? When one shifts, for instance, from the political problem of pensions in general to an account of the vicissitudes of an individual pensioner, of a particular individual ensnared in History, we discover that this rationality does not exist, that the nexus between individuality and History, upon which sound politics are – or should be – based, and upon which the great nineteenth-century novel is also based, is shattered beyond recall. For the nineteenth-century novel – great or small – the action of an individual was, at bottom, integrated into a difficult but not wholly irrational History. The consequence was a humanistic sense of unity between the world and its representation. When the nineteenth-century writer invented stories, he could rely upon the same conception of History that he expressed in his historical and political writing and could employ an analogous style. The writing and the style of Victor Hugo’s <italic>Les Misérables</italic> is none too different from that of his polemic against Napoleon III. Kafka, by contrast, would not have been able to write his novels in the style of everyday communication or political statements.</p>
<p>I felt these problems strongly when I was working on the draft – or rather drafts – of <italic>Blindly</italic>, in which I continually found myself reckoning with disintegration, shipwreck, the inevitable senselessness and irrationality of the events I was narrating, and with the attempt – despite it all – to go in search of that fragmented meaning. It was somewhat like searching for that red thread which, Goethe said, is to be found in all the ropes of the British fleet, thereby indicating that in all the variety of ships, sails, riggings, hawsers and so on, there was a unity which conferred meaning. This is the meaning one looks for, even if the red thread snaps during the search.</p>
<p>Writing is like being at the same time a customs officer and a <italic>passeur</italic>; it establishes borders and transgresses them. There are, however, different typologies of writing. Moral or political writing seeks to mark out, albeit in various forms, borders: between good and evil, the licit and the illicit, what one can and cannot do. It is written in the Gospel: ‘Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay’. By contrast, the story of life is by definition the crossing of these borders, inasmuch as we penetrate into that grey zone, to use Primo Levi’s phrase, which is often life’s characteristic terrain.</p>
<p>It has been said that the protagonist of my novel <italic>Blindly</italic> with his false names ideally represents the illegal immigrants, the fugitives, the <italic>sans-papiers</italic>, the revolutionaries, hidden under so many pseudonyms. Fugitives have always been at the centre of my imagination and of my writing. There is a tension in me between the ‘good fight’, as St Paul writes, and the mysterious impulse to run away, to desert, to betray and suffer indignity. Often it is the same individual who feels both impulses, as with many of Conrad’s characters – captains who staunchly and courageously face the storm and at the same time would secretly like to flee, to disappear, to be nobody. The sea – a great object of love in my life – is the landscape of epic and vanity. It has been said that <italic>Blindly</italic>’s real protagonist is the sea. In <italic>Blindly</italic> too there is a fierce belief in an ideal – in this case the Revolution – and fidelity, and at the same time the need to flee, the sense of vanity, the desire to disappear.</p>
<p>The Argonauts’ myth – especially in versions such as the Orphic Argonautica – opens up immense oceanic horizons, boundless seas that in turn encroach upon those crossed by Jorgen and Salvatore. The story of Medea, too, provides a profound mythical substructure for the story of the protagonist’s fondness for a woman – many women, variations and almost at times <italic>serializations</italic> of a single woman – passionately loved and culpably sacrificed, outraged and lost. The Golden Fleece, in its turn, ended up always in the wrong hands – an illicit property, a criminally acquired trophy, stolen by someone who in turn had stolen it from someone else. The Fleece becomes thus alternatively the red flag, the banner of glorious battles, a rag used to strangle, a bedspread on which to make love, and so on.</p>
<p><italic>Blindly</italic> is a delirious monologue wherein other voices flow, interweave, override. The speaker is Salvatore Cippico, the protagonist of a life of struggle and disillusionment, which has taken him from his native Tasmania to Fascist Italy, the war in Spain, the Resistance, Dachau, Tito’s gulag, the last voyage to Australia, and the final, definitive return – all through the most desperate adventures. He speaks to a doctor, and also to himself; many voices interweave with his own and each time he identifies himself with others, especially with Jorgensen; occasionally he speaks as though he <italic>were</italic> Jorgen, narrating Jorgen’s life as if it were his own; occasionally he identifies himself with someone else again. Perhaps this doubling or fusion of the two protagonists arises also out of the fact that Salvatore’s heroic and terrible revolutionary vocation, which led him to sacrifice everything to it – his own self but also others, beginning with the woman he loved – is unconsciously in need of the carefree, joyous, anti-ideological humanity of Jorgen. The revolution for which Salvatore lived provided meaning and greatness to his life, but it also swallowed up and sacrificed his existence. It took from it all that gaiety and lightness which Jorgen’s life, although equally tossed about by History and fraught with difficulty and misfortune, had nevertheless retained. For Jorgen had none of the modern intellectual’s pretensions to impose an absolute meaning on History, thereby sacrificing the sweetness of his own life, and of others’, to a Higher Cause.</p>
<p>Salvatore talks, speaking into the recorder and then erasing. Every so often the doctor insinuates his questions, and perhaps also his answers, into the recording. The voice remains the same, but at times Salvatore fears it may no longer be his own. He chatters away into the computer, to others or possibly to himself. He is without doubt psychically disturbed, having failed to cope with all that has befallen him. He is, in a clinical sense too, a divided self. The voices that speak are perhaps all his own, even those of the doctor and the multifarious tormentors who have interrogated him throughout his life. But his voice is also a choral voice, since each one of us is always a ‘choral self’. Whenever something important happens to us, it is never solely ours, solely private: to fall in love, to grow, to age, to fall sick, to possess a faith or to lose it, to die – these are experiences which an individual experiences in a uniquely personal manner, but also at the same time in the name of each and every one. In a sense he loses his own name, like the Unknown Soldier, taking on the name of every one.</p>
<p>Certainly the experience that befalls Salvatore is overwhelming. It breaks him, drives him to delirium. To speak of <italic>Blindly</italic> one must speak of a maelstrom, of language as a whirlpool choking one’s voice, dredging and sucking up life and with it the whole story (or all History?). It does so with a fury that the protagonist at times seems intentionally to heighten, as if he wished to hasten death, to finish it all off quickly. This violent whirlpool of words is like a serpent that suffocates the self who utters it. It is his story and our story, which is sometimes too much for us. We all sometimes fail to cope and life appears intolerable, as if we had to carry the world on our shoulders, grinding us down. Hence Salvatore’s desire to escape – from his tormentors, but also from love and from life itself. On the other hand, in his proliferation of identities is also mirrored the anguish of being cancelled by the universal depersonalization of the postmodern, by a serialization that reproduces and dissolves every identity. The anxiety of his speech betrays his fear of being the illusory creation of a video-game, which one touch of a key can either expunge or multiply to infinity. All this he strenuously seeks to resist.</p>
<p>At times, out of too much love of life, the protagonist reaches a breaking point and he flees from himself. He feels he must <italic>tell</italic> in order to preserve memory, which not only constitutes our identity but is also a duty towards the victims, who are all too often subjected to the further violence of being forgotten. This memory, however, is not the past, but is always present. It is the feeling that everything that has a value is present, as when we say that Shakespeare <italic>is</italic> – rather than <italic>was</italic> – a poet. The narrative is therefore in the present tense, since everything is recounted at the very moment the protagonist relives it and incorporates it into his life. Every so often the weight of crushing memory is intolerable, hence the occasional violent desire in the protagonist to wipe out memory, to press the button that erases the tape recording, to burn and expunge everything, even his own self – obsessed as he is with fleeing the terrible lager of life, which at the same time is so much loved.</p>
<p><italic>Blindly</italic> is a book that combines the two types of writing that Ernesto Sábato called daytime and night-time writing. In the former a writer creates and expresses a world with which he is in agreement; in it he declares his own values, his mode of being. In the latter the writer has to reckon with something that suddenly emerges from within himself and which he did not know he possessed: feelings, disquieting drives (even horrible truths, according to Sábato) that astound us, appal us and confront us with a self-image foreign to us. This writing tells us what we could be, what we fear or hope to be, what by sheer chance we have not been. Such writing places us face to face with the Medusa of life, who at that moment cannot be sent to the hairdresser to get her serpent hair done in order to be rendered presentable. This is the writing wherein the writer’s Double speaks and, though the writer may well prefer his Double to speak of different things, he cannot but pass him the microphone.</p>
<p>In the book the great hopes of the twentieth century, together with the great freedoms it achieved, retain all of their real and passionate value, yet they are inextricably entwined with the century’s repudiations and its horrors. Hence the writing cannot but be a blending of day and night. The title itself pronounces this – <italic>Blindly</italic> derives from an anecdote about Admiral Nelson. It is said that in the battle against the Danish fleet off Copenhagen, when the Danes raised the white flag Nelson continued to bombard them for almost two hours, later excusing himself by saying that he had not seen the white flag because he had put the telescope to his blind eye. In the book this becomes the symbol of doing evil blindly, of not seeing – or not wanting to see – the evil one does; it is a symbol, as well, of living and loving blindly.</p>
<p>The narrative of the novel unfolds through a wide-ranging variety of tones, rhythms and registers, in order to combine the engulfing and frenzied maelstrom of the monologue with the precision of historical and geographical details and with the breath of ideological debate. It is a book in which heady rhythms alternate with the long, broad wave of the epic, and the many different voices merge with that of the protagonist. The syntactical, lexical and idiomatic variety is inevitable, as is the high-frequency oscillation between the sublime and the sarcastic, the aristocratic and the vulgar, the high and the low. Equally necessary is the symbiosis between epic impersonality, objective report and individual heartache, whose interlacing of confession and falsification, the polyphonic chaos which constitutes the story and involves, in particular, the use of the various verb tenses, posed great organizational problems to the narrative.</p>
<p>In general the protagonist speaks and narrates: everything he utters is in the present tense of his recounting – reliving, perhaps falsifying and reinventing – of the facts. Nothing is consigned to the detached representation of the past perfect tense; everything is lived at the moment it is uttered. The protagonist identifies with others, doubles and multiplies and thus reduces himself. The problem was how to render – linguistically and structurally – this multiple self-identification, in which ‘clinical report, epic and delirium, life continuously erased and rewritten’, make ‘things and events precipitate as in an abyss. <italic>Blindly</italic> is [ultimately] a dogged attempt to escape from the place of existence to find a direction, or at least a final escape route’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047244112460005">Magris, 2008</xref>: 28).</p>

<p><bold>Claudio Magris</bold> is one of the most authoritative voices on Central European literature and the cultural, political and social challenges that the new Europe is facing in the twenty-first century. A writer, translator, literary critic and cultural philosopher, Magris has written extensively on the shifting of allegiances caused by the reshaping of European borders, and on the difficulties of disentangling the web of multiple identities that often constitute the very essence of Europeanness. His lyrical and mesmerizing prose, erudite and nostalgic yet at the same time permanently focused on moral dilemmas, has gained him a wide range of public recognition and an ever-growing body of European and non-European readers. Magris has been the recipient of several awards and honorary degrees, and he is often named as a favourite for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In the words of the Prince of Asturias Awards jury (2004), ‘Claudio Magris epitomises the finest humanistic tradition and the pluralism of early twenty-first century European literature in his work – a multifaceted Europe without frontiers, supportive of others and open to dialogue between cultures. Magris employs a powerful narrative voice in his books to highlight certain niches that constitute a land of freedom within which a yearning takes form: European unity within its historical diversity’.</p>
