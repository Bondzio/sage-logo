<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 19-year-old right-handed painter was referred with a 3-year-old history of pain. Initially, the symptoms appeared only in the wrist and after strenuous activities, but had gradually progressed to appear at rest and with proximal and distal radiation. The patient complained of numbness, especially in the thumb, and, to a lesser degree, in the index and middle fingers.</p>
<p>On clinical examination, there was a painful swelling on the radial aspect of his right volar forearm proximal to the wrist. The swelling was more prominent during gripping and was locally tender. The palm of the patient was tender, particularly on the imaginary line from the wrist to the index finger. Active and passive range of motion and arterial examination were normal. There was no thenar atrophy and Phalen’s test was normal, but there was a positive Tinel sign over the distal median nerve. The patient complained of numbness, especially in the thumb, and, to a lesser degree, in the index and long fingers. Wrist and forearm radiographs were normal. An MRI scan showed only an abnormal muscle over flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon of third and fourth fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193413485011">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>At operation, we found an abnormal muscle 11 cm long in the anterior compartment of forearm covering the distal part of the FDS tendon of third and fourth fingers, between the palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis. Proximally, the muscle was attached to the radius like the FDS muscle. The distal tendon was partly inserted at the proximal margin and superior surface of the flexor retinaculum and then merged into the proximal part of the palmar aponeurosis. The bulk of the muscle lay directly over the median nerve where it appeared to compress the nerve, especially during contracture. The muscle received innervation by two branches of median nerve at its radial aspect. The muscle was excised completely. Histological examination showed normal muscle tissue. Mass excision was curative.</p>
<p>In extremely rare cases, a muscle called radiopalmaris arises from the anterior surface of the radius in common with FDS and inserts into the palmar aponeurosis or synovial sheath covering the FDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413485011">Bergman et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193413485011">Rodrigues et al. (2009)</xref> presented a case in a cadaveric study which was similar to ours. The difference was in the insertion site: in our case the belly laid distally near the retinaculum, but in Rodrigues’ case it had a long tendon of insertion passing through the carpal tunnel as it entered the palm. In the literature, there are two similar cases with a painful mass on the radial aspect of volar forearm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193413485011">Peers et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193413485011">Kosiyatrakul et al. (2010)</xref> separately described an abnormal symptomatic muscle that presented as a painful, enlarging volar forearm mass: the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) brevis. Unlike the radiopalmaris, the FCR brevis originates from the radial shaft and its tendinous part crosses over the FCR tendon and distally inserted on the trapezium.</p>
