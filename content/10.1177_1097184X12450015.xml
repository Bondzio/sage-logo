<title>Introduction</title>
<p>“I am heterosexual” is not a commonly heard declaration of identity. Nor does it seem to hold much confessional purchase in terms of personal and social significance, in the way that “I am gay” does. Instead, it has an odd, almost unsettling tenor about it. As feminist scholars argue, heterosexuality enjoys such a naturalized, normative status in society that it needs no articulation, no explanation. It is “exnominated,” in Roland Barthes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X12450015">2000</xref>) term. That is, heterosexuality “goes without saying.” By contrast, it is the perceived “outsiders,” the excluded “others,” who are defined and named in terms of sexual identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12450015">Richardson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1999</xref>). It is against this backdrop that I explore the tendency among heterosexual men with HIV in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to declare their sexual identity in a way that is otherwise atypical among heterosexual people. In this task, I draw on theories of heteronormativity, on qualitative interviews with heterosexual men with HIV, and on my long-standing collaboration with Pozhet, an HIV health promotion service for heterosexuals living with HIV. One persistent theme in my research, and in my conversations with Pozhet staff and clients over many years, has been these men’s concerns around their perceived sexual orientation and sexual identity. In their interactions with me, with Pozhet staff and other service providers in the Australian HIV sector, they seem compelled to articulate and affirm their identity as heterosexual men in one way or another, be it literally or indirectly, but always with palpable intent.</p>
<p>In the local HIV sector, whose culture and approach have long been strongly shaped around gay men as the most affected population, this apparent need to emphasize heterosexuality tends to create a sense of discomfort, partly because it seems curiously anomalous, and partly because, on the face of it, it lends itself to a perception of homophobia. In this article, I seek to examine this phenomenon more closely in order to identify and unpack the meanings surrounding it. I consider how this kind of explicit thematization of heterosexuality jars with and exposes its normally taken-for-granted status in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1996</xref>). I argue that, to understand these men’s compulsion to name their sexual identity, and the unease it provokes, we need to understand the intersections between the cultural force of heteronormativity and the profoundly homosexual history of the HIV epidemic in Australia. Unlike Judith Butler’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1097184X12450015">2004</xref>) concept of “undoing” as an act of resistance against gender normalization, in this context, HIV reveals in powerful ways the “undoing” of heterosexuality, and the attempts to performatively “do” heterosexuality in response to this undoing, thus bringing into sharp focus fault lines in heteronormativity.</p>
<sec id="section2-1097184X12450015">
<title>Background and Approach</title>
<p>In Australia, unlike much of the rest of the world, the incidence of heterosexual transmission of HIV is relatively low. Since the start of the epidemic, HIV transmission has occurred predominantly through sexual contact between men. As a result, the history of the local epidemic is closely linked with the gay community, which has been disproportionally affected by the virus. This has shaped both public perceptions and programmatic responses to the disease. HIV prevention and education strategies have long and rightly been targeted primarily at gay men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X12450015">Kippax and Race 2003</xref>). There have been very few HIV awareness campaigns aimed at the general public, and no national one since 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X12450015">Tulloch and Lupton 1997</xref>). One unintended corollary of this is that HIV has become culturally coded and socially invisibilized in the heterosexual community as a disease that mainly affects gay men. At the same time, Australia has seen a small but steady increase in HIV notifications through heterosexual exposure in the past decade. According to surveillance data, HIV diagnoses for which infection was attributed to heterosexual contact increased from 19 percent in 2001–05 to 25 percent in 2006–10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X12450015">NCHECR 2011</xref>, 24).</p>
<p>Analyses of mainstream media coverage in recent years show that heterosexuals are framed in public discourse as being largely unaware, naïve, or complacent about HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12450015">Newman and Persson 2009</xref>), and that the risk of HIV infection tends to be construed as a peripheral problem of “others” or “elsewhere” (Persson and Newman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1097184X12450015">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12450015">McKay et al. 2011</xref>). This marginalization of HIV is borne out by the absence of a culture of regular HIV testing among heterosexual people, akin to that among gay men, a practice which enables early diagnosis of HIV. While regular testing of heterosexuals would be both costly and unwarranted from a public health perspective, one stark effect is the continued overrepresentation of heterosexual people among late presenters with an AIDS diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X12450015">NCHECR 2011</xref>, 29). Another effect of this marginalization of HIV is the intense secrecy found among HIV-affected heterosexuals themselves (Persson and Richards, 2008a; Persson et al. 2006). Also indicative of the general perception that HIV is not a heterosexual concern is the fact that as late as 2004, over twenty years after the start of the epidemic, next to no research had been conducted in Australia specifically on heterosexuals with HIV.</p>
<p>In response to this conspicuous gap, the author initiated and led the Straightpoz study, focusing on men and women living heterosexually with HIV, including HIV-negative partners of people with HIV. It remains the only study of its kind in Australia. The study commenced in 2004 and was conducted at the The National Centre in HIV Social Research at the University of New South Wales in collaboration with the Heterosexual HIV/AIDS Service NSW, commonly known as Pozhet. The aim of this qualitative, longitudinal cohort study was to build a comprehensive picture of the experiences of living with HIV among this greatly under-researched population in the local epidemic, including issues around diagnosis, stigma, disclosure, health, treatments, services, relationships, and sexual practice (Persson et al. 2006, 2009; Persson 2008, 2010, 2011; Persson and Richards 2008a, 2008b). Consequently, the scope of the study was much broader than the particular issue considered here. The study included three phases of data collection conducted in 2004, 2006, and 2009, using the methods of indepth, semistructured interviews, and some fieldwork. The study was approved by the University of New South Wales ethics committee.</p>
<p>A total of forty-eight participants participated in one or more interviews. Of these, twenty-one were men with HIV who came from diverse socioeconomic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. They ranged in age from thirty to seventy years, with the majority in their forties and fifties, and had been living with HIV between one and twenty years, with thirteen men having received their diagnosis during the nineties. Mode of HIV infection varied and included unprotected heterosexual sex (three men), needle sharing (five), surgical procedure (two), sex with men (two), while nine men said they did not know how they had become infected or declined to provide this information. Interviews were audiorecorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim. Identifying information was removed from the transcripts or changed to ensure the participants’ anonymity. Interviews were interpreted through thematic analysis, the foundational method for qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12450015">Braun and Clarke 2006</xref>). Transcripts were coded by hand according to the key issues covered in the interviews, focusing on the identification of both recurrent and divergent themes, which were then analyzed in detail to build a contextualized understanding of differences and similarities across interviews and across time. The author conducted all interviews, coding, and data analysis. For the purposes of this article, data codes relating to sexual identity and masculinity were reexamined and closely read alongside theories on heteronormativity.</p>
<p>Over the course of the study, the close and invaluable partnership with Pozhet has involved ongoing consultation and concrete collaborative work, such as shaping the focus of each phase of the study, drafting interview schedules, developing recruitment strategies, coauthoring reports, journal articles and presentations, me actively participating in various Pozhet workshops, and together having countless conversations about ideas, issues and patterns relating to the client group. Pozhet is a statewide health promotion service for men and women living heterosexually with HIV in NSW, including HIV-negative partners. It is one of the only two services in Australia targeted specifically at this client group. Pozhet began in 1991 as a small peer-support group run by volunteers and has since grown in both scope and staff. The service engages with clients from across the state, of all ages and various cultural and social backgrounds. Men living heterosexually with HIV make up approximately half of the service’s client group. The primary role of the service is to provide support and education to enhance the physical, sexual, and emotional health of its clients through a variety of means, including a free-call telephone helpline, an interactive website, an e-newsletter, and regular workshops and events. Another important role of the service is advocacy and workforce training, which aims to ensure that the needs of heterosexual people with HIV and their partners and families are kept on the agenda of HIV health services and relevant nongovernment organizations and included in HIV education and health care initiatives.</p>
<p>In our individual work, my Pozhet collaborators and I have often come across what seems like a need among men with HIV to clarify their heterosexuality in various ways, a theme which we have noted in many of our conversations. When first encountering these sometimes overt statements of sexual identity, we were not quite sure what to make of them, partly because of the unambiguous focus of our work, but also feeling somewhat uneasy with the potential undertones of homophobia. But over time, and through discussions with each other, what began to develop was a sense that a more nuanced reading of this theme was needed, especially since many of these men actually express considerable respect and gratitude toward the gay community for having fought so hard for HIV treatments and services during the early epidemic. Based on these discussions and my follow-on analysis and theorization, I suggest that to understand this pervasive and persistent narrative among these men, we need to consider the similarly pervasive and persistent power of heterosexuality as a norm in society. I now turn to theories of heteronormativity to explore some useful tools with which to tease out this phenomenon.</p>

<title>Heteronormativity</title>
<p>Scholarly problematizations of heterosexuality date back to feminist and sociological writings in the 1970s, with Adrienne Rich’s (1980) work on “compulsory heterosexuality” representing a landmark effort to destabilize heterosexuality as a natural category. The 1990s saw a renewed and radical critique of heterosexuality among queer and feminist theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1999</xref>). Scholars such as Eve Kosofsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12450015">Sedgwick (1990</xref>), Judith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12450015">Butler (1990</xref>), and Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1097184X12450015">Warner (1991</xref>) began to identify the totalizing tendency of heterosexuality, what Warner referred to as the “default <italic>heteronormativity</italic> of modern culture” (1991, 16, emphasis added), and later described by Celia Kitzinger as the myriad ways in which heterosexuality is produced and institutionalized “as a natural, unproblematic, taken-for-granted, ordinary phenomenon” (2005, 478).</p>
<p>Today, the concept of “heteronormativity” is widely used in political, social, and critical theory to describe the power of heterosexuality when it operates as a norm, as a regulatory practice that sets the conditions of possibility and impossibility for gender identity and behaviours. As such, scholars argue that heteronormativity should be distinguished from homophobia. They suggest that the use of homophobia as a political concept encourages an interpretation that reduces the political and material effects of heteronormativity to the explicit actions or prejudices of homophobic individuals, and thereby risks obscuring the broader, systemic problems at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12450015">Chambers 2007</xref>, 664; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X12450015">Kitzinger 2005</xref>, 478), a point that has clear relevance to my concerns in this article.</p>
<p>The concept of heteronormativity reveals institutional, cultural, and legal conventions that reify and encode the norm of heterosexuality. It reveals that heterosexual desire and identity are not merely assumed in social interactions; they are expected, even demanded. Heteronormativity emphasises the extent to which everyone, straight or queer, will be scrutinized, measured, evaluated, and judged from the perspective of the heterosexual norm. It privileges and rewards those identities, practices, and relationships that more closely approximate the norm, while stigmatizing or rendering invisible those that deviate from it (Chambers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12450015">2007</xref>, 664–66 also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1097184X12450015">Johnson 2002</xref>). Rather than being a natural expression of gender and sexuality, it is through these institutional and everyday social practices that heterosexuality is continually produced and sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12450015">Richardson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1999</xref>). Indeed, heterosexuality, according to Butler, is <italic>performative;</italic> always in the process of being constituted in time and space through “stylized repetition of acts” (1990, 141), acts that mimic its own norms “and thereby produce the effect of being natural” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12450015">Richardson 1996</xref>, 5).</p>
<p>The naturalization of heterosexuality, which renders it unmarked and invisible, might also explain why heterosexual identities and the quotidian practices through which they are reproduced have until recently received little attention in the academic literature. As noted by Richardson in the nineties, where sexuality is taken up as a “significant category for social analysis it has been primarily in the context of theorising the ‘sexual other’, defined in relation to a normative heterosexuality” (1996, 1). Others have similarly observed a lack of empirical work on heterosexuality and have emphasised that, although queer and feminist theory problematizes heteronormativity, what is less often explored is <italic>the effect of heteronormativity on heterosexuals themselves</italic> (Hockey, Meah, and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X12450015">2007</xref>, 32–33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1999</xref>, 15–16). Critical inquiries have tended to conflate heterosexuality as an institution with heterosexual practices and experiences, treating it as if it were monolithic or coherent, denying it any complexity and ignoring its internal struggles and subversions, its diversity and contested meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1996</xref>, 21–30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">1999</xref>, 165; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12450015">Richardson 1996</xref>, 2).</p>
<p>It is these fault lines within heteronormativity that are of interest in this article because of what they can reveal. Significant here is the observation made by Hockey and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X12450015">2007</xref>) that the power of heteronormativity not only masks the cultural and lived specificities of heterosexuality; it also complicates attempts to examine it. How can a category that is so ubiquitous and dominant, yet so invisible, be captured and interrogated? “Being ‘everywhere and nowhere,’ heterosexuality resists critical reflection” (2007, 4). Confronting this dilemma in their own research, they found that one gateway into this “perversely obscure” category was precisely to focus on its “shadow self ”; its limits, failures, transgressions, and exclusions, in short, its criteria for disqualification (2007, 9–11). Such criteria vary across cultures and time; for example, the change in attitude with regard to premarital sex or having children “out of wedlock” in western societies (2007, 11), while others such as sexual violence, “perversity” and infidelity seem to persist across time (even though they might be sanctioned and assume contrary meanings in delimited or nonnormative contexts). Examples of contemporary criteria might include polyamorous relationships, having children through surrogacy, or being HIV positive. Alongside these shifting fault lines, heterosexuality has one enduring point of vulnerability, which is at the same time integral to its own production, and of particular relevance to the analysis at hand: its relationship to homosexuality.</p>
<p>Heterosexuality is not only about identification, but also and importantly about <italic>dis</italic>identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12450015">Richardson 2004</xref>, 402); a process which not only shores up its borders but also constitutes its Achilles’ heel. Within the heteronormative framework, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X12450015">Butler (1997</xref>) and other feminist scholars have argued, the cultural formation of gender identity emerges not out of affirmation, but out of negation. Heterosexual masculinity, in particular, is defined by what it is not, by what it rejects, above all femininity and “sissydom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X12450015">Kimmel 1994</xref>). Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X12450015">Butler (1997</xref>) puts it, heterosexual identity is constituted through the disavowal of homosexual attachments. Inherently unstable and fragile, it depends on the repetitive repudiation of these “other” identities for its own security and coherence. In this way, homosexuality and heterosexuality define each other in a reciprocal, but hierarchical relationship; neither makes sense without the other. Heterosexuality is sustained as the norm by excluding and naming that which does not conform, that which is “other.” Yet, as with any binary, heterosexuality is inescapably tenuous, because its “other”—on which it depends—is always present and, hence, always threatens to undo it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X12450015">Jackson 2005</xref>, 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1097184X12450015">Fuss 2001</xref>). It is here that we begin to find some crucial pointers to the thematization of sexual identity among heterosexual men diagnosed with HIV in the Australian context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1097184X12450015">
<title>HIV and the “Undoing” of Heterosexual Masculinity</title>
<p>Because of the historical and cultural ways HIV has been gendered in Australia, having HIV clearly deviates from and destabilizes heteronormative masculinity. This is illustrated by Tobias’ story, to cite one of many examples among the men in the Straightpoz study. Fifty-year old Tobias, who was diagnosed in 1991, talked about how having HIV was incompatible with his identity as an officer in the military, a classic bastion of dominant masculinity. He described how he would attend Anzac commemoration days in his uniform, looking “pretty flash” and having girls take photos of him, thinking he is “a bloody hero.” He then added: “But the truth of the matter is a little bit less than that,” the implication being that having HIV made him “less” of a man. He was concerned about this in relation to a woman he had recently met online. Although he resented having to “live a lie,” he had not yet disclosed his HIV status to her, afraid that it would shatter her illusion of him.<disp-quote>
<p>I’m an officer—an officer and a gentleman—all that sort of stuff. That’s the impression she’s got. I ain’t going to tell her yet that I’m HIV positive. One day we’ll make it there. But I know deep down that I’m putting my best side forward. But there’s a thing just around the corner.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Tobias was infected through what he described as a one-off sexual encounter with another man while being drunk on leave during an overseas military mission. For him, the emasculating effects of having HIV in the context of potential heterosexual romance were framed by themes around: a sexually “deviant” past that had to be accounted for at some point (and which was also the reason for his divorce from his ex-wife); an infectious legacy both alien and unanticipated in heterosexual liaisons; and a perceived inability to measure up to his own pretensions of idealized masculinity. In addition to these themes of heteronormative disqualifications, the homosexual connotation of HIV and its terrorizing power to “unmask” him as not being a “real man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X12450015">Kimmel 1994</xref>) was explicitly foregrounded by Tobias when commenting on the hypermasculine milieu of the military.<disp-quote>
<p>If I went in to work and said, “I’m HIV positive,” they’d baulk because it is aligned with the gay side of the community . . . They’d say, “Shit, we never thought Tobias was a poof ” . . . [That] doesn’t make me resent either HIV or the gay community. It only gives me more sympathy for them.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The invisibility of HIV in Australian heterosexual society and its designation as a “gay disease” was evident in the circumstances of diagnosis among the men in the study. None were diagnosed as a result of regular HIV testing. Severe illness was, by far, the most common reason for having an HIV test. Few had ever considered HIV as a personal concern or risk and most were utterly shocked to find themselves HIV positive.<disp-quote>
<p>[The doctor] looks at me and he puts his hands on my shoulders and goes “I’m really sorry to tell you. You’ve been diagnosed with HIV”. And I went “With <italic>what?”</italic> I just didn’t get it. I just plain didn’t get it . . . I couldn’t hear a word he was saying. I was looking at the wall, trying to think, treading my steps back . . . you know, how, where, when? (Cameron, aged 43, diagnosed 2003, does not know how he got HIV).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Most of the men perceived HIV as highly stigmatized in heterosexual society, insisting that people were generally still prejudiced against those who contracted the virus. They spoke at length about heterosexual people being ignorant and uninformed, how they mistakenly thought HIV happened only to gay men. Most admitted to a similar mind-set prior to their HIV diagnosis. Fifty-eight year old Morris, for example, underwent a multitude of tests when he landed in hospital seriously ill. He was convinced that his HIV test would be negative because he was a heterosexual man.<disp-quote>
<p>[I was] ignorant about the whole thing. That’s why when the doctor said he wanted to do the test I said “I won't have it; I'm not gay, there’s no way” . . . I thought a hundred per cent I wouldn't have it. I have found out since that a lot of people that are not gay have it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The men attributed such ignorance to a lack of HIV education and public discussion about the virus in broader society. At the same time, they struggled to come to grips with the homophobia and “politics of sexual shame” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12450015">Warner 2000</xref>) that besiege heterosexuality and, by implication, fuel the stigma of having HIV in a society where HIV positivity equals homosexuality, or else some kind of heterosexual transgression or “deviance,” such as promiscuity, prostitution, infidelity, swinging, or illicit drug use. For the men in the Straightpoz study, the cultural inscribing of HIV as “gay” was experienced as a loss of control over their identity. Regardless of how they got HIV, they often felt like they were being forced into an “identity corner” where they had to counter or pre-empt other people’s assumptions about their sexuality, including health professionals and HIV sector workers, or else keep their HIV status a secret. The following comments were typical.<disp-quote>
<p>People who are not positive immediately think it’s a gay thing, yeah, so I decided not to talk about it. There’s a lot of stigma about HIV. (Gordon, aged 59, diagnosed in 1996, does not know how he got HIV)</p>
<p>The first thing people would think “Oh, you're gay” or “You were gay or you caught it that way,” you know? Especially in that I’m not married and I’m a single man, you know? So I don't know what people who don’t really know me think. I don’t care now really, but that <italic>really</italic> annoys me, the stigma of it . . . I get sick of the, you know, if you’ve got HIV, “Oh, you’re gay.” (Kevin, aged 56, diagnosed in 1986, got HIV through sharing needles)</p>
<p>Everybody seems to think, “You’re HIV? You’re gay! You’re not gay? You’re a drug user then.” You know? Can’t they get it any other way? Is that the only two ways in the world? They don’t realise, you know. (Gavin, aged 46, diagnosed in 2000, got HIV through heterosexual sex)</p>

</p>
<p>Stigmatization, as sociologist Erving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X12450015">Goffman (1963</xref>) observed, is fundamentally about social relationships, not individual attributes. This rendering of stigma is compatible with the concept of heteronormativity as a regulatory power that shapes how people negotiate their identities and live their lives. In fact, as already noted, heteronormativity is sustained through practices of exclusion and stigmatization. Self-stigmatization, Goffman wrote, involves a degree of acceptance of society’s prejudices against oneself. If people are already socialized to subscribe to those prejudices prior to being stigmatized themselves, internalization of stigma may be particularly difficult to resist. That is, if heterosexual men are complicit in stereotyping <italic>who </italic>gets HIV, only to suddenly find that they have become “one of those people,” if only by association, they are likely to turn those prejudices against themselves. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X12450015">Goffman’s (1963</xref>, 7) words:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he standards he has incorporated from the wider society equip him to be intimately alive to what others see as his failing, inevitably causing him, if only for moments, to agree that he does indeed fall short of what he really ought to be. Shame becomes a central possibility, arising from the individual’s perception of one of his attributes as being a defiling thing to possess and one he can readily see himself as not possessing.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>On this approach, it becomes possible to reconcile the fact that the men in the Straightpoz study often showed genuine signs of having become more sensitized toward homophobia and the plight of sexual minorities since being diagnosed with HIV, while at the same time having internalized society’s homophobic stigmatisation of HIV. Consequently, as much as they resented it, having HIV was clearly perceived a major heterosexual disqualification. There was a shared sense of not quite belonging in the heterosexual community anymore. Some men had withdrawn socially and sexually to avoid questions or feelings of alienation or the possibility of rejection. “You steer clear of things that you think will cause you problems and that’s relationships,” Kevin explained. “I hate what I’m saying, but it’s a fact.” HIV posed distinct challenges to the men’s sense of heterosexual masculinity, not only by raising questions around their sexual orientation but also by affecting their capacity to enact conventional gender expectations. Infectiousness and ill health compounded the stigma of HIV and compromised many men’s perceived ability to find a partner, father children and, in some cases, to “provide” for a family; all significant tokens of heterosexual masculinity in many cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X12450015">Connell 1995</xref>). As Brendan, who was single, put it:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m at the opinion, what have I got to offer . . . Would you gamble your feelings and emotions on a bloke that could be dead in six months . . . there is no future to offer a girl . . . [HIV] puts a hell of a clamp on your love and your sex life. (Brendan, aged 48, diagnosed 1992, got HIV through sharing needles)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Gavin, aged 48, who was in a long-term relationship that predated his late diagnosis with an AIDS-defining illness in 2000, lamented that his resulting poor health had ruined his ability to work and earn money, to have sex, and to “protect” his partner; rendering his existence one of “weakness” and thus antithetical to heterosexual manhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X12450015">Kimmel 1994</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Nowadays I don’t even <italic>feel </italic>like a man half the time, you know, I just feel useless type thing quite a lot. I can’t do the things that I used to . . . Really, you know, if we had been relying on sex and money, we would have been finished <italic>a long</italic> time ago.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And yet, despite these commonly expressed feelings of heterosexual disqualification and diminished masculinity, or perhaps because of them as I suggest below, the men simultaneously emphasized their heterosexual identity through their stories or through its naming; this unusual yet seemingly purposive verbal “doing” of heterosexuality appearing awkwardly, as if compensatorily, alongside narrative of its “undoing” by HIV.</p>

<title>“I’m Not Gay or Anything”: The “Doing” of Heterosexual Masculinity</title>
<p>As my Pozhet collaborators and I have found in our respective interactions with heterosexual men with HIV, they are inclined to be very protective about their sexual identity. Despite the explicit focus of the Straightpoz study, men who have participated have nonetheless and frequently shown a need to affirm their heterosexuality to the interviewing researcher. They have done so either by stating it directly, as for example Derek: “You’ve probably gathered I’m not gay or anything like that. . .. Please don’t get the wrong idea.” Or they have emphasize their engagement in what could be described as dominant “masculine” pursuits, such as riding motorbikes, shooting, doing martial arts, playing sports, drinking, or getting into fights. Some would elaborate, sometimes extensively, on their sexual history with women, or talk about their present or future desires to fulfill gender role expectations as husbands, fathers, and providers. Many would also point out their discomfort around acquaintances and health workers making assumptions about their sexuality on the basis of their HIV status, or describe at length how they, as heterosexual men, did not feel welcome or comfortable when accessing what they saw as predominantly gay-oriented HIV health and support services. At the heart of such descriptions was a sense of being adrift or dislocated, of trying to articulate a place in the epidemic. While HIV had fractured their sense of belonging in the heterosexual world, they also felt like cultural outsiders in the local HIV community.<disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult for me to have my condition defined in a foreign sexuality to me, and have the services almost shaped around that. And that’s completely separate to—like because I think there should be gay everything, really, I’ve got no problem with that. But the shortage of, not services but, an overview and perspective on straight HIV people is profound, I think . . . they don’t fit. I think what I’m trying to say is; they don’t seem to fit. There’s no place that they actually plug in to, whereas gay positive people seem to at least have a place to plug in to. (Dean, aged 49, diagnosed 1998, got HIV through sharing needles)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The same kind of narratives and expressions of identity are commonly encountered by Pozhet staff. For example, often when men first enter the service, re-engage with the service, or meet new staff, they will, despite the service’s unambiguous name, emphasize their heterosexuality and relate stories that foreground “masculine” traits and pastimes, as noted above. In addition, they often express relief and gratitude about being able to access an HIV service for “straight” men where their sexual orientation is not an issue. Yet, curiously, many still feel a need to declare it. No specific Australian data exist on mode of HIV transmission among men who identify as heterosexual, but there is ample anecdotal evidence that sex with men is a relatively common mode. However, it is part of Pozhet’s philosophy to not inquire about mode of transmission and to treat it as irrelevant from a service perspective. The purpose behind this approach is to place emphasis on sexuality as a social practice rather than an intrinsic identity. It recognizes sexual fluidity and allows for diverse sexual histories, while focusing squarely on the current cultural context in which people <italic>live</italic> with HIV. An ironic corollary of this considered approach, however, is that it opens up a grey area, one of potential sexual ambiguity and conjecture, which might partly explain why many of Pozhet’s male clients feel a need to clarify their sexual identity.</p>
<p>But there are deeper cultural reasons why this naming is significant. The power of heteronormativity partly derives from the fact that the specificity of heterosexuality remains largely unacknowledged. As Jackson observes: “Most of the population ‘do’ heterosexuality every day without reflecting critically on that doing” (1999, 180). Heterosexuality is rarely articulated as an identity or thematized in accounts of social life, but is simply presumed, precisely because of its naturalised status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12450015">Richardson 1996</xref>, 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12450015">2004</xref>, 401). As the unexamined norm, it “needs no name and no justification for its existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1999</xref>, 3). The term “heterosexuality” is sometimes not even understood, because heterosexuals are simply “normal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson 1999</xref>, 174). In ordinary circumstances, Morgan, Steiner, and Morgan Thompson argue, “There is no proverbial ‘coming out’ experience for heterosexual individuals, no moment of identity confrontation whereupon they declare to the world, ‘I am a heterosexual!’” (2010, 425). However, the less ordinary circumstances of an HIV diagnosis produce precisely such a “coming out” experience for many heterosexual men who feel compelled to articulate their sexual identity. This unorthodox naming of heterosexuality disrupts its normative, taken-for-granted status, which gives us a clue to its discombobulating effect and the uneasiness it tends to provoke.</p>
<p>Jackson makes the key point that, “heterosexuality is named by straights only when it is felt to be under threat” (1999, 173). As a matter of course, heterosexuality is sustained through silence: “It dare not speak its name, for in so doing it makes evident what it keeps hidden, that it is only one form of sexuality” (1999, 173). But when its boundaries become blurred or questioned, when its privilege and exclusivity is imperilled in some way, heterosexuality tends to be brought into sharp focus, at times provoking forms of heteronormative assertiveness. Gay marriage is a contemporary example of such a “threat” at a socio-political level, which has given rise to “the formation of a self-conscious public heterosexual identity” among both opponents and supporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12450015">Richardson 2004</xref>, 402). A different example at a more personal level is the one at hand: the threat that an HIV diagnosis can pose to some Australian men’s sense of heterosexual masculinity because of the virus’ cultural and epidemiological association with male homosexuality. It is noteworthy that there is no such association between HIV and lesbianism in Australia and that the women with HIV who took part in the Straightpoz study were far less inclined to emphasise their heterosexuality in the sense of a sexual identity. Another interesting point is that the study attracted a much larger response from heterosexual men compared to women. The likely reason for this is that the study provided a far rarer opportunity for these men to tell their story and to have their experiences acknowledged and “put on the HIV map,” which many mentioned as significant. It is also possible that participating in research specifically focused on heterosexuals with HIV provided them with a way to “formally” affirm their sexuality. This might also explain why more men than women tend to participate in the various service activities of Pozhet. </p>
<p>In short, then, HIV can bring into articulation that which normally “does not want to be named,” as Barthes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X12450015">2000</xref>, 138) put it. But it can also bring about a new emphasis on heterosexuality in terms of how it is <italic>lived. </italic>That is, it can become more privileged as a sexual orientation than it actually had been prior to diagnosis. As both my collaborators and I have seen examples of in our work, concerns about being perceived as homosexual because of HIV sometimes leads to a kind of hyperconformity to heteronormative masculinity. In some instances, where men have a history of engaging in both gay and straight sex, the HIV diagnosis becomes a catalyst for returning to, or entering into, exclusive heterosexuality. My Pozhet collaborators relayed the following (deidentified) story: on his first call to the Pozhet free-call helpline, George, a man in his fifties, was informed that he did not need to disclose his mode of transmission or his sexual history, but he insisted upon telling his story. He had been a married man and had two adult sons. However, George’s marriage had ended when his wife found e-mails from his male lover, and his relationship with his sons had been severely compromised after they found gay porn on his computer. When he was subsequently diagnosed with HIV, George abandoned his same-sex relationships and declared himself to be exclusively “straight.” Throughout this initial phone call, and subsequent others, he assiduously emphasised his heterosexuality, both in name and through foregrounding his interests in “masculine” pursuits and his desire to date women.</p>
<p>Stories along similar lines were told by men in the Straightpoz study. For example, thirty-four-year old Nelson had been sexually active in what he referred to as the “gay scene” and the “heterosexual swingers’ scene” prior to his HIV diagnosis in 2003. He explained that, as soon as he found out he had HIV, he “linked up with Pozhet” and also stressed that he no longer had sex with men:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t do [that] anymore, believe me . . . I think I got <italic>so</italic> spooked by it. I believe it’s how I got HIV . . . And, yeah, like wow, you know, [I’ve] just really come to a point in my life, I think, where I really appreciate female company.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Throughout the interview, Nelson repeated his wish to “settle down with the right woman.” It was as if he was trying to undo, or atone for, the “transgressive” sexual desires that he believed had led to his HIV infection by disavowing them in favor of absolute heterosexuality and by expressing his readiness to embrace heteronormative domesticity. In other words, men with a sexually diverse history might try to reduce the dual stigmas of HIV and homosexuality by actively dissociating themself from one of them, especially if they believe they became infected through sex with men. But the “politics of sexual shame” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12450015">Warner 2000</xref>) can also play out in converse ways, with “heterosexual” men having sex exclusively with other men after their diagnosis, because they feel that there is a cultural space for HIV-positive sex within the gay community, or else because they feel that their HIV status has completely disqualified them from participating in a heterosexual world, most of all sexually, and now that they have a “gay disease” they have “little choice but become gay,” as one Straightpoz participant put it. Such stories are less common in the work that I and my collaborators do, presumably because “heterosexual” men who become oriented toward sex with men after being diagnosed with HIV are less likely to access services or participate in research that focus on heterosexuality. But such stories bring about additional and no less problematic, yet powerful questions around HIV and sexual identity, which I hope future research, including my own, will usefully explore.</p>

<title>Concluding Reflections</title>
<p>In conclusion, Australian heterosexual men experience a privileged position in society. When this position is compromised and their identity “spoiled” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X12450015">Goffman 1963</xref>) by an illness that derives much of its stigma from its explicit association with homosexuality, reclaiming their status and identity as heterosexual men might take on considerable importance. As I have suggested here, the tendency among these men to emphasize their heterosexuality is an attempt to regain some control by pushing back against the “identity corner,” which they feel they are being forced into because of HIV. While they cannot change or “undo” their HIV status, they can resist the “undoing” of their sexual identity to some extent, even if only through articulating it. As I have discussed elsewhere, for some men, forming a relationship with an HIV-negative woman becomes a powerful conduit back to heteronormality (Persson and Richards 2008b). But if men with HIV see intimate relationships, sex, fatherhood, and other culturally specific ways of “doing” heterosexuality as being out of bounds due to a sense of damaged masculinity, or due to the generally poor understanding among heterosexuals of the implications of living with HIV, then the naming of heterosexuality can become particularly important.</p>
<p>As I have also suggested, this naming reveals more than just a sexual identity. Stevi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12450015">Jackson (1999</xref>, 165), whose work has greatly inspired my analysis, is wary of any declaration of heterosexuality as an identity. She argues that “Just as being white in a racist society can only be a political rallying point for the racist Right, being heterosexual cannot become a positively affirmed political identity except to preserve heterosexual privilege.” However, heterosexual experiences that fall outside of heteronormativity are significant in that they challenge its privileged status by exposing its fault lines and, as such, they <italic>are</italic> political. And it is here that HIV becomes so instructive. HIV is a “profoundly social illness,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X12450015">Kippax, Holt, and Friedman (2011</xref>, e1) argue. Because the virus is so “deeply embedded in social, cultural and political processes,” it also has the capacity to, in turn, lay bare such processes and their contingent, mutable nature.</p>
<p>In the context that I have explored, HIV reveals in powerful ways the “undoing” of heterosexuality, but also attempts to “do” heterosexuality in response to this undoing. In this process, these men thematize a sexual category whose naturalized status is ordinarily maintained through silence, through its own nonarticulation, thus disrupting the taken-for-grantedness of heterosexuality that infuses society. Or to put it this way: an illness that is largely invisible in the heterosexual community makes visible an otherwise invisible sexual category. But it does more; as an ancillary effect it also disrupts the taken-for-grantedness of homosexuality in the local HIV sector, where men are assumed to be gay unless stated otherwise. It is not the case that heterosexual men with HIV feel compelled to name their sexuality simply to protect their identity or reclaim their status. In fact, many are aware that this naming can come across as homophobic, which troubles them. And yet they feel they <italic>have</italic> to name it, out of necessity, in an attempt to obtain support and resources that are relevant to them and their specific circumstances. By doing so, they also make visible a sexual category that is otherwise largely invisible in the Australian HIV sector.</p>
<p>As with any analysis, this one has its limitations, partly because it is a secondary analysis drawn from research that was not primarily designed to look specifically at this issue, but the supplementary use of anecdotal evidence based on my collaborator’s extensive professional engagement with these men adds strength to the case. The analysis is also limited by the focus on the NSW context and by the absence of greater cultural diversity among Straightpoz participants and those who access Pozhet. For example, the growing numbers of men with HIV who have immigrated to Australia from sub-Saharan Africa usually come from cultural backgrounds in which HIV is not associated with homosexuality, but is stigmatized in other ways that might give rise to different kinds of experiences and narratives of heterosexuality. Future research might also be able to capture a broader spectrum of stories through a focus on generational perspectives; not only in terms of changing ideals of masculinity but also in terms of the intersections and divergences between sexual subjectivities shaped by the terrorizing times of the early epidemic and those shaped by a diagnosis in a contemporary context where HIV can be said to be, in many respects, a very different illness to what it once was.</p>
<p>However, the analysis I have pursued here is by no means intended to be conclusive or definitive, but rather is a preliminary attempt to open up this thorny terrain in order to move toward better understanding and much needed discussions of how heteronormativity shapes the lives of those who identify as heterosexual. There has been a recent surge in interest around masculinity, driven by key scholars such as Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1097184X12450015">Kimmel (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X12450015">2010</xref>) and Raewyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X12450015">Connell (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1097184X12450015">2000</xref>), and evinced by the founding of <italic>Men and Masculinities </italic>and similar journals in recent years. Heeding a call by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1097184X12450015">Connell (2000</xref>), Hockey and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X12450015">2007</xref>, 41) argue that what should be a fundamental direction in this relatively new field of study is more “sociological attention to the emotional dimensions of men’s experiences of heterosexuality.” By tracing the fault lines it brings into view, HIV provides a valuable lens through which to explore how men make sense of their sexual identity and lived experiences and how these relate to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1097184X12450015">Ingraham (1999</xref>, 12) has referred to as the inherent “state of crisis and contradiction” of heterosexuality. This is a complex issue affecting a vulnerable and often isolated population of men living with HIV in Australia. We should therefore be careful not to dismiss their tendency to affirm their sexual identity as simply an expression of homophobia, but rather try to understand the dynamics behind it and the purposes it might serve.</p>
