<abstract>
<p>Scholars agree that aggression among children can lead to a host of delinquency issues that can last into adulthood. Research has found that exposure to violence is one of the strongest predictors of aggressive behaviour and the use of violence. Utilizing a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, the article seeks to determine the effect of exposure to community violence on levels of aggression among children in Kingston, Jamaica. Using data obtained from a sample of preparatory and primary school children, the article finds that unlike studies done in larger countries, there was no significant difference in aggression among the children. With levels of aggression similar across the sample, the article argues that the widespread nature of violence in Kingston means that no one is immune to the effects. Exposure occurs in a number of ways and the direct witnessing of community violence is only one of a variety of risk factors for increased aggression.</p>

<title>Exposure to violence</title>
<p>The frequent and continual exposure of children to community violence is an issue of increasing concern internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0907568211422612">UNODC, 2007</xref>). Evidence from the United States for example suggests that as many as one-third of all children are the victims of some form of violence and approximately 90 percent witness violence at least once during their lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0907568211422612">Richters and Martinez, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568211422612">Gorman-Smith et al. (2004)</xref>, for example, in their study involving 263 African-American and Latino youth from inner-city communities in Chicago, concluded that rates of exposure were ‘quite high’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568211422612">Guterman and Cameron (1997)</xref> found that 80–90 percent of American inner-city children have either witnessed or been victims of violence in their communities.</p>
<p>Rates of violent crime within the Caribbean are particularly high. It has been suggested that the Caribbean region as a whole has the highest per capita murder rate in the world with rates increasing steadily in most islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0907568211422612">UNODC, 2007</xref>). Much of this violence occurs in poor, urban, densely populated communities in which high levels of deprivation and violent crime have led to insecurity among residents. Such communities are common in the inner-city of the Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), Jamaica. However, they also exist in Guyana (Buxton), Haiti (Cite Soleil) and Trinidad and Tobago (Laventille) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0907568211422612">UNODC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0907568211422612">WINAD, 2006</xref>). As a result, levels of childhood exposure to violent activity are high the Caribbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0907568211422612">Zavaschi et al., 2002</xref>). The Jamaican experience has received a great deal of attention as inner-city children are exposed to extreme forms of violence on an almost daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211422612">Bailey, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0907568211422612">Samms-Vaughan et al. (2005)</xref> highlighted the high level of community violence to which Jamaican children are exposed through an assessment of exposure of 1674 urban 11- to 12-year-olds. They found that a third of the children surveyed had witnessed severe acts of physical violence while a fifth had been victims themselves. Boys and children attending primary school had the greatest level of exposure. School type has become a proxy for exposure to violence among children in Jamaica, as many of the children who attend primary schools live in poor areas that are plagued by violence.</p>
<sec id="section2-0907568211422612">
<title>Exposure to violence and aggression</title>
<p>There is some variation in the manner in which aggression and violence are defined and the terms are often used interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0907568211422612">Standford et al., 2003</xref>). However, most researchers define aggression in ways that are consistent with the definition proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568211422612">Baron and Richardson (1994)</xref>, as behaviour intended to harm or injure another who is motivated to avoid harm. A distinction is made between affective and predatory. Affective (hostile, reactive) behaviour is prompted by a sense of threat and is likely to occur with visible displays of anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568211422612">Hubbard et al., 2010</xref>). Predatory aggression (proactive, instrumental) is more deliberate and directed to a goal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211422612">Bushman and Anderson (2001)</xref> have reservations about this dichotomous view, arguing that it creates confusion over motives and that many acts may encompass both. These, however, are the categories most often used. Violence may be seen as a severe form of aggressive behaviour, involving the intentional application of force or the threat of force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0907568211422612">Meloy, 2006</xref>). While all acts of violence are seen as forms of aggression, all acts of aggressions are not necessarily violent.</p>
<p>Research suggests that children who witness, or are victims of violence are at risk for a host of social and psychological problems, one of which is believed to be increased aggression. In fact, many argue that exposure to violence is one of the strongest predictors of aggressive behaviour and this link is well established in the international literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568211422612">Durant et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568211422612">Feigleman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568211422612">Gorman-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0907568211422612">Orue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0907568211422612">Salzinger et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, research seems to suggest that the origins of antisocial behaviour can be seen at a very early stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0907568211422612">Schuler and Nair (2001)</xref> conducted research among 6-year-olds, and found a higher level of behavioural issues, one of which was aggression, among those who had witnessed violence. Those exposed to violence also revealed higher stress scores on the Children’s Response to Stress Inventory. Studies have identified risk factors which, if present, increase the likelihood that children would develop problem behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568211422612">Howell and Egley, 2005</xref>). These risk factors have been grouped into five developmental domains – individual, family, peer group, school and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568211422612">Howell and Egley, 2005</xref>). At the individual level, the risk factors measured at ages 6–11 included exposure to violence. Those at the community level included disadvantaged neighbourhoods, exposure to firearm violence, feeling unsafe in the neighbourhood and aggression. The presence of multiple risk factors and risk factors in multiple domains, it is argued, increases the likelihood of delinquency.</p>

<title>The risk environment</title>
<p>Disadvantaged communities are viewed as disproportionally prone to violent activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0907568211422612">Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois (2004)</xref> have criticized the tendency of human and behavioural scientists to subsume violence in these communities under notions of human aggression. They point instead to the structural inequalities and power relations in the society which breed an oppositional street culture of resistance to exploitation. Exclusion from employment and inclusion in precarious wage labour, wrote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0907568211422612">Wacquant (2002)</xref>, maintain young men in a state of deprivation that is marginally preferable to joblessness. The American ghetto, the ‘peculiar institution’, is not economically viable in the lives of poor, black Americans (Wacquant, 2000). But this street culture is not just a reaction to economic deprivation. It is also a search for dignity and respect and a refusal to accept marginalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568211422612">Anderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568211422612">Bourgois, 2004</xref>). It can be understood as ‘a culture of opposition – if not resistance – to economic exploitation and cultural denigration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211422612">Bourgois, 2003</xref>). Repeated displays of nerve reinforce a reputation for vengeance and this deters disrespect, which is a source of anxiety in these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211422612">Anderson, 2002</xref>). Rage and desperation are internalized and converted into interpersonal everyday violence that is directed against themselves and their immediate community rather than their oppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211422612">Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211422612">Bourgois, 2003</xref>). The inner-city is a noisy place, write <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568211422612">Barnett and Whiteside (2000)</xref>. There is not only actual noise but also ‘the noise of risky competition to survive under conditions of stress’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568211422612">Barnett and Whiteside, 2000</xref>: 82). This is the risk environment which, some researchers argue, is a useful concept for an understanding of why people living under such conditions do what they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568211422612">Bourgois, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0907568211422612">Scheper-Hughes, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In many socially excluded inner-city communities in the KMA in Jamaica, children live with ‘the violence of everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0907568211422612">Scheper-Hughes, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0907568211422612">Moser and Holland (1997)</xref> linked this violence with the broader aspects of deprivation associated with social exclusion. This is a view supported by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568211422612">Chevannes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568211422612">Headley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0907568211422612">Levy, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0907568211422612">Headley (1996)</xref> argued that structural forces have produced not only anger and despair, but an at-risk population that acts out that anger and despair. The level of crime and the stigmatization of the communities have led to social isolation, ‘a kind of quarantine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0907568211422612">Levy, 1996</xref>: 39) robbing the poor of steady and worthwhile employment and the basic amenities on which self-respect and morale hinge. The outcome is a value system that exalts ‘badness’, pervasive violence, a ‘secret war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0907568211422612">Levy, 1996</xref>). Scholars have argued that children living in these communities are at considerable risk for aggressive behaviours and negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568211422612">Baker-Henningham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568211422612">Bartley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the violence in these communities results from inter- and intra-gang conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211422612">Bailey, 2010</xref>). However police incursions into communities that are virtually ‘extrastatal islands beyond the law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422612">Harriott, 2000</xref>) and their style of policing are often accompanied by gun-related violence. Some of these incidents are on such a scale that they affect the entire country and attract international attention and concern. The events in the inner-city community of Tivoli Gardens in May 2010 is an example. They stemmed from attempts by the security forces to apprehend a community leader for extradition to the US. A siege was followed by a clash between the security forces and members of the community in which more than 70 persons were killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568211422612">Chapin, 2010</xref>). There was violence also in number of poor communities where there was support for the people of Tivoli Gardens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568211422612"><italic>Jamaica Observer</italic>, 2010b</xref>: 1). Normal activities throughout the KMA were brought to a standstill as people were afraid to leave their homes. A State of Emergency was declared to allow the police to deal with the violence that threatened the stability of the country.</p>
<p>This represents an extreme though not isolated case. For the children living in inner-city communities in Jamaica, exposure to violence is an everyday experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0907568211422612">Samms-Vaughan et al. (2005)</xref> found that the most common experience of poor children who attended primary school was the loss of a family member or close friend to murder, an event that is reported to have profound psychological consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0907568211422612">Melhem et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0907568211422612">Payton and Krocker-Tuscan, 1988</xref>). Given the high level of violence in Jamaica, the study was designed to assess the extent to which young children display aggressive behaviours.</p>
<p>Using a sample of Jamaican primary and preparatory school children, we seek to answer the following questions:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study adopted a mixed methodology – a questionnaire survey and group discussions with primary and preparatory school children in the Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA) in Jamaica. Children in four schools (two primary schools in the public system and two private preparatory schools) participated in the study. The schools were selected because they represent two important categories of primary-level education in Jamaica. The children in publicly funded schools tend to be of a lower socioeconomic status than students who attend fee paying private preparatory schools.</p>
<p>The primary schools were selected with the assistance of the Ministry of Education, to represent inner-city schools and a school serving rural areas. The inner-city primary school (Garrison Primary) was situated in an area of shanty-town dwellings, tenements and government low-income schemes. Like, many of the communities in this zone it is a ‘garrison constituency’ – the safe seat, political stronghold, fortress that supports a particular political party, and is controlled by a gatekeeper, able to use his position of authority to deliver votes –the Maximum Leader or Don (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0907568211422612">Figueroa and Sives, 2003</xref>). Its political affiliation affects its relations with surrounding communities and explains many aspects of the intense gang warfare that typifies the community. Residents, including children, must adhere to the pattern of political socialization. Most household heads are self-employed, engaging in an activity referred to as ‘hustling’. This involves the selling of legal and illegal items and doing whatever is necessary to survive. Such communities, to a large extent, exist beyond the fundamental institutions of the state, for while state systems have not been completely supplemented, the communities have developed alternative institutions including an alternative justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422612">Harriott, 2000</xref>). The vast majority of students who attend the primary school reside within a half-mile radius of the school. They face isolation and stigmatization.</p>
<p>The second primary school (Rural Primary) was located in rural St Andrew, within a low-income settlement. This large school serves a very wide geographical area, drawing students from predominantly poor, subsistence agricultural areas. The two private preparatory schools, Prep One and Prep Two, were located within suburban St Andrew. The fees for private education put these schools outside the reach of poor families and their students are drawn from middle- and high-income families across the KMA.</p>
<p>The timing of the research coincided with the preparation of the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT), which meant the students from Grade 6 were unable to participate. Participants were drawn from Grade 5. Younger students were not asked to participate because of the cognitive and linguistic abilities required to complete the questionnaire. Typical Grade 5 students in Jamaica are between 9 and 11 years of age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0907568211422612">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The main instrument for the quantitative component was a questionnaire created for the study using an existing measure, the Aggression Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568211422612">Buss and Perry, 1992</xref>). The Buss–Perry Scale of Aggression is a 29-item questionnaire that assesses four distinct types of aggression: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility. Sample items from each aggression dimension are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568211422612">Table 1</xref>. Respondents were asked to rate each of the items on a seven-point scale in terms of how characteristic they were of their personalities (from (1) extremely uncharacteristic of me to (7) extremely characteristic of me). However, response categories were modified to make it easier for the students (from (1) definitely not like me to (5) very much like me).</p>

<sec id="section8-0907568211422612">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data collection took place during April 2008. In the case of the two public schools, permission was first obtained from the Ministry of Education, which then informed the schools of the request and of its approval. The school sent letters prepared by the researchers to parents. The letter outlined the purpose of the study and asked permission for their children to be included in the study. There were very few refusals. Approval from the Ministry was not required for collecting data at the two private schools. Instead permission was first obtained from the school principals/directors and then from parents. In both primary and preparatory schools, questionnaires were administered to students by two trained interviewers in a large classroom in a group setting. The interviewers answered questions as to how to complete the questionnaire but did not read the questions. On average these sessions lasted for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Eight students representing boys and girls of mixed abilities participated in the group discussions at each school. Garrison Primary school children were extremely articulate; their participation was animated, lively, excited and involved. This was in marked contrast to the stilted discussions held with Prep One and especially Prep Two participants. The discussions lasted for an average of 1 hour.</p>
<p>A number of quality assurance checks were put in place to ensure effective analysis of the data collected. Group discussions were led by a trained and experienced moderator and were taped and transcribed. Tapes were supplemented by the use of a note taker. A standardized protocol was developed together with a manual for data collection. These were discussed with the note taker who was asked to capture verbatim accounts of the discussion and to record non-verbal activity. Transcripts were produced soon after each group discussion. A list of themes had been decided upon before commencing the study. Before analysis, however, the data obtained were examined and new themes included. Coding took place during the analysis and sections of the data given labels. Extensive discussions with the note taker followed, to ensure a consensus on the findings, interpretation and conclusions.</p>

<title>The group discussions</title>
<p>As stated earlier, the link between community violence and neighbourhood characteristics is well established in the literature. Children living in poor communities suffer from disproportionate amounts of exposure as compared to their counterparts in more affluent communities. Focus group interviews confirmed the findings of previous research.</p>
<p>The children from Garrison Primary gave graphic accounts of incidents they had witnessed. They knew both those who were killed, as well as those doing the killing. They had lost friends and relatives in the ‘war’ between rival gangs as well as the ‘shoot out’ between the police, whom, they felt, were just as bad as the criminals and gunmen. They told their stories in popular song:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Police and tief [thief] inna shoot out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>and in mime:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One day at my sister’s basic school some men from [Community] came down and shoot this man in him [his] shoulder and you see him just spinning round and round.</p>
<p>Miss [Named victim] just lean up so, on the wall. Pure [many] shot in the side of him. From head go down to him toe. Shot full him up.</p>
<p>Me see man kill man.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their short lives they had become inured to ‘war’ and the weapons of ‘war’:</p>

<p>Miss . . . it’ snot like one time when you see people with something hang off of them pocket you ’fraid [afraid]. It’s not like that again. You see it hang off you get used to that now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, they felt that the violence would not affect them as long as they did not ‘follow’ or ‘trouble’ anybody. The children were comforted by what they saw as attempts by community leaders to hold perpetrators accountable, to prevent victims from retaliation and so build peace in the community. When they were wronged they appealed to the Don:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . this man saw me bathing . . . and he looked over on me . . . and it wasn’t the first time he did it. My mother told my brother . . . and the bad man say ‘you no hear the Don sister call you?’ . . . and they started beating him up. The first time he didn’t get the beating. It was the second time he did it so mother just tell them to beat him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was the Leader’s attempt to promote participation in order to make things right and to make the victim central to justice in a community in which violence was embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568211422612">Harriott, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The children of Rural Primary had experiences of a different kind. In the agricultural communities from which they were drawn, praedial larceny is a major problem and farmers suffer much crop and animal loss. Besides this, the children painted a picture of rural communities overrun by thieves. They steal household goods and motor cars. They steal from the Church:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Miss, they tief [steal] people plate and fork.</p>
<p>They did tief my Auntie car.</p>
<p>Miss, gunman come into my mother house and him take my mother CD and DVD.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unlike the inner-city communities, these remote agricultural communities are not controlled by Dons, and it appears that given the inability of the formal system to address the problems, individuals took the matter of justice into their own hands. The children related several incidents of vigilante justice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Miss a thief was coming from a corner bar and them [residents] shot him.</p>
<p>A man came to steal a car and the people in the community found him and kill him.</p>
<p>A man was stealing in the community Miss and the people caught him and cut off his head. I saw the head Miss . . . they were taking pictures.</p>
<p>One day miss, I was coming from school miss and I see a dead man at my gate and my mother said to me they shoot him and kill him because he was thiefing [stealing].</p>
<p>. . . they tie him pon [on] tree and hang him, Miss.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although discussants did not experience the constant interpersonal violence perpetrated by gang members that was common in the inner-city, they lived in communities in which there was a perception that the state was ineffective in enforcing the law and therefore they had to take steps to remedy this flaw. They lived with adult tolerance and possible approval of swift punishment outside the law.</p>
<p>The children attending Prep One and Two had markedly different experiences. One of the female participants in the discussions in Prep One had recently moved out of a community which, she said, was too violent. She was visibly upset as she spoke of the death of a cousin in a shooting incident. Incidents within their communities were rare:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is only one time I heard of a killing.</p>
<p>Sometimes I hear gunshots . . .</p>
<p>One night I heard something like gunshots and I got up and looked out of my window. Then I saw police shooting at a man.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Community problems were relatively mundane. Articles left in the garden were stolen; garbage collection poor; their neighbours’ loud music, marauding dogs were causes for concern.</p>

<title>Aggression and school type</title>
<p>A series of independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted to examine whether there were significant differences in levels of aggression (overall, physical, verbal, anger and hostility) between primary school children who were exposed to violence and preparatory school children. The results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the aggression types. On average primary school children reported higher levels of aggression (<italic>M</italic> = 85.41, SD = 14.90) than preparatory school children (<italic>M</italic> = 83.91, SD = 20.87). However this difference was not significant (<italic>t</italic>(89.02) = .47, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As stated earlier, studies have generally concluded that exposure to violence leads to increased aggression among children. Some have argued that this exposure is one of the strongest predictors of aggression among children and have pointed to the alarmingly high rates of violence in high-crime, inner-city and urban neighbourhoods, offering them as examples of intense breeding grounds for aggressive behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568211422612">Bell and Jenkins, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0907568211422612">Marans and Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0907568211422612">Osofsky et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0907568211422612">Richters and Martinez, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus group interviews confirmed the notion that children from the inner-city and poor rural communities attending the primary schools were exposed to higher levels of community violence when compared to their preparatory school counterparts. Despite this, the present study found no significant relationship between this exposure and levels of aggression among the sample. One possible explanation for this may be that there are certain contexts in which the concept of exposure needs to be modified.</p>
<p>Much of the literature on exposure to violence focuses on children who have observed violence (witnessing) and those who have had direct experience of violence (victimization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568211422612">Bell and Jenkins, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568211422612">Guerra et al., 2003</xref>). The assumption of most studies is that those who actually reside in communities with high levels of interpersonal conflict are exposed. However, this small island has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world when crime statistics are standardized for population size. The average homicide rate for the KMA in the 3-year period 2000–2 was 41 and for most of the 1990s it hovered around 40 per 100,000. In 2009 the number reached 1680, a record high for a country of 2.7 million persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568211422612">JCF, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Chicago, with a population of comparable size, recorded 453 homicides in the same year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568211422612"><italic>Carib Daily</italic>, 2010</xref>). In suburban areas, middle- and upper-income communities from which most preparatory school children are drawn more often than not share geographical space with poor, often violent ‘uptown low-income’ areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568211422612">Bailey, 2005</xref>). Some of these suburban low-income communities have similar socioeconomic characteristics to inner-city communities and can have higher rates of violent crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568211422612">Bailey, 2010</xref>). Moreover, some are embedded in middle- and high-income areas, creating what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0907568211422612">Knight and Davies (1978)</xref> refer to as ‘impure cells’. Rich and poor ‘live cheek-by-jowl’. Fearful middle-class households try to lessen fear and provide a sense of protection by high walls, and the creation of enclaves in the form of small gated communities, fortified not only by walls but by a host of self-protection (including guns) and target hardening measures. This attempt to manage risk has been referred to as the architecture of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211422612">Agboola, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0907568211422612">Young (1999)</xref> observed, the language of exclusion misunderstands the nature of the city. The barriers are regularly breached. Many who live in the low-income communities serve those who live behind the gates. The barriers are blurred in other ways. Children attending preparatory schools may not be able to avoid passing through violent communities on their way to and from their homes. A student of Prep Two offered that killing was a big problem not in his community but,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . a little bit outside, Miss.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A named main road along which they had to drive has ‘a lot of violence and they have shooting’.</p>
<p>Some of the students described seeing both victims and perpetrators of violence in public places – a woman who had been shot at the entrance to a shopping mall, a man with bloody hands wielding a knife in a mall. They witnessed stop and search activities of the police.</p>
<p>Middle-class families retreat through fear to defensible spaces which do not free them from fear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0907568211422612">Minton (2009)</xref> opines that such communities produce an authoritarian environment that increases fear and dilutes trust. They send messages to children that the outside world is unsafe and this heightens fear and paranoia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568211422612">Ellin, 1997</xref>). Research is needed to measure the effect of living in these fortified enclaves on young children.</p>
<p>Moreover, consideration must also be given to the nature of urban violence in the island. Reports of violence are daily occurrences. In the period 29 August through 4 September 2010, one television station (CVM) in the island carried an average of two violent incidents – stabbing and shooting – per night. The reports are usually accompanied by interviews of eyewitnesses, grieving relatives and neighbours, and police visits to the scenes of the crimes. There is no agreement in the literature on the effects of violence in the media on children but some report an association with aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568211422612">Bushman and Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568211422612">Huesmann et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also the events such as those which occurred in Tivoli Gardens, which engulf the entire island. In a yet unexplained offshoot of the Tivoli Garden invasion, a residence in an up-market community was surrounded and invaded by the security forces, and a householder repeatedly shot in the presence of his family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568211422612"><italic>Jamaica Observer</italic>, 2010a</xref>: 1). This shook the urban middle class for they realized that despite the walls and the gates, they were vulnerable. The Tivoli affair dominated the news media and was the major topic of conversation for weeks following, leaving no one unaffected. Those children who lived outside Tivoli Gardens may not have been witnesses to the violence but the graphic horrors of the clash and the subsequent invasion of Tivoli Gardens entered some of their homes through the social media.</p>
<p>The reaction of some Jamaicans to the slaying in Tivoli was captured in the comments accompanying the YouTube coverage of the events:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Kill them all. Kill them all.</p>
<p>The rest of Jamaica just want to go about their lawful business. Tivoli could break from the rest of Jamaica and sink in the sea like Port Royal.</p>
<p>Why should I cry for them? We need to sweep the whole place . . .</p>
<p>Continue your duties security forces. I give authority to drop 2 more bombs in Tivoli Gardens . . .</p>
<p>We need a full year of this kind of operation in Jamaica so we can let the country grow.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many saw the conflict in terms of them and us. These are not the voices of people who live in crime-ravaged communities. They have not necessarily witnessed or have been victims of violence. Nevertheless, they have been desensitized by the level of crime in the country.</p>
<p>Researchers and human rights groups have been urging the state to introduce measures to mediate the effects of community violence on vulnerable children in Jamaica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568211422612">Amnesty International, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0907568211422612">Samms-Vaughan et al., 2005</xref>). The focus is on children who witness or are victims of violence and there is no doubt that these are the most vulnerable. They face multiple risk factors in multiple risk domains. However, in a small country such as Jamaica where the level of violence is so high and where its brutal manifestations are so widespread, vulnerability may extend beyond this group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0907568211422612">Margolin and Gordis (2004)</xref> acknowledge this when they caution that even those who do not witness may hear repeated accounts of incidents and may form their own mental imagery of the event.</p>
<p>Exposure to community violence can occur in a variety of ways. Some children may be eye witnesses to violence; some may be victims of violence and these may be in most immediate need of intervention. Some children hear disturbing accounts of violence; are exposed to daily discussions of violence and adult support for violence. Some may have their daily routine disturbed by the effects of violence. Others live behind walls in fear of violence. The nature and consequences of a particular form of exposure may differ. Victimization and direct exposure may be more common among children living in poor inner-city communities, but the effects of rapidly increasing levels of violence are felt throughout the capital city. As such, while middle-and upper-income children may not experience the level of community violence endured by their poorer counterparts, violence and the threat of violence are nevertheless a part of their everyday lives.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0907568211422612">Margolin and Gordis (2000)</xref> caution that there is wide variability in children’s reaction to violence and that there are variables that mediate and moderate reactions to violence. There is a danger, they wrote, of ‘pathologizing’ those who live with violence. In a synthesis of more than a decade of research on resilience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568211422612">Bernard (2004)</xref> concluded that children who face multiple risk factors can develop into competent, caring adults. Resilience, she argued, is not a personality trait that one may or may not have. It is ‘an innate capacity bolstered by environmental protective factors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568211422612">Bernard, 2004</xref>: 9). In Masten’s view, resilience arises from normal human capabilities, relationships and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0907568211422612">Masten, 2001</xref>). It requires ‘ordinary magic’ – effective parents, close relationships, human brain functions and positive beliefs about self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0907568211422612">Masten, 2001</xref>). All young people have the capacity to lead healthy, successful lives.</p>
<p>Indeed, several extremely successful Jamaican artistes and athletes grew up in these violent inner-city communities and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568211422612">Humara (1999)</xref> suggests, such activities may provide a structured environment which is protective, as well as avenues for escape from an aversive environment. But many children do not have the emotional resources, the self-efficacy and the support systems that might inspire resilience. Children in the inner-city more often than not live with lone parents who are themselves traumatized by the violence and the struggle to survive. These are the multiple risk factors that increase their vulnerability. But it must be recognized that when the level of crime in a small society is so high, all children may be exposed to stresses. Scores for aggression are higher among primary school children but not significantly so. It may be that professional interventions, targeted to particular types of communities, interventions directed to the creation of conditions that reduce stress and support the biological drive for normal human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0907568211422612">Masten, 2001</xref>) are needed in all schools to prevent negative outcomes.</p>
