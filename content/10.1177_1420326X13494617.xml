<p>Fast population growth and rapid development of our communities have exerted a huge impact on our natural environment. The design, fabrication, construction and operation of buildings in which we live and work are responsible for significant consumption of our natural resources. Taking the United States as an example, buildings account for 39% of total energy use, 68% of total electricity consumption, 30% of landfill waste, 38% of carbon dioxide emissions and 12% of total water consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X13494617">1</xref>] and China is catching up. In order to alleviate the problem, smart green buildings development could well be considered as one of the viable choices. As its name suggests, smart green buildings combine “smart” and “green” concepts. Green buildings are about resources efficiency, lifecycle effects and building performance while keeping the lowest impact to the environment. Smart buildings, in which the core component is an integrated building technology system, are about construction and operational efficiencies, enhanced management and occupant functions. Therefore, the environment, economy and society can benefit from smart green buildings by enhancing and protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, improving air and water quality, reducing waste streams, conserving and restoring natural resources. Besides, smart green buildings can reduce operating costs, improve occupant productivity, enhance asset value and profits and optimize life-cycle economic performance. They can also enhance occupant health and comfort, improve indoor air quality, minimize strain on local utility infrastructure and improve overall quality of life. From another viewpoint, the minimum function of traditional buildings is to provide a shelter. Strength, durability, cost on selecting building materials, planning and construction are focused by civil engineering while aesthetics, comfort and attention to fulfilling psychological needs of the occupant are stressed by architecture. However, smart green buildings seek to conserve and utilize natural resources, emphasize eco-friendly construction and minimize carbon footprint on a global scale. The trend of the development is that smart green buildings should manage to cater more for the needs of humans, with increasing magnitude of personalization. People will be in control of the environment and be able to tune it to their needs.</p>
<p>A lot of research activities are being carried out to make our buildings smarter and greener. Absorption, adsorption and various advanced thermodynamic cycles could be considered as renewed interest in thermally activated cooling and heating systems. Micro-channel systems could help improve heat and mass transfer, leading to reduction of fluid inventories, material utilization and environmental impact. Integrating micro-channel systems into smart green buildings could make those buildings more energy efficient. Apart from that, integrating novel heat transfer fluids (e.g. nanofluid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X13494617">2</xref>] as well as improved heat and mass transfer devices into heating and cooling systems can also further reduce the energy consumption and ecological footprint of some building systems. A tri-generation process is another option to increase the efficiency in thermal and electric generation. Recently, the tri-generation system has been used for power generation and also for air-conditioning systems. Comparing with the co-generation system, tri-generation refers to district energy which can achieve a higher efficiency with a smaller environmental impact. With a similar size of generation plant, the installation of a tri-generation system can provide about 50% higher efficiency than that of co-generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X13494617">3</xref>]. Also, combining the co-generation plant with an absorption chiller or adsorption chiller is often described as a tri-generation plant in which the absorption and adsorption chiller can be powered by solar energy or waste heat. The advantage is that we convert this free energy into useful energy in the form of chilled energy. As a result, it can reduce electricity consumption by a huge amount, making the smart green building greener.</p>
<p>Ventilation is crucial in maintaining good indoor air quality. The more fresh air from non-polluted ambient source is brought into the indoor environment, the better the indoor air quality. However, a lot of energy is consumed by conditioning fresh air, particularly in Asian cities, like Hong Kong, where humidity is very high in certain months of the year. It has been noticed that at least 30% of the annual heating and cooling cost is spent on handling fresh air in a typical building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X13494617">4</xref>]. Over-ventilation may lead to a significant waste of energy. Therefore, an operationally cost-effective ventilation control system is very important in buildings. Ventilation control strategies such as sensible temperature-based air-side economizer, enthalpy-based air-side economizer, demand control ventilation and personalized ventilation have been demonstrated in many buildings all over the world. A demand-controlled ventilation system attempts to achieve acceptable indoor air quality at reduced energy cost by controlling an HVAC system’s outdoor airflow rate based on measured parameters. Many ventilation requirements and recommendations are in the form of outdoor airflow rates per person and floor area. Ventilation systems are therefore designed to provide a minimum level of outdoor air based on the designed occupancy level multiplied by the per-person together with the per-area ventilation requirements. Demand control ventilation offers the possibility of reducing the energy penalty of over ventilation during periods of low occupancy while still ensuring adequate levels of outdoor air ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X13494617">5</xref>]. Personalized ventilation systems have also drawn a lot of attention. A personalized ventilation system supplies fresh air directly to the occupants. It could be integrated with a low power consumption smart sensor to consider individual comfort need such that it could reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission. All in all, integrating the demand control ventilation with the personalized ventilation is considered a perfect match. It not only can save energy, but also can enhance health and comfort, making the smart green building greener and smarter.</p>
<p>With the rigid growth in semiconductor technology, it is believed that using LED as a lighting device will be the new trend in the coming years for applications in smart green buildings because the luminous per watt of LED has increased from 0.1 to around 20. Besides, recent research shows that the luminous per watt of LED will be increased to about 130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X13494617">6</xref>]. Therefore, traditional lighting systems may soon be replaced by high power LED lighting systems. There is no doubt that, with such exponentially fast growth in LED technology, using LED as a lighting device is no longer a myth for future smart green buildings.</p>
<p>Since last century, many scientists have been searching for new and renewable energy sources. Development of an energy storage device is another choice which is as important as developing new sources of energy since it not only enhances the performance and reliability of the energy systems, but also reduces the mismatch between supply and demand. Therefore, it plays a critical role in conserving energy right now. Phase change materials (PCMs) have been considered for thermal storage in buildings since before 1980 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X13494617">7</xref>]. They utilize a bio-based PCM to absorb and release heat such that they can melt and solidify at room temperature. With the rapid development of PCM, they are now usually impregnated with some commonly used construction materials, such as concrete, gypsum board, plaster and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X13494617">8</xref>]. As a result, PCMs can save energy and provide greater comfort for building occupants. Last but not least, integrating wind turbines, photovoltaic panels and other energy assets into existing and new buildings becomes another hot trend because these technologies enable buildings to be an energy conserver and producer, while they co-generate with the local power grid. Every roof on every building can be an energy generator. They can definitely help create clean and green energy for the buildings.</p>
<p>Smart green building development opens up a brand new direction for a number of emerging research topics in Indoor Built Environment. The effort leads to enhanced performance and functionality in buildings. Energy, buildings and the environment are interlinked in a symbiotic relationship. The concept of smart green buildings can help optimize this interaction and create a new perspective for the indoor built environment taking into consideration the limited budget of energy and materials in the world. It will be envisaged that more and more papers will move into this direction in the near future.</p>
