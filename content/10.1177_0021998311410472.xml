<p>The inter-ply characteristics of polymeric prepreg composites influence their interlaminar fracture toughness and the overall performance. This article embarks on engineering the inter-ply interfaces of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. A novel and practical technique for dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto woven CFRP prepreg is presented. The interlaminar fracture toughness of these CFRP lay-ups was evaluated experimentally and compared with the regular (without any CNTs) specimen. Double cantilever beam and end notch flexure tests were conducted for interlaminar fracture studies. It was observed that the addition of MWCNTs in between the CFRP prepreg plies helps in strengthening the interface. There existed an optimum percentage in which these nanofillers should be added. The presence of nanotubes increased fiber bridging within the ply interfaces, which in turn controlled the inter-ply crack propagation. The findings and the mechanisms are discussed using the test data, SEM pictures, schematics, and scans of the fractured surfaces.</p>

<p>The use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites has increased due to their high strength and stiffness properties combined with lightness. CFRP is one of the best options as a structural material in aerospace, automotive, and marine industries. Especially, most of aircraft components are formed as laminated composites made from partially cured or pre-impregnated fiber reinforcement sheets, commonly called prepregs.</p>
<p>CFRP laminated composites are usually produced by draping, stacking, and curing multiple sheets of prepregs together. They, therefore, hold on to each other offering excellent in-plane properties. But this process does not offer reinforcement in the thickness direction, encouraging delamination or crack-like damages between the ply interfaces, which are mostly the matrix-rich areas. The most possible causes for inter-ply defects and damages may be the poor ply adhesion, intra-ply cracks, regions of high void content, and overloads. The inter-ply characteristics of laminated composites have direct influence on the interlaminar fracture toughness and interlaminar shear stress distribution in the material.</p>
<p>A significant amount of experimental and analytical research has been so far devoted to improving the fracture toughness of laminated composite structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410472">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410472">5</xref></sup> It is known that the stacking sequence of plies and the ply orientations control interlaminar fracture toughness of laminated composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410472">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410472">7</xref></sup> It was also shown that the fracture toughness could be improved by using a toughened resin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410472">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410472">9</xref></sup> or interlayer/interleaf materials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410472">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410472">16</xref></sup> or by inserting through-the-thickness fiber yarns (or tows) using stitching, z-pinning or weaving techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410472">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311410472">19</xref></sup> Micro and nanofillers are being increasingly tried out for improving the properties of the binding polymers for composites.

<p>Many researchers so far have embarked on using CNT-filled polymer matrix either for producing <italic>in situ</italic> resin-fiber wet lay-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998311410472">34</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311410472">36</xref></sup> or for manufacturing partially cured unidirectional tapes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311410472">37</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311410472">39</xref></sup> However, the major industries use prepregs where fibers are already impregnated with a neat resin. The prepregs that are to be kept refrigerated until use require a slightly different handling and the molding processes. It is more challenging to engineer a prepreg surface with nanoreinforcement in the form of uniformly distributed CNTs because prepregs have precise resin content, tacky surfaces providing little opportunity to manipulate CNT distribution and dispersion.</p>
<p>A novel technique for dispersion of CNTs over woven CFRP prepreg is presented in this article. The interlaminar toughness of these CFRP laminates were evaluated using the double cantilever beam (DCB) test for the opening mode fracture and the endnotch flexure (ENF) test for the in-plane shear mode fracture on CFRP laminates with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at the laminate mid-plane. Results in the form of load vs. crack extension data, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the delaminated surfaces, and the fracture toughness values are presented. A critical percentage of CNTs giving optimum performance is identified. Possible mechanisms associated with the understanding of the interface-strengthening phenomena are explained.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311410472"><title>Theoretical background</title>
<p>The resistance to interlaminar crack propagation commonly known as delamination is termed as interlaminar fracture toughness, and measured as strain energy released per unit area of the delamination growth. Experimental studies can be conducted on coupons with a pre-initiated crack, testing them under a selected mode while monitoring the position of the crack front with an optical instrument. A complete description of the methods for obtaining modes I and II critical fracture toughness values (<italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>IIC</sub>, respectively) using DCB and ENF test data is available in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998311410472">40</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021998311410472">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>DCB test is used for determining <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> at crack initiation, calculated at the deviation of the load–displacement data from the linearity. For propagation value of <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub>, more than five points corresponding to crack lengths between 65 and 95 mm were averaged. The experimental compliance calibration technique known as the Berry's method was used to calculate <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> values using Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311410472">1</xref>):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021998311410472"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410472-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>P</italic> is the load (kN), <italic>δ</italic> the displacement of the notch tip (mm), <italic>a</italic> the crack length (mm), and <italic>B</italic> the specimen width (mm). This method assumes that the compliance <italic>C</italic>, is proportional to <italic>a<sup>n</sup></italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is the slope of a plot log (<italic>δ<sub>i</sub>/P<sub>i</sub></italic>) vs<italic>.</italic> log <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>, drawn using the visually observed values at the delamination onset and the propagation.</p>
<p>ENF tests are used to determine the delamination or interlaminar fracture toughness in mode II. The mode II interlaminar fracture toughness was evaluated using Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311410472">2</xref>) based on experimental compliance calibration method as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0021998311410472"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410472-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>

which is the slope of the curve <italic>C = f</italic>(<italic>a</italic><sup>3</sup>)<italic>,</italic> and <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> is the value of compliance at the origin. It is difficult to obtain a stable crack growth during a three<italic>-</italic>point bend ENF test, and therefore, multiple specimens with different initial crack lengths are required to accomplish the compliance vs. crack length curve.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311410472" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The woven CFRP prepreg used for making the ENF and DCB specimens had a plain weave of T700 carbon fiber tows, each consisting of 12,000 filaments of 8 micron diameter. The areal weight of the prepreg fabric was 195 g/m<sup>2</sup> and its nominal resin content without MWCNTs 33 wt%. The nominal ply thickness was 0.28 mm. The epoxy resin used in this prepreg was L-930HT with bisphenol A/epichlorohydrin as a main constituent. The prepreg with the trade name L-930HT-4819 T was supplied by J.D. LINCOLN, INC., CA 92627. The MWCNTs used in this study had a purity of &gt; 95% and were procured from Syst Integration Pte Ltd, Singapore. The average diameter of the nanotubes was ∼50 nm and their length ranged between 5 and 15 µm. A Teflon-coated peel cloth of 0.2 mm thickness, supplied by Airtech International, Inc., Huntington Beach, CA 92647, was used as the transfer film for the MWCNTs. Ethanol, procured from Riverbank Chemicals Pte Ltd, Singapore, was used to solvate the CNTs. Stainless steel piano hinges 50 mm × 20 mm in size, purchased locally, were bonded onto the specimen surface to affect load transfer in mode I.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311410472"><title>Method for CNT dispersion on prepreg</title>
<p>The MWCNTs were mixed first with ethanol in 1:350 proportion by weight. The solution was sonicated for about an hour using a water bath sonicator to enhance the dispersion. After sonication, the solution was sprayed on a flatly laid peel cloth in a manner by which homogeneous distribution of the solution and the solute was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410472">Figure 1(a)</xref>). A chemical fume-hood was used to take away the excess ethanol fumes safely as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410472">Figure 1(b)</xref>. After volatilizing the solvent, a thin layer of MWCNTs formed over the sprayed peel cloth surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410472">Figure 1(c)</xref>). Meanwhile, the CFRP prepreg was removed from the deep freezer and allowed to defrost sufficiently at room temperature. The bare prepreg surfaces generally exhibit mild tackiness at room temperature due to the partially cured matrix. A piece of prepreg was then placed over the peel cloth such that one of the tacky surfaces of the prepreg was in full contact with the peel cloth with the CNTs. A light roll was then applied over the prepreg. Due to the rolling pressure from the top and the stickiness of the prepreg surface, most of the CNTs transferred from the peel cloth to the prepreg surface, as schematically seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410472">Figure 1(d)</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311410472" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Method of CNT dispersion and transfer onto CFRP prepregs.

<p>On the side, to explore an alternative way, a trial was conducted by directly spraying the sonicated ethanol-CNT mix on to the prepregs. However, as anticipated, ethanol caused some degradation of the resin matrix. This procedure, therefore, was not pursued further.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311410472"><title>Manufacturing test specimens</title>
<p>Once the prepreg surface was coated with the MWCNTs, composite laminate specimens were fabricated using the CFRP prepreg following the basic steps of lay-up formation, curing and finally, the finishing. First, the woven CFRP prepreg with and without MWCNTs were cut to the desire sizes using shearing scissors. Six layers of CFRP prepreg were stacked forming a symmetric and balanced lay-up of [0/90] orientation to build a laminate. Light rolling was applied at every stage as the laminate was being built to avoid trapping of air and formation of unwarranted undulations on the prepreg surfaces, and to compact the lay-up effectively. A layer of CNT-engineered CFRP prepreg was then added at the top of the lay-up with the CNTs facing upward. This 7-layer laminate formed half of the specimen. Such two halves were then brought together in such a way that the sides containing CNTs faced each other forming a layer of MWCNTs at the mid-plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410472">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Note that a thin film of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was laid at the mid-plane of the laminate on one side of the specimen to form an initial crack according to the standard test method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021998311410472">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998311410472">47</xref></sup> for modes I and II samples. Thus, the layer of MWCNTs along with the crack starter was built in between the 7th and 8th plies of the 14 ply-stack. These laminated specimens were then clamped between two flat aluminum plates applying a molding pressure of approximately 0.62 MPa. The mold assembly was then transferred to a vacuum oven for de-bulking (removal of trapped air and further compaction) over 10 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the specimens were cured in another oven at the required curing temperature of 120°C under the applied clamp pressure. Due to the high temperature and pressure application during the curing, MWCNTs at the interface were expected to flow slowly into the adjacent fiber layers forming a unified interface with CNT-laden fibers with certain interlocking at micro and nanoscales as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410472">Figure 2(b)</xref>. A SEM picture of the prepreg taken after adding CNTs but before incorporating that prepreg layer into the laminate is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410472">Figure 2(c)</xref>. The cross-section of a fully cured laminate showing the CNT-engineered inter-ply interface was also scanned using SEM. The picture is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410472">Figure 2(d)</xref>. It can be clearly seen from the picture that CNTs have found their way between the fiber tows from the adjoining plies. This corroborates the situation sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410472">Figure 2(b)</xref>.

<p>The same procedure was followed for preparing all the samples. Different specimens were prepared with 0.0, 1.32 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, 2.25 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, and 3.62 × 10<sup>−6</sup>g/mm<sup>2</sup> MWCNTs per unit area of the laminate interface. These specimens were designated as specimen-A (without CNT-engineered interfaces), specimen-B (with 1.32 g/m<sup>2</sup> CNTs at the mid-surface after curing), specimen-C (with 2.25 g/m<sup>2</sup> CNTs at the mid-surface after curing), and specimen-D (with 3.62 g/m<sup>2</sup> CNTs at the mid-surface after curing).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311410472"><title>Interlaminar fracture studies</title>
<p>The DCB and ENF tests were employed according to ASTM D 5528 and JIS K7086, respectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021998311410472">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998311410472">47</xref></sup> for understanding modes I and II interlaminar fracture behaviors allowing quantitative comparison between the composites with and without CNT-engineered interfaces. The geometric details and specifications of both types of specimens are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410472">Figure 3</xref>. The width <italic>B</italic>, and the thickness, 2 <italic>h</italic>, of specimens were in the range of 24.96–25.07 and 2.98–3.12 mm, respectively.

<p>As stated earlier, the initial crack at the mid-plane of the laminated specimens was introduced by pre-laying a PTFE film. It may be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410472">Figure 4</xref> that one of the longer side edges of the specimens was painted white with typewriter correction fluid to aid in the visual detection of the crack propagation. Further, those sides were marked with a suitable scale to facilitate crack measurement. Wherever essential, a paper scale was also glued onto the side surface of specimen.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311410472" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Specimen under interlaminar fracture tests. (a) DCB specimen under mode I test and (b) ENF specimen under mode II test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410472-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A total of five samples were tested of each type of laminated composite specimen. The tests were conducted using the universal testing machines, Zwick-8306 and Instron-5569. In the DCB tests, the crack opening loads were applied to the specimens via the piano hinges attached to the main specimen faces. The tests were carried out at a constant crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min recommended in the standard. In the ENF tests, specimen was loaded in a standard three-point bending fixture at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min.</p>
<p>For better observation, a digital camera system was deployed for tracking the interlaminar crack growth. Subsequent crack positions were noted with the help of the paper scale as the interlaminar crack propagated along the length of the specimen. The load vs. crosshead displacement curves were recorded during each test. The beam deflections were noted using the crosshead displacement. After the test, the specimens were cut along the direction transverse to the loading direction and the fracture surface was imaged using a field emission scanning electron microscope, SEM JEOL 5600LV.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410472">Figure 5(a)</xref> shows the crack propagation resistance curves (crack growth vs. interlaminar fracture toughness) for the DCB test samples, whereas the load–deflection curves recorded for the test samples during the ENF tests are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410472">Figure 5(b)</xref>. All these curves exhibit rising trends with intermittent drops in the load carrying. These sharp drops are indicative of the unstable crack growth or sudden propagation of the delamination. It may be noted that specimen-A was taken as the base line performer against which the other three types of specimens with CNT-engineered interfaces were assessed. Among the trends observed for various DCB test samples, specimen-B exhibited the best performance with plenty of crack growth arrests, whereas in specimen-C the improvement was not that prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410472">Figure 5(a)</xref>).

<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410472">Figure 5(b)</xref>, load vs. displacement curves for the specimen-B rose rapidly until the displacement reached up to about 5.6 mm, beyond which its load carrying capacity dropped with further but sudden small-scale crack growths. Specimen-C and specimen-D, which had a higher percentage of MWCNTs in the mid-plane, showed a similar load–deflection behavior as the specimen-A with further drop in the applied load. During the ENF test, the behavior of all type of the specimen was almost the same.</p>
<p>Specimen-B proved to be the best, indicating improved load-carrying capacity with approximately 26% rise in mode I and 38% in mode II above the base-line. The same behavior reflected in the calculated values of the interlaminar fracture toughness for both types of tests. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410472">Figure 6</xref>, specimen-B provided the highest values of <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>IIC.</sub> The specimen-D showed the least <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> values. Thus, the fracture toughness was optimum at 1.32 g/m<sup>2</sup> MWCNTs at the mid-plane. The toughness values subsequently dropped as the percentage of MWCNTs at the mid-plane increased.

<p>The specimen-B led to improved mode I fracture toughness (+40% in the initiation value of <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> and 32% in value of <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> at crack propagation) and mode II fracture toughness (+140%) as well as better crack arresting properties. In order to understand the reasons behind these, the microstructure of various specimens was studied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410472">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows the fracture surface of mode I test sample without nanotubes. The appearance of a few tows in the weave at the fracture surface can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410472">Figure 7(b)</xref>. It shows some fiber pull-out and adhesion failure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410472">Figure 7(c) and (d)</xref> clearly shows that the added CNTs not only mixed well with resin and formed good interface but also flew in to the fibers and surrounded them. This confirms the accomplishment of the original objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410472">Figure 2(b)</xref>).

<p>Some of the fibers are also seen lifted out of their position along with the surrounding layer of CNT-matrix coating in the mode I test. This is the indication of the fact that the CNTs bonded well with the matrix and also formed through-thickness reinforcement after dispersing within at least the first few fiber stacks of the adjacent plies.</p>
<p>The failure mechanism for specimen-A may be explained using <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410472">Figure 8</xref>. The hairy appearance of the mid-plane of specimen-A seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410472">Figure 8(a)</xref> proves that some of the fibers were pulled out of their original position in mode I, which is a common phenomenon in places where fibers in the tows are not held down by the weave. These fibers lifted up due to their adhesion with fibers from the opposite ply. However, the resistance to the inter-layer crack propagation comes only from the matrix holding the fibers together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410472">Figure 8(b)</xref>), which leads only to moderate values of <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>IIC</sub>.

<p>With the CNT-engineered surfaces, the fiber-matrix characteristics at the interface get altered. For specimen-B, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410472">Figure 9(a)</xref>, significant fiber bridging occurred. A number of fibers from adjacent surfaces are seen to have joined together forming bridges. It is believed that these bridges developed due to the inter-locking CNTs embedded into the surrounding matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410472">Figure 9(b)</xref>). The fiber bridging sustained much longer than the usual matrix–matrix adhesion bonding providing better fracture resistance. As a result, significant improvements in <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>IIC</sub> were seen.

<p>It was clear that the amount of MWCNTs present in the ply interface controlled the fracture behavior. Specimens-C and D, which had higher percentage of CNTs, exhibited a locally resin-rich surface with higher areal density of MWCNTs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410472">Figure 10(a) and (b)</xref> shows how the CNT-laden resin (matrix) remained largely in between the adjoining plies. The conditions became worst in the case of specimen-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410472">Figure 10(c) and (d)</xref>). Since the CNTs agglomerated within the interface rather than penetrate through the fiber layers as in specimen-B, the interface did not provide much resistance to the crack growth. On the contrary, it offered a thick enough path for the cracks to propagate easily. This was assumingly the main reason for the drop in <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>IIC</sub> for specimens-C and -D where percentage of CNT was higher than optimum. Nevertheless, specimen-D showed some improvement in mode II (31%) above the base line value, possibly due to the improved shear resistance of the matrix because of the nanoreinforcement. However, the <italic>G</italic><sub>IC</sub> at crack initiation values were down by 20% due to the cohesive failure through the CNT-rich interface, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410472">Figure 10(c)</xref>.

<p>In summary, it may be concluded that MWCNTs, if well dispersed in an optimum proportion, do improve the interlaminar fracture characteristics and the toughness values for CFRP prepreg laminates, which may prove an attractive solution for the prepreg users.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311410472" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The developed technique of using an impervious film for spraying the ethanol-CNT mix and then transferring the ethanol-free layer of CNTs to the prepreg provided the necessary dispersion and worked well in facilitating further percolation of CNTs into a few top layers of fibers within the tows. In our studies, the fracture toughness values were maximum for specimen-B where CNT distribution was 1.32 g/m<sup>2</sup>. With such optimum percentage of CNTs per unit area of the prepreg, sufficient interlocking among the CNTs leading to fiber bridging could be achieved. The mechanisms that either offer or hamper the improvements in interlaminar fracture behavior and toughness values in modes I and II could be explained logically and supported by the micro-level observations and analysis. The studies show that a small percentage of MWCNTs are only needed to achieve improved resistance to delamination in laminated prepreg composites.</p></sec>
