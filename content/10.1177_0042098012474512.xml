<abstract>
<p>The English government’s 10-year flagship Decent Homes programme ended in 2010. The purpose of this article is to examine the asset management strategies that a sample of London housing associations took to meet the Decent Homes Standard. Drawing on the concept of institutional logics, the article outlines the social housing sector’s conflicting regulatory context, whereby organisations were statutorily obliged to improve housing standards, without being able to raise rents as a way to fund improvements. Depending on whether the housing association adopts a market-orientated or traditional, task-orientated approach to asset management, the associations sampled have either disposed of non-decent stock to generate cash flows or else retained the stock, undertaking minimal repairs to meet the government’s target deadline. The article concludes that not only has this national performance target triggered different organisational responses, it has also led to longer-term unintended consequences for existing and future tenants.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Across Europe, governments statutorily regulate the management of social housing stock to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474512">Gruis, 2008</xref>). Regulation and inspection regimes have traditionally had a pervasive influence on the English social housing sector, with this regulatory culture affecting not only social landlords’ day-to-day practices but also their long-term asset management strategies (AMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins, 2006</xref>). Upward accountability to central government became a key element of the previous Labour government’s 2000 <italic>Housing Green Paper, quality and choice: a decent home for all</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474512">DETR, 2000</xref>). A 10-year flagship policy programme was established to bring existing social housing stock up to a mandatory Decent Homes Standard (DHS) by the end of 2010.</p>
<p>Four key components make up England’s DHS, relating to properties that provide: a reasonable state of repair, a degree of thermal comfort, modern facilities and services, and minimum levels of fitness for habitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012474512">DCLG 2006</xref>). When the programme commenced in April 2001, 39 per cent of social housing stock was deemed ‘non-decent’, consisting of approximately 1.2 million properties managed by local authorities and 400 000 managed by housing associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474512">NAO, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The attention of policy-makers has primarily focused upon the delivery of the DHS programme to local authority stock, under different forms of social housing management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012474512">House of Commons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474512">NAO, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012474512">CIH, 2010</xref>). The estimated cost of the DHS programme to local authority stock has been around £22 billion, with the coalition government committing a further £2 billion in capital funding to complete the programme post-2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012474512">House of Commons, 2010</xref>). As the National Housing Federation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474512">NHF, 2010</xref>, p. 1) notes, “DHS is viewed often only in the context of (local authority) council housing”. Less attention, however, has been paid to the ways in which traditional housing associations (HAs) brought their stock up to DHS without the use of government assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012474512">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the magnitude of the problem in the HA sector is not great, the non-decent stock in the sector reduced from 18.6 per cent in 2004 to 2.4 per cent by the end of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474512">TSA, 2011</xref>). Moreover, HAs implemented the standard at their own expense, at no direct cost to the taxpayer. Rather than allocating funding to HAs to enable major repairs, the government instead expected these social landlords to be financially independent and “give a high priority to asset management” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474512">NAO, 2010</xref>, p. 6), with necessary housing improvements funded through strategic investment decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012474512">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although policy guidance exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012474512">Cave, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012474512">NHF, 2011</xref>), there has been little academic research focusing specifically on the impact of government regulation on individual social landlords’ asset management strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012474512">Larkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474512">Gruis and Nieboer, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474512">Gruis (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474512">Czischke <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> contend, there is limited theorisation and empirical analysis of the way individual housing organisations make strategic asset management decisions, particularly within their different institutional contexts. Yet strategically, managing existing social housing assets and reviewing underperforming stock are of growing importance, particularly as the rate of housing replacement is slow.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to examine the AMS that HAs have taken in order to meet the DHS by the target deadline. Using the concept of institutional logics developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins (2006)</xref> for the HA sector, the article highlights the sector’s conflicting regulatory context, whereby the previous Labour government, in its 2000 <italic>Housing Green Paper</italic>, statutorily obliged HAs to improve housing standards, yet at the same time set a ceiling on individual properties’ rent increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474512">DETR, 2000</xref>). The way in which HAs have responded to the government’s demands led academics, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> to speculate on whether<disp-quote>
<p>the challenges stemming from the 2000 <italic>Housing Green Paper</italic> to restrict rents whilst raising quality might stimulate English housing associations to develop a more dynamic approach [to asset management] and sell more of their stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, p. 1244).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Drawing on a sample of London-based HAs, the article examines the AMS that HAs have adopted to fund repair works so as to achieve the government’s DHS. The pressures that London HAs face are particularly acute, with organisations having to balance competing demands from new and existing tenants placed upon their ageing stock, which has high maintenance costs but also comparatively high capital values. Difficult strategic choices have to be made, with the London HAs taking different courses of action to meet the DHS by the target deadline.</p>
<p>The research provides empirical evidence that supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>.’s (2004)</xref> hypothesis that some HAs have devised AMS which dispose of property assets as a way of raising finances for housing improvements. Other organisations were found to refrain from such activities. Drawing on the typology initially developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref>, this article suggests that the HAs’ strategic choices to dispose of or retain stock depend on whether the organisation adopts a market-orientated or a more traditional, task-orientated approach to asset management. The article concludes that, not only has this national performance target triggered different organisational responses, it has also led to longer-term, unintended consequences for existing and future tenants.</p>

<title>2. Institutional Logics and Housing Associations’ Asset Management Strategies</title>
<p>Asset management strategies support decisions about the holding, selling and repositioning of an organisation’s assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Most of the literature on strategic asset management is drawn from the private sector. Yet, in private-sector asset management, the emphasis is on optimising financial performance within the marketplace. Within the business literature, strategic choices, for instance, are conceived in a profit-making context and there is a long tradition of analysing organisations’ AMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474512">Mintzberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012474512">Aaker, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of institutional logics used in organisational studies has been developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins (2006)</xref> as a means to understand HAs’ strategic decisions—in particular, how they respond to multiple government expectations. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012474512">Friedland and Alford’s (1991)</xref> introduction of the concept, the notion of institutional logics has taken root in analyses of organisational responses to institutional forces, with an increasing amount of attention given to the impact of government regulations on organisational behaviour. Governments represent a key institution that establishes guiding beliefs or principles, with its formal rules directing organisations’ actions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012474512">Friedland and Alford (1991)</xref> note, institutional logics guide organisations’ practice, with co-existing rules having an impact on organisational strategies. Yet, although organisations are faced with similar exogenous institutional pressures, they negotiate these logics in different ways.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474512">2011</xref>), in particular, focuses on the underlying tension within the English HA sector between logics of scale and efficiency on the one hand and local accountability on the other, and the impact that these competing logics have on organisational behaviour. His research demonstrates the ways in which HAs balance the regulatory expectations to expand and diversify their core business, yet at the same time they need to remain locally accountable to residents and the community they serve. How an organisation manages the tension between competing logics is evident in the business strategy which they choose to adopt.</p>
<p>In the context of DHS policy compliance, the English HA sector faced a different set of institutional logics. To ensure universal access to decent and affordable housing, the previous Labour government established a common definition of housing decency, so that all social landlords across the country worked towards a standardised goal. The government also sought to end the ‘arbitrary’ differences in rent setting between local authorities and HAs through rent harmonisation (see section 3). The embodying goals and values of this state institution, in effect, acted as organisational principles which guided social landlords’ practices. An investment obligation was placed on all landlords to improve their stock as a matter of urgent priority. Moreover, the government also focused attention on the importance of asset management to release funds to resource housing improvements.</p>
<p>Yet whilst the pressure to re-examine AMS was motivated externally, through institutional regulations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012474512">Bacon <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> suggest that HAs’ strategic choices to meet government expectations are generated internally, driven by the HA’s business ethos as well as the current Chief Executive’s and board’s corporate agenda. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012474512">Manzi’s (2007)</xref> study of London HAs equally highlights the importance of understanding an organisation’s culture in explaining how decisions between alternative courses of action are made. HAs with specific sets of values and beliefs respond to the external institutional pressures in different ways, and in turn take different approaches to AMS. The choice of AMS to fund housing improvements essentially aligns to the prevailing attitudes and shared commitments of the organisation.</p>
<p>Whilst acknowledging the uniqueness of each organisation’s AMS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> suggest that variations in strategic decision-making are based on whether a HA essentially follows a market-orientated approach or alternatively a more traditional, task-orientated approach to asset management.</p>
<p>For a market-orientated organisation, a key AMS would be selling underperforming liability stock, as this would allow the property’s latent value to be realised and recycled into stock improvements, including meeting the DHS. Moreover, property acquisitions would be another important AMS as a way to diversify the organisation’s real estate portfolio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012474512">Figure 1</xref> highlights an AMS of a market-orientated HA that incorporates both property disposal and acquisition strategies. As organisations divest from uneconomical assets with high maintenance spend and replace them with properties that generate greater positive returns, this can also lead to changes in the organisation’s tenant profile, particularly if emerging housing needs become accommodated in the acquired properties. Social obligations towards tenants traditionally housed in the disposed properties, however, may be foregone.</p>

<p>In comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> typify the strategic objectives of a more traditional, “task-orientated” (p. 1233) association as one that would not proactively seek commercial opportunities, including stock disposal, as a means of generating cash flows. Instead, the organisation restricts itself to performing traditional, social housing tasks, including managing its existing assets and focusing on current tenants’ needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474512">Czischke <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> suggest, however, that HAs who focus primarily on traditional management practices, ‘the way we have always done it’, are less innovative and entrepreneurial compared with market-orientated HAs, as these social housing managers do not search outside their domain for market opportunities. By solely maintaining their narrow product domain, they also may not be in a position to address wider and future housing needs.</p>
<p>Although classifications cannot be rigidly applied in practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>.’s (2004)</xref> distinction between market and traditional task-orientation proved useful in facilitating their comparative research on Dutch and English HAs’ AMS. Whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474512">Gruis and Nieboer (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474512">Gruis (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474512">Czischke <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> have further refined the organisational archetypes, these academics continue to refer to this broad distinction between market orientation and a more traditional, task-orientated approach to asset management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012474512">3</xref></sup> This distinction is therefore used in this article as a way to understand the different approaches in asset management that the sample of London HAs have taken to meet DHS.</p>

<sec id="section3-0042098012474512">
<title>3. The Institutional Context of Traditional English HAs</title>
<p>Comparing English and Dutch HAs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474512">Gruis and Nieboer (2007)</xref> found that Dutch organisations are not only more uniform in type, fewer in number and larger in size, but they also have a greater degree of administrative and financial independence. They contend that the tendency towards Dutch HAs becoming more market-orientated relates to a reduction in government control and financial support. The sale of new and existing dwellings, for instance, subsequently became a policy option for these organisations to generate cash flows for stock improvements and replacements.</p>
<p>Within England, a greater variety and number of HAs exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474512">TSA, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098012474512">4</xref></sup> Before the introduction of the coalition government’s Localism Act (2011) and Welfare Reforms in 2012, a relatively strong regulatory framework was in place. HAs operated under the Tenant Service Authority’s central regulations and the Audit Commission monitored property improvements through a scheduled inspection system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012474512">National Archives, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012474512">HCA, 2012</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474512">Gruis and Nieboer (2007)</xref> note, the tendency towards English HAs becoming market-orientated may be in response to government pressures, with binding regulations to raise stock quality giving this pressure a visible form.</p>
<p>Whilst the English government’s 2000 <italic>Housing Green Paper</italic> statutorily obliged HAs to raise housing standards to DHS, at the same time, it also placed a ceiling on individual property annual rent increases, which is calculated as the Retail Price Index plus 0.5 per cent (plus £2 per week). This rent harmonisation system, introduced on 1 April 2002, expected all social landlords in the same area to charge similar rents for similar properties by 2011/12, allowing for a 5 per cent tolerance of the guideline target rent set by the government. The coalition government has continued this rent-setting process on existing tenanted properties, with a revised target convergence date of 2015/16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012474512">House of Commons, 2012</xref>). For HAs that have historically set rents that were significantly below market rents, there is no compensation for charging rents below the target rent. Instead, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012474512">TSA (2010b)</xref> set rent caps in high-cost areas, such as London, to protect existing tenants from sharp rental increases.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012474512">Tang (2011)</xref> argues, the constraints of the rent-setting formula reduce the capacity of HAs to undertake improvements of existing stock, yet repair costs have risen as HAs ensure that their stock meets the DHS. Moreover, this is a particular issue for those HAs operating in London who spend on average the largest amount per unit on management, repair and maintenance of any region in England. Yet their average rental income per unit only just covers operational costs, placing considerable financial pressures on London HAs’ balance sheets. The tension in institutional logics between the requirements to raise housing standards, whilst rental income is restricted, may trigger HAs to develop more market-orientated AMS as a way to generate cash flows and realise government expectations.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the HA sector’s business models have moved away from one purely based on rental streams to ones based on both rental income and sales proceeds, particularly from low-cost homeownership (LCHO), with HAs relying on sales proceeds of these newly built properties to generate surplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012474512">Tang, 2011</xref>). The value of sales receipts, however, is dependent on market conditions, with London having comparatively high capital valued properties compared with the rest of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474512">TSA, 2011</xref>). The uncertain economic environment, manifested through unsold LCHO schemes and a drop in property sales, however, presents an on-going challenge for HAs dependent on sales revenues of newly built properties to meet interest payments and operating costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474512">TSA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012474512">Tang, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>HAs also have the power to dispose of existing assets into the open market as an alternative way of generating cash flows. The resolution to sell a unit in vacant possession, however, has to have prior approval by the HAs’ internal board of management as well as the external regulatory body—previously the TSA and, since April 2012, the Homes and Communities Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012474512">HCA, 2012</xref>, p. 27).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098012474512">Figure 2</xref> indicates the amount of HA properties sold to the private sector and sitting tenants as well as demolished in England between 2004 and 2010. Whilst the figures represent a relatively small proportion of the total HA stock, since 2008 the number of property disposals has increased relative to selling existing properties to sitting tenants exercising their ‘right to acquire’. The strategic decision taken by individual HAs to sell existing assets into the open market is, however, masked by the aggregation of data. Understanding whether meeting DHS has triggered HAs to become more market-orientated and dispose of stock, necessitates tracing individual organisational decision-making.</p>

<title>4. Research Methods</title>
<p>Given the varied circumstances of individual HAs, a number of academics have adopted a case study approach to examine HAs’ organisational behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012474512">Bacon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012474512">Manzi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012474512">Kearns and Lawson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474512">Gruis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012474512">Gibb and Trebeck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012474512">Halina, 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> note, the sector cannot be classified rigidly and it is impossible to draw generalisations from such a wide disparity of organisations. Even though the limitations of case study research are widely acknowledged in the research community, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012474512">Gibb and Trebeck (2009</xref>, p. 378) argue that this form of research provides “important indications and lessons which should spark wider debate and discussions”, particularly in relation to consequences of HAs’ actions, as this paper will demonstrate.</p>
<p>In this paper’s analysis, the interrelationship between institutional logics, the organisation’s business orientation and the AMS of a selection of HAs is explored. As the research aims to compare HAs’ strategic decisions, this necessitates holding the external environment relatively constant. Whilst meeting the DHS provides a standardised, regulatory goal to be achieved across the English HA sector, the housing market conditions within which individual HAs operate vary across the country. For this reason, the sample of HAs chosen was restricted to those operating in similar market conditions and facing similar housing pressures. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474512">Gruis (2008)</xref> notes, it is important to exclude as much as possible the differences caused through factors related to the context of the HA.</p>
<p>London-based HAs were chosen as the propensity for HAs to be market-orientated, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> suggest, should be greater in a relatively buoyant market. Yet although London HAs may have market opportunities to sell properties, whether they in fact adopted this course of action was investigated, particularly in the light of the competing pressures they face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012474512">Manzi 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The research entailed in-depth case studies of three London HAs. The HAs were selected based on the examination of the Audit Commission’s inspections reports, HAs’ annual reports and suggestions from experts in the HA sector. In particular, scrutinising TSA’s <italic>Regulatory and statistical returns</italic> (RSR) submitted by different London HAs allowed a preliminary investigation into which HAs faced similar housing pressures and owned similar property portfolios by size, type, age, location and percentage of non-decent stock (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012474512">Table 1</xref>). Scrutinising these returns also allowed a selection of HAs which were selling property onto the open market over time and those that had not, in order to make sure the sample contained a variation in business practices. Analysis of the individual HA’s RSR also checks for reliability of evidence given in the interviews with Chief Executives of the selected HAs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012474512">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>5. London HAs’ Response to the DHS</title>
<p>Seeking the most cost-effective way to bring stock up to DHS as part of wider stock reinvestment policy was a key consideration among the three London HAs, particularly as costs to achieve this had to be fully absorbed. The HAs agreed with the NHF that<disp-quote>
<p>the decent homes programme has resulted in additional spending and redirection of money that might have been spent … if decent homes had not come along (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474512">NHF, 2010</xref>, p. 4).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474512">TSA (2011</xref>, p. 22) estimates that the average cost associated with achieving DHS includes “operating costs plus £8,200 per unit made decent, a cost typically incurred over several years”. Repair costs, however, vary by property type and age. For the London HAs sampled, owning an ageing housing stock further compounded the problem of financing the repair works to bring non-decent stock up to DHS. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012474512">Tang (2011)</xref> notes, average rental income per unit only just covers operational costs, with viability issues being particularly marked for older stock.</p>
<p>The HAs had experienced little difficulty in raising the quality of their post-1988 purpose-built housing estates up to DHS, given that the stock was relatively new. Yet this property type represented a relatively small proportion of the HAs’ assets. Problems arose, however, in bringing the standard of 19th-century, Victorian and early-20th-century, Edwardian, properties up to DHS, yet they made up the bulk of the three HAs’ assets. These assets consisted of both purpose-built estates and street properties previously bought with refurbishment grants under the 1974 Housing Act. Many of these properties fail the DHS with regard to low thermal comfort. They also have poor energy efficiency, sound proof insulation and layout.</p>
<p>Despite Victorian and Edwardian properties often not reaching the government’s decency standard, owner-occupiers’ and buy-to-let demand for such properties has remained relatively high, particularly within the boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, where the HAs’ stock was primarily located. Pursuing market opportunities to dispose of these properties into the open market, however, varied among the sampled HAs and was dependent on their business orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012474512">Bacon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012474512">Manzi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0042098012474512">
<title>5.1 Case Study A: Market-orientated HA Disposes of Assets to Fund Stock Improvements and Replacements</title>
<p>Case study A was established in 1966 as part of a merger with another London HA. The organisation owns over 14 000 properties predominantly in estates, purpose-built in 1915 and located in west London, as well as converted Victorian and Edwardian terraced street properties bought in the 1970s, 70 per cent of which are flats. The rest of the stock was built post-1988, including housing for sale as a way to widen the HA’s housing product.</p>
<p>This HA provides an example of a proactive, market-orientated organisation whose comprehensive AMS had been devised in 1997, prior to the government’s 2000 <italic>Housing Green Paper</italic>. The strategy had been later updated in 2004, before the Audit Commission’s scheduled inspection visit, and later in 2008. The AMS was linked to the organisation’s business plan, which included a 10-year cyclical and planned maintenance programme. As the Audit Commission’s 2005 inspection report noted, the HA was well organised and, compared with other similar-sized London associations, was ahead in meeting the DHS by the target deadline. At 2005, 14 per cent of its stock was non-decent; by 2010, the percentage was 2.66 per cent. Case study A, in effect, represents a ‘front-runner’ HA; as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474512">Gruis (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the HA’s AMS had become increasingly market-orientated in each update, with its business plan being predicated on continuously generating internal cash flows from rental income, as well as selling newly built LCHO properties and existing properties to sitting tenants, to service long-term debt and pay for repairs. Between 2007 and 2010, the HA had sold 515 new LCHO properties, with the number of sales peaking at 145 units in 2008 (the height of the property market) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012474512">Table 1</xref>). The organisation, however, did not want to be over-reliant on new-build property sales to make a surplus, as the business plan would be vulnerable to financial exposure, given market uncertainty.</p>
<p>It is also difficult for HAs in general to depend on existing tenants exercising their right-to-acquire their property as a means of raising capital receipts. Right-to-acquire sale proceeds are likely to become increasingly unpredictable for London HAs in particular, as these organisations accept 100 per cent local authority tenant-nominations. Compared with existing tenants, new tenants entering the HA sector are relatively younger, often single-person households, with a high proportion reliant on income support. These types of households are therefore not in a position to purchase their social housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474512">TSA, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Devising a strategy to dispose of the older, non-decent stock had been initiated by the business-minded Chief Executive, as an alternative means of generating additional finances. Moreover, the current board and senior management supported this strategic decision to dispose of underperforming stock that could not viably be brought up to DHS. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012474512">Table 2</xref> shows, between 2007 and 2010, 138 property sales to the private sector were made by the HA, in addition to 33 sales to sitting tenants. Asset disposal not only allowed savings to be made through reduced operating costs, selling street properties that were dispersed across neighbourhoods reduced the organisation’s overall management costs. The capital receipts could also be recycled into stock improvements and acquisition of replacement stock.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012474512">Table 1</xref> highlights, four-bed units make up a small proportion of each of the London HAs’ stock relative to one-bed properties. Case study A therefore made a strategic decision to sell non-decent, one-bed units once they became void and to use the receipts to acquire three- and four-bed units. This proactive, market-orientated approach to AMS enabled the organisation to diversify and reshape its property portfolio. It also allowed the organisation to provide re-let opportunities for existing tenants, especially families, to move into larger social housing stock. In doing so, the organisation’s tenant profile also changed.</p>
<p>Case study A had effectively followed a market-orientated AMS, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012474512">Figure 1</xref>, which incorporates both disposal and acquisition strategies. The Chief Executive, however, was aware that trade-offs had to be made when taking strategic choices in asset management<disp-quote>
<p>One-bed properties make up around 40 per cent of the stock and are invariably let to single people in dire housing need. Turnover is greatest for this stock. Once they become void we replace them with three- to four-bed properties, as there is a lot of demand for larger accommodation, with families stuck in unsuitable accommodation and we need to rehouse overcrowded households. At the same time, these one-bed units are sold off to economically active owner-occupiers, creating a tenure mix in our neighbourhoods. Yet, where will the vulnerable homeless go?</p>

<sec id="section7-0042098012474512">
<title>Case Study B: Market-orientated HA Disposes of Assets out of Pressure to Meet the DHS</title>
<p>Case study B was founded in 1862 by a philanthropic banker and is one of the first HAs established in England. It owns over 15 000 units, with 90 per cent of its stock being in purpose-built Victorian and Edwardian estates. Twenty-five per cent of the stock was deemed non-decent in 2005. Whilst the percentage had been reduced to 10.33 per cent by the target deadline, this percentage was worse than the London and national average for HAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474512">NAO, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As the Audit Commission’s 2006 inspection report noted, this organisation had only put a comprehensive AMS into place to address DHS in 2006, once the inspection visit was scheduled. Moreover, the strategy was reliant on asset disposal to achieve the national performance target<disp-quote>
<p>Slow progress [in meeting DHS] has been reflected in a lack of resources for investment in major repairs … plans are now in place to achieve DHS by 2010, though this is dependent on stock disposal … Some key stakeholders are not satisfied with [case study B’s] approach to consultation on its disposal programme … It reduces its ability to meet housing needs (Audit Commission’s 2006 inspection report).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Case study B had taken the decision to sell its older properties, once in vacant possession, yet not out of strategic choice like case study A. The organisation had been forced to become market-orientated and seek commercial opportunities to raise finance, given the pressures they were under to comply with DHS. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012474512">Table 2</xref> shows, 528 units were sold to the private sector and 37 sales were made to sitting tenants between 2007 and 2010. Alongside this, 97 LCHO units had been sold in the same time-period. Altering its stock profile, however, was a secondary consideration for this organisation compared with the need to meet the short-term DHS performance target and the HA’s inability to increase rents on existing tenanted properties as a way to fund improvements.</p>
<p>The HA had historically charged low rents, which remain below London’s target rent. In 2010, for instance, average weekly rents were £98.58 compared with the London average target rent of £102.88 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012474512">Table 2</xref>). There is little opportunity for the organisation to ‘catch up’ on the rents set below London’s target rent, as the HA has to abide by the government’s capping on annual increase in rents on individual properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012474512">House of Commons, 2012</xref>). Disposing of assets therefore provided an alternative way to raise cash flows for repair works. The Chief Executive justified this decision, stating that<disp-quote>
<p>This is a mandatory DHS national standard, yet the lack of government funding for HAs means there was no choice but to sell property in order to fund the time scales of the decent homes programme—a real pressure on us. We had to make up for the shortfall in rental income as we have kept rents historically low and cannot increase them as we would like. Yet selling stock leads to a loss of much needed affordable housing in our capital city.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0042098012474512">
<title>Case Study C: Traditional, Task-orientated HA Retains Assets</title>
<p>Case study C was established in 1963 as an exempt charity under the UK Industrial and Provident Society Act, which is a legal entry for voluntary organisations in England. The HA owns over 10 000 units which are heavily concentrated in west and north-west London. Sixty per cent of its stock was purchased in the 1970s and refurbished, particularly large Victorian mansions which were converted into flats. A large proportion of this stock is located within Conservation Areas, which adds to the redevelopment costs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012474512">National Archives, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The organisation devised its first comprehensive AMS to address DHS in 2005, prior to the Audit Commission’s scheduled inspection in 2006. Since then, it had reduced its non-decent stock from 14.6 per cent to 3.27 per cent by the target deadline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012474512">Table 1</xref>). Unlike the other two associations, the HA had not, however, devised an AMS that disposed of assets as a way of generating financial income to fund investments.</p>
<p>The strategic decision to retain assets was primarily driven by the business ethos of the HA’s Chief Executive and current board members. They considered such a strategy as detracting from the traditional, core function of letting affordable housing, particularly to low-income households who could not otherwise afford to live within central and inner London. Local accountability to their existing tenants, in effect, played a key part in this HA’s decision-making. As the Chief Executive noted<disp-quote>
<p>Unlike other (named) London HAs, a board decision was taken to not sell off stock, even if in poor repair. When I became Chief Executive, we decided our priority was to hang on to high-value stock in central London, particularly in Kensington and Chelsea. Our existing tenants want this too. These older Victorian properties blend into the area as no stigma is attached to them, although they are becoming increasingly expensive to maintain and make energy efficient.</p>

<p>As with case studies A and B, this HA’s business plan relied on its rental income stream to fund its improvement programme. Although the HA’s average rents were considerably below market rents, they were higher than London’s average target rents (having average weekly rents of £107.83 in 2010; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012474512">Table 2</xref>). The HA had the internal financial capacity to fund DHS and not be reliant on asset disposal. However, in the future, average rents will have to be lowered towards the London target rent as the rent harmonisation deadline approaches, which will impact on the HA’s future rental income stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012474512">HCA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the organisation had also taken the strategic decision to carry out minimal repairs required to meet DHS, as a way to make financial savings. Undertaking the least amount of repairs possible in order to comply with DHS concurs with the findings in government reports on DHS. These reports suggest that this decision, however, leads to tenant dissatisfaction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474512">NAO, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012474512">HCA, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474512">NHF, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Audit Commission inspection in 2006 noted that case study C had a history of backlog in repairs. This could be attributed to retaining ageing stock with high maintenance spend, which creates a financial burden on the organisation. Moreover, the Commission also considered resident involvement in reinvestment programmes to be inadequate, with residents not being involved in the prioritising of the programme, of which DHS was a part.</p>
<p>Case study C was also not developing LCHO units for sale, nor was it acquiring properties as a way of expanding and diversifying its asset base (Table 2). The HA considered buying properties to be equally onerous as disposing of them, given the regulatory constraints facing the HA sector. It was therefore deterred from taking this course of action. As the Chief Executive explained<disp-quote>
<p>We have used the government’s ‘purchase and repair’ grant to buy lower-end street properties, yet there was a tight stipulation that HAs have to buy properties and do the repairs before receiving the grant. Also, we cannot find three-bed properties that we can afford even with a grant. We have therefore given up trying to buy properties in the open market even though we have overcrowding issues and growing waiting-lists. It’s a lot of hassle, although we are aware we should do more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In effect, case study C was not only scaling back the extent of property repairs, but also not searching outside its domain for new opportunities, which will therefore affect the HA’s ability to respond to future tenant expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474512">Czischke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>6. Unintended Consequences of HAs’ Strategic Decisions</title>
<p>Focusing on the way in which HAs react to multiple institutional logics, and variations in organisations’ behaviour and practices, has become a growing theme within social housing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012474512">Halina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474512">Czischke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). At the same time, the consequences of HAs’ strategic decisions need also to be considered. The pressure to meet the government’s DHS time scale has triggered a real tension for HAs in London, who experience high demand pressures, high maintenance costs and inability to increase rents on existing tenanted properties. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012474512">Table 4</xref> summarises the HAs’ AMS and the potential consequences of these strategies.</p>

<p>In order to meet the DHS by the target deadline, two of the social landlords sampled had become increasingly market-orientated. Whether as a proactive and strategic AMS to fund improvements and acquire replacement stock, or out of necessity and driven by cost considerations, disposing of assets can, however, lead to unintended policy consequences. The cumulative effect of London HAs adopting this strategy may have inadvertently contributed to house price inflation, particularly at the peak of the London housing market. It can also trigger gentrification with higher-income owner-occupiers purchasing previous social housing assets, particularly Victorian and Edwardian properties in prime locations, and displacing lower-income social housing tenants within London’s neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474512">Davidson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Seeking market opportunities to raise finance, including disposing of stock, may, in turn, endanger the fulfilment of social objectives. Implementing a property sales programme creates an equity issue, particularly if properties suitable for single-person, homeless households are sold and social obligations towards those in acute housing need are foregone. Moreover, with private rents and owner-occupation costs being much higher in London, social housing tenants cannot easily transfer to other sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012474512">Tang, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The traditional, task-orientated HA sampled had adopted a different approach to meeting DHS, yet in doing so, faces different challenges. This organisation has focused on maintaining its assets, by not seeking opportunities to sell them into the open market. Yet in the long term, the retention of properties with high maintenance spend may create a financial burden on this association. Compromises may also be made. Undertaking repair works to minimal standards will result in housing standards not meeting tenants’ rising expectations. Moreover, solely concentrating on the fulfilment of traditional management tasks, and not seeking market opportunities to raise finance, develop LCHO units or acquire replacement stock, may mean that wider and future tenant needs cannot be met.</p>

<title>7. Conclusions</title>
<p>Drawing on the concept of institutional logics offers a way to understand how organisations respond to government’s multiple accountabilities and expectations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins (2006)</xref> suggests, tensions within a regulatory framework are manifested in organisational decisions, with HAs forced to make strategic choices as they negotiate government’s prevailing values and rules. Whilst there has been extensive research on the changing role of HAs in the light of the competing institutional logics they face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474512">Mullins, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474512">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474512">Czischke <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), the impact of regulatory requirements, like DHS, on organisations’ asset management decisions has been largely neglected, often seen as a technical issue with no real significance.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper was therefore to address this gap by focusing on how the HA sector has responded to the challenge of meeting the previous Labour government’s DHS, despite regulatory constraints on rent-setting. Meeting this national performance target has not only impacted upon the business planning of HAs, it has also led to the development of AMS that would not necessarily have happened without the policy being put in place. This paper has examined, in particular, the strategic decisions taken by a sample of London HAs either to dispose of non-decent stock or to retain these assets. These organisations faced resource constraints and increasing demand pressures on their ageing, but comparatively high-valued, housing stock. Pressures on HAs are intense and difficult asset management choices have to be made.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012474512">Gruis <italic>et al</italic>.’s (2004)</xref> distinction between a market-orientated and a traditional, task-orientated approach to asset management provided a means of explaining the variations in AMS found among the London HAs. The strategic direction taken by an individual HA depends upon its business approach to asset management as well as its financial capacity to respond. Pursuing a particular strategic direction can, however, result in unintended consequences. The merits of selling assets need to be weighed against the benefit of retaining social housing, particularly in inner and central London for low-income households who need it. Conversely, holding onto ageing stock with high maintenance spend may create a long-term financial burden on the organisation concerned.</p>
<p>The policy landscape underpinning HA activity is in a state of flux under the coalition government, with unprecedented changes happening to the social and welfare systems in England. The TSA and the Audit Commission were abolished in April 2012, with the regulatory role transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency. There is now no longer a government statutory duty on HAs to meet DHS, nor is their progress formally audited through the Audit Commission. Yet despite this, the principle as well as processes have been set in motion with regard to HAs continually monitoring and maintaining their stock to a decent condition thereafter. The government is also committed to rent harmonisation on existing tenanted properties, with a ceiling on rental increases remaining in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012474512">HCA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The social housing sector, however, now faces a new set of institutional logics which will force HAs to make strategic choices with regard to their AMS, as they respond to the government’s new ideologies. On the one hand, the introduction of a new affordable rent model allows HAs to charge up to 80 per cent of market rent on new units and existing re-lets. This extra income will enable HAs to borrow additional finance from the capital markets which can be used to fund future stock improvements as well as new developments. On the other hand, the Welfare Reform Act 2012 has brought in a range of changes that impact on HA tenants’ capacity to pay their rents, which will, in turn, have ramifications for HAs’ finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012474512">Pawon and Wilcox, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The impact of these reforms is likely to be felt most acutely in London. Rents set by the affordable rent model could underpin substantial increases in London HAs’ borrowing capacity, whereas elsewhere in England the impact is much more modest as the differential in social and affordable rents is less marked. Yet, at the same time, London HAs will see their existing tenants’ housing benefits cut to keep their income within the government’s total welfare cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012474512">London Assembly, 2011</xref>). As with meeting the government’s DHS, these new conflicting institutional logics will trigger different organisational responses, leading to unforeseen and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Traditional, task-orientated HAs, whose accountability to their existing tenants is strong, are consciously capping affordable housing rents significantly below the government’s guidelines so that they remain at affordable levels, thus reducing the impact on their tenants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474512">Murphy, 2012</xref>). Yet, this will mean foregoing opportunities to generate extra income to support the HAs’ future AMS. In contrast, market-orientated HAs are more likely to accept the government’s affordable rent model and welfare reforms as well as their knock-on consequences, which may lead to substantial shifts in the HAs’ tenant profile over time.</p>
<p>Whilst additional income for market-orientated organisations will be generated to fund new development and future capital improvement works, it remains unclear what will happen to those households whom the English HA sector has traditionally assisted with housing, particularly in high-demand areas like London.</p>
