<abstract>
<p>Studies suggest that disclosure alters representations of emotional or traumatic events and that linguistic parameters may index such change. Most work has been conducted among younger adults; hence, this report examined whether changes in the proportions of pronoun, emotion, and cognitive characteristics across two narrations predicted changes in mental and physical health outcomes in a later life sample. Black and White men and women (<italic>N</italic> = 160) aged 50 to 70 years completed two 10-minute oral disclosures at baseline and 1-month follow-up, describing a sad event in conjunction with either a happy or a neutral event, and completed measures of depressive symptomatology, stress, and health. Despite some variation across outcomes, reductions in symptoms were generally predicted by lowered proportions of first personal singular pronouns and sadness words and increased proportions of insight and causal words; directional change scores were more useful than absolute change in predicting outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for tailoring disclosure-based interventions among older groups for which traditional written paradigms may be poorly suited, and directions for future research are given.</p>

<p>Occasionally to the great merriment of their adult children, friends, and relatives, older adults spend considerable time narrating events from their lives; often, variations on the same “story” are told time and again. Depending on content and the functions being accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0261927X12446736">Webster &amp; Haight, 1995</xref>), story-telling or reminiscence predicts life satisfaction and psychiatric distress in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12446736">Cappeliez, O’Rourke, &amp; Chaudhury, 2005</xref>); self-positive reminiscence predicts greater life satisfaction and lower depression and anxiety, whereas self-negative reminiscence predicts worse outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X12446736">O’Rourke, Cappeliez, &amp; Claxton, 2011</xref>). However, research in the self-disclosure and reminiscence traditions has yet to specifically examine the implications stemming from the <italic>repeated</italic> nature of these disclosures—the fact that stories are repeatedly retold—or evaluate the linguistic characteristics of the stories that change with the telling and/or predict outcome. In this article, we use the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to evaluate whether changes in theoretically derived classes of words predict changes in depressive symptomatology, stress, and physical health when a sample of adults aged 50 to 70 years narrated sadness-eliciting events twice, separated by a 4- week period.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261927X12446736">
<title>Self-Disclosure: Effects and Mechanisms</title>
<p>Although experimentally manipulated, written self-disclosure regarding upsetting or traumatic events is associated with superior outcomes including physical health, anxiety, psychological adjustment, stress, health behavior, employment, and immunological functioning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12446736">Frattaroli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Seagal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261927X12446736">Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261927X12446736">Smyth, 1998</xref>, for reviews), the reasons for such effects are unclear. Possible mechanisms include cognitive restructuring or meaning making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Francis, 1996</xref>), habituation/exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X12446736">Lepore, 1997</xref>), and self-regulation and social integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261927X12446736">Sloan &amp; Marx, 2004</xref>). The restructuring approach has the greatest empirical support, the idea being that creating coherent narratives regarding events helps integrate thoughts and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261927X12446736">Smyth, True, &amp; Souto, 2001</xref>) and enables people to shift experiences from a more to a less intrusive and fragmented form (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12446736">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Data show that persons randomized to disclosure conditions intended to improve narrative structure reported fewer activity restrictions than persons who created a descriptive list of their experience or disclosed on neutral topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261927X12446736">Smyth et al., 2001</xref>); studies providing guidance in how to write had marginally (overall effect) or significantly (for psychological outcomes) larger effect sizes in a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12446736">Frattaroli, 2006</xref>). Focusing on new insight is superior to concentrating on catharsis in reconciling secrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12446736">Kelly, Klusas, von Weiss, &amp; Kenny, 2001</xref>), although other work suggests improvements may be greater in expressive versus insight conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261927X12446736">Sloan, Marx, Epstein, &amp; Lexington, 2007</xref>); instructions emphasizing <italic>both</italic> expression and cognitive assimilation have been associated with greater awareness of the positive aspects of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0261927X12446736">Ullrich &amp; Lutgendorf, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0261927X12446736">
<title>Word Frequency Characteristics and Adaptive Outcomes</title>
<p>Drawing on thinkers such as Freud and Lacan, recent work has emphasized linguistic change in trauma process and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, Mayne, &amp; Francis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>); language is a key organizer of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12446736">Lacan, 1970</xref>) and may act as a marker for cognitive processes including assimilation and insight. In some views, words are more than a story; they are a window on the world of the narrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>). Empirically, this approach implies that the absolute levels of certain forms of linguistic content and/or narrative <italic>change</italic> should predict improved outcomes. Improvement may be characterized by a “linguistic fingerprint.” Thus far, three classes of word frequency phenomena appear important.</p>
<p>First, changes in emotional word frequency appear important. Retrospective analyses suggest that relatively high levels of positive emotion words, a moderate number of negative emotion words, and an increasing number of cognitive words predict better outcomes in self-disclosure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, Mehl, &amp; Niederhoffer, 2003</xref>). Second, data indicate markers of cognitive process are important. Increased use of insight (e.g., consider, know, understand) and causation (e.g., cause, effect) words predicts health improvement in students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Francis, 1996</xref>) and bereaved caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to recall that the same informational “content” can be conveyed in multiple forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; King, 1999</xref>) and a large proportion of speech is composed of words that do not communicate content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12446736">Chung &amp; Pennebaker, 2007</xref>). Empirically, greater use of first person pronouns predicts narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261927X12446736">Raskin &amp; Shaw, 1988</xref>), neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; King, 1999</xref>), trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261927X12446736">Weintraub, 1989</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261927X12446736">Rude, Gortner, &amp; Pennebaker, 2004</xref>), and grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12446736">Boals &amp; Klein, 2005</xref>). On this basis, we expected increasing first person pronouns to predict poorer outcomes particularly for the two outcomes (physical symptomatology and depression) that have established links to self-oriented processes. Greater personal pronoun use may indicate less confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12446736">Berry, Pennebaker, Mueller, &amp; Hiller, 1997</xref>), an increased self-focus, or the inability to “detach” from a story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>). Attempts to create psychological “distance” from narrations are evident in pronoun use when deceptions occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X12446736">Newman, Pennebaker, Berry, &amp; Richards, 2003</xref>), although deflections may also manifest in group (e.g., we) versus self-related pronouns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12446736">Buller, Burgoon, Buslig, &amp; Roiger, 1996</xref>). Overall, changes in the use of personal pronouns may index the extent to which events are seen as part of the self, with greater use of first person singular pronouns generally predicting poorer outcomes, including anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261927X12446736">Weintraub, 1989</xref>) and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261927X12446736">Rude et al., 2004</xref>); multivariate predictions regarding distinctions among first person singular, second person, and third person pronouns were less immediately evident and we treat this as an exploratory question.</p>

<title>The Age Question: Variations in Self-Disclosure and Word Usage</title>
<p>Few studies have examined whether experimentally controlled disclosures have mental and physical benefits in older groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12446736">Magai, Consedine, Fiori, &amp; King, 2009</xref>), although there is a growing cross-sectional literature describe “painful” self-disclosures on topics such as health and bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12446736">Coupland, Coupland, &amp; Giles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12446736">Coupland, Coupland, Giles, Henwood, &amp; Wiemann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X12446736">Fowler &amp; Soliz, 2010</xref>). Where older samples are included, experimental studies have typically accessed samples with particular diagnoses, such as arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X12446736">Kelley, Lumley, &amp; Leisen, 1997</xref>) or breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261927X12446736">Stanton et al., 2002</xref>). Although improvements in adjustment and health sometimes occur with time, experimental condition notwithstanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12446736">Magai et al., 2009</xref>), disclosure in nonstudent groups predicts reduced absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12446736">Francis &amp; Pennebaker, 1992</xref>), fewer health care visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X12446736">Crow, 2000</xref>), and reductions in intrusive thinking, hopelessness, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261927X12446736">Segal, Bogaards, Becker, &amp; Chatman, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this small literature, a primary purpose of the current report was to evaluate whether the linguistic characteristics that predict improvement in younger groups would also be so when an older sample completed a structured self-disclosure. Older adults show greater off-topic verbosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X12446736">James, Burke, Austin, &amp; Hulme, 1998</xref>), narrate in ways that connect experiences with a sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12446736">Pasupathi &amp; Mansour, 2006</xref>), and manifest more integration themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12446736">Bauer &amp; McAdams, 2005</xref>). Such considerations suggest we might expect greater causal and insight word proportions to predict reduced symptomatology. Consistent with lifespan emotions work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Magai, 2006</xref>), disclosure narratives in older groups tend to contain more positive and fewer negative emotion words, fewer first person singular terms, and increased causation and insight words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>The Age Question: Self-Disclosures in Context</title>
<p>Unlike laboratory disclosures, those in everyday life occur where recounting of negative events is interspersed with positive events or more neutral recollections. We elected to contrast the effects of sadness-eliciting disclosures occurring in the context of happy versus neutral narrations for two reasons. First, older adults report more positive affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12446736">Consedine, Magai, &amp; King, 2004</xref>), are differentially sensitive to positive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Magai, 2006</xref>), and report more mixtures between positive and negative experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X12446736">Magai, Consedine, Krivoshekova, McPherson, &amp; Kudadjie-Gyamfi, 2006</xref>). Second, functionalist accounts of positive emotions imply there could be either costs or benefits to sadness narrations that occur in the context of a positive induction. Positive states broaden attention and thinking repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446736">Fredrickson, 2001</xref>); promote flexible, creative, and integrative processing; and reduce the odds of ignoring or distorting information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X12446736">Isen, 2008</xref>). Such flexibility may facilitate insight during subsequent sadness narrations or allow for more in-depth processing in the time following such a disclosure. Conversely, however, these same effects might interfere with the specific “processing” thought to underpin self-disclosure’s benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261927X12446736">Suedfeld &amp; Pennebaker, 1997</xref>). Sadness has been “designed” to facilitate adaptation to loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Moskowitz, 2007</xref>) and is manifest in a response that prevents ongoing investment in the “lost cause,” generates signals that increase social support, and produces “dwelling” on the loss, facilitating the rearrangement of goal commitments and the construction of plans for managing the loss (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Magai, 2006</xref>). Inducing happiness in close proximity to sadness might interfere with the benefits of sadness disclosures. Given the absence of prior work in this area, we treat this possibility as an exploratory question.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current report is intended to illuminate how changes in the linguistic characteristics of sadness narratives predicted changes in depressive symptoms, stress, and physical health symptomatology in a sample of older adults. In the study, 160 participants were asked to identify an experience in the past 2 years that made them very sad, relive the event, and narrate it for 10 minutes in the context of either a happy or a neutral narration in two laboratory sessions held 1 month apart. Based in the above literatures, we predicted the following:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited for a study of “Emotion and Personality” through newspaper advertisements, posted flyers, mailings to senior centers, and referrals. Participants were excluded if they reported a history of heart disease, stroke, or hypertension; a current course of medication for these diseases; or nonfluency in English. Participants in the parent study (<italic>N</italic> = 200) completed either a sad/happy narration, a happy/sad narration, a sad/neutral narration, or a neutral/sad narration. Given our focus on how <italic>changes</italic> in the narration of sadness-eliciting events might predict outcomes, we examined the 160 persons who completed narrations at both time points and whose laboratory sessions <italic>included a sadness narrative</italic>.</p>
<p>As is described more fully in reports stemming from the parent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12446736">Magai et al., 2009</xref>), 30 participants failed to complete the second visit. These individuals were removed from the data and, to enable statistical matching on gender and race, replaced with new participants who completed both laboratory sessions; a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated no baseline differences between participants dropping out versus completing the study. The final sample was composed of 160 adults ranging in age from 45 to 76 years (<italic>M</italic> = 53.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.56) and balanced for race (European American, African American) and gender; the mean level of education was 14.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.76; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12446736">Table 1</xref>).

<p>We assessed health at baseline and at follow-up with items from the Health Survey Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X12446736">Ferrano &amp; Wilmoth, 2000</xref>), supplemented by items from the Wahler Physical Symptom Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0261927X12446736">Wahler, 1968</xref>). The scale, which enabled participants to rate their symptoms in a comprehensive but rapid manner, consisted of 27 items including pain, nausea, poor appetite, headache, cough, tiredness, and the like. The scale ranged from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology. The internal consistency alphas in the present study were .89 at Time 1 and .90 at Time 2. A change score was computed by subtracting the baseline score from the score at follow-up; positive/higher scores represent an <italic>increase</italic> in symptomatology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261927X12446736">
<title>Depressive symptomatology</title>
<p>The depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Developed based on the SCL-90-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12446736">Derogatis, 1977</xref>), the Brief Symptom Inventory has been used in hundreds of investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X12446736">Derogatis &amp; Savitz, 1999</xref>). The depressive subscale is a 6-item, self-report inventory rated on a 5-point scale of distress (0-4) from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>extremely</italic>. It has robust reliability characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X12446736">Derogatis &amp; Melisaratos, 1983</xref>). The alpha coefficients for the depression subscale at baseline and 5-week follow-up were .88 and .87, respectively. Change scores were computed such that higher scores represent an <italic>increase</italic> in symptomatology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261927X12446736">
<title>Stress</title>
<p>We employed a 10-item measure of stress developed for a large cross-national study of mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12446736">Chatters, 1993</xref>); the scale has been used in several large studies of diverse adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12446736">Consedine et al., 2006</xref>). Using a 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 3 (<italic>very much</italic>) scale, individuals rate the level of stress they are experiencing in 10 domains (e.g., money, health, family). The alpha coefficients for the scale in the study were .73 at Time 1 and .78 at Time 2. A change score was computed by subtracting the baseline score from that at follow-up; positive/higher scores represent an <italic>increase</italic> in stress.</p>

<sec id="section13-0261927X12446736">
<title>Narrative content</title>
<p>To assess the impact of changes in the frequency of pronoun, affective, and cognitive word characteristics on changes in outcomes, texts were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), 2007 version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, Chung, Ireland, Gonzales, &amp; Booth, 2007</xref>). We adopted LIWC because of its prior use in studies of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0261927X12446736">Tsai, Simeonova, &amp; Watanabe, 2004</xref>), including work in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12446736">Löckenhoff, Costa, &amp; Lane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>); linguistic analyses may be particularly useful in older groups because they are less susceptible to biases associated with other formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12446736">Löckenhoff et al., 2008</xref>), and LIWC appears preferable to alternative automated text analytic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12446736">Bantum &amp; Owen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>LIWC uses a dictionary composed of almost 4,500 words and word stems. Each word or word stem defines one or more word categories or subdictionaries, and LIWC uses these to categorize each word. Initial content and construct validity was completed by the creators of LIWC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12446736">Francis &amp; Pennebaker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 2007</xref>). Depending on dimension, interrater reliability of category word elements ranged from 86% to 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, Francis, &amp; Booth, 2001</xref>), suggesting content validity. Construct validity was assessed by four judges rating 210 essays on several LIWC dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 1997</xref>), resulting in moderate to strong correlations for most categories (0.22-0.75). Other work suggests reasonable concurrent validity with human rater codings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12446736">Alpers et al., 2005</xref>), with some tendency toward overidentification in the broad “positive” and “negative” emotion categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12446736">Bantum &amp; Owen, 2009</xref>). A fuller description of the construction and properties of LIWC can be found in the most recent manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Baseline and follow-up sadness narratives were transcribed verbatim and then “cleaned” following LIWC protocol. Given our interest in examining whether increases, decreases or absolute changes in the linguistic characteristics previously shown to predict outcome would generalize to older adults, several classes of linguistic phenomena were extracted. First, we derived pronoun scores representing the proportion of first person singular (e.g., I, my, me), second (e.g., you, you’ll), or third person pronouns (e.g., she, they, them). Second, because older adults report more mixed emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Magai, 2006</xref>), we extracted a score for the target emotion (i.e., sadness) as well as scores for positive emotions (e.g., love, nice), anxiety (e.g., worried, fearful), and anger (e.g., hate, annoyed). Third, we extracted scores for words falling within LIWC’s “causal” (e.g., because, effect) and “insight” classes (e.g., think, know, understand). Directional change scores were derived by subtracting the baseline proportion of each category from the corresponding proportion at follow-up such that a positive score indicates an increase in the proportion of the category across the two narrations. Absolute change scores represent the absolutized change values and were used to test whether the <italic>direction</italic> of change (vs. change itself) were important in predicting changes in outcome.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section15-0261927X12446736">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>Participants were prescreened by telephone and mailed a package with a consent form and baseline measures. Participants were randomized to narration condition at the time of recruitment. During recruitment and consent, participants were told they would come to the laboratory on two occasions, 4 weeks apart, and narrate two events each time. They were not told what sorts of events they would recount until arriving. At the first visit, participants completed measures not germane to this report and then narrated the two events required by their condition. Skin conductance and heart rate measures were taken during narration but these data are the subject of another report as are the content of a diary assessing health in the intervening month. At the second laboratory visit, participants again completed the health and mood measures and then were asked to renarrate the same two events described in the first session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0261927X12446736">
<title>Narrative instructions</title>
<p>For emotional narrations, participants were asked to
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . . remember an experience in the past 2 years that made you very <italic>sad</italic> [or <italic>happy</italic>]. This should be an event that happened to you personally. Put yourself back into the situation as though you were just now experiencing it. Then prepare to imagine telling the experience to a best friend or relative. Remember that it is very important that your friend understand exactly how you feel about the incident and why you felt that way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants were informed that they could start their stories at any point but were asked not to switch stories; they were given a few moments to gather their thoughts and note the topic on a piece of paper; this sheet was later used to prompt recall of the same stories at follow-up. In line with prior studies, neutral instructions asked them to describe the activities of a typical week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X12446736">Lepore, Bruno, &amp; Smyth, 2002</xref>), and participants were provided with a list of seven prompts to ensure the 10-minute narrative period was filled; they were instructed to make use of the prompts if they ran out of things to say but not to base their story on them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261927X12446736">
<title>Analytic strategy</title>
<p>The analytic strategy had two steps. First, we used repeated-measures MANOVAs to characterize the sample and their narratives as a function of race, time, and narrative condition. Second, we examined the ability of both absolute (ignoring direction of change) and directional (increase/decrease) changes in word class counts to predict changes in outcomes using multiple regressions in which changes in word frequencies were regressed on changes in mental and physical health at follow-up while controlling for demographics and narrative condition.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12446736">Table 1</xref> provides a description of the sample broken down by race and narrative condition. A race by condition MANOVA on the demographics showed no condition effects, Wilks’s Λ = .178, <italic>ns</italic>, but an effect for race (Wilks’s Λ = 5.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Follow-up univariates showed that Whites reported greater education than Blacks.</p>
<sec id="section19-0261927X12446736">
<title>Linguistic Characteristics of the Sadness Narratives</title>
<p>Next, we examined the basic linguistic characteristics of the sadness narratives in a 2 (race) × 2 (condition) × 2 (time) repeated-measures MANOVA in which race and condition served as between-subject factors and time of narrative served as a within-subject factor, examining narrative word counts; the proportion of first personal singular, second person, and third person pronouns; the proportion of positive affect, anxious, angry, and sad words; and the proportion of LIWC-coded causal and insight words. There was a main effect of Time, Wilks’s Λ = 3.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .16, although this relation was moderated by interactions with Race, Wilks’s Λ = 2.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .13, and a three-way interaction with Condition, Wilks’s Λ = 2.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .13. There was also a main effect for Race, Wilks’s Λ = 3.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .19. Examination of the Race effect showed that Blacks had marginally more first person singular pronouns, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 3.61, <italic>p</italic> = .059, more second person pronouns, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 11.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, marginally more anger words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 3.81, <italic>p</italic> = .053, more sad words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 4.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and more causal words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 5.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0261927X12446736">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with prior studies, Time predicted an increase in the proportion of positive emotion words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 4.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, as well as increases in second person pronouns, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 6.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.

Examination of the Time × Race effect showed that use of first person singular words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 4.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, decreased over time among Blacks whereas use of second person pronouns, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 5.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and insight words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 3.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, increased; the three-way interaction between Time, Race, and Condition suggested that this increase in insight word usage only occurred when the sadness narrative was paired with a happiness narrative, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 4.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. This three-way interaction also indicated that although use of anxious words did not vary as a function of time or race, there was an effect in which anxiety word use declined among Blacks where sad narratives were paired with happiness narratives but declined among Whites in the opposite condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 5.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and that third person pronoun usage declined among Blacks where sad narratives were paired with happy narratives but declined among Whites in the opposite condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 156) = 4.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>Third, we examined changes in the mental and physical health outcomes.

<title>Predicting Mental and Physical Health Outcomes With Changes in Sadness Narratives</title>
<p>Finally, we tested whether changes in narrative pronoun, affective, and cognitive content predicted changes in the three mental and physical health outcomes. A series of linear regressions in which demographics (sex, income, race), a condition dummy code (using the sadness–happy pairing as the referent), and LIWC-derived narrative variables reflecting <italic>changes</italic> in the proportion of pronouns, four affect word classes (positive emotion, anxiety, anger, and sadness words), and two cognitive word classes (causal and insight word classes) were conducted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X12446736">Table 3</xref> displays the raw and standardized coefficients from these analyses. To test the possibility that <italic>any change</italic> in narrative content was beneficial we then ran a parallel model testing the absolutized versions of these change scores. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0261927X12446736">Table 4</xref> displays the raw and standardized coefficients from these analyses. For ease of interpretation, these analyses are hereafter referred to as directional versus absolute change models.</p>

<title>Directional Change Models</title>
<p>The directional change model predicting changes in depressive symptomatology was marginally significant, <italic>F</italic>(13, 146) = 1.66, <italic>p</italic> = .076, and explained 13% of the variance in depressive symptom change. Narrating sadness together with a happy (rather than neutral) narrative predicted greater depressive symptomatology and greater depressive symptoms were predicted by increases in sad word usage and, marginally, by decreases in the proportion of causal and insight category words used (see left panel, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X12446736">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The directional model predicting changes in stress was significant, <italic>F</italic>(13, 146) = 2.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and explained 15% of the variance in stress change scores. In contrast to the depressive symptom model, however, increased stress was predicted by being female as well as by increases in the proportion of first person singular pronouns and anger words used and, perhaps more surprisingly, by increases in the proportion of insight words across the two narrative episodes (see center panel, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X12446736">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the directional model predicting changes in physical health was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(13, 146) = 2.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and explained 20% of the variance in the health symptom change scores. Increased physical health symptomatology (i.e., subjectively poorer health) was predicted by making a sadness narration together with a happy (rather than neutral) narrative, by increases in the proportion of first person singular pronouns, increased third person pronouns, and by an increased proportion of sadness words (see right panel, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X12446736">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Absolute Change Models</title>
<p>In general, models conducted using absolutized change scores were less powerful or explanatory.

<p>However, the absolute change model predicting changes in stress was significant, <italic>F</italic>(13, 146) = 2.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and explained 16% of the variance in stress change scores. Increased stress was predicted by being female and by increases in the proportion of first person singular pronouns. Additionally, increased stress at follow-up was <italic>marginally</italic> predicted by a greater proportion of anxiety words, a greater proportion of sad words, and a greater proportion of insight words (see center panel, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0261927X12446736">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute change model predicting changes in physical health was nonsignificant, <italic>F</italic>(13, 146) = 1.64, <italic>p</italic> = .08, and only explained 13% of the variance in the health symptom change scores. An increase in physical health symptomatology (i.e., subjectively poorer health) was predicted by greater income and by making a sadness narration together with a happy (rather than neutral) narrative.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current report investigated how changes in the linguistic characteristics of sadness narratives predicted changes in depressive symptoms, stress, and physical health symptomatology in an infrequently studied group—older adults. We found the expected effects in which changes in depressive and physical health symptoms and, to a lesser extent, stress were predicted by reductions in first person personal singular pronoun and sadness word usage and increases in the proportion of insight and causal words; in general, results were considerably stronger with the directional change versus absolute change variables. Second, our analyses provided preliminary evidence of how disclosures may be affected by the emotional contexts in which they occur; participants whose sadness narration occurred in the context of a happiness narration showed evidence of greater improvements in depressive symptomatology and physical health than those doing so in the context of a neutral narration. Below, we discuss these results more fully, integrate our findings with prior studies, consider possible differences across outcomes, and offer some directions for future research</p>
<sec id="section25-0261927X12446736">
<title>The Linguistic Fingerprints of Improvement</title>
<p>Finding that directional changes in word class frequency when retelling the “same” sad story predicted outcome is consistent with the idea that health improvements are typified by a “linguistic fingerprint” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with work linking pronouns to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261927X12446736">Rude et al., 2004</xref>), reduced use of first person singular pronouns predicted reduced health symptomatology and less stress, and reductions in physical health symptoms were also predicted by fewer third person pronouns. Causality in the relations between distinct classes of pronoun use and outcome is, however, unclear as studies have yet to directly attempt manipulations of distinct classes of pronoun frequency in therapeutic narrations. However, given links between first person pronoun use and narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261927X12446736">Raskin &amp; Shaw, 1988</xref>) and an anxious disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261927X12446736">Weintraub, 1989</xref>), reductions in first person singular pronoun use may index alterations in the degree to which events are seen as caused by, or affecting, the self. It may be that the <italic>repeated</italic> disclosure of sad events facilitates the broadening of their cognitive representation, shifting the representational focus away from an exclusive concentration on the self—pronoun use was reduced over time—toward a more balanced appreciation of (a) the place of the event in the larger picture and (b) the event’s impact on others.</p>
<p>Some findings in the current report do, however, suggest that determining what intrapersonal or interpersonal processes specific classes of pronoun use are indexing during sadness narrations is a complex matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, 2011</xref>). In particular, it is worth recalling that an increase in the proportion of third person pronouns (e.g., he, she, they) was uniquely associated with an increase in the number of reported health symptoms; this effect was in addition to that associated with first person singular pronouns. Given the likely content of sadness narrations—prototypically concentrated around loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Moskowitz, 2007</xref>)—the link between increased proportions of third person pronouns and poorer outcomes may index a lack of self-agency or an increasing tendency to externalize explanations for narrated events.</p>
<p>Although preliminary, a few possible explanations appear viable. First, the link between external attribution patterns (i.e., other referencing) and increased negative emotionality may, prima facie, explain the negative health consequence associated with proportionally more third person pronouns. However, negative emotionality is implicitly controlled in our analyses, at least as indexed by angry, anxious, and sad word usage, meaning other explanation may be needed. A complementary alternative is that fluctuations in third person pronoun usage may index variations in other-focused defensive process (i.e., that people orient toward behavior of others as a means of not thinking about the self). Although self-orientation is implicitly controlled through use of first person singular pronouns, the effect of third person word usage may nonetheless effectively reflect an unconscious attempt to minimize even greater self-focus.</p>
<p>More broadly, the idea that a less self-focused cognitive form may be a desirable change in the linguistic representation of sad events is consistent with our finding marginal links between increases in the proportion of both insight and causal word use and reduced depressive symptomatology, although increases in insight-type words predicted <italic>increased</italic> stress. Although there was no effect of causal or insight words on physical health, the possible benefits of increasing causal and insight-type language is consistent with studies among students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker, 1993</xref>) and bereaved caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 1997</xref>). In the context of affect (i.e., depression), greater insight may facilitate (or reflect) event restructuring and the integration between thoughts and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261927X12446736">Smyth et al., 2001</xref>) and help reconcile fragmented event representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12446736">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>). Integration themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12446736">Bauer &amp; McAdams, 2005</xref>) and a greater tendency to link experiences to the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12446736">Pasupathi &amp; Mansour, 2006</xref>) are common in later life and may suggest that cognitive linguistic markers are particularly salient for this group. Given that recurrent processing of sadness and nostalgia have previously been shown to predict poorer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12446736">Cappeliez &amp; O’Rourke, 2006</xref>), it may be that structured disclosures are beneficial while unprompted and naturally occurring disclosures index aspects of event-related distress or the inability to resolve conflicting events and thus predict poorer outcome.</p>
<p>Finally, we found the expected effect in which reductions in sadness words predicted reduced depressive and physical health symptomatology, although we did not find any effects associated with positive affect (PA), and also found that stress reductions were predicted by fewer anger words. Reductions in narrative negativity have been linked to improved outcome (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 1997</xref>, Study 1); thus, it is unsurprising that reductions in sadness content predicts superior outcomes, at least for outcomes that have strong affective constituents or are otherwise influenced by emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Moskowitz, 2007</xref>). What is perhaps less expected (and more provocative) is that reductions in sadness word use continue to predict improvement in these two outcomes even when controlling for changes in pronoun and insight/causal word use.</p>
<p>In contrast to the depression and physical health models, the model predicting changes in stress reflected a somewhat different profile of predictors. First, changes in the proportions of sad words did not predict changes in stress. Instead, reduced stress was predicted specifically by reductions in anger word frequency. Although this specific difference was not predicted, it is consistent with the more differentiated emotional lives of older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Magai, 2006</xref>) and the notion that different classes of linguistic phenomena may predict different outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker et al., 1997</xref>). In retrospect, it seems likely that stress reductions are better predicted by anger word usage because anger (rather than sad or anxious responses) reflects the frustrating nature of many normative stress elicitors. It is also interesting to note that increases in causal language did not predict reduced stress, which was better predicted by a <italic>reduction</italic> in the proportion of insight class language. Greater use of words from this class (e.g., think, know, consider) may reflect perseveration or rumination on the sources of stress or their (objectively) ongoing nature in the lives of participants. Although replication and further work are needed in this area, the current report may imply that insight-oriented thinking is more useful as a predictor than causal thinking when specifically seeking to intervene to reduce stress.</p>

<title>Approximating the Naturalistic Context of Later Life Disclosures</title>
<p>As noted, disclosures normatively occur during unstructured conversations where the recounting of negative events may be intermingled with descriptions of other events. In addition, verbal (as opposed to written) disclosure may be less taxing and avoid potential frustrations associated with tasks requiring fine motor skills, eyesight, and/or arthritic hands in older groups. Given tendency for older adults to both (a) intersperse positive and negative events during conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12446736">Carstensen, Gottman, &amp; Levenson, 1995</xref>) and (b) show sensitivity to positive emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X12446736">Mather &amp; Carstensen, 2005</xref>), we paired sadness with either a positive or a neutral event. Although power considerations precluded a direct examination of the possibility that sadness disclosures may be either more or less effective when paired with other emotional disclosures, several interesting findings emerged.</p>
<p>To begin, it is worth recalling that the condition variable was an independent predictor of outcome for both depressive and physical health symptomatology; in both cases, pairing the sadness narrative with a happy narrative was associated with superior outcome relative to having completed the sad/neutral pairing. One possibility is that this effect reflects the complex links between PA and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12446736">Consedine &amp; Moskowitz, 2007</xref>). PA may serve as an antidote to stress, perhaps “undoing” the physical effects of negative arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X12446736">Fredrickson &amp; Levenson, 1998</xref>) or increase social and personal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12446736">Fredrickson, 2001</xref>). Importantly, in terms of our focus on the linguistic characteristics predicting outcome, any benefits associated with completing a happy narrative were in addition to those predicted by changes in the sadness narrative.</p>
<p>More provocatively, examination of the differences between sad narrations that occurred in the context of happy versus neutral narrations showed that, at least among Blacks, use of insight words showed a greater increase when sadness narratives were paired with happy narratives while anxious word usage declined. Thus, at least as indexed by these two word classes among Blacks, patterns of linguistic change consistent with improved outcome were greater in the presence of a happy narrative. Exactly why Black participants’ linguistic processes appeared to differentially shift in the presence of a happy narrative is unclear at this point. One possibility is that linguistic changes were more marked among Blacks because the greater proportions of pronouns, sad and angry words, and causal words is indexing systematic differences in the <italic>type</italic> of event selected across the two races; it is possible that the types of sad events chosen by Blacks allowed for greater “movement” in linguistic composition. Another possibility is that the normative coping and regulatory styles of Blacks—notably, greater positive reappraisal and religious-based coping or an increased tendency to find benefits in adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261927X12446736">Tomich &amp; Helgeson, 2004</xref>)—enables them to extract greater benefits when narrations includes elements (i.e., the happy narration) that facilitate the utilization of normative event-management styles. Given that most self-disclosure studies have examined younger, White groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12446736">Consedine et al., 2002</xref>), studies that systematically test the generalizability of disclosure interventions across age and ethnic groups and evaluate whether the ostensible linguistic mechanisms are equivalent are clearly warranted.</p>

<title>Limitations and Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Although they provide a useful contribution to understanding how the benefits of repeated verbal disclosure of sad events may be created by or reflected in language, these data are not without their weaknesses. First, counts do not illuminate the context in which words are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12446736">Bantum &amp; Owen, 2009</xref>) and are ill-suited to distinguishing between different meanings of the same word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12446736">Chung &amp; Pennebaker, 2007</xref>) or detecting irony or sarcasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X12446736">Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, unlike the current study in which narrations occurred twice, a month apart, most disclosure work has been (a) written rather than verbal and (b) repeated on consecutive days. There are, however, few differences in outcomes associated with variation in the timing of repeated disclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12446736">Frattaroli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261927X12446736">Smyth, 1998</xref>). One study of 106 students found no differences in either short- or long-term outcomes as a function of whether disclosures occurred across 3 days, 3 hours, or within 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12446736">Chung &amp; Pennebaker, 2008</xref>). Second, although there are few studies examining disclosure in healthy samples of older adults, we felt that a written disclosure paradigm might prove either off-putting or difficult to transport to other older groups because of issues with fine motor skills, eyesight, and/or arthritic hands in these populations.</p>
<p>These limitations noted, the current study provides a useful contribution to the study of the linguistic markers of event adaptation. In addition to providing one of the few analyses of older adults’ emotional, cognitive, and pronoun narrative content during experimental disclosure, the study tested the effects of sad disclosures in the context of either happy or neutral disclosures, providing a somewhat more naturalistic examination of typical disclosure processes. The characteristics predicting improvement showed that changes in pronoun usage, affective word usage, and use of insight and causal words independently and simultaneously predicted outcomes. Experimental work has gone looking for the <italic>particular</italic> aspect, often implicitly pitting emotional and cognitive components against one another, and results have not been consistent. Some experimental studies have found that insight is superior to catharsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12446736">Kelly et al., 2001</xref>) while others suggest that emotional expression is better than insight/cognitive assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261927X12446736">Sloan et al., 2007</xref>). The current report found independent effects associated with changes in both affective and cognitive words as well as in pronoun usage <italic>at the same time</italic>. Although the lack of experimental control over these characteristics means we cannot eliminate third variable explanations, the overarching message appears to be that verbal disclosures regarding sad events offer a relatively simple, transportable, and nonthreatening intervention that simultaneously affects both emotional and cognitive processes in ways commensurate with improved mental and physical health outcomes.</p>
