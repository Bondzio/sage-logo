<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the rise and changing nature of ‘lean production’ in Sweden and ‘lean’s’ interaction with union strategy and the demands of union members and employers. It begins with a discussion of what has characterised the Swedish work organisation debate over the past 50 years. With this as a base, we discuss significant trends in Swedish industry that provide both pitfalls and possibilities for workers and for Swedish trade union strategy. Our presumption is that such a strategy is not once and for all given, but something that must be brought up to date in relation to the societal context and altered production systems. Finally, we discuss IF Metall’s concept of ‘sustainable work’ that was established at their Congress in 2008. The title of our article, ‘If you can’t beat them, join them?’ is a provocative way to formulate the core of our analysis based on our overall understanding of lean production in Sweden. There are important implications for managers, workers and unions in countries both similar to and different from Sweden.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185613483999" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article discusses the nature and implications of ‘lean production’ in Sweden. It explores the effects of lean production on work environment and work organisation and how such strategies have interacted with demands from union members, employees and employers. The discussions are based on results from a number of projects carried out by the authors over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613483999">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson and Johansson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185613483999">Johansson and Johansson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185613483999">Johansson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185613483999">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185613483999">Johansson and Abrahamsson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185613483999">Johansson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185613483999">Johansson and Wikberg-Nilsson, 2010</xref>). These original articles and papers build on both qualitative and quantitative analysis of previous work organisation research and policy papers, and also on interviews with employer associations and labour union representatives, as well as managers and workers at industrial workplaces. Before we introduce the current discourse and try to understand what happens when the unions face lean production, we need to explore in some detail the historical context and see how it has changed over time and, in so doing, examine some of the major themes in Swedish studies of work organisation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185613483999"><title>From consensus to conflict</title>
<p>Sweden has a long tradition of cooperation between employers and trade unions in the area of how industrial work should be organised. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, safety issues were an area for cooperation, and during the first half of the century, there was general consensus on how Taylorism should be introduced. Critical voices began, however, to be heard, and at the Congress of the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) in 1966, the criticism was primarily directed at labour market policy aspects. Criticism was more evident by the 1971 Congress, a congress that focused on the question of industrial democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185613483999">LO, 1971</xref>). The organisation of work was given considerable attention and, compared with the 1966 Congress, the proposals were further developed in support of more autonomous work groups at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>In the beginning, industrial democracy was organised in cooperation with the Swedish Employer Association (SAF) in the joint Development Council for Collaboration (URAF). URAF was a research organisation inspired by the successful socio-technical experiments that were carried out in Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022185613483999">Thorsrud and Emery, 1969</xref>). This cooperation, however, did not work as smoothly as originally thought, and the lack of success led to a growing division between the SAF and LO, causing the trade union movement to turn to the Social Democratic Party for support to secure a minimum degree of co-determination guaranteed by law. The result was a new Codetermination Act that was launched in 1974.</p>
<p>The climate worsened as LO began demanding power over the means of production by the proposal for Employee Investment Funds, which would have led to all industrial production becoming employee controlled and owned. Under the threat of the Employee Investment Funds, the SAF developed its own vision under the name <italic>Different Kinds of Factories</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185613483999">Agurén and Edgren, 1979</xref>). The SAF’s vision focused more on technical solutions combined with interesting work roles based on the socio-technical approach. The question of power over the means of production made it impossible to continue cooperation, but LO’s largest union, the Swedish Metal Workers’ Union (Metall), wanted to push the issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185613483999"><title>‘Good work’</title>
<p>In 1985, the Metall Congress presented its now-famous concept of ‘good work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185613483999">Metall, 1985</xref>). In a document with the same name, work was examined from many aspects, but the main focus was on production through technical and work organisational issues. Based on this analysis, Metall formulated nine principles for how good work can be attained: 1) job security; 2) a fair share of production earnings; 3) co-determination in the company; 4) a work organisation for cooperation; 5) professional know-how in all work; 6) training as a part of work; 7) working hours based on social demands; 8) equality at the work place; and 9) a working environment without risk to health and safety. If one compares Metall’s good work with the socio-technical approach, it becomes evident that Metall expanded the perspective from the workplace to conditions in the labour market. Parallel with Metall was the general trade union within the industry, the Swedish Industrial Union (Industrifacket), developing a strategy of its own: ‘developmental work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185613483999">Industrifacket, 1995</xref>). In 2006, Metall and Industrifacket merged and became IF Metall. The trade union movement as a whole quickly adopted Metall’s formulation of criteria for good work and the thoughts behind Industrifacket’s developmental work, and at the 1991 LO Congress, a large congress report was presented under the name of <italic>Developmental Work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185613483999">LO, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In this report, LO took a further step from the workplace to working life and even broader social issues. The basis for this strategy was the recognition of new demands from union members in a changing workforce, expressed in terms of a transition from wages and social security to more existential expectations of life, taking the presence of a welfare society for granted. Focusing on changing the work organisation as a means to develop both individuals and society, this concept introduced four principles designed to support justice and development in working life: 1) the elimination of class society, that is, trade-offs and burdens of working life should be fairly distributed, the hierarchy in production should be challenged and all employees should have the right to development in their work; 2) the right to education, integrity, good health and the possibility to decide working hours for all employees; 3) organising work that contributes to more equal work tasks and equal wages between blue- and white-collar workers and men and women; and 4), on the national level, a fair distribution of financial earnings and capital, strong financial groups balanced through national capital, and increased shared savings within the pensions system.</p>
<p>Worth noting is that when the trade union movement was formed in 1898, it was a movement for men formed by men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185613483999">Hirdman, 1998</xref>). In the 1960s, however, the concept of ‘gender roles’ arose and radicalised the entire debate. Nonetheless, by the time <italic>Good Work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185613483999">Metall, 1985</xref>) was published, the idea of equality between men and women was still only addressed in very general terms. As mentioned earlier, a few years later, in <italic>Developmental Work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185613483999">LO, 1991</xref>), gender equality issues were included, although primarily in the form of the need to place a higher value on women’s work, with nothing about changing fundamental structures of the labour market. LO’s 1996 Congress, however, saw a new trend. The Congress agreed that both class and gender were sources of oppression and that these influence how life and work are shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185613483999">LO, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185613483999"><title>A changed industrial context and consensus once again</title>
<p>During the late 1980s, a relatively drastic shift in the industrial context occurred primarily related to new problems confronted by industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185613483999">Johansson, 1999</xref>). These issues were primarily low productivity and major quality problems. Until this point, production technicians had tried to solve problems by investing more; however, in too many of these cases, the investments had not been profitable enough. Now, other solutions were needed based on the more efficient use of existing production equipment and at the same time taking advantage of the potential to be found among skilled labour. Organisation and leadership thus became more important. The new solutions corresponded with trade union demands from the 1970s and early 1980s. The employers and companies not only accepted demands for group work, but also took up the initiative to develop them. Development of competency was also introduced as a new element in discussions about a new work organisation. The struggle for industrial democracy seemed to be not a real struggle at all, but rather the emergence of a new type of consensus between companies and unions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185613483999"><title>‘Lean production’ makes its entrance</title>
<p>At this time (late 1980s and early 1990s), Swedish working life met a new industrial discourse that is often called lean production. Lean is not a new idea. In fact, it has been a guiding star throughout the growth of industrialisation. Adam Smith argued for thrift with manpower in his classic example of needle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022185613483999">Smith, 1976/1776</xref>). Frederick Winslow Taylor refined a type of lean production in his article ‘The principles of scientific management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022185613483999">Taylor, 1972/1913</xref>). Since then, industrial production has continually been on a diet, but its character has varied over time and this variation has been the key for the ideas on how work should be organised.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, this was in the form of the Japanese production and organisation philosophy – today, often called the ‘Toyota Production System’ – which was seen as the great saviour for European industry. It was almost a Japan-euphoria, and the first concepts we came to know were ‘Just-In-Time’, ‘Five S’, ‘Kanban’, ‘Kaizen’ and ‘Total Productive Maintenance’. Later on, in the early 1990s, lean production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022185613483999">Womack et al., 1991</xref>) made its entrance; an American concept largely based on the Toyota Production System and the Japanese transplants in the US. Lean production has mainly been applied in larger industrial mass production and has often been combined with assembly lines. In short, the lean concept’s focus is on effective resource management and the main idea is that this will be achieved with a flow-based production layout and organisation, reducing waste, and increasing standardisation and orderliness. For lean production advocates, teamwork, multi-skilling, job rotation, task enlargement and worker participation in continuous improvement activities are also important parts of the concept, even if <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185613483999">Hines, Holweg and Rich (2004)</xref> describe the early versions of lean (1980–1990) as merely a cost-reducing philosophy designed for the shop floor. In Sweden, the lean concept had a flying start with the great stock market crisis of the early 1990s, where Swedish industry was subject to a diet that is unparalleled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185613483999"><title>Other popular management models</title>
<p>Lean production was not the only concept. Rather, it can be seen as part of the rich flora of popular organisational and management models spread across the world during the 1980s and 1990s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613483999">Furusten, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185613483999">Røvik, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185613483999">Björkman (2003)</xref> describes it as management fashion. Even if realities have been more stable and slow than organisational fashion, the models have played a role at the discourse level and still influence social construction in organisations: how people view the organisation, the profession, the work and themselves as workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson, 2009</xref>). Some of these models were quite related to lean production: Total Quality Management (TQM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613483999">Deming, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613483999">Feigenbaum, 1961</xref>), Six Sigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185613483999">McFadden, 1993</xref>), Total Productive Maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185613483999">Nakajima, 1988</xref>) and perhaps also Time Based Management (TBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022185613483999">Stalk and Hout, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Although parts of these models originated in Japan, their more prominent advocates were US researchers and consultants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613483999">Furusten, 1999</xref>). Other models were even more Americanised, like Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185613483999">Hammer and Champy, 1993</xref>), the Boundaryless Organization (Ashkenas et al., 1997), the Individualised Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185613483999">Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1997</xref>) and Balanced Scorecard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185613483999">Kaplan and Norton, 1993</xref>). Learning plays a central role in all the models and was especially clearly formulated in the models Learning Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022185613483999">Senge, 1990</xref>) and Knowledge Management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022185613483999">Sanchez and Heene, 1997</xref>). Compared with the Swedish/European traditions and the socio-technical approaches that focused more on the workplace level and the work organisation’s relation to the technical system, these models had a clear management perspective and discussed almost solely the social system. Another difference was the ‘bottom–up traditions’ in Swedish working life compared to the new concepts’ more ‘top–down perspectives’.</p>
<p>Although the models to a high degree built on one another and had similar rhetoric and normative management messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613483999">Furusten, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185613483999">Røvik, 2000</xref>), they were somewhat different and can in one respect be seen as reactions to each other. Lean production and other models from the early 1990s were clearly rationalisation and efficiency strategies for the production organisation, while the models from the late 1990s were more comprehensive and represented normative management strategies. These models were focusing on creating a powerful corporate culture and effective organisation around core processes to create value for customers. The favoured organisational form was a flat and integrated work organisation where objective-oriented work teams with opportunities for workplace learning played a central role. If we compare Metall’s and LO’s vision of good work with these management concepts, they converge to a great degree in their rhetoric, at least in these aspects.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, most companies undertook their implementation projects in cooperation with trade unions and in a positive spirit to do good for both the company and its employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson, 2002</xref>). The trade unions had a low profile in the working life debate. Their discussion concerning work environment and work organisation had lost its intensity and lacked vision and concrete proposals regarding what form the work of tomorrow should take. The discussion lay in the shadow of the high unemployment rate and the requirement of putting the finances of the Swedish state on a sound basis after the great stock market crisis in the early 1990s. The interest of the trade unions focused on unemployment and new labour legislation that may be characterised as ‘labour legislation for growth’. In other words, the trade unions were more interested in those who were unemployed than in the work environment for those who had employment.</p>
<p>The modern management models, concepts and tools were marketed as ready for use in all types of organisations, but most often they were not implemented in their entirety and needed to be adapted and ‘translated’ to the national and local organisational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022185613483999">Røvik, 2000</xref>). In Swedish industrial practice, the management models were mixed with neo-liberal views, national labour market traditions (such as good work) and research on workplace learning, ergonomics and socio-technical principles, an amalgamation of ideas that has formed what we have described as a ‘Swedish dialect’ of management models. These are formulated in four trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185613483999">Johansson and Abrahamsson, 2009</xref>):
<list id="list1-0022185613483999" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Rational flows</italic>. The major trend is that the physical layout of production is based on the product flow, either in conventional assembly lines or in product groups linked in a flow. The work organisations are based on processes and flows often focused on the end customer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Integrated production teams</italic>. One part of the flow-based organisation is to dissolve borders between functions, departments and units. Another form is the specific mixing and integration of work assignments within respective flows or processes, from order to delivery. One aspect of this is job rotation and that the employees need to have an overview and knowledge of several sections of the production. This provides greater flexibility in staffing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Flat organisations</italic>. Another trend, although not as clear, is fewer management levels and more decentralised decision-making, for example, autonomous work teams. This democratic touch is perhaps a typical Swedish approach, especially workers’ participation. Emphasis on coaching, teamwork, communication and cooperation increase in importance. Commitment and creativity are considered important and have clearly highlighted the importance of the individual.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Learning at work.</italic> For production personnel, knowledge transfer, development of competency and learning at work are considered important. It is about training individuals to participate in work teams, but it is also a question of organisational changes in workplace culture that can handle, for example, rapid changes in production techniques, products and quality demands.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185613483999"><title>The return of ‘lean production’</title>
<p>Lean production’s popularity has risen and fallen since the early 1990s, but during the last decade the concept has seen a renaissance, and today (2012) it has achieved an unchallenged position as the leading management model. In Sweden, lean appears as the most enduring and thorough management concept of the 1990s and has clearly moved from rhetoric to practice and resulted in seemingly real organisational changes in many companies – although they may take many different forms. We have seen a rapid diffusion of lean systems not only into manufacturing sectors, but also into the process industry, health care and civil services, in both private and public sectors. The effect is not just that the public sector copies lean and other industrial management models, but also that the model’s basic structures become so dominant that they are internalised in our consciousness.</p>
<p>However, there are several different variations on lean occurring at the same time, when comparing different nations, different sectors of the labour market, between small and large organisations and even within organisations. Some try to launch hybrid models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613483999">Börnfelt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022185613483999">Wallace, 2004</xref>) or a ‘softer’ version of lean; perhaps especially in the Nordic version of lean, something close to what we earlier described as a ‘Swedish dialect’. Others choose to return to the ‘orthodox’ Japanese production systems, and once again companies, consultants and researchers take pilgrimages to Japan to learn. Still others stick to the ‘hard-core’ version, where the work tasks often become detail-controlled, short-cycled and standardised. During the last decade, the assembly line, sometimes labelled lean, and often used in conjunction with lean, experienced a renaissance in Swedish industry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185613483999"><title>‘Lean’ and ‘good work’</title>
<p>The international management literature paints a bright and optimistic picture, assuming that companies actually implement lean or other current management concepts. Such a strategy, so the literature emphasises, results in better productivity, survival in the global market and, at the same time, good working environments by getting rid of the classic Taylorism. A bad work environment is waste, according to lean, and some lean advocates argue that lean is almost the new good work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613483999">Berglund, 2010</xref>). Standardised work operations are seen as a necessity both for planning the production flow and for continuous improvements, including of the work environment. By providing workers with learning opportunities and empowerment, for example in Kaizen activities, it is hoped that lean can help workers improve their competence and also create working conditions that combat stress and work-related health issues. The concepts of sustainability and healthy organisations are often used in presentations of lean. The expected effects of the time savings in lean are always presented as something good: better quality and more time for innovation and development, and even improvements to the environment thanks to lower energy and material consumption. Today, you can sometimes even hear the term ‘green lean’ mentioned by industry leaders and production researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185613483999">Kurdve et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, gender equality is on the agenda for both the unions and the employers, mostly when recruitment and Human Resource Management (HRM) are discussed. In management literature, women are even described as the ideal workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185613483999">Kelan, 2007</xref>). But gender equality is also seen as a natural part of lean or at least a prerequisite for lean, a tool for successful implementation of lean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185613483999">Franzen et al., 2010</xref>). This line of argument is built on the idea that the process and flow organisation of lean, at least in its theoretical and ideal form, requires a focus on skills and flexibility, and therefore a gender marking of work tasks becomes obsolete and counterproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>In spite of the high level of consensus, the diversity of optimistic perspectives and the extensive dissemination of the ideas of lean throughout industry, many companies run into diffuse resistance and even open conflicts when trying to implement lean or other similar organisational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson, 2002</xref>). The organisations more or less revert to previous forms, despite the fact that this often is quite irrational and counterproductive from a productivity and economic perspective as well from a work environmental perspective.</p>
<p>But even when the change processes run more smoothly, it seems an open question how much of the ideals of lean are reflected in the industrial implementations. There are successful examples that produce good working environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185613483999">Brulin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185613483999">Hunter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022185613483999">Saurin and Ferreira, 2009</xref>), effective organisations and positive financial numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022185613483999">Vink et al., 2006</xref>). But, unfortunately, we must conclude that the picture from the 1990s was not always positive from either the company’s or the employees’ perspective. A long series of negative tendencies were visible in working life during the late 1990s: an increased number of people on long-term sick leave and with work-related illnesses and injuries; burned-out personnel; and stressed and overburdened people. The academic interest in lean and similar strategies has generated a raft of critical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185613483999">Berggren, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613483999">Eklund, 2000</xref>). A group of Swedish working-life researchers proposed the label ‘mean production’ as a substitute for ‘lean production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613483999">Berggren et al., 1991</xref>). Some researchers describe the effects of lean in terms of anorexic work organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022185613483999">Radnor and Boaden, 2004</xref>) or seductive and greedy organisations where workers are expected to be disciplined, flexible, responsible, multi-talented and prepared to work overtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022185613483999">Rasmussen, 1999</xref>). Others argue that despite lean’s and the other management models’ talk of a paradigm shift, they do not at all attempt to change basic power and capitalist structures, and much of Taylorism remains in modern organisational forms, especially in lean, and can continue to result in the same types of work-related problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022185613483999">Thompson and Warhurst, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>When it comes to teamwork, worker autonomy and decision-making, job rotation and expanding work assignments, and the learning and working environment, there are several contradictory images. We can, for example, see a trend where the perspective is shifted from the group to the individual. The group/team is no longer the smallest planning level for employers. This is clearly seen with the re-emerging assembly lines and ‘hard-core’ lean. The cycle time of the lines is often not as short as during the heydays of the assembly line, but they are considerably shorter than with group-organised work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185613483999">IF Metall, 2010</xref>). In general, the ‘leaner’ the production becomes, the greater the risks for one-sided work movements and physical overexertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185613483999">Landsbergis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022185613483999">Westgaard and Winkel, 2011</xref>). In addition, repetitive standardised work assignments make breadth and variation difficult to achieve and do not provide good opportunities for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185613483999">Ellström, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022185613483999">Thompson and Warhurst, 1998</xref>). Such a situation can result in workers feeling that they are replaceable and/or not qualified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022185613483999">Wärvik and Thång, 2003</xref>). Moreover, standardised work tasks reduce worker autonomy and one’s own opportunity to make decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185613483999">Jürgens, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar way, we can still see an obvious discrepancy between rhetoric and practice when it comes to some aspects of gender equality. Even if companies’ implementation of lean production can challenge or even threaten, as a secondary effect, many aspects of the local prevailing unequal gender order among other organisational relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613483999">Abrahamsson, 2002</xref>), it seems that lean adapts and fits in very well with existing unequal gendered structures and discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185613483999">Kahn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185613483999">Kelan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022185613483999">Taylor, 2006</xref>). There are also studies showing that lean can even give more gender inequality, for example, by having a more negative effect on the work environment for women workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185613483999">Angelis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022185613483999">Newsome, 2003</xref>) and creating more gender homogeneous jobs and more pronounced gender segregation within the production organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185613483999">Losonci et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We can conclude that depending on how the lean concept is implemented, it can offer opportunities for both productivity and improvements in the working environment; however, there are pitfalls. Therefore, there are different interpretations of and attitudes to these systems, as well as their claimed outcomes and effects on the work system.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0022185613483999"><title>IF Metall once again – ‘sustainable work’</title>
<p>Even though the Swedish trade unions have a reputation for being open to technological change, the relationship with today’s lean has been ambivalent, shifting from an initial resistance to a welcoming of lean, at least from some trade unions, albeit with some words of warning included in the acceptance. The labour unions argue that the implementation of lean production requires a balance between fulfilling demands from members (e.g. employment security and a healthy and secure work environment) and employers (e.g. a competitive production system) – a goal that sometimes has been difficult to fulfil.</p>
<p>In 2002, an enquiry by Metall showed that 55% of the total workforce within Swedish industry worked at a company that had introduced lean; among larger companies, the equivalent number was around 70%. As a result, wider work content, cooperation and influence, as well as more participation in problem-solving activities among the workers, could be found. On the negative side, shortened cycle times, higher stress and an increased risk of receiving repetitive strain injuries were observed in companies that had introduced lean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185613483999">Metall, 2003</xref>). Worth noting is that the increased work content, at first glance seen as a positive effect, was the result of work rotation being introduced, something that did not necessarily mean that the work tasks had been more qualified. In fact, it often implied a rotation between simple, and thereby not developing, work tasks. Together with the fact that the same enquiry showed that the union influence was low in the implementation process, this called for action. Keeping the growing interest in lean in mind, it became necessary for the trade union to take part in the development process in order to secure both good working conditions and high productivity. To support the local trade union representatives in handling the companies’ growing interest in and use of lean, expressed as ‘Rationalization – once again on the agenda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185613483999">Metall, 2003</xref>: 3), the report illustrated how lean interacts with and contradicts the concept of good work, and gave guidelines for future trade union work on these questions.</p>
<p>With the wisdom of hindsight, it becomes clear that this was not an easy task; the trend of deteriorating working conditions and decreasing trade union influence continued, parallel with an increasing interest in lean production. In 2008, a number of local trade union branches reported that they ‘refused to become an alibi’ for the introduction of a lean concept that contradicted the trade unions’ perspective of good work, initiated and controlled by management. In practice, this implied that their participation in the development work stopped. To some degree, this was met with internal union criticism, as these branches now stood outside of the development process without any possibilities of influencing the outcome, and thereby handed all the power over to management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185613483999">IF Metall, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As a means to promote a version of good work in general, or a lean work that better supported the trade unions’ missions of good and developing work in particular, IF Metall launched a new union strategy in 2008, the concept of sustainable work<italic>.</italic> The concept can be seen as a further development of good work, this time with a stronger focus on the work organisation as a means to obtain sustainable working conditions in competitive companies. According to the new strategy, sustainable work can be obtained through the fulfilment of the following conditions: 1) enlarged work tasks and individual development for all employees; 2) developing work tasks for all employees; 3) job rotation so that no more than 75% of the work tasks shall consist of repetitive, bounded or strictly controlled work; 4) work tasks that are possible to adjust in case of rehabilitation; 5) consequence and risk analyses made before changes in work organisation; 6) general and specific development of competency, integrated into the daily work in order to develop both employee and company, leading to a more numeric gender equality within occupations, positions and units in the company; 7) a wage system that stimulates development, allows for increased wages and contributes to equal wages; and 8) cooperation between management and unions concerning development work in an early stage of the planned change, as well as employee participation in changes that concern their own work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185613483999">IF Metall, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to IF Metall, to ensure that lean implementation will result in a developed work organisation, it is necessary to stress a more holistic approach, a development of total efficiency and close collaboration, a partnership between management and trade unions, where the trade union is involved in an early stage so that a real trade union influence in the development of the work organisation is ensured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185613483999">Metall, 2003</xref>). IF Metall argues that sustainable work originates in individual workplaces. Based on local conditions, the aim is to bring together two separate perspectives: the individual member’s right to good health and development at work; and the industrial workplaces’ need for high productivity and competitive strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185613483999">IF Metall, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>When comparing sustainable work with earlier union manifestos, we can see that labour market issues are toned down in favour of a focus on the work organisation and workplace, and in a way this can be seen as a return to the socio-technical paradigm. Sustainable work does not challenge lean production; rather, it puts limits on how far rationalisation strategies are allowed to affect the work environment. Our hope is that by accepting a modified form of lean production, the workers will increase their employability. The union stresses that in order to reach the full potential of lean implementation, a win–win situation that does not conflict with the trade unions’ main mission is necessary, as well as partnership and cooperation between management and trade unions. Our conclusion seems to be that if you can’t beat them, join them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0022185613483999"><title>If you can’t beat them, join them</title>
<p>A comprehensive conclusion based on developments over 50 years is that the Swedish trade union movement usually chose cooperation before confrontation, or ‘dancing’ instead of ‘boxing’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185613483999">Huzzard et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022185613483999">Peetz and Bailey (2012)</xref> describe it. Sometimes, the cooperation went very far, such as in connection with the introduction of Methods<bold>-</bold>Time Measurement (MTM), when they chose to actively take part in the actual implementation. Perhaps it was a wise strategy; in exchange, they gained insight into the implementation process and were probably able to avoid the worst of exploitation.</p>
<p>However, the consensus was not total. Group work and delegated responsibility became concepts unions worked for in the 1960s. To begin with, the resistance from employers was hard, but 10 years later, the criticism had been toned down and group work became a rationalisation strategy driven by employers. However, such debates, ideas and strategies of work organisation have been rather invisible in Swedish working life during the latest decade. The Swedish trade union IF Metall’s concept of sustainable work tries to resolve this dilemma through the use of enlarged work content where more administrative and controlling tasks are added to the traditional work tasks. Other labour unions are using similar strategies. Our fear is that these actions are not going to change the situation in any dramatic manner. It is no exaggeration to say that the concept of sustainable work is living in the shadow of lean production, whose main purpose is to reduce costs and where rational flows are an important component. We can also see an increasing influence of the globalised market. This is a development that clearly reduces national discretion, especially from a union perspective: production can easily be moved to countries with low wages and weak regulation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our conclusion is that Swedish labour union strategies for handling lean production have to acknowledge that we live in a new industrial context that has new prerequisites and new opportunities for development. Stopping the development towards lean is probably neither possible nor desirable. The global market requires rational production, and the unions as well as the employers need to find forms for organisation of work that fit into the framework of lean as well as concepts of good and sustainable work. For example, lean is perhaps not such a bad alternative if it can be integrated with a learning focus: involving the individual’s total competence as a resource in the company’s internal rationalisation work. In contrast to a more ‘hard-core’ lean, this involves increased autonomy and increased learning for workers. A threat to this, as well as a hope, is the individualisation of work. Individualised control of workers is a natural part of today’s management concepts, but individualisation is even stronger in the entire social discourse. The individual going before the collective is something that characterises most of society’s sectors. From a labour point of view, this can be a problem that needs to be balanced. A powerful collective is the guardian for good working conditions while, at the same time, the new trade union concepts need to ensure the individual’s learning, development of competency and ability to be innovative and creative, and that this becomes a part of the production system.</p>
<p>Finally, national trade union strategies should not be viewed as pure ‘copy and paste solutions’ for other countries to follow. Corporative traditions, organisational structure and trade union density differ between countries or even regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185613483999">Jensen, 2006</xref>), affecting trade union influence. However, earlier Swedish trade union strategies, such as the concepts of good work and developmental work, have inspired, or even been adopted by, trade unions in Europe and global union federations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185613483999">Lansbury, 2009</xref>). The question is: will sustainable work have the same impact? Perhaps, but one problem is that, as we have previously noted, the current Swedish trade union strategies for handling lean production are developed within a general framework of what a lean-heavy working life can offer. The unions and the employers are trying to find forms for organisation of work that fit into the framework of lean as well as concepts of good and sustainable work, and that is not an easy task. Another problem is that we live a globalised industrial world with mobile international capital, which means that the unions’ discretion is quite limited. We can conclude that IF Metall’s sustainable work is not the optimal solution, but it might be a step in the right direction, perhaps, in fact, the only possible step. If you can’t beat them, then it’s not such a bad strategy to join them.</p>
