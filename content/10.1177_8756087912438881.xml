<abstract>
<p>The present work investigates the preparation of nonisocyanate polyurethane through condensation of oligomeric hard segments produced by using phenol sulfonic and hydroxybenzoic acids and soft segments obtained by transesterification reaction of polyoxypropylene glycol with ethyl urethane. Obtained nonisocyanate polyurethane films with different hard segments content were tested for their mechanical, physical and thermal properties. Polyurethane films containing p-hydroxybenzoic acid exhibited enhanced tensile strength and water resistance. The tensile strength increased by approximately 230% and water resistance by 35% with the addition of 30% p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis confirmed the formation of segmented structures within the prepared condensation nonisocyanate polyurethane-based films. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results analysis confirmed the chemical structure of condensation polyurethanes with characteristic groups of typical conventional polyurethanes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-8756087912438881" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyurethanes (PUR) produced with conventional methods have been known for more than half century and are widely used in many areas, such as in biomedical applications, coating materials or as matrices for leather-like materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756087912438881">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756087912438881">4</xref></sup> They are characterized by versatile morphology which is dependent on the content and type of hard and soft segments (SS). However, the high price and toxicity of isocyanates constitute the main disadvantage of PUR.</p>
<p>To overcome these drawbacks, great efforts are currently underway to develop production processes resulting in less expensive and more environmentally friendly nonisocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUR). The recent trend in the PUR synthesis is the replacement of toxic diisocyanates by other components. Condensation route using nonisocyanate components seems to be an alternative for PUR preparation.</p>
<p>Several studies investigated the preparation and properties evaluation of PUR using carbon dioxide and diamines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912438881">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087912438881">7</xref></sup> Endo and his research group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912438881">5</xref></sup> synthesized PUR using carbon dioxide, bisepoxide and diamine by means of polyaddition route. The obtained PUR bearing hydroxyl groups in the side chains could be further transformed to fabricate PUR with various side chains. Wilkes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8756087912438881">6</xref></sup> also reacted carbonated soybean oil with carbon dioxide in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide as catalyst at 110°C to produce PUR. The soybean oil reacts with amines to give NIPUR networks. The characterization of the obtained NIPURs confirmed the network character of all obtained materials, as well as the dependence of mechanical and dynamic properties on type and stoichiometry of amines.</p>
<p>Petrović and his research group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087912438881">7</xref></sup> prepared and studied the structure, mechanical, physical and swelling properties of PUR obtained from carbonated soybean oil with different diamines. They mixed 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,4-butylenediamine and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine with different carbonate to amine ratios. The reaction of soybean oil with carbon dioxide resulted in complete conversion of epoxy to cyclic carbonate groups ending in PUR with higher cross-linking density and much higher tensile strength (TS) than similar PUR. They found all used amines produced elastomeric PUR with glass transition (<italic>T</italic>g) temperatures between 0 and 40°C and hardness between 40 and 90 Shore A. Moreover, the prepared material exhibited a TS of 2.6–6.9 MPa and quite high elongation at break between 160 and 230%.</p>
<p>Figovsky et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8756087912438881">8</xref></sup> investigated a new generation of protective coatings based on NIPURs and water-borne compositions of fire-resistant coatings. They used cyclocarbonates, primary amines and epoxy resins to produce NIPURs. NIPURs have attracted increasing attention because of their improved water absorption resistance and thermal resistance, as well as absorption/desorption properties in comparison with conventional PUR. Their field of applications includes chemical-resistant foams, coating and sealants.</p>
<p>The synthesis of aliphatic PUR from diamines and diols or alternatively from α,ω-aminoalcohols using ethylene carbonate as a substitute of phosgene was carried out by Rokicki and Piotrowska.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8756087912438881">9</xref></sup> Using <sup>1</sup>H and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup>C NMR spectroscopy analysis, they showed that PUR can be obtained by the transurethanization reaction between α,ω-bis(2-hydroxyethoxycarbonylamino) alkanes and diols containing six or more carbon atoms. The molecular weights (MWs) of obtained PUR were determined by means of mass spectroscopy method and were found to be low between 1580 and 3500.</p>
<p>In a separate work, Diakoumakos and Kotzev<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756087912438881">10</xref></sup> used an aliphatic tricyclocarbonate and amines to produce NIPURs. They estimated the reaction activation energy and defined the chemical structure of the obtained NIPURs. They confirmed that the chemical structure and MW of amines affect the reactivity of amines toward cyclocarbonate. The reaction activation energy decreased by 17.5% upon addition of 1% of catalyst (triethylamine). Furthermore, the model nonisocyanate-based PUR exhibited a very low <italic>T</italic>g temperature (–1°C) and relatively high elongation at break of about 70%.</p>
<p>Jayakannan and Deepa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756087912438881">11</xref></sup> employed a new melt transurethane polycondensation method to prepare thermally stable aliphatic or aromatic PUR without solvent and isocyanate. The transurethane process was confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup>C NMR and MW of the PUR were estimated. The presence of catalyst resulted in 97% reaction conversion, whereas its absence gave only less than 2% of the product, similarly to other results reported in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756087912438881">10</xref></sup> Moreover, the authors showed that almost all the obtained polymers were stable up to 280°C with a <italic>T</italic>g temperature from –30 to +120°C depending on the diols used in the melt transurethane process.</p>
<p>Nonisocyanates segmented condensation polyether urethanes (SCPUR) were prepared from oligoether dicarbamates, urea, phenol sulfonic acid (PSA) and formaldehyde (F).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756087912438881">12</xref></sup> The reactive carbamate groups together with flexible oligoether chains constituted the SS, whereas urethanes, urea and phenol ring (from PSA) constituted the hard segments (HS). The optimum conditions for performing each SCPUR synthesis process were determined and the water resistance and mechanical properties were related to the PUR structure.</p>
<p>More recently, condensation PUR with different HS content were prepared by condensation reaction of urea, PSA and F and tested for their mechanical, physical and thermal properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup> The obtained films were heated at 50°C for 120 min and then treated at 135°C during 15 min or 160 during 10 min. The TS of samples thermally treated was 120% higher than for samples treated only at 50°C. The obtained PUR exhibited segmented structures with phase separation between HS and SS. Films containing 19 and 21% HS heated at 50°C then 135°C exhibited acceptable mechanical properties and water resistance. The lower and higher end-use temperatures of HS were affected mainly by the polymer composition.</p>
<p>The main objective of the present work was to investigate the effect of HS content on the TS, water absorption resistance and thermal properties of environmentally friendly PUR synthesized by condensation method. To achieve this aim, condensation PUR were prepared using urea, PSA, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) and F. The segmented PUR contained different amounts of HS and SS.</p>

<sec id="sec4-8756087912438881"><title>Preparation of oligomers with HS</title>
<p>PSA and HBA and urea were selected as components for the synthesis of HS. PSA and HBA were mixed in a flask, and then urea solution in formalin was added at such a rate that the reaction temperature will not exceed 50°C. This latter was selected to avoid the decomposition of sulfone groups which occurs at temperatures above 59°C. The molar ratio of substrates used in the preparation of HS was −urea : (PSA + HBA) : F = 1 : 1 : 1.</p>
<p>The reaction took place at (20°C–50°C–20°C) during 100 min according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756087912438881">scheme 1</xref>

<p>The mixing of raw materials and intermediate product was carried out at room temperature. The condensation reaction showed a slight exothermic character giving liquid oligomers at room temperature. The possibility of obtaining homogeneous polymeric films was conditioned by the continuation of the condensation reaction of obtained oligomers with the addition of F for 2 h at 60°C, regardless of mixture compositions. Films of liquid oligomers were heated in an air-circulating oven for different times and temperatures up to solidification of samples.

<p>Tensile tests were carried out using an Instron machine Model 5566 at room temperature and a crosshead speed of 100 mm min<sup>–1</sup>, in accordance with ISO 37:1977 412 standard procedure. Samples with a 6 cm length, 1 cm width and 0.3 mm thickness were used.</p>
<p>The water resistance of the obtained films was evaluated at room temperature. The samples were weighed and immersed in distilled water for 24 h at room temperature. Then, they were dried in air-circulating oven at 50°C for 2 h. The weight loss arising from incomplete reaction of the used substrates was then evaluated.</p>
<p>The sorption and desorption of water vapor was carried on prepared PUR films according to BN-76/7773-01 norm. The water vapor sorption relies on the determination of water vapor weight absorbed during a certain time by the sample conditioned in a chamber under 95% of relative humidity. However, the desorption concerns the amount of water vapor released by the samples during a certain time at 65% of relative humidity.</p>

<p>It can be observed that the TS increased and elongation at break of tested elastomers decreased with increasing amounts of HS and reacted HBA. All films containing HBA exhibited enhanced TS as compared to PUR films without HBA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, the incorporation of 30% mole of HBA resulted in approximately 230% improvement in TS in comparison with polymer without HBA for the ratio of SS : HS : F equating 1.0 : 0.8 : 1.6. Furthermore, the TS increase attained only 9–100% for polymers with SS : HS : F = 1.0 : 0.9 : 1.8 and SS : HS : F = 1.0 : 01.0 : 2.0. However, for higher SS : HS : F ratios (i.e. 1.0 : 1.5 : 3.0 and 1.0 : 2.5 : 5.0), the TS increased by approximately 155–165%. Thus, polymers obtained from HS containing maximum amount of HBA (all PUR samples symbol ‘d’—in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-8756087912438881">Table 2</xref>) and characterized by the best mechanical properties were selected for further testing. It was interesting to relate their chemical structure with their composition. It has to be mentioned that, PUR films prepared from HBA exhibited higher TS than films based on PSA without HBA (20 MPa and 12 MPa, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup> Moreover, the water resistance of HBA-based PUR was higher than that of PUR films prepared from PSA without HBA (97% in comparison with 60%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The HBAs and PSAs embedded in ionomeric condensation PUR composition are able to produce a polymer with enhanced mechanical properties resulting from the well-known self-improvement effect as for conventional PUR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756087912438881">1</xref></sup> The stronger polar –COOH of HBA forms strong van der Waals bonds, which can further enhance the PUR mechanical properties. However, it has to be mentioned that the cross-linking connected with –COOH was not to be detected in straightforward manner as proved by the presence of peaks from FTIR.</p>
<p>Moreover, it can be noticed that water vapor sorption and desorption of the obtained samples increased and water resistance increased with increasing amount of HS completely represented by increasing PSA content. This can be explained by the fact that the sulfone groups control the sorption properties of PUR ionomers. It was also found that, HBA increased the water resistance of obtained polymeric films. However, the water resistance of the mentioned films increased by only 30%.</p>
<p>As seen from the results of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-8756087912438881">Table 2</xref>, the maximum water vapor desorption was in the range 35% (PUR film IId)—70% (PUR film Id) for films based on 30% HBA. Moreover, the extents of water vapor sorption and desorption were equal for the tested films. The water sorption decreased by about 60% for PUR film based on 30% HBA in comparison with film without HBA (film designated PUR Id).</p>
<p>The water resistance between 25 and 35% was obtained for all tested films. Moreover, the maximum resistance was exhibited by the PUR film (Id) with 30% of HBA.</p>
<p>Infrared (IR) spectroscopy analysis was carried out on prepared PUR films in order to check the occurrence of possible chemical reactions between reactive groups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756087912438881">Figure 1</xref> shows IR spectra of PUR samples containing different amounts of HS (0.8–2.5 moles HS/1 mole SS).

<p>Absorption bands associated with methylene bridges and aromatic rings (with HBA and PSA) were observed in all tested films independent of their compositions. Moreover, a large and intensive double peak was identified in the range 3071–3332 cm<sup>–1</sup>, regardless of HS and SS contents. The mentioned range concerned the stretching vibrations of N–H and O–H groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756087912438881">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756087912438881">16</xref></sup> The occurrence of degenerated triple band in the range 2862–2972 cm<sup>–1</sup> can attest the presence of stretching vibrations of C–H groups in three different aliphatic arrangements.</p>
<p>The IR spectrum showed characteristic small absorption at 2360 cm<sup>–1</sup> corresponding to urethane linkage (–NH stretching). However, the diffuse-intensive band at 1694–1710 cm<sup>–1</sup> can testify about the presence of C–O groups but also their content in the monomer (methylene bridge, carboxyl groups and urethane bonding).</p>
<p>The appearance of a distinct double-stretching vibration peak in the range 1450–1600 cm<sup>–1</sup> for C=C in aromatic arrangement was observed only in samples containing 0.8–1.0 moles of HS (samples designated as Id, IId and IIId; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-8756087912438881">Table 2</xref>). The double absorption peak came probably from aromatic rings of the two acids which form the HS constituent elements. However, such peak was observed as single broad peak in samples containing more HS.</p>
<p>The hydroxyl group was identified at 1517–1520 cm<sup>–1</sup> for all tested samples independently on their compositions. However, an intensive signal for C=C and C–H groups in aromatic and aliphatic arrangements was observed in the frequency range 1451–1455 cm<sup>–1</sup>. However, the vibrations of C–H, C–O, C–C and C–N groups took place in the range 1341–1374 cm<sup>–1</sup>. Besides the above mentioned peaks, the urethane group showed an additional peak at 1231–1234 cm<sup>–1</sup>. The stretching vibration of N–H groups in within urethane groups were shown as a broad intensive peak, characteristic for typical addition PUR. The groups N–H and O–H gave an additional band in the range 1150–1000 cm<sup>–1</sup>. This signal was observed in the form of a degenerated broadband, which can testify about the significant contribution of urea, urethane and phenol groups as well as O–H groups from the acids.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that, the peak appearing at 1000 cm<sup>–1</sup> may arise from the stretching vibrations of S=O within <inline-formula id="ilm1-8756087912438881"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-8756087912438881"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>SO</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> groups and its height increased with increasing amount of HS in the sample, which can be confirmed by the ionomeric character of PUR. The vibration of hydroxyl groups O–H within PSA and HBA is represented by a distinct double peak in all tested films at approximately 3300 cm<sup>–1</sup>.</p>
<p>Bands confirming the substitution of aromatic rings as well as the macromolecular structure appear below 862 cm<sup>–1</sup>. The vibration stretching of C–H groups in aromatics gave signals in three ranges of wavelengths 862, 835–837 and 778–779 cm<sup>–1</sup>. This range is typical for C–H in aromatic ring. The sharp and highly intensive peak at 778–779 cm<sup>–1</sup>, with double substitution ring in ortho position, confirmed the chain extension at the mentioned position. The peaks at 835–837 and 862 cm<sup>–1</sup> confirmed the ring formation in para position, which justifies the generated formula of condensation PUR macromolecule.</p>

<sec id="sec11-8756087912438881"><title>Phase transitions of PUR films</title>
<p>DSC was used to estimate the phase transitions of PUR films containing different amounts of HS for compositions with 0.8–2.5 moles of HS and 1 mole of SS.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-8756087912438881">Figure 2</xref> is shown the DSC thermograms of condensation PUR films with different HS content (DSC analysis carried out in the temperature range: +25°C → –60°C → +25°C).
<fig id="fig2-8756087912438881" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Thermograms of condensation polyurethanes with different hard segments content (differential scanning calorimeter [DSC] analysis in the temperature range: +25°C → –60°C → +25°C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_8756087912438881-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The following characteristic phase transition temperatures were determined as a function of HS and SS contents under two scanning conditions: glass transition (<italic>T</italic>g), crystallization (<italic>T</italic>c), melting (<italic>T</italic>m) as well as decomposition (<italic>T</italic>d). The phase transition temperatures were defined as tangent to the front peak line at the inflection point.</p>
<p>Moreover, distinct peaks corresponding to phase transitions of HS and SS were identified in thermograms of PUR samples containing different amounts of HS.</p>
<p>The tested samples showed similar rubbery temperature ranges. PUR films exhibited higher resistance to frost. The lower end-use temperature of polymers as determined by the SS <italic>T</italic>g temperature value did not depend on HS content in the tested PUR samples. It remained in the range between –49 and –48°C with increasing amount of HS.</p>
<p>However, the higher end-use temperature of PUR films as defined from the melting temperature of HS was indirectly proportional to the amount of HS in the obtained polymer. The prepared films were anticipated to be useful over a temperature range of –48 to +187°C based on the small difference between <italic>T</italic>g of SS and <italic>T</italic>m of HS. Similar results concerning isocyanate-based segmented PUR were reported in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8756087912438881">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>It can be noted that, the glassy transition of SS of NIPURs prepared without HBA took place at approximately –70°C and the HS melted at temperatures around 160°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912438881">13</xref></sup> It seems that, the presence of HBA in NIPUR has shifted the end-use range toward higher temperatures, that is, between –48 and +190°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756087912438881">Figure 3</xref>).
