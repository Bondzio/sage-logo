<abstract>
<p>This study identifies clusters of US and Canadian metropolitan areas with similar knowledge traits. These groups—ranging from ‘Making regions’, characterised by knowledge about manufacturing, to ‘Thinking regions’, noted for knowledge about the arts, humanities, IT and commerce—can be used by analysts and policy-makers for the purposes of regional benchmarking or comparing the types of programme and infrastructure available to support closely related economic activities. In addition, these knowledge-based clusters help to explain the types of region that have levels of economic development that exceed, or fall short of, other places with similar amounts of college attainment. Regression results show that ‘Engineering’, ‘Building’, ‘Enterprising’ and ‘Making’ regions are associated with higher levels of productivity and/or income per capita; while ‘Teaching’, ‘Understanding’, ‘Working’ and ‘Comforting’ regions have lower levels of economic development.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>It would be an understatement to suggest that knowledge plays a key role in today’s economy; for much of the developed world, it might be more accurate to assert that knowledge <italic>is</italic> today’s economy. Many observers have noted that the importance of natural resources, buildings and machinery as the means to produce goods and deliver services has been overshadowed by the primacy of knowledge, skills and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011411949">Drucker, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011411949">Knight, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011411949">Florida, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011411949">Lever, 2002</xref>). Facing this realisation, researchers of urban and regional economic policy (and some policy-makers themselves) have a heightened interest in programmes that fall under the broad umbrella of human- capital-based economic development. These strategies include enhancing and promoting regional amenities to attract talented and creative workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011411949">Florida, 2002</xref>), workforce education and training, and incentives for R&amp;D and entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011411949">Mathur, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Human-capital-based strategies are often backed by research suggesting that educational attainment, typically measured as the percentage of adult residents with a college degree, increases regional economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011411949">Rauch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011411949">Glaeser <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011411949">Moretti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011411949">Abel and Gabe, 2011</xref>). However, the number of years of formal education is a somewhat crude and generic measure of human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011411949">Goldin and Katz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011411949">Ingram and Neumann, 2006</xref>). By simply counting up a region’s residents with a college degree, equal weights are applied to individuals regardless of their area of expertise. Surely, the knowledge and skills required to graduate with a degree in, for example, mechanical engineering or physics are different from the knowledge and skills needed in, say, history or political science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011411949">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the knowledge economies of US and Canadian metropolitan areas. Building from the literature on occupational-based approaches to economic development, this task involves focusing on the occupational make-up of regions to determine the types of knowledge used in the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011411949">Florida, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011411949">Feser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011411949">Markusen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011411949">Bacolod <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011411949">Scott, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011411949">Florida <italic>et al</italic>. (2008</xref>, p. 618) suggest that, whereas formal education “measures potential talent or skill”, an emphasis on occupations provides an idea of how “human talent or capability is absorbed by and used by the economy”. Thus, with information on the skills and knowledge that are important to job performance, we can use occupational employment data to determine the knowledge profiles of regions.</p>
<p>Our primary goals in the paper are to identify clusters of US and Canadian metropolitan areas with similar knowledge profiles and then to investigate the relationship between two indicators of regional economic development—GDP and income per capita—and a metropolitan area’s assignment to a particular knowledge-based cluster. This analysis extends the literature on the role of knowledge in regional innovation, growth and policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011411949">Machlup, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011411949">Knight, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011411949">OECD, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011411949">Cooke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011411949">Lambooy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011411949">Godin, 2006</xref>). These studies sometimes make a distinction between the ‘knowledge economy’—a concept based on a region’s labour force—and a ‘knowledge-based economy’—a system-based concept (for example, regional innovation system) concerned with knowledge flows among segments of a regional economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011411949">Cooke and Leydesdorff, 2006</xref>). Our analysis of the occupations present in US and Canadian metropolitan areas has a labour force and, thus, a ‘knowledge economy’ emphasis.</p>
<p>The two main research and policy questions addressed by our analysis are: “Do the types of knowledge present in a region affect measures of economic development above and beyond the well-documented effects of educational attainment?”; and, if so, “What types of regional knowledge profiles are positively associated with measures of economic development?”. This enquiry is rooted in previous studies that examined the interrelationships between a region’s knowledge base, and its economy and geography. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011411949">Leydesdorff and Meyer (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011411949">Leydesdorff (2006)</xref> describe this ‘triple helix’ as a system in which a region’s knowledge base and economy are connected through innovations. We would expect differences in the knowledge profiles (i.e. bases) of regions, which are mutually determined in the triple helix framework along with the types of knowledge infrastructure (for example, universities) available in the region, to explain differences in regional economic development indicators.</p>
<p>Our way of conceptualising the knowledge profiles of regions is quite different from how knowledge bases have been examined previously in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011411949">Asheim and Coenen (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011411949">Asheim <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> characterise a region’s knowledge base as ‘analytical’, ‘synthetic’, or ‘symbolic’, depending on whether innovation requires knowledge creation (for example, science-based), applications using available knowledge (for example, engineering-based) or the invention of new images and cultural goods (for example, artistic-based). As a second approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011411949">Lever (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011411949">van Winden <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> use a set of regional attributes (for example, presence of major companies, trade fairs and exhibitions, share of population with tertiary education) to characterise the knowledge bases of European cities. In what follows, we offer a third perspective on examining regional knowledge bases—one in which the cluster analysis provides a way to measure and characterise US and Canadian metropolitan areas according to their knowledge profiles, which cover a wide range of specific subject areas.</p>

<title>2. Knowledge Profiles of US and Canadian Metropolitan Areas</title>
<p>Determining the types of knowledge available in US and Canadian metropolitan areas presents a challenge to empirical researchers because, unlike the approach of measuring ‘generic’ human capital by counting up the number of residents with a college degree, such information is not directly observable. Following the method used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011411949">Feser (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011411949">Abel and Gabe (2011)</xref>, our approach allows us to infer the knowledge present in each metropolitan area using its occupational structure and data on the knowledge requirements of the region’s workforce. Information on the knowledge requirements of occupations is from the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network (O*NET).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011411949">2</xref>
</sup> The O*NET system contains detailed occupational-level data, collected via interviews with incumbent workers and input from professional occupational analysts, about job-related knowledge requirements pertinent to the 33 subjects listed in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref>. These areas cover a wide range of topics from aspects of business (for example, Administrative and management, Sales and marketing) to basic sciences (for example, Physics, Chemistry and Biology) and production-oriented tasks (for example, Food production, Production and processing).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The O*NET survey asks respondents to rate the importance of the knowledge type to their job (for example, on a scale of 1–5) and then rate the level of knowledge needed (for example, on a scale of 1–7). The follow-up question on the ‘level’ of knowledge, which provides a different set of ‘anchors’ for each of the knowledge areas, is only required for types of knowledge that are rated as at least ‘somewhat’ important (i.e. rating of ‘2’ or higher on the first question). For the subject area of Chemistry, as an example, a knowledge level rating of ‘2’ is equivalent to “use a common household bug spray”, a rating of ‘4’ is similar to “use the proper amount of chlorine to purify a water source” and the anchor for a knowledge level of ‘6’ is “develop a safe commercial cleaner”.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref> also shows, as illustrative examples of the information used in the cluster analysis that follows, standardised knowledge scores for several US and Canadian metropolitan areas. We used a four-step process to construct these metropolitan-level knowledge scores. Step one involved calculating occupational-level knowledge indices. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011411949">Feser (2003)</xref>, we constructed these indices as the product of the knowledge importance (i.e. scale of 1–5) and level (i.e. scale of 1–7) ratings for each of the occupations. Step two involved developing knowledge indices for each metropolitan area. These variables are averages of the occupational-level knowledge indices, weighted by the proportion of a metropolitan area’s workforce in each occupation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098011411949">3</xref></sup> Metropolitan area workforce information is from the 2006 Canadian census and the three-year (2005–07) 1 per cent sample of the American Community Survey administered by the US Census Bureau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011411949">Ruggles <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098011411949">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third step involved using the knowledge indices for 255 US and 32 Canadian metropolitan areas to calculate average knowledge scores (and corresponding standard deviations) for each country in each of the 33 subject areas. The final step involved transforming the metropolitan-level indices into standardised knowledge scores, such as those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref>, which are expressed in terms of the number of standard deviations that a metropolitan area lies above (i.e. positive values) or below (i.e. negative values) its national average.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098011411949">5</xref></sup> For example, the information presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref> indicates that Athens, Georgia, has a History and archaeology knowledge score that is 3.51 standard deviations above the mean value across all US metropolitan areas; Toronto has an Economics and accounting knowledge score that is 2.12 standard deviations above the mean value across all Canadian metropolitan areas; and Washington, DC, has a Mechanical knowledge score that is 2.26 standard deviations below the mean value across all US metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>The knowledge profiles shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref> provide a broad view of the types of knowledge that are used in the selected metropolitan areas. Athens, Georgia, has a workforce that is knowledgeable about Education and training, the sciences (for example, Biology and Chemistry), the humanities (for example, History and archaeology, Foreign language and Philosophy and theology) and mental health (for example, Psychology, and Therapy and counselling). These types of knowledge are indicative of the region’s economic identity that is heavily influenced by the presence of the University of Georgia. On the other hand, Calgary is characterised by a workforce that has low knowledge about topics such as Therapy and counselling, Philosophy and theology and History and archaeology, but is highly knowledgeable about Engineering and technology, Mathematics, Physics and Design. Whereas the types of knowledge available in Athens, Georgia, immediately suggest ‘college town’, Calgary’s knowledge profile points to a region that is strong in engineering and technology, presumably related to its energy-based economy.</p>
<p>New York, Toronto and Washington, DC, share the similar traits of high knowledge about Fine arts, Clerical, Communications and media and Economics and accounting. Further, these major metropolitan areas are characterised by low knowledge about Food production, Chemistry and Mechanical (things). However, there are some knowledge areas in which New York and Washington, DC, are quite different from Toronto. New York and Washington, DC, have positive standardised knowledge scores in the areas of Education and training, Geography, History and archaeology, Foreign language, Philosophy and theology, Psychology, Sociology and anthropology and Therapy and counselling, while Toronto has negative standardised knowledge scores in these subject areas. On the other hand, Toronto has a positive knowledge score in the area of Production and processing, while New York and Washington, DC, have negative standardised knowledge scores on this topic. These differences suggest that the New York and Washington, DC, economies have greater emphases on humanities and mental health, whereas Toronto’s workforce is more oriented towards manufacturing-type activities.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref> reveals some interesting differences in the knowledge profiles of New York and Washington, DC. The standardised knowledge scores in the subject areas of Computers and electronics, Design, Engineering and technology, Mathematics and Telecommunications are much higher in Washington, DC, than in New York. On the other hand, the New York workforce is more knowledgeable than its Washington, DC, counterpart in the subject areas of Medicine and dentistry, Psychology and Therapy and counselling. These differences suggest that Washington, DC, has a greater emphasis on technology and engineering (similar to Calgary), while New York’s workforce is more knowledgeable about the areas of physical and mental health.</p>

<title>3. Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>We used the standardised knowledge scores for the 33 subject areas to reduce our sample of 287 US and Canadian metropolitan areas into a smaller set of regions that share similar knowledge traits. To do this, we employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011411949">Ward’s (1963)</xref> hierarchical clustering method that forms groups of metropolitan areas by minimising the sum of the squared differences of their standardised knowledge scores (i.e. similar to the information shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref>) in the 33 subject areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098011411949">6</xref></sup> The method starts by joining the two metropolitan areas with the most similar knowledge profiles into a cluster and then—in subsequent iterations—combines other metropolitan areas with similar knowledge profiles into new clusters or adds places to existing clusters.</p>
<p>As an example, the first two metropolitan areas that were identified as a cluster (i.e. the two places with the greatest similarity in knowledge profiles) were Chicago and Kansas City. In this case, these regions cluster together due to their common high knowledge in commerce (for example, Sales and marketing) and information technology (for example, Computer and electronics, Telecommunications), but relatively low knowledge in the subject areas of Chemistry, Food production, Mechanical (things) and Public safety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098011411949">7</xref></sup> After this first iteration, we went from the original 287 metropolitan areas (i.e. 287 ‘clusters’ made up of one metropolitan area) to 286 clusters: the cluster that combined Chicago and Kansas City, and the remaining 285 metropolitan areas. With each subsequent iteration, the number of clusters falls by one, until all of the metropolitan areas are joined into a single cluster. Choosing the exact number of clusters to maintain is somewhat subjective, depending on the intended use of the information. In our analysis, we found that 11 clusters provided metropolitan area groups with reasonably similar knowledge requirements (based on a diagnostics coefficient that measures the sum of the squared Euclidean distance among the knowledge profiles of clusters) as well as a manageable number of groups for the subsequent analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0042098011411949">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011411949">Table 2</xref> provides names and brief descriptions of these metropolitan area clusters, along with a list of subjects that are characterised as ‘high’ and ‘low’ knowledge. The full list of metropolitan areas in each cluster is provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0042098011411949">Appendix</xref>. A cluster is said to have ‘very high knowledge’ in a particular subject area if the mean value of standardised knowledge scores calculated across its members is greater than 1.0. These knowledge areas are <underline>underlined</underline> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011411949">Table 2</xref>. We refer to a cluster as possessing ‘high knowledge’ about a topic if the mean value of standardised knowledge scores calculated across its members is between 0.5 and 1.0. Clusters that are characterised as ‘very low knowledge’ or ‘low knowledge’ in a particular subject are defined similarly, except they refer to standardised knowledge scores that are, on average, less than -1.0 or between -0.5 and -1.0 respectively.</p>

<p>For example, the cluster of Making regions—described as ‘very high knowledge about manufacturing; very low knowledge about commerce and humanities’—has a workforce characterised by very high knowledge about the subject areas of Mechanical and Production and processing, and very low knowledge about Customer and personal service, English language, Geography and Economics and accounting. This cluster is comprised of metropolitan areas such as Canton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Windsor, Ontario. The metropolitan areas included in the Making regions cluster are generally regarded as some of the more important US and Canadian manufacturing regions.</p>
<p>Whereas the cluster of Making regions contains places with a long history of manufacturing, a group of Teaching regions is made up of mostly ‘college towns’. These metropolitan areas—such as Bloomington, Indiana; Columbia, Missouri; and Kingston, Ontario—are characterised by very high knowledge about subjects such as Education and training, Biology, Chemistry, History and archaeology and Philosophy and theology. In addition, Teaching regions have very low knowledge about Production and processing, and Mechanical (things). The information for Athens, Georgia, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011411949">Table 1</xref> provides a reasonably close representation of the knowledge profiles of the metropolitan areas included in this cluster.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0042098011411949">9</xref></sup> A cluster of Understanding regions is also made up of metropolitan areas (for example, Charlottesville, Virginia; Iowa City, Iowa) that are home to major research universities. This group is characterised by very high knowledge about arts, sciences, humanities and IT; and very low knowledge about manufacturing. These two clusters of primarily college-dominated metropolitan areas differ in that there is a stronger emphasis on the knowledge topics of Fine arts, Medicine and dentistry and IT (i.e. Computers and electronics, Telecommunications) in the Understanding regions.</p>
<p>A cluster of Thinking regions includes the major US metropolitan areas of New York, Philadelphia and San Diego, as well as some smaller places such as Halifax, Nova Scotia; Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Portland, Maine. These regions are characterised by high knowledge about arts, humanities, IT and commerce; and low knowledge about manufacturing. Many of the other major metropolitan areas in our sample—such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Montreal and Toronto—are included in a cluster of Enterprising regions, which are characterised by high knowledge about commerce (for example, Sales and marketing, Economics and accounting, Customer and personal service) and IT (i.e. Computers and electronics, Telecommunications). These groups differ in that the Thinking regions (for example, New York, Philadelphia) have high knowledge in a broader range of topics related to the humanities (for example, Geography, History and archaeology, Philosophy and theology) and mental health (for example, Psychology, Therapy and counselling), while the Enterprising regions (for example, Chicago, Toronto) have deeper knowledge about commerce.</p>
<p>Metropolitan areas such as Anchorage, Alaska; Houston, Texas; Lake Charles, Louisiana; and Oshawa, Ontario; are included in a cluster of Building regions. This group is noted for its very high knowledge about construction and transport, as well as high knowledge about Mechanical (things). Many of the places that make up this cluster serve as key transport hubs (for example, Mobile, Alabama; Saint John, New Brunswick) and some have economies that are dominated by tourism (for example, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Naples, Florida) or energy-related production and distribution (for example, Edmonton, Alberta; Houston, Texas).</p>
<p>A cluster of Innovating regions is made up of metropolitan areas such as Austin, Boston, Seattle and Washington, DC. These places are generally regarded as some of the cities with the highest levels of human capital and innovative activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0042098011411949">10</xref></sup> Indeed, this cluster is characterised by very high knowledge about IT, arts, commerce and engineering. In addition, Innovating regions have high knowledge about education and the humanities (for example, English language, Geography, History and archaeology). Given its strong presence in the humanities, the Innovating regions cluster has high knowledge in many of the same subject areas that are emphasised in Teaching regions (for example, Athens, Georgia; Kingston, Ontario) and Understanding regions (for example, Gainesville, Florida; Rochester, Minnesota). However, the cluster of Innovating regions distinguishes itself with very high knowledge about Engineering and technology, and Economics and accounting. These knowledge areas related to engineering and commerce are less emphasised in the other two clusters of college-oriented metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>High knowledge about IT, commerce and engineering are also defining characteristics of a cluster of Engineering regions, which is made up of metropolitan areas such as Calgary and San Jose. This small group of metropolitan areas is similar to the cluster of Innovating regions (for example, Boston, Ottawa, San Francisco) in its strong emphasis on engineering and science, but it does not have very high knowledge scores in the subject areas of Education and training, History and archaeology and Philosophy and theology. In addition, the metropolitan areas that make up the Engineering regions cluster are characterised by low knowledge about physical (for example, Medicine and dentistry) and mental (for example, Psychology, Therapy and counselling) health.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011411949">Table 3</xref> presents information on average GDP and income per capita—two key indicators of regional economic development—for each of the 11 knowledge-based metropolitan area clusters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0042098011411949">11</xref></sup> In addition, the table shows average levels of college attainment for each of the clusters. As with the metropolitan-area-level knowledge scores, the regional economic development indicators and educational attainment data are reported as standardised values, which are interpreted as the number of standard deviations that a metropolitan area falls above (i.e. positive values) or below (i.e. negative values) its national average. For example, the average GDP per capita value of 1.22 for the cluster of Innovating regions suggests that the metropolitan areas in this group have, on average, productivity figures that are 1.22 standard deviations above the mean calculated across all of the metropolitan areas in the same nation.</p>

<p>Figures shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011411949">Table 3</xref> suggest that the clusters of Engineering and Innovating regions have the highest values of GDP and income per capita among the 11 knowledge-based metropolitan area clusters.

<p>We can use the results from the regression analysis to answer the two questions posed about the relationship between measures of economic development and the knowledge bases of regions. The first question of whether the types of knowledge present in a region have an effect on economic development above and beyond the effects of educational attainment is addressed by comparing regression models that differ only by the inclusion of a set of dummy variables indicating a metropolitan area’s cluster assignment. The second question regarding the types of knowledge profile that are positively associated with measures of regional economic development is addressed by examining the regression coefficients that correspond to the knowledge-based cluster dummy variables.</p>
<p>Results from the model focusing on GDP per capita, without controlling for the knowledge-based clusters, suggest that college attainment and population size have positive and statistically significant effects on regional productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0042098011411949">12</xref></sup> A one standard deviation increase in the share of the metropolitan area population with a college degree is associated with a 0.52 standard deviation increase in GDP per capita. A similar increase in population size is associated with a 0.24 standard deviation increase in GDP per capita. The adjusted <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> of 0.396 suggests that the educational attainment and population size variables explain about 40 per cent of the variation observed in regional productivity.</p>
<p>In the model that includes the fixed effects indicating a metropolitan area’s knowledge-based cluster, the effect associated with a one standard deviation increase in college attainment rises from a 0.52 to a 0.60 standard deviation increase in regional productivity. In addition, the model’s goodness of fit (i.e. adjusted <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) increases from 0.396 to 0.470, which suggests that educational attainment, population size and the knowledge-based cluster assignments collectively explain almost one-half of the variation observed in GDP per capita. Regression results pertaining to the measure of regional income per capita reveal similar patterns. Importantly, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098011411949">Table 4</xref>, F-tests of joint variable significance show that the knowledge-based clusters, as a group, have a statistically significant effect on per capita GDP and income.</p>
<p>Estimated coefficients corresponding to the knowledge-based clusters suggest that, controlling for the share of residents with a college degree and population size, Engineering regions have significantly higher levels of productivity and income than places in the other knowledge-based clusters. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011411949">Florida <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011411949">Beckstead <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> found that engineering-related occupations have a high association with regional development and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011411949">Gabe (2009)</xref> uncovered positive private and external (i.e. spillover effects) returns associated with engineering-based knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0042098011411949">13</xref></sup> Estimated coefficients corresponding to Building, Enterprising and Making regions suggest that metropolitan areas in these groups also have at least one measure of regional economic development that is significantly higher, controlling for differences in college attainment and population size, than places in the other knowledge-based clusters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, regression results suggest that Teaching and Understanding regions have significantly lower levels of productivity and income per capita than other places with similar levels of college attainment and population size. In previous studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011411949">Abel and Gabe (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011411949">Florida <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> found that—whereas the end-result of a college education increases productivity—the presence of educators in a region does not enhance indicators of economic development. Explanations for these findings are that some places dominated by large universities (i.e. high knowledge about Education and training) may have smaller shares of residents engaged in other productive activities, and—in a study of the knowledge bases of European cities—some places (for example, ‘Intellectuals’) with strong universities may lack “a knowledge-intensive business sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011411949">van Winden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, p. 540). Results from the fixed-effects models also suggest that, controlling for educational attainment and population size, Working and Comforting regions have less favourable indicators of regional economic development than the other knowledge-based clusters.</p>
<p>Our fixed-effects results corresponding to the Innovating, Teaching, Understanding and Engineering regions demonstrate the utility of the knowledge-based clusters at differentiating levels of regional economic development across places with high levels of education. According to the figures shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011411949">Table 3</xref>, these clusters have the highest average shares of college attainment; yet the economic development indicators vary widely among these clusters. As noted earlier, the clusters of Innovating and Engineering regions have the highest average values of GDP and income per capita. On the other hand, the Teaching and Understanding regions, despite their high levels of college attainment, have productivity and income figures that are in the middle to the bottom of the pack among the 11 knowledge-based clusters.</p>
<p>In our regression analysis of regional economic development, we found positive estimated coefficients on the fixed effects corresponding to Engineering regions, while the clusters of Teaching and Understanding regions are associated with lower levels of productivity and income per capita. The Innovating regions are about where you would expect in terms of these indicators, given the share of the population with a college degree. Assignment to this cluster is associated with a 0.070 standard deviation decrease in output per capita and a 0.046 standard deviation increase in income; neither of these effects is statistically significant. The fact that Teaching and Understanding regions have modest levels of economic development, in light of their high shares of college attainment, helps to explain the increase in the estimated effect of educational attainment on economic development in the fixed-effects regressions. Without accounting for the knowledge-based clusters, the effects of education on economic development are likely to diminish at high levels of college attainment in the Teaching and Understanding regions. After controlling for the fixed effects associated with these and the other clusters, the estimated effects of education on economic development increase markedly.</p>

<title>5. Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>This paper identified clusters of US and Canadian metropolitan areas with similar knowledge profiles and investigated the relationship between two indicators of regional economic development—GDP and income per capita—and a metropolitan area’s assignment to a particular knowledge-based cluster. The clusters provide a useful system for organising metropolitan areas based on a region’s economic identity and the types of knowledge available in the labour force. Many places with a long history of manufacturing (for example, Canton, Ohio; Windsor, Ontario) are clustered in a group of <italic>Making regions</italic>, while places such as Boston, Raleigh-Durham, Ottawa and San Francisco make up a cluster of <italic>Innovating regions</italic>.</p>
<p>Regional analysts and policy-makers can use these clusters to identify ‘peer groups’ with similar knowledge profiles for the purposes of benchmarking or comparing the types of government programme and infrastructure used to support closely related economic activities. For example, officials from Athens, Georgia, would be likely to benefit more from a site visit to State College, Pennsylvania—a fellow Teaching region—than from trying to emulate the policies that are effective in nearby Atlanta. Likewise, officials in Athens would be better off using State College and other Teaching regions as benchmarks to gauge changes in regional economic indicators. These recommendations follow the suggestion, articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011411949">Asheim and Coenen (2005</xref>, p. 1174), that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to developing regional innovation and knowledge economy policies; rather, “a differentiation needs to be made on the basis of a cluster’s knowledge base”.</p>
<p>Yet beyond the utility of the knowledge-based metropolitan area clusters for these purposes, they are used to address two policy and research questions related to the knowledge bases of US and Canadian metropolitan areas: “Do the types of knowledge present in a region affect measures of economic development above and beyond the effects of educational attainment?” and, if so, “What types of regional knowledge profiles are positively associated with measures of economic development?”. Our empirical results show that incorporating fixed effects indicating a metropolitan area’s cluster assignment substantially increases model goodness-of-fit measures (i.e. adjusted <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) compared with regressions that include college attainment as the sole indicator of human capital. These findings as well as F-tests of joint variable significance indicate that the knowledge-based clusters are important predictors, above and beyond shares of college attainment, of regional economic development.</p>
<p>In addition, the fixed-effects regression results identify the types of region that are likely to have levels of economic development that are greater (or less) than others with similar shares of college attainment. Here, our regression results show that Engineering, Building and Enterprising regions are associated with higher levels of productivity and/or income per capita; while Teaching, Understanding, Working and Comforting regions have lower levels of economic development. This does not suggest, for example, that Understanding regions are less productive than Building regions. The cluster of Understanding regions has an average standardised productivity score of 0.31, which is higher than the comparable score (−0.002) for Building regions. However, in the fixed-effects regressions, the association with regional productivity is higher for Building regions (estimated coefficient = 0.389) than Understanding regions (estimated coefficient = −0.760) due to the fact that higher productivity in Understanding regions (compared with Building regions) is explained by the large difference in educational attainment.</p>
<p>Finally, the knowledge-based clusters are especially helpful in understanding differences in the measures of regional economic development across metropolitan areas with similarly high shares of college attainment. Places that are dominated by large universities (for example, Bloomington, Indiana), regions that are noted for vibrant innovative economies (for example, San Francisco) and key engineering and technology centres (for example, San Jose) typically have among the highest levels of college attainment. Our regression models allow us to isolate the effects of education on economic development by controlling for differences in the knowledge profiles of regions. This allows us to make a distinction between, for example, the types of knowledge used by the workforces of ‘college towns’ as compared with places such as Silicon Valley. The end-result is that incorporating information about a region’s knowledge base increases the estimated effects of education on regional productivity and income per capita.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are some study limitations to bear in mind when interpreting these results. While cluster analysis is a well-established methodology, some judgement is necessary in determining the number of clusters to maintain. Thus, it may be possible to come up with different results using a different clustering method or by selecting additional or fewer categories to use in the regression analysis. Hence, another approach might reveal new insights into the relationship between a region’s knowledge base and economic development. Moreover, our analysis takes the types of knowledge present in a metropolitan area as given and does not consider the importance of history or past economic development in shaping each region’s economy, and thus, knowledge profile. While incorporating such information is beyond the scope of the current study, doing so may provide a fruitful path for future research.</p>

<p>Years of education … is a coarse measure of skill: all degrees are not equivalent in terms of the skills they encompass, and all students—even those that graduate from the same institution with the same degree—do not achieve the same level of preparedness upon graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011411949">Ingram and Neumann, 2006</xref>, p. 38).</p>

<p>This calculation required matching occupational categories from the O*NET system, which is based on SOC occupational codes, to those used in the datasets of metropolitan area employment. For the Canadian metropolitan areas, we used an occupational concordance to convert 520 Canadian NOC occupations to 821 US SOC occupational codes. From there, we matched the six-digit SOC occupations to O*NET knowledge scores. For the US metropolitan areas, we matched the O*NET occupations to one of 470 occupations used in the American Community Survey administered by the US Census Bureau.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0042098011411949">

<p>For the Canadian metropolitan areas, 2.7 million dwellings—or 6.5 million individuals—were sampled in the 2006 census long-form that covers 20 per cent of the population. For the US metropolitan areas, the workforce knowledge variables are constructed using individual-level information on 3.7 million workers who are covered in the 2005–07 1 per cent sample of the American Community Survey.</p>

<label>5.</label>
<p>All of the variables used in the paper are expressed as standardised values relative to a metropolitan area’s home country because of differences in US and Canadian occupational categories, slight differences in the time-periods over which information is available and—for variables expressed in dollar terms—differences in US and Canadian currencies.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011411949">Feser (2003)</xref> provides a detailed account of how Ward’s clustering method can be applied to the O*NET knowledge areas.
