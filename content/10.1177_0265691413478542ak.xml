<p>This book tells the stories of six citizens of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) whom the Communist regime considered dissidents or disloyal and who were accordingly made to suffer. With one exception (Robert Havemann), the dissidents are not famous ones. Why Havemann is included in the book is unclear – perhaps because he was such an inspiration to all East German dissidents. The author’s aim is, by telling their stories, to keep understanding of how and why East Germans suffered under Communist dictatorship alive, and, in particular, to transmit this understanding to a younger generation of English speakers with no memory of the GDR. The inspiration for the book was a conference in Berlin in 2003 marking the centenary of George Orwell’s birth. Called ‘Books That Led to Jail’, the conference featured papers by former East German dissidents who had read books forbidden in the GDR and had therefore been arrested and imprisoned by its State Security Ministry (<italic>Ministerium für Staatssicherheit</italic>, or Stasi).</p>
<p>The book is more a work of journalism than one of scholarship. Each profile of a dissident (with the exception of Havemann, who died too early to be interviewed) consists of a mixture of interview and narrative. The book is, therefore, not an analytical study of abuse of human rights in the GDR. The stories it tells are moving ones, but they are not fitted into any satisfactory interpretation of how or why the regime deprived its victims of their human rights and why some East Germans proved willing to engage in dissent when others did not. The dissidents discussed here were either religious or Marxists who thought that the GDR’s ruling party had betrayed Marxism, or, most commonly, just independent-minded.</p>
<p>The author maintains that his aim was simply to ‘let the sufferers speak for themselves’. The book’s chapters contain long passages of dialogue between him and his interviewees, quoted verbatim. Some of his interviewees were resisters. Their acts of resistance were ordinary ones in the Soviet Bloc: photographing and disseminating banned books like Orwell’s <italic>Animal Farm</italic>; receiving banned literature from the West; or smuggling photographs of the demonstrations of autumn 1989 to the West. Other interviewees were free thinkers. One was a Communist party member who was regarded as politically unreliable, denied a university teaching job and forced into secondary school teaching. Another was a schoolteacher who was dismissed because she was a convinced Lutheran. Another was simply unlucky: she just accepted gifts from a West German relative. The author has not checked what he was told by his interviewees, so it is possible that at least some of what they say may be unreliable.</p>
<p>The author’s use of key conceptual terms is loose and unilluminating. He often maintains that the GDR was ‘totalitarian’ and that life in the GDR was ‘Orwellian’. There is no satisfactory analysis of what these terms mean. Totalitarianism is a hotly contested concept and few historians believe that the GDR was genuinely totalitarian according to the criteria developed by such outstanding writers as Hannah Arendt, Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Nor is the term ‘Orwellian’ defined. The occasional comment shows that the author is referring to an abnormal society in which the state persecuted dissidents, censored all forms of expression, lied, indoctrinated its people, destroyed all social bonds between them, deprived them of privacy, and prevented them from thinking for themselves, thus reducing their thoughts to ‘groupthink’. Again, many historians would not accept that the East German Communists achieved such extreme social repression. Many former citizens of the GDR vigorously maintain that life there was much more normal than is suggested by this book, with its frequent references to <italic>1984</italic> and <italic>Animal Farm</italic>. Betrayal of family members to the Stasi was very uncommon; the family was the social unit which best withstood infiltration by the secret police. Most of the victims in this book, as is true of the Stasi’s victims as a whole, were betrayed by friends or acquaintances.</p>
<p>The Communists did not, in fact, stamp out freedom of thought or expression as completely as the author claims; the GDR never became the perfect dictatorship depicted in <italic>1984</italic>. Public expression of views different from those of the Party was often tolerated during phases in the GDR’s life, and particularly in its last years. Nor was surveillance as complete. Despite the Stasi’s army of informers, East Germans built private worlds for themselves. Many were careful about whom they confided their thoughts to, but that is a far cry from ubiquitous spy cameras. Thought remained free; indoctrination cultivated independence of mind.</p>
<p>Rather than being totalitarian, the GDR comes across in this book as it was: a state which insisted on conformity and found out too late that a modern society cannot be governed like that. This book tells the stories of a few brave people who were made to suffer before they found enough allies to force the Communists from power. <italic>Dialectics, Dogmas and Dissent</italic> does make the point that it was precisely the ordinariness of the suffering, frustration and disappointment the book depicts which brought the regime down. Millions of ordinary people with ordinary grievances decided that they had had enough.</p>
