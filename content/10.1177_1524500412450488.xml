<abstract>
<p>The benefits of physical activity (PA) are well recognized. While the benefits of PA contribute to a higher quality of life, physical inactivity remains a population-wide plague around the world. The health risks associated with inactivity are disproportionately high among those with low-incomes. While the barriers hindering an active lifestyle among low-income persons are well known, there is a paucity of literature on the perspectives of those that are providing recreation services to low-income citizens. It is anticipated that understanding the professionals’ perspectives may help refine municipal recreation policies and procedures in order to better reach and serve low-income citizens. This study sought to understand the benefits of and challenges to implementing programs designed for low-income citizens. Framed by social marketing theory, key informant interviews and a focus group were conducted with recreation professionals from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (<italic>N</italic> = 9). Social marketing can be a powerful way to make sense of how policies and programs are positioned by recreation professionals and offered to their less well-resourced patrons. Implications for practice include delivering programs outside of facility walls, using word of mouth as a trusted communication method, developing subsidy policies, seeking external funding sources, and relying on partnerships to facilitate delivery and recruitment. By focusing on the recreation professional, this study reveals the importance of targeting upstream audiences in order to effect change for the end users. Future research in other social service professions might benefit from a similar approach to advancing service delivery.</p>

<p>The benefits of physical activity (PA) are well recognized. Among those benefits that can be attributed to participation in PA are a decreased risk of disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, colon cancer, and osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450488">Dahmann, Wolch, Joassart-Marcelli, Reynolds, &amp; Jerrett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450488">Eyler, Brownson, Bacak, &amp; Housemann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall, Jago, &amp; Fox, 2011</xref>). Further, PA provides psychological benefits such as decreased stress, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412450488">Hausenblas &amp; Fallon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall et al., 2011</xref>). While the benefits of PA contribute to a higher quality of life, physical inactivity remains a population-wide plague around the world: According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524500412450488">World Health Organization (2002)</xref>, 60% of the world’s population is insufficiently active to reap health benefits.</p>
<p>In the United States, fewer than 5% of adults were found to meet national PA recommendations, as measured with accelerometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500412450488">Troiano et al., 2008</xref>). Canadians fare better, though almost half admit to not meeting Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412450488">Gilmour, 2007</xref>), and this was recently confirmed through objective measures of fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450488">Shields et al., 2010</xref>). The health risks associated with inactivity are disproportionately high among those with low-incomes<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1524500412450488">1</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450488">Dahmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412450488">Kumanyika &amp; Grier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are numerous barriers that have been reported to limit the ability of individuals with low-income to participate in PA. These barriers include (among others) a lack of financial resources, time, and affordable transportation, as well as reduced access to child care and inadequate health care coverage (Day, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450488">Frankish, Milligan, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500412450488">Withall, Jago, &amp; Cross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500412450488">Williamson et al., 2006</xref>). The financial difficulties have been exacerbated in recent years with an increase reliance on user fees within the public recreation sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450488">Slack, 2003</xref>). Low-income citizens frequently do not have the discretionary income to pay user fees for recreation and therefore do not use the services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450488">Slack, 2003</xref>). This exclusionary pricing raises fundamental questions about the social purpose of public recreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450488">More &amp; Stevens, 2000</xref>). Where public recreation was historically viewed as a right of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500412450488">Tirone, 2004</xref>) and a service for <italic>all</italic>, the increased reliance on user fees means that the burden of payment will weigh most heavily on those who possess the fewest resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412450488">McCarville, 1995</xref>). Because citizens living in poverty are at greater risk of health inequities by virtue of their life chances and circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450488">Marmot, 2007</xref>), failing to provide affordable and accessible services further compromises their life choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524500412450488">Wharf Higgins, Rickert, &amp; Naylor, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To alleviate this economic burden, attention is focused on the service providers as individuals who must create opportunities for those living in poverty to take part without paying user fees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450488">Burns &amp; Graefe, 2006</xref>). Policy makers and public recreation providers are now encouraged to shift their view of service delivery from that of fun and games to one of an essential service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450488">Tindall, 1995</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412450488">Wharf Higgins and Rickert (2005)</xref> note:<disp-quote>
<p>While it is understandable for recreation centers to include the words “health promotion” or “disease prevention” in their philosophy and mission statements, and a common acknowledgment by the profession that municipal recreation departments are well positioned to play a significant role in this regard, there are few documented examples of how this is realized. (p. 454)</p>
</disp-quote>Indeed, while the barriers hindering low-income citizens from participating in an active lifestyle are frequently documented (though less frequently tended to), the barriers facing those responsible for delivering the services are less well known. Admirably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall et al. (2011)</xref> gathered PA instructors’ perspectives of increasing recruitment and retention of their vulnerable clients, yet understanding practitioners’ professional and organizational boundaries for serving low-income patrons at a structural level represents a gap in the literature. In social marketing terms, practitioners represent an “upstream” segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450488">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>) and serve as gatekeepers to PA opportunities for those who rely on their professional services.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524500412450488">
<title>Purpose Statement</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that low-income groups are faced with many barriers to participation in PA initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412450488">Brownson, Baker, Housemann, Brennan, &amp; Bacak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500412450488">Withall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall et al., 2011</xref>). What remains understudied and thus not well understood is the experience of recreation professionals: what are the benefits of and challenges to implementing programs designed for low-income citizens? What skills or tools do professionals require to engage the hard to reach? What policies or organizational resources best support their work? This study begins to fill the disconnect in the knowledge base and reveals the importance of targeting upstream audiences in order to effect change for end users.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1524500412450488">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>Using social marketing theory and concepts as an orientational framework to inquiry, this study used an exploratory research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450488">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>) in order to define the problem facing recreational professionals in their efforts to serve low-income citizens. Specifically, the aim of this qualitative inquiry was to explore and understand, from the professionals’ perspective, the implementation experience of delivering PA programs and services designed for low-income citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524500412450488">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were nine experienced recreation professionals (eight female, one male) working in municipal recreation centers. Participants were selected using two sampling strategies. First, convenience sampling was used to select only communities that were situated on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Second, critical case sampling was used, as it was assumed that data from one community could be generalized to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450488">Patton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, seven communities were involved in the study with one community having two different people being interviewed and one community having a different representative for the focus group than the interview. Participants were approached if they had self-identified that their organization was targeting low-income citizens in their programs and services. All participants signed an informed consent prior to the interview and focus group and the study was approved through the University of Victoria Board of Ethics prior to data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524500412450488">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Audiotaped key informant interviews were conducted, as the initial method of data collection and each participant was interviewed individually. An interview schedule was used to ensure that the same basic lines of inquiry were followed with each participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450488">Patton, 2002</xref>). To determine the efficacy of the interview schedule, a pilot interview was conducted and revealed the need to adapt the questioning prior to continuing the remaining interviews. Each interview was transcribed verbatim within 1 week of the actual interview. In doing so, adjustments could be made to the line of inquiry if needed prior to the next interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524500412450488">
<title>Focus Group</title>
<p>Following the interviews, four of the eight participants were able to participate in a focus group. Of those that could not attend, busy schedules and conflicting commitments were stated as reasons for their absence. Further, one of the participants who had been interviewed but could not attend sent a representative from her community to participate in the focus group. This focus group was unique in that it utilized an adapted pile sorting group activity that was done to complete a member check and determine whether the initial categories developed from interview data were accurate of the participant’s perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412450488">Colucci, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524500412450488">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis began after the first interview and continued throughout the remainder of the study. After each interview, data were transcribed verbatim and reviewed immediately. Upon completion of the interviews, open coding was completed to create categories that would be used in the focus group activity. Following the focus group, a second data analysis was conducted. First, open coding was conducted to condense the data and restructure the categories based on participant’s feedback. Finally, to make sense of the themes, data were reframed and conceptualized through a social marketing perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412450488">Morse, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-1524500412450488">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the study are presented in relation to the marketing mix, with each theme being placed within one of the P’s.

<title>Product</title>
<p>Participants recognized the inherent value of recreation to contribute to individual’s health and quality of life, and for that reason, they had all chosen to work in the recreation field. The raison d’être of recreation as a profession, or their core product, was the joy and “flow” that leisure can offer everyone. Providing accessible and affordable opportunities for PA and recreation was extremely important to the participants and at the heart of what they do. In addressing the realities of working in the public sector, with reduced budgets and time constraints, participants recognized that in order to reach their entire community, they must go above and beyond the call of duty to resourcefully serve as many low-income citizens as possible. As the primary audience of this study, providing tools, resources, and skills to offer successful programs to a wider reach of low-income citizens will enable them to be better “delivery channels.” The remaining components of the marketing mix (price, place, promotion, and partnerships) are framed and discussed to support the actual and augmented products (the delivery of successful programs to low-income citizens) by offering creative solutions to policy and program delivery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524500412450488">
<title>Price</title>
<p>Participants in the study shared their struggles with exchange. While they placed high value on offering initiatives to low-income citizens, they still had to negotiate various barriers that impeded their ability to reach everyone through their current programs and services. Despite being situated in the public sector, participants worked within a revenue generating and cost-recovery framework of service delivery. Such a business rather than a public service orientation to their work often meant focusing more on revenue production than community development and programming. In addition to the financial constraints associated with offering programs to low-income citizens, participants identified the lack of additional resources, time, and skills as costs associated with this behavior.</p>
<p>Decreasing these costs was fundamental to the participants’ goals of successful service delivery. To alleviate budget constraints, participants became creative and whenever possible did “more with less.” Offering programs free of charge, such as drop-in swimming or special events, creating access to programs and seeking external funding were all strategies that they used to ensure that they could offer meaningful opportunities for low-income citizens while still meeting budgetary goals. Participants acknowledged the importance of partnerships in assisting them in costs associated with time, knowledge, and skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524500412450488">
<title>Place</title>
<p>Participants placed great value on their ability to offer programs and services to low-income citizens and strived to do the best they could with the resources available to them. In their goal to deliver more affordable and accessible recreation opportunities for low-income citizens, participants suggested that focusing on place would be one way to negotiate costs associated with space. Indeed, participants suggested that in order to improve service delivery, they would have to think outside the box, literally. While traditionally recreation has been delivered within the walls of a facility, the use of green space was suggested as one way to improve access. Offering programs in community parks, providing walking and biking guides, and delivering community maps would function to expand delivery space. Encouraging activities with no registration or user costs may be more appealing and convenient to low-income citizens and would incur little cost to the provider. The importance of decentralizing recreation in this way was critical to increasing their capacity to serve “everyone” in their community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524500412450488">
<title>Promotion</title>
<p>The need to provide successful programs to low-income citizens was embedded within the hearts and minds of participants. It simply was part of their professional DNA. As such, participants reflected that the use of various communication channels and persuasive messaging was not necessary. To assist professionals in reaching more low-income citizens, participants recommended facilitating better message delivery and content to the end user and as such, contribute to their capacity to do their job well.</p>
<p>Indeed, recreation professionals acknowledged that traditional messaging was not always appropriate in reaching low-income citizens. To better serve low-income citizens, both the message and the communication channel must be tailored to the desired audience. Participants identified word of mouth, personal connections, and partnerships as ways to effectively reach low-income citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524500412450488">
<title>Partnerships</title>
<p>Community links and partnerships may be the most important “P” of this marketing mix. Perhaps because of the long history of community development in public recreation, participants emphasized the importance of building relationships and forming partnerships with a wide range of organizations and services. In their quest to deliver successful programs to low-income citizens, partnerships will be important in all aspects of service delivery, including price, place, and promotion.</p>
<p>Working with community organizations addressed the issue of price in various ways. Partner organizations were often able to assist with funding of programs and services by offering grants. In addition, with the help of partner organizations, recreation professionals were able to gain knowledge and skills about the low-income citizens in their communities, and how to best address their needs.</p>
<p>Recognizing that all programs and services need not be delivered at the recreation facility, participants were able to work with partner organizations to offer programs and services in different locations throughout the community. In doing so, professionals were able to extend their reach and meet the needs of people they might not otherwise attract to the recreation facility.</p>
<p>With a focus on word of mouth and building relationships as a promotional tool, partnerships became key in message delivery. Many partnership organizations have existing relationships with low-income citizens and are able to communicate directly with them about what is available through the recreation center. Further, partnership organizations can assist the participants in bringing the low-income citizens to the facility, a task that can be difficult with the hardest to reach members of a community.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-1524500412450488">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Engaging <italic>all</italic> citizens in publicly funded recreation opportunities has long been the goal of communities across Canada. Rooted in social reform, public recreation was historically viewed as a right of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500412450488">Tirone, 2004</xref>). Traditionally, recreation was concerned with the urban poor and aimed to provide relief from their everyday life, to make them feel like part of their community, improve their quality of life, and remove any class distinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412450488">Wharf Higgins, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As the findings of this study suggest, the ideology to provide a service for <italic>all</italic> has shifted as municipal recreation and parks services have become more market driven. The pressure to meet budget allocations and bring in revenue has forced professionals to shift their program development and implementation to one of a business. Indeed, an increased reliance has been placed on fees and charges that generate revenue needed to compensate for the decline in government support for recreation services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450488">Godbey, Caldwell, Floyd, &amp; Payne, 2005</xref>). In an attempt to do more with less, recreation now emphasizes the benefits of leisure time, rather than fulfilling a social mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412450488">Wharf Higgins, 2005</xref>). Citizens are now viewed as customers, with recreation departments responding to specific demands and using branding to “sell” their services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450488">Godbey et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The actual product for the primary audience of this study was their ability to offer successful programs and services to low-income citizens. The remaining components of the marketing mix were all developed to support the professionals in achieving this goal. But who are the low-income citizens and how is that defined through the eyes of the participant?</p>
<p>Participants defined a low-income citizen as an individual who was able to meet the needs of daily life, but had little extra for recreation and leisure. When asked to define the poor, participants suggested they were individuals who were living a transient lifestyle and who did not necessarily have a home nor knew where their next meal would come from. The participants of this study recognized that they were not meeting these individuals in the provision of services.</p>
<p>Participants acknowledged that poverty is one of the most influential determinants of health and affects virtually all other determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450488">Reutter, Harrison, &amp; Neufeld, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500412450488">Subramanian &amp; Kawachi, 2006</xref>). The correlation between health and poverty is indisputable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1524500412450488">World Health Organiation, 2003</xref>), a notion that was reinforced by participants of this study. What the participants suggested, however, was that the initiatives and programs they offered through recreation opportunities were not targeted at those they considered “poor,” rather those individuals that they identified as being “low-income.”</p>
<p>Participants of this study identified a gap in their ability to reach <italic>everyone</italic> in their communities. They recognized that their current policies were not serving the homeless nor those they considered “poor,” and they expressed frustration that their current policies did not provide an easy way for low-income citizens to benefit from recreation services.</p>
<p>Participants expressed the importance of public policy as an effective way to address poverty and its health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450488">Reutter et al., 2002</xref>). Currently, however, there is a low degree of government support for poverty reduction initiatives despite economic forecasts that demonstrate considerable savings in health, crime, and economic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412450488">Ivanova, 2011</xref>). Even further down the priority list is recreation programming, as it is not considered an essential service for basic human needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450488">Reutter et al., 2002</xref>). Participants identified the lack of policies available as a limiting factor to the provision of services to low-income citizens. Indeed, there are few policies available and little research has been conducted on how these policies can support public sector professionals in subsidizing and assisting low-income citizens.</p>
<p>To engage low-income citizens in recreation opportunities, participants acknowledged they had to use unconventional strategies to reach a broader group of individuals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450488">Withall et al. (2011)</xref> recommend emphasizing word-of-mouth strategies will improve service providers’ communication efforts. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412450488">Lagarde and Gendron (2011)</xref> note in reference to low-income parents, they “are not ‘hard to reach’ but rather they can be hard <italic>for us</italic> to reach” (p. 98). To extend their reach and facilitate word-of-mouth promotion, professionals conducted much of their work with the support of community partnerships. By collaborating with others, professionals were able to access facilities, resources, funding opportunities, and a range of expertise and services not available through recreation facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450488">Lagarde, Doner, Donovan, Charney, &amp; Grieser, 2005</xref>). As indicated in the literature, as recreation departments are faced with increased economic pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450488">Frisby &amp; Hoeber, 2002</xref>), the use of partnerships gives recreation professionals the ability to stretch staff, equipment, and finances to be able to do more with their programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412450488">Mowen &amp; Kerstetter, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It was through successful partnerships, and their ability to be creative, that professionals were able to negotiate the challenges of reaching low-income citizens. Traditionally, recreation services have been facility-bound due to the large amount of resources spent on creating infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450488">Kaczynski, 2008</xref>). Participants recognized that to reach low-income citizens, their services would need to fit easily into their lives and require little extra effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524500412450488">Strand, Rothschild, &amp; Nevin, 2004</xref>). To do so, the professionals did not rely solely on the use of recreation facilities, rather they identified programs and services such as walking trails, the use of public parks, and recreation outreach programs as viable approaches to service delivery. As Doner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450488">Lotenburg (2010)</xref> notes, “If you begin your planning process by considering place, you are more likely to identify the best intervention points” (p. 134). Akin to the settings-based notion in health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500412450488">World Health Organization [WHO], 1988</xref>), a focus on place makes recreating convenient, accessible, appealing, and appropriate. Other innovative studies have demonstrated the profound influence of place on behavior change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412450488">Linnan et al., 2001</xref> and the BEAUTY study). Perhaps most importantly for low-income citizens, because tending to Place “widens the focus beyond the individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450488">Lotenburg, 2010</xref>, p. 131), it returns the recreation professional to their historical community development roots and address the social determinants of health.</p>
<p>Reaching low-income citizens has been identified as a challenge and limiting factor to the success of the recreation professionals. Partnering with community organizations that have relationships with marginalized populations and encouraging these individuals to build on their own social networks is a strategy for broadening reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412450488">Frisby &amp; Millar, 2002</xref>) and was adopted by participants of this study.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>A notable strength of this study is its conceptual use of social marketing in framing the structure of the research questions, sample, data collection, data analyses, and results. Positioning the study from the perspective of the recreation provider is unique and argues for the importance of market research with other “upstream” audiences.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study include its small and convenient sample with practitioners whose experiences reflected their specific organizational work environments. As such, the findings may not be relevant for other Canadian or North American populations. Further, while this study begins the formative research process, similar to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450488">McDermott et al. (2005)</xref>, engaging more and diverse upstream stakeholders (e.g., local and state government officials, public health staff, and like-minded community partners) is needed to fully develop a social marketing campaign that facilitates recreation practitioners in reaching and serving low-income citizens.</p>

<sec id="section16-1524500412450488">
<title>Implications for Social Marketing</title>
<p>We concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500412450488">Lee and Kotler (2009)</xref>, who argue that social marketing has a significant role to play in helping to end poverty. Following the advice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500412450488">Thackeray (2010)</xref>, our target audience was selected to comprise recreation professionals, those tasked with serving the underprivileged, rather than vulnerable citizens themselves. In doing so, we sought to understand how a social marketing orientation can elucidate their exchange transaction and might mitigate system-wide obstacles and empower professionals to act on their values. In exchange for acting on the traditional tenets of public recreation, participants identified that they are rewarded intrinsically when they go above and beyond their written job descriptions. This study has indicated that in order to better serve low-income citizens in our communities, we must first support the individuals that are providing the service. Key recommendations include:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Future PA interventions should place a focus on using outdoor facilities such as parks, trails, and green spaces rather than indoor facilities such as community recreation centers. Policies need to be created so that recreation professionals can continue to create programs and services that are out in the community rather than within the walls of the recreation facility.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Future research is needed to explore the impact of recreation on homeless people, including how to ensure that public recreation is able to bridge the gap from serving “low-income” to serving the “poor.”</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Future policies must reflect the notion that public recreation is a service available to all segments of society; otherwise recreation centers run the risk of imitating the private sector and lose the ability to support and facilitate community development initiatives. This will require subsidy policies (e.g., applying market price to popular programs or using cafeteria profits to fund programs for citizens with less disposable incomes) that are tailored and appropriate for diverse municipal recreation systems.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Increased access to funding opportunities (i.e., state-level, charitable, corporate) for the provision of services for low-income citizens would be widely appreciated and support the recreation professionals in their valuable work.</p>
<p>In responding to the changing needs of citizens and the field of recreation, highlighted by the experiences of participants in this study, public recreation attempts to keep pace despite a dwindling public purse. Adopting a social marketing mind-set revealed the many reasons why professionals view the provision of services to low-income and poor (homeless) individuals as so important to the health of individuals and society. It may be that target audiences viewed as possessing intractable health and social behaviors are simply not the most appropriate priority markets to reach. Rather, as we have discovered, it may be that professionals and service providers offer the most salient insights and strategies, as they occupy the interim delivery portals. Certainly, other human and social service professions might benefit from a similar approach to advancing service delivery.</p>

<p>Although there is no official definition of low income in Canada, Low Income Cut Offs (LICOs) are commonly used. LICOs are based on family expenditure data. Below the LICO, families will spend a larger share of income for food, shelter, and clothing than the average family. In 2010, the LICO for a family of four living in a metropolitan center was $29,996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450488">Statistics Canada, 2011</xref>). </p>
