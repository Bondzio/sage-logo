<abstract>
<p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with impaired processing and regulation of emotions. A vast body of research has elucidated the altered neural processes that occur in response to emotional stimuli, while little is known about anticipatory processes. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation during the presentation and anticipation of negative stimuli. Furthermore, we examined the effects of an 8-week antidepressant treatment with escitalopram. We matched 12 unmedicated MDD patients and 12 healthy control participants to perform a task involving affective pictures. The design of our event-related task consisted of presenting positive, negative, and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) across two runs and under opposite conditions. For the ‘expected’ condition, the pictures were cued by a word indicating their emotional valence; whereas the ‘unexpected’ condition had a combination of random letters precede the emotion picture. MDD patients displayed greater amygdala activation when anticipating negative pictures and greater prefrontal activation when confronted with them without the anticipatory cues. After antidepressant treatment, both amygdala and prefrontal activation decreased significantly in the treated MDD patients relative to controls. These findings show that the neural mechanisms of emotion anticipation and processing are altered in patients with MDD and that these alterations are able to normalize after treatment with an antidepressant.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cognitive models of depression predict that depressed individuals are characterized by negative biases in all aspects of information processing, including perception, attention, memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112450779">Beck, 1976</xref>) and thinking about the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112450779">Abrahamson et al., 1978</xref>). These theoretical predictions are supported by empirical studies especially in regard to biased retrieval processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112450779">Watkins et al., 1996</xref>), attention towards sad faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112450779">Gotlib et al., 2004</xref>) and anticipation of future events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112450779">Cropley and MacLeod, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent functional imaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of the anticipation of and response to aversive stimuli. This research was mainly directed towards perceptual biases in depressed individuals: an often replicated result is increased amygdala activation during the presentation of negative emotional stimuli, for example, while being presented with sad facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450779">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112450779">Surguladze et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112450779">Suslow et al., 2010</xref>), negative words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112450779">Siegle et al., 2002</xref>) and negative affective pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112450779">Anand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112450779">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>). Successful antidepressant treatment has accordingly been associated with normalization of amygdala activation during the presentation of emotional stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450779">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112450779">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112450779">Sheline et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of the prefrontal cortex in emotion perception in depression is less clear. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112450779">Davidson et al. (2003)</xref> report hypoactivation of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), there is also evidence for increased activation of prefrontal regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112450779">Anand et al., 2005</xref>), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112450779">Anand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112450779">Johnstone et al., 2007</xref>) and dorsal ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112450779">Beauregard et al., 2006</xref>) during the presentation of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals. Mayberg’s limbic-cortical dysregulation model based on evidence from a series of positron emission tomographic (PET) studies is consistent with the findings of decreased activation in dorsal neocortical regions such as the DLPFC and dorsal ACC; and increased activation in paralimbic regions such as the insula, amygdala and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112450779">Mayberg, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112450779">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Until now, relatively few functional imaging studies have investigated anticipation of emotion in depression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112450779">Abler et al. (2007)</xref> report increased activation within the sublenticular extended dorsal amygdala (SLEA) bilaterally in depressed individuals during the expectation of negative stimuli.</p>
<p>Altered neural activation patterns during the anticipation and presentation of emotional events in depressed individuals could result from deficits in emotion regulation. Gross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112450779">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112450779">2002</xref>) shows that efficient emotion regulation, namely reappraisal, can have its onset in anticipation of the emotional event and precedes the emotional response. It diminishes the negative emotional experience and the subsequent emotional reaction. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112450779">Ochsner et al. (2002)</xref> investigated the neural correlates of reappraisal, which are increased for the lateral and medial prefrontal regions, but decreased for the amygdala and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112450779">Gross and John (2003)</xref> indicate that depressed individuals are impaired in adequately regulating emotions. Suppression of an emotional reaction only changes the behavioural response, while the physiological parameters such as heart rate, skin conductance and blood pressure remain unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112450779">Gross, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we assessed neural activation during anticipation of and response to unpleasant stimuli, in order to examine the neural correlates of impaired processing of emotions during depression. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of an 8-week course of antidepressant therapy with escitalopram on emotion processing. Based on previous research and Mayberg’s limbic-cortical dysregulation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112450779">Mayberg, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112450779">2003</xref>), we predicted that depressed individuals would display greater amygdala activation during anticipation of and response to negative stimuli as compared to control participants, while displaying reduced activation in the prefrontal regions: OFC, MPFC, DLPFC and dorsal ACC. In addition, in line with other treatment studies on depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450779">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112450779">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112450779">Sheline et al., 2001</xref>), we expected normalization of these dysfunctions after antidepressant treatment with escitalopram.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881112450779">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited twelve unmedicated patients (mean age 43.5 ± 11.5 years; all right handed; 7 were men) who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression, and were to receive treatment in the Psychiatric Department of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin from both the inpatient and outpatient centers of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, on the Charité Mitte campus.</p>
<p>All participants were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID I/II). The patients and their chosen matched controls had no personal nor family history of other axis I or II disorders. Also, the controls were chosen to have no personal nor family history of depressive disorder. Patients were included in the study if their score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was 16 or higher. In addition, they completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).</p>
<p>Control participants were matched to the patients for gender, age, verbal IQ measured with the Wortschatztest (WST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112450779">Schmidt and Metzler, 1992</xref>) and smoking habits. Further, patients and controls did not differ significantly in the completed years of education (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112450779">Table 1</xref>). These controls were recruited through an advertisement on the Charité - Universitätsmedizin intranet. All participants gave written informed consent to take part in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</p>

<p>Exclusion criteria for all participants were: any medical condition that might interfere with the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination (e.g., claustrophobia, a pacemaker, or head injury), as well as left-handedness.</p>
<p>At the time of the first assessment (T1), patients and controls were under no psychotropic medication and had no severe medical disorders. We made sure to recruit only medication-naive patients or patients that having withdrawn from medications, were free from them for at least a minimum of four drug half-lives.</p>
<p>Depressed patients underwent their first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning session prior to commencing treatment with escitalopram. For treatment thereafter, these patients received 5 mg of the drug in the morning for the first 3 days, and an additional 5 mg every 3 days until a therapeutically effective dose was reached (mean dose = 18.8 ± 6.4 mg; range: 10-30 mg). The second scanning appointment (T2) was scheduled 6 ± 2 weeks later for both depressed and healthy participants. The average number of days between the two scanning appointments did not differ significantly between depressed patients and healthy controls (interval for the MDD patients: mean = 59 ± 13.1 days; controls: mean = 58 ± 15.9 days; <italic>p</italic> = 0.868).</p>
<p>Antidepressant treatment response was defined as a HRSD score ≤ 7 or a HRSD score reduction ≥ 50% at the second measurement point (Mayberg et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Control participants underwent the same study procedures, with the exception of the antidepressant treatment. None of the controls reported clinically relevant symptoms of MDD at the current time, nor within their lifetime. All 24 of the study participants completed the assessment with the Structural Clinical Interview, BDI and HRSD before each fMRI session.</p>

<title>The Affective Pictures Paradigm</title>
<p>The Affective Pictures Paradigm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112450779">Friedel et al., 2009</xref>) was used for emotional stimulation and consisted of positive, negative and neutrally-affecting pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112450779">Lang et al. (1999)</xref>. This was used across two runs, each containing 54 pictures (18 from each category: positive, negative and neutral; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112450779">Figure 1</xref>). The pictures were presented for the duration of 2 s in random order, with a randomly jittered inter-trial interval of 1.6 to 3 s. A cue appeared 3 s before each picture for only 500 ms, followed by a fixation cross. In one of the two runs, the pictures were cued by a word indicating their emotional valence (e.g., the ‘expected’ condition words: positive, negative or neutral), whereas in the other run, only a combination of random letters preceded the emotional picture (‘dghntfu’, which we refer to as the ‘unexpected’ condition). The two runs were counterbalanced across subjects, to exclude any effects of temporal order of picture exhibition to the participants.</p>

<p>Participants were instructed to passively view the stimuli, because active emotional rating tasks are shown to influence amygdalar activation in response to aversive pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112450779">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). To ensure the participants’ attention to the given task, they were asked to confirm every viewed picture with a button pressed by their right thumb. After the scanning session, the study participants rated the valance and arousal felt upon viewing each picture, using a scale from 1 to 9 (1 = unpleasant/not arousing; 9 = very pleasant/very arousing).</p>

<title>fMRI acquisition</title>
<p>The procedures for the pre- and post-treatment scanning sessions were identical for all participants. After completing the clinical questionnaires, we acquired each patient’s MRI data on a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Magnetom Vision®, Siemens, Erlangen), equipped with a circularly polarized head coil (DP-Headcoil). The functional data, consisting of echo-planar images (EPI), were collected in two runs having 290 functional images per run (settings: ascending sequential acquisition, 24 slices with 0.3 mm gap, TR 2300 ms, TE 40 ms, flip angle 90°, matrix = 64 x 64 and voxel size 4 x 4 x 3.3 mm).</p>
<p>For an anatomical reference, a 3D MPRAGE (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo) image data set was acquired (settings: TR=9.7 ms, TE = 4 ms, flip angle 12°, matrix = 256 x 256 and voxel size 1 x 1 x 1 mm). Head movement was minimized using a vacuum pad.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The fMRI data were pre-processed and analysed by SPM5 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>). We excluded the first three volumes and realigned the images to the first of the remaining images to correct for head motion between the scans. Image normalization was performed with the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) template provided by SPM. The normalized functional data from each subject were smoothed with an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.</p>
<p>The data were analysed using the general linear model (GLM) approach, as implemented in SPM5 at two levels (The Welcome Department of Imaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In the participant specific first level analysis we included picture valences (negative, positive, or neutral) given for expected and unexpected pictures, as well as the different cues we provided (negative, positive, neutral, or meaningless cue) as the explanatory variables in the model. All events were modelled as delta functions convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, as provided by SPM5.</p>
<p>The contrast images from the first-level analysis of each participant were then subjected to second-level analysis to gain statistical inferences at the group level.</p>
<p>Group analysis was performed separately for the anticipation and presentation phases. In order to analyse group differences during the anticipation period, images resulting from the contrasts positive cue, negative cue and neutral cue were subjected to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the within-subject factor condition (positive, negative and neutral cue) and the between-subject factor group (controls <italic>versus</italic> MDD patients). Analogously, we computed a mixed ANOVA for the presentation phase with the contrast images (positive uncued pictures, positive cued pictures, negative uncued pictures, negative cued pictures, neutral uncued pictures, and neutral cued pictures) with picture valance (positive, negative and neutral pictures), as the within-subject factor, and group (control <italic>versus</italic> MDD) as a between-subject factor.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the neural differences for the perception of emotion-based word cues and emotional pictures, we computed the following t-contrasts for the whole sample: negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral cue and negative uncued <italic>versus</italic> neutral uncued pictures. We also performed an exploratory analysis for positive cues and pictures and reported the results of these <italic>t</italic>-contrasts, (positive <italic>versus</italic> neutral cue and positive <italic>versus</italic> neutral pictures), at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and FDR-corrected, seen in the supplementary section of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding our <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses about altered anticipation and perception of negative emotions in MDD, we computed the <italic>t</italic>-contrasts ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral cue’ for the anticipation period and ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral pictures’ for the subsequent presentation phase.</p>
<p>To assess the changes in neural activation between the first and second measurement points (T1 and T2), we computed mixed ANOVAs for anticipation and presentation as described above, but with the additional within-subject factor, time (T1 <italic>versus</italic> T2). In order to reveal neural changes between T1 and T2 that were specific to the MDD group, we used the <italic>a priori</italic> defined interaction term (MDD patients T1 &gt; T2) - (controls T1 &gt; T2).</p>
<p>Effects within our <italic>a priori</italic> defined prefrontal regions of interest (ROI) are reported at a statistical threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.005 and ≥10 voxels per cluster (for similar approaches, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112450779">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112450779">Simmons et al., 2008</xref>). Due to the small sample size, but at the same time a strong <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis with regard to increased amygdala activation in patients with MDD relative to controls, we chose a lower statistical threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05 and ≥5 voxels per cluster (for similar approaches see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112450779">Hariri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112450779">Jones et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the changes in neural activation from T1 to T2, we drew a 6 mm sphere around the peak activated voxel at T1 and then performed a small-volume correction for multiple comparisons within this sphere, using false discovery rate (FDR) as implemented in SPM5, with a significance level of <italic>p FDR</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>The ROIs (amygdala, MPFC, OFC, DLPFC and dorsal ACC) were defined using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmri.wfubmc.edu">http://www.fmri.wfubmc.edu</ext-link>). Transformation of MNI to Talairach coordinates was performed with the script ‘mni2tal’ provided by Matthew Brett (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/MniTalairach">http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/MniTalairach</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Psychopathology was assessed with the HRSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112450779">Hamilton, 1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112450779">1967</xref>) and BDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112450779">Hautzinger et al., 1994</xref>). At T1, all the patients were moderately to severely depressed (HRSD: 21.2 ± 4.2; BDI: 26.0 ± 9.6; 10 of the 12 patients had recurring depression). At T1, BDI scores differed significantly between MDD patients and controls (MDD: 26.0 ± 9.6; CON: 5.2 ± 3.7; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). By T2, depression severity decreased significantly in the MDD patients treated with escitalopram (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, HRSD <italic>t</italic> = 4.01; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and BDI <italic>t</italic> = 4.24; all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, 9 out of 12 patients had a clinically significant response ( ≥ 50% reduction of the HRSD score; for 6 patients, the T2 HRSD score was ≤ 7). The remaining 3 patients were classified as non-responders to that drug and/or dose.</p>

<title>Behavioral data</title>
<p>The demographic and symptom characteristics of the MDD patient and control groups are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112450779">Table 1</xref>. With regard to the subjects’ picture rating, we performed two repeated-measure ANOVAs separately, for valence and arousal scales, with the between-subject factor group (MDD patients <italic>versus</italic> controls) and the within-subject factors of time (T1 <italic>versus</italic> T2) and picture category (positive, negative, or neutral). The picture valence ANOVA revealed only a significant main effect based on picture category (<italic>F</italic> = 62.6; <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; <italic>Eta</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.92). The picture arousal ANOVA revealed there was a significant main effect of picture category (<italic>F</italic> = 49.2; <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; <italic>Eta</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.89), and a trend toward a significant main effect of time (<italic>F</italic> = 3.5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.083; <italic>Eta</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.21). Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between picture category and time (<italic>F</italic> = 5.8; <italic>p</italic> = 0.017; <italic>Eta</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.49). Post-hoc, only two sample <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed there was a significant group difference between the MDD patients and controls at T1, in the arousal ratings for neutral pictures: MDD patients rated the neutral pictures as more arousing, compared to the controls (MDD: mean = 4.0; SD = 1.41 and controls: mean = 2.5; SD = 1.5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Post-hoc paired sample <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed a significant change in perceived arousal in the MDD group relative to the controls, from T1 to T2 (T1: 4.0 ± 1.5; T2: 2.2 ± 1.1; <italic>t</italic> = 3.9; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004).

<title>Brain activation during anticipation</title>

<title>Brain activation during presentation</title>
<p>For the contrast ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral pictures’ the healthy controls showed increased activation in the middle occipital gyrus (<italic>t</italic> (110) = 3.2; <italic>x</italic> = −51, <italic>y</italic> = −74 and <italic>z</italic> = 10; 24 voxels; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, uncorrected) and in the middle temporal gyrus (<italic>t</italic> (110) = 3.0; <italic>x</italic> = 60, <italic>y</italic> = −62 and <italic>z</italic> = 7; 29 voxels; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, uncorrected; see Supplementary Table 2).</p>
<p>To test our <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses, we further analysed group differences in the contrast ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral pictures’.

<p>A repeated-measure ANOVA with the additional factor of time (T1 <italic>versus</italic> T2) for the presentation phase revealed significant changes in activation of all the prefrontal areas that had shown a greater activation in the MDD group, at baseline, within the contrast ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral pictures’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881112450779">Figure 3</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2).

<p>Exploratory whole brain analysis results for the contrast ‘positive <italic>versus</italic> neutral pictures’ are given in the supplementary section (see Supplemenatry Table 3).</p>
<p>For the presentation phase, we tested for whether the increased prefrontal activation during the perception of negative stimuli was correlated with depression symptom severity (using HRSD and BDI scores). We extracted the patients’ (i.e., beta values) peak activated voxels from the bilateral DLPFC (left hemisphere: <italic>x</italic> = −42, <italic>y</italic> = 38 and <italic>z</italic> = 15; right hemisphere: <italic>x</italic> = 42, <italic>y</italic> = 38 and <italic>z</italic> = 15), the right lateral OFC (<italic>x</italic> = 39, <italic>y</italic> = 35 and <italic>z</italic> = −9) and the right medial OFC (<italic>x</italic> = 15, <italic>y</italic> = 29 and <italic>z</italic> = −9) and then correlated them with HRSD and BDI global scores, using Pearson’s linear correlation coefficients. To analyse the association between treatment response and the normalization of activation in the PFC, we correlated the differences between the prefrontal areas at T2 <italic>versus</italic> T1, with the differences in symptom severity between T1 and T2. Significance was not reached in the correlations between prefrontal activation and symptom severity at T1, nor between treatment response and normalization of prefrontal activation.</p>
<p>Further, we report the distinct neural activation patterns for the perception of emotion labels and emotional pictures, resulting from the <italic>t</italic>-contrasts ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral cue’ and ‘negative uncued <italic>versus</italic> neutral uncued pictures’ for the whole sample, in the paper’s supplementary section (Supplementary Table 3.1 and Supplementary Table 3.2). We found smaller activations for the anticipation phase ‘negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral cue’ than for the picture presentation ‘negative uncued <italic>versus</italic> neutral uncued pictures’. We therefore report activated clusters in both contrasts, at a more lenient threshold (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 uncorrected).</p>

<p>In this study, we found significantly increased amygdala activation in anticipation of negative pictures in our depressed patients relative to matched healthy control subjects. The amygdala activation decreased significantly from the first to the second measurement after, antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, depressed patients showed a significantly increased prefrontal activation in response to negative pictures, namely in the bilateral DLPFC, right lateral OFC and in the right medial OFC. Similarly to the anticipation period, we found a significant decrease in activation of all of the above-mentioned prefrontal regions from the first to the second measurement point, in the depressed patients relative to the controls. Furthermore, we did not find a significant correlation between symptom severity and amygdalar activation in the anticipation period, nor with the PFC activation in the presentation period in the patient group, nor did we find significant correlations between treatment response and changes in activation of the above-mentioned regions.</p>
<p>Increased amygdala activation in depressed patients is in line with the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112450779">Abler et al. (2007)</xref> and with our <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112450779">Abler et al. (2007)</xref> suggests, increased amygdalar responses upon the expectation of aversive pictures in depressed patients could represent a higher than usual assignment of salience to stimuli announcing negative events. Cognitive theories postulating that depressed individuals are characterized by negative biases in all aspects of information processing support this interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112450779">Beck, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112450779">Abrahamson et al., 1978</xref>). A possible explanation would be that healthy controls, unlike depressed patients, might succeed in down-regulating their emotions in anticipation of the negative stimuli, possibly in the sense of developing an individual expectation coping strategy, and therefore not showing any significantly increased amygdalar activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112450779">Herwig et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings of increased activation in both the precentral and medial cingulate gyrus in anticipation of negative events in healthy participants are in line with research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112450779">Herwig et al. (2007)</xref>, and further supporting our interpretation. Because we did not assess emotion regulation strategies per se, other explanations could also be possible, for example, it may be equally likely that depressed patients simply pay more attention to negative cues than control subjects, because they are more salient to them.</p>
<p>A change in amygdala activation from the first to the second measurement point within the whole sample of depressed patients and a similar trend in treatment responders is in line with a number of studies showing reduced amygdala activation after successful antidepressant therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450779">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112450779">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112450779">Sheline et al., 2001</xref>). One criticism here might be that the depressed patients were treated with escitalopram, but the control participants were not. Escitalopram has been shown to have an effect on the processing of emotions in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112450779">Alves-Neto et al., 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112450779">Arce et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the presentation phase, the healthy control group showed stronger activation of the middle occipital gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus, both areas which are strongly associated with visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112450779">Ganis et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, the middle temporal gyrus is an important component of the neural network involved in social perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112450779">Alisson et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to group differences for negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral stimuli, we could not find the expected increase in amygdala activation in the depressed patients. Prior research shows that in depressed patients, there is greater amygdala activation in response to negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral stimuli, using both facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450779">Fu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112450779">Surguladze et al., 2005</xref>) and pictures obtained from the IAPS inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112450779">Anand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112450779">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>). A possible reason why we did not find greater amygdala activation in the presentation phase could be the preceding cue. None of the above-mentioned studies reporting greater amygdalar activation have incorporated an anticipation period into their paradigms. In our study, regardless of whether a cue or a non-word was displayed, the participants understood that this phase preceded the presentation of positive, negative or neutral events. This knowledge alone might have made the subsequent pictures more expected. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112450779">Abler et al. (2007)</xref> also found increased amygdala activation in the anticipation phase only, but not during a subsequent presentation of negative pictures.</p>
<p>Contrary to our hypothesis, we found there was increased prefrontal activation in the DLPFC, and lateral and medial OFCs in MDD patients relative to controls, in response to pictures eliciting negative emotional responses. Our hypothesis was based on findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112450779">Davidson et al. (2003)</xref>, who found prefrontal hypoactivation in depressed patients in response to negative stimuli, and whose results were in line with a number of PET studies. One example is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112450779">Mayberg et al. (1994)</xref>, who showed there is reduced regional cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal structures of depressed patients.</p>
<p>However, there is conflicting evidence with regard to prefrontal hypoactivation. Our findings do replicate research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112450779">Anand et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112450779">Johnstone et al. (2007)</xref>, whose studies also report increased prefrontal activation in response to negative <italic>versus</italic> neutral stimuli sourced from the IAPS inventory. A possible interpretation of our findings could be that emotion-regulating mechanisms in depressed patients are delayed and more maladaptive. Suppression, as an emotion regulation strategy, is shown to be maladaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112450779">Gross, 2002</xref>) and is positively correlated with depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112450779">Gross and John, 2003</xref>). Voluntary suppression of negative emotions has been associated with increased activation of prefrontal areas such as the DLPFC and the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112450779">Lévesque et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112450779">Philipps et al., 2008</xref>). Our interpretation also is in line with research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112450779">Goldin et al. (2008)</xref>. In this study, healthy participants watched negative emotion-eliciting films under different conditions. One of them was a reappraisal condition, in which participants were encouraged to think objectively in order to down-regulate emotions. Another condition consisted of suppressing emotions, by keeping their face still and not displaying any emotional reaction. Both reappraisal and suppression methods produced significant responses in an extensive network of the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the reappraisal condition exclusively in the early, while the suppression condition exclusively in the late movie-watching period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112450779">Erk et al. (2010)</xref> show that medicated depressed patients are also capable of adequately regulating emotions (e.g., by employing the reappraisal strategy) when they undergo explicit instruction to do so. Reappraisal produced a similar decrease in amygdala activation and increased prefrontal activation, just as in healthy controls. This ability, however, decreased with increasing depression severity and the regulatory effect became less sustainable. Emotion regulation would be one possible interpretation of our findings. An equally valid interpretation is that depressed patients show an increased emotional reaction to negative stimuli.</p>
<p>From the first to the second fMRI measurement, the level of activation changed significantly for all prefrontal regions. Analysis of treatment responders only revealed similar, but somewhat smaller activation changes, most likely due to the smaller sample size. In treatment responders, we found there were significant changes in activation in the bilateral DLPFC and in the medial OFC. Activation changes in the lateral OFC did not reach significance. Our findings indicate that supposedly dysfunctional mechanisms of emotion processing are, at least in part, reversible. This is consistent with other studies reporting normalisation of neuronal function in depressed patients after successful antidepressant treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112450779">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112450779">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112450779">Sheline et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>One limitation of the present study lies within the open-label design, as a MDD patient group treated with placebo could not be included, nor could a healthy control group receive escitalopram, for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>Without a placebo control group, we cannot fully assign the observed neural activation changes to the therapeutic effect of escitalopram. Instead, we must regard them as general therapeutic effects. Additional work is required to more strongly implicate escitalopram in the observed changes.</p>
<p>Due to our strict selection criteria for MDD patients, we had a small sample size. In order to take part in our study, patients had to be unmedicated and show no personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. Hence, we had little statistical power and had to choose relatively low statistical thresholds for the fMRI results. A small sample size may also have limited our ability to find significant correlations between symptom severity and the fMRI results.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study is the fact that we did not assess the emotion regulation strategies of the participants after viewing the emotional pictures in the scanner (e.g., Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112450779">Gross &amp; John, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our results clearly show that anticipation and processing of emotions recruit separate neural networks. We also found neural differences between the initially unmedicated depressed patients and healthy controls, in both their anticipation and response to negative stimuli, which indicate that dysfunctions in emotion regulatory mechanisms are present in the depressed. In addition, our study shows that these mechanisms are, at least in part, reversible, and therefore represent a state marker rather than a trait marker of depression.</p>
<p>Further research should provide better insight into the link between emotion regulation strategies and neural activation, by adding measurement of physiological arousal during the experiment and by assessing the emotion regulation strategy.</p>
