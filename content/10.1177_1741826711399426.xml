<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Anxiety, psychological distress and personality may not be independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease; however they may contribute via their relationship with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. This study aimed to examine the association between psychological distress, risk behaviours and patient demographic characteristics in a sample of general practice patients aged 40–65 years with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Cross-sectional analytic study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients, randomly selected from general practice records, completed a questionnaire about their behavioural risk factors and psychological health as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial of a general practice based intervention to prevent chronic vascular disease. The Kessler Psychological Distress Score (K10) was the main outcome measure for the multilevel, multivariate analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Single-level bi-variate analysis demonstrated a significant association between higher K10 and middle age (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001), high neuroticism (<italic>p</italic> = 0), current smoking (<italic>p</italic> = 0), physical inactivity (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and low fruit and vegetable consumption (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008). Socioeconomic (SES) indicators of deprivation (employment and accommodation status) were also significantly associated with higher K10 (<italic>p</italic> = 0). No individual behavioural risk factor was associated with K10 on multilevel multivariate analysis; however indicators of low SES remained significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> When all factors were considered, psychological distress was not associated with behavioural risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Other underlying factors, such as personality type and socioeconomic status, may be associated with both the behaviours and the distress.</p>

<p>While there is good evidence that some psychosocial factors such as depression and social isolation are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the role of anxiety, psychological distress and personality is less clear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711399426">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711399426">3</xref></sup> They may contribute via their relationship with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours as graded associations between anxiety or depression symptoms and unhealthy behaviours have been demonstrated in patients at risk of vascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711399426">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711399426">5</xref></sup> and in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711399426">6</xref></sup> If they do contribute via their impact on behavioural choices, there should be strong associations between behavior and distress. However, this relationship might be moderated by a range of other factors.</p>
<p>Neurotic personality trait is strongly associated with psychological distress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711399426">7</xref></sup> and is an important moderator of the behavioural response to stressors as individuals with high neuroticism demonstrate emotional instability and low self esteem; experience greater distress in response to stress and make poorer choices when dealing with stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711399426">8</xref></sup> Gender is also strongly associated with psychological distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711399426">9</xref></sup> External stressors that may impact on psychological distress include markers of socioeconomic status (SES) such as employment, education level, accommodation, language difficulties and location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711399426">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prevalence of moderate to high levels of psychological distress in Australia is 14.2% for men and 20.4% for women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711399426">11</xref></sup> In 2006–2007, 9.35% of general practice encounters in NSW were with patients experiencing psychological problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711399426">12</xref></sup> General practitioners (GPs) frequently assess psychological disorders in the context of life stressors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711399426">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2001, 53% of the Australian adult population had two or three and 16% had four or more of the following cardiovascular risk factors: tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, obesity, low fruit or vegetable consumption, risky alcohol consumption or diabetes; with prevalence increasing with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711399426">14</xref></sup> General Practitioners frequently identify and provide brief interventions to address these risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711399426">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711399426">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study hypothesis that high psychological distress has significant positive associations with higher neuroticism, risk behaviours, female gender and markers of low SES, was explored in a sample of general practice patients aged 40–65 years with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711399426" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>This study describes a cohort of primary care patients participating in a cluster randomized controlled trial of a complex general practice-based intervention to prevent chronic vascular disease (Health Improvement and Prevention Study).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711399426">17</xref></sup> It was conducted in five Divisions of General Practice (local primary care support organizations) in NSW, Australia that had expressed interest following direct approach by the study team. All practices within these divisions were asked to express interest in the trial, and the first eight in each geographical area – whose principal GP agreed to participate, used electronic medical records and were not involved in similar research – were accepted for the study. In each practice, clinical management software was used to select a random sample of up to 160 patients who did not have pre-existing CVD or diabetes and were aged either 40–55 years with diagnosed hypertension or hyperlipidaemia; or aged 56–64 years. Practices were able to remove patients from the list who were deceased or otherwise unsuitable for the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711399426">17</xref></sup> Eligible patients were sent a letter from the practice, information about the study, the consent form and a questionnaire to return to the study centre in a reply paid envelope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711399426"><title>Ethics</title>
<p>Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Human Research and Ethics Committee. General Practitioners, practice nurses and patients provided written informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711399426"><title>Instruments</title>
<p>The questionnaire completed by the study participants included the Preventive Health Check Survey (PHCS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711399426">18</xref></sup> the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711399426">9</xref></sup> and the Neuroticism Scale from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised, Short form (EPQ-N-RS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711399426">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The K-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711399426">Figure 1</xref>) is a ten-item questionnaire measuring negative emotional states in the preceding four weeks. Responses are rated on a five-point scale and summed to produce a score from 10 to 50. High scores (30–50) are strongly associated with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. The instrument has been validated for use in Australia, USA and other countries for population studies and clinical monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711399426">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711399426">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711399426">21</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-1741826711399426" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Examples of Items from K10 and EPQ-N-RS Scales.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741826711399426-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The EPQ-N-RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711399426">Figure 1</xref>) represents an individual’s tendency to experience psychological distress or neuroticism. It is a 12-item scale using a dichotomous response format. The ‘yes’ responses are summed to produce a score from 0 to 12. Scores are high in those with psychiatric disorders, emotional instability and low self esteem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711399426">22</xref></sup> It has been validated for use in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711399426">23</xref></sup> and has been used in large population health surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711399426">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PHCS is a multi-item self-report questionnaire measuring patients’ behavioural risk factors, height, weight and socio-demographic characteristics. The questions are based on those in the NSW Health Survey and have been validated for use in primary care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711399426">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information on the characteristics of the practice (number of GPs, estimated size of practice and location) was collected by a survey completed by the practice manager or principal GP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711399426">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711399426"><title>Data and variables</title>
<p>The K-10 score is a continuous outcome variable. A score of 10–15 indicates low psychological distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711399426">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dichotomous patient behavioural risk variables were computed using the original question responses. Higher neuroticism was defined as a score greater than the sample median from the EPQ-N-RS scale. Smokers indicated that they were currently smoking tobacco. Physical activity (PA) scores used frequency of PA per week to compute a score from 0 to 8. A score of less than 4 indicated inadequate PA levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711399426">24</xref></sup> Number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables consumed was summed to give a score. A score of less than 7 indicated inadequate diet. At-risk alcohol intake was defined as more than two standard drinks consumed on a typical day when drinking. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as self reported body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the reported height in metres. A BMI of ≥25 indicated Overweight or Obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711399426">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The socio-demographic characteristics of respondents studied were gender, age, home ownership, education, employment, country of birth and language spoken at home (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711399426">Table 1</xref>). Home ownership and employment status can be considered as markers of SES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711399426">26</xref></sup> Demographic variables were dichotomous with the exception of employment status. ‘Unemployed’ was used as the reference category as this was considered a marker of lower SES compared with employment or retirement from the workforce.

<p>We examined the association between the independent variables and the K-10 score in bivariate, single-level analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711399426">Table 1</xref>) using analysis of variance in SPSS statistical software (version 15; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<sec id="sec8-1741826711399426"><title>Multilevel Models</title>
<p>To account for the potential moderating effect of each of the independent variables on the associations between behaviour and distress, a multilevel, multivariate regression model was used with K10 score as the continuous dependent variable and general practice and patient characteristics including behavioural risk factors as the independent variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711399426">Table 2</xref>). Where data sets clearly identify ‘patients’ and ‘practices’ in a nested hierarchical structure, multi level analysis has substantive advantages over single-level regression modeling in being a technically correct method to model the patient and practice level associations with K10 score. Multilevel analysis (with MLwiN software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711399426">28</xref></sup>) adjusted for clustering of patients (level 1) within practices (level 2).

<p>The level 1 or level 2 variance explained for the main model was estimated as the difference in variance for each level between the baseline model and main model divided by the variance of that level for the baseline model.</p>

<p>While completed consent forms and questionnaires were received from 934 patients (19% response rate), adequate data was available for 884 questionnaires from 30 practices and was used for the initial analysis. The multilevel regression included only data from the questionnaires for which information on all the independent variables was available, resulting in a final sample size of 630 patients from 30 practices. Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> tests indicated that proportions of the independent variables were similar between the records used in multilevel analyses and missing data except for patients who spoke a language other than English at home.</p>
<p>The mean K10 score (Cronbach alpha = 0.896) for the sample was 16 (SD 6.3). The mean EPQ-N-RS (Cronbach alpha = 0.844) for men was 3.89 (SD 3.35) and for women 4.19 (SD 3.50).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711399426">Table 1</xref> shows the characteristics of the respondents and practices (independent variables): 41.1% were from larger practices and 60.3% were from rural areas. The majority (60%) of the participants were in the older age group and 56.2% were female. Three-quarters were born in Australia and 91.2% spoke English at home. The majority were home owners (78.9%) and either employed (66.6%) or retired from the workforce (12.7%). Less than half (42.5%) had completed a qualification higher than school level.</p>
<p>The bivariate analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711399426">Table 1</xref>) demonstrated an association between higher K10 score and middle age (40–55 vs older), high neuroticism, current smoking, inadequate physical activity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, speaking a language other than English at home, living in rental accommodation and being unemployed. It was also associated with urban practice but not with practice size.</p>
<p>The multilevel regression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711399426">Table 2</xref>) shows that psychological distress was higher in the middle-aged group (40–55 years) compared with older patients (56–64 years). It was also higher among those who were unemployed and those with higher EPQ-N-RS score. K10 was not associated with any individual behavioural risk factor nor practice size or location after adjustment for confounding factors.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711399426"><title>Variance components</title>
<p>At the patient level (level 1) 38% of the variance among patients for K-10 was explained by the independent variables used in the analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711399426">Table 3</xref>). There was very little variance in K10 at the practice level (level 2) and 100% of the variance among practices was explained by the variables used in the analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1741826711399426" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>As expected we found a strong positive association between neuroticism and psychological distress. Neuroticism has been related to emotionality with high neuroticism individuals experiencing greater distress in response to major life stress compared to low neuroticism individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711399426">7</xref></sup> Personality traits such as neuroticism are strong predictors of psychological distress and have been found to be more powerful than environmental factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711399426">29</xref></sup> Our model shows that personality, age and being unemployed explained 38% of the variance of distress.</p>
<p>Age was associated with psychological distress as patients who were middle aged (40–55) were more distressed than those who were older. A previous Australian study showed that K10 scores indicating high distress among those aged between 16 and 49 years were more prevalent than among those aged 50–64 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711399426">30</xref></sup> Gender may be a risk factor for anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711399426">10</xref></sup> with females tending to have higher K10 scores compared to males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711399426">9</xref></sup> in some studies but not others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711399426">31</xref></sup> While gender was not a significant predictor of distress in our study, females did have a higher K10 score, although this did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>Being unemployed was significantly associated with psychological distress in this study. This is consistent with other studies that have demonstrated that being unemployed is a significant contributor to poor mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711399426">10</xref></sup> There are also associations between unemployment and smoking and other behavioural risk factors in the Australian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711399426">32</xref></sup> However, these associations may not to be mediated by a causal link between psychological distress and the risk behaviours.</p>
<p>While there appeared to be strong associations between behavioural risk factors and psychological distress these were non-significant in the multilevel, multivariate model after adjustment for SES or neuroticism. This is in contrast to other studies that have demonstrated an association between anxiety and depression and unhealthy behaviours in subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711399426">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711399426">5</xref></sup> but have not included markers of socioeconomic status or personality trait in the analysis, which we found were important predictors of distress.</p>
<p>Bonnet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711399426">4</xref></sup> also demonstrated a gradient effect for both anxiety and depression in relation to poor diet, smoking, physical activity, with those participants with higher anxiety or depression scores being more likely to have unhealthy behaviours. Psychological distress is an indicator of possible anxiety or depression but does not enable a definite diagnosis. It is possible that there is a threshold level of distress that impacts on behaviour choice and our subjects had not reached this level.</p>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. The cross-sectional design does not make it possible to establish a temporal relationship between psychological distress and other factors. Longitudinal data from the trial examining changes in both behavioural risk factors and K10 over time will allow an assessment of the impact of behaviour change on psychological distress as well as examination of the impact of psychological distress on behaviour over time. The selection of participating divisions and general practitioners, while including both urban and rural locations, may not have resulted in a representative sample, as only those practices that were interested responded to the invitation. However the patients were chosen randomly from practice records and their psychological distress levels, personality and behavioural risk factors were typical of the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711399426">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711399426">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711399426">19</xref></sup> despite the response rate being lower than we had hoped;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711399426">17</xref></sup> 100% of the practice level variance was explained by the variables in the final model. Analysis was based on self-reported variables that may reduce the reliability of findings. Audit data from medical records would have been more reliable but were not available for this study.</p>
<p>This study supports the evidence that psychological distress may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease as it does not seem to be associated with behavioural risk factors. However, it may be a causal link between environmental stressors such as unemployment and cardiovascular disease as well as between personality and cardiovascular disease as it is strongly associated with both. More research, especially monitoring change over time, may help clarify these findings.</p>
