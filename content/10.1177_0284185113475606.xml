               <title>Background</title>
               <p>Conventional radiography has limitations in the detection of physeal fractures before the closure of the physis occurs. Fracture detection may be improved by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To evaluate the usefulness of MRI for the detection of occult fractures involving the physis when radiography results are negative.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>In this prospective study, 24 children (age range, 3–15 years; mean age, 10.7 years) received MRI if they met the following criteria: acute joint trauma, swelling and tenderness around the joint, limitations in bearing weight, an open physis, and negative radiography results for fractures. Fractures revealed by the MRI were classified according to the Salter-Harris classification system. Joint effusion, bone marrow edema, and periosteal alterations were graded on a three-point scale. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test and Fisher's exact test were used for the statistical evaluation.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>From a total of 24 MR data-sets, 23 were evaluated (one patient was excluded due to poor MR image quality). Elbow injuries were present in 10 patients (43.5%), distal tibia injuries in 10 patients (43.5%), and distal femur injuries in three patients (13%). MRI results excluded physeal fractures in 15 (65.2%) of the 23 children. An occult physeal fracture was detected with MRI in eight (34.8%) patients; of these, five (21.7%) had fractures of the elbow, two (8.7%) had fractures of the distal tibia, and one (4.3%) had a fracture of the distal femur. All of the patients with fractures and 11 of the 15 patients without fractures demonstrated bone marrow edema.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>The frequency of occult fracture, as detected by MRI, was 34.8%. Thus, MRI is a useful additional imaging method for the detection of occult fractures when radiography is negative.</p>

         <p>The growth plate is involved in 6–15% of all childhood fractures of the tubular bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C1">1</xref>). The most frequent site of physeal injury is the distal radius (49.9%), followed by the distal humerus (16.7%), and the distal tibia (11%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C2">2</xref>). If physeal injuries are not detected promptly and treated adequately, growth retardation as well as growth arrest, angular deformity, length inequality, and impairment in the function of the involved limb may result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C3">3</xref>). Nearly 15% of all physeal fractures lead to growth arrest, and the most common site of post-traumatic bone bridge formation is the distal tibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C4">4</xref>).</p>
         <p>Radiography is the standard method used to diagnose fractures in children. The radiographic diagnosis of fractures near the growth plate, however, is challenging because ossification of the epiphysis has either not yet taken place or is incomplete. If diagnostic uncertainty persists after conventional radiography, additional imaging methods, such as radiographic comparative views of the contralateral site, stress radiography, bone scintigraphy, ultrasonography, MRI, or CT, can help to improve the diagnostic accuracy of fracture detection. Chapman <italic>et al</italic>. found that multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has a high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for the detection of radiographically occult fractures when it is applied to children with traumatic elbow effusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C5">5</xref>). MDCT takes only seconds to perform, and no sedation is required. Moreover, MDCT studies may be reformatted in any plane from a single data-set. Radiation exposure, however, is a matter of concern when examining children with CT or scintigraphy approaches. Ultrasound is a readily available imaging technique that provides important information regarding soft tissue injuries and has been shown to be useful for identifying occult fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C6">6</xref>); however, the acoustic window is often limited, and this modality is strongly operator-dependent. MRI does not carry these limitations, as there is no radiation exposure to the child (as with CT, radiography, or bone scintigraphy), and equivalent image quality is achieved in any desired imaging plane (in contrast to ultrasonography). Moreover, MRI can be used to visualize the following with high accuracy: the path of osteocartilaginous injury, bone marrow edema, joint effusion and tendinous, and periosteal and ligamentous injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C7">7</xref>).</p>
         <p>It is noteworthy that only a few prospective studies have been published consisting of a homogeneous study population, including exclusively children without fractures on radiography, and evaluating the detection rate of occult fractures involving the growth plate by MRI.</p>
         <p>We designed this prospective study to evaluate the usefulness of MRI for the detection of occult fractures involving the growth plate in cases where the radiogram showed no evidence of fracture.</p>

            <title>Subjects</title>
            <p>Twenty-four children (14 boys and 10 girls; mean age, 10.7 years; age range, 3–15 years) with acute joint injuries were prospectively examined with MRI. The entrance criteria for enrollment in the study included the following: acute joint trauma with tenderness and swelling over the involved joint, refusal to move the joint actively or passively, an open physis, and the lack of fractures detected by radiographs. Clinically, all patients required additional imaging to exclude the presence of occult fractures. MRI was chosen for this purpose and was performed 1–4 days after the radiographic imaging. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children participating in the study.</p>

            <title>MRI</title>
            <p>MR examinations were performed on a 1.0 T unit (Magnetom Expert, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using dedicated extremity coils (knee coil, head coil, or flexible surface coils). Scanning was performed without sedation or the administration of contrast medium. T1-weighted (TR/TE, 400–550/12–17 ms; matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 3 mm) and T2-weighted (TR/TE, 4000–4500/96–120 ms; matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 3 mm) turbo spin-echo images were obtained in two planes. A T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence (Turbo-Inversion Recovery-Magnitude [TIRM]) (TR/TE/IR, 4500–6100/96/160 ms; matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 4 mm) or a 3D T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence with fat suppression (TR/TE/flip angle, 47/10/40°; matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 2 mm) was acquired in at least one plane. All patients had clinical follow-up examinations at 1 week and between 4 and 6 weeks after the injury.</p>

            <title>Image analysis</title>
            <p>One specialized pediatric surgeon with &gt; 10 years of experience evaluated the radiographs in the emergency department. The radiographs were re-evaluated by the pediatric surgeon and a radiologist with &gt; 7 years of experience in musculoskeletal imaging. Then the patients were selected for MRI according to the entrance criteria.</p>
            <p>One radiologist analyzed the MR images, which were scrutinized for fracture lines, cortical discontinuity, bone marrow edema, joint effusion, and periosteal alterations. From the MRI, a fracture was identified when there was a distinct fracture line crossing the cortex and/or the trabecula. Fractures to the growth plate were classified according to the five-type Salter-Harris classification system. Bone marrow edema (bone bruising) was defined as localized bone marrow hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, with or without an accompanying fracture. The visibility of bone marrow edema, joint effusion, and periosteal reaction was graded using a three-point scale, where “−” represented “not present”, “+” represented “mild to moderate”, and “++” represented “pronounced”. The degrees of visibility of these parameters were statistically analyzed to detect the most helpful sequences for the depiction of fracture lines and bone bruise. Additionally, signal intensities were measured on areas with bone marrow edema and on an adjacent area with normal appearing bone marrow signal by drawing a ROI (region of interest). Differences between the signal intensities in these two areas were calculated for each sequence. Thereafter, these differences were pairwise tested for statistically significant differences between all possible combinations of sequences.</p>

         <p>Twenty-four children with potential physeal injuries were examined using radiography and MRI. One patient was excluded from the study due to the poor quality of the MR images because of motion artifacts. Eight (34.8%) of the 23 patients were shown to have occult physeal fractures, as detected by MRI (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475606TB1">1</xref>).

         <p>The site of injury was the elbow for 10 (43.5%) patients, five (50%) of these patients had occult elbow fractures with involvement of the growth plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475606F1">1</xref>). Bone edema was seen in all patients with elbow fracture and in three (60%) of five patients without fracture. Periosteal reaction was found in three (60%) of five patients with fracture and in one patient without. In one child who had an injury to the elbow, the physeal fracture was not diagnosed after the first reading of the MR images. The initial radiographs showed no evidence of fracture, although the follow-up radiograph 1 week later revealed a physeal fracture of the distal humerus with delayed displacement (Salter-Harris I). From a retrospective re-analysis of the MR images, the fracture was visible.

         <p>In contrast to the group of patients with elbow fractures only two (20%) out of 10 patients had occult physeal fractures of the distal tibia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475606F2">2</xref>). Bone bruise was found in both patients with occult fracture and in six out of eight (75%) patients without fracture. Periosteal reactions were found in one of the patients with fracture and in one (12.5%) out of eight without fracture.

         <p>Three (13%) of 23 patients had injuries to the knee. One of them had an occult physeal fracture, type II Salter Harrison (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475606F3">3</xref>) with joint effusion, extensive bone bruise, periosteal reaction, and periarticular soft tissue swelling. Both patients with knee injury without occult fracture had joint effusion, one of them with additional bone bruise, and none with periosteal reaction.

         <p>All 23 patients demonstrated evidence of joint effusion on MRI. The degree of effusion was less conspicuous in patients without fractures compared with those with fractures, although this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt;0.5). All patients with fractures had concomitant bone marrow edema. The fracture lines were best visualized with the T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences and the T1-weighted images, without statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &gt;0.5). The T2-weighted images without fat suppression were the least sensitive for detecting fractures (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). The fracture lines, as visualized by MRI, were subtle for five of the eight patients. Bone bruising was best visualized on the T2-weighted fat-suppressed turbo-spin-echo sequences, followed by the T1-weighted images. T2-weighted images without fat suppression were the least sensitive for the detection of bone marrow edema (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.02).</p>
         <p>The therapeutic consequences from the MRI findings consisted of the following: prolongation of the immobilization time by 1–2 weeks for six patients with occult fractures; surgery for one patient with an elbow injury; and relief from splint immobilization for three patients with no additional findings on MRI.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of MRI for detecting occult fractures in children with joint injuries when the radiography results were negative for fractures. From the MRI results, fractures could be ruled out for 15 (65.2%) of the 23 children. Conversely, there were eight (34.8%) patients with radiographically occult fractures that were detected by MRI. The fracture lines, however, were subtly defined by MRI for five of the eight patients. In addition, one elbow fracture was not detected during the first MRI evaluation, although it could be observed in retrospect. The failure to detect fractures has also been reported for MDCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C5">5</xref>). The therapeutic consequences of the MRI results consisted of prolongation of the cast bearing in six patients and surgery in one patient (elbow injury). The use of MRI as an additional diagnostic imaging tool may also avoid over-treatment, which can result in the unnecessary limitation of extremity motion and clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. In this study, the use of MRI led to a more rapid cast removal in three patients who did not demonstrate any relevant additional findings on MRI (no fractures, no bone bruises). Carey <italic>et al</italic>. reported that for 14 suspected cases of physeal injury, the use of MRI altered the radiographic diagnosis in 50% of the cases by demonstrating either radiographically occult fractures or unsuspected transphyseal extensions of a fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C9">9</xref>). However, Petit <italic>et al</italic>. reported that radiographic diagnoses were changed as a result of MRI in only one case and that treatment was not altered for any of the remaining 28 cases with acute fractures of the distal tibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C8">8</xref>). The different patient populations examined in these two studies may explain these contradictory results.</p>
         <p>In our study, the most frequently examined joints were the elbow and the ankle. Contrary to other traumatic injuries within the physeal region, which occur at a peak incidence during the end of the physis closure process, injuries to the elbow are the most often observed between the fourth and eighth year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C10">10</xref>). Accurate diagnoses of injuries to the elbow are particularly challenging with conventional radiography, as the five ossification centers are not completely ossified at that age. The ability of MRI to assess physeal fractures in young children and adolescents has also been demonstrated by other studies; however, the prevalence of occult fractures that can be detected using MRI has only been evaluated in a few studies. In our study group, 10 patients with elbow injuries were examined, and five (50%) of these patients had radiographically occult fractures that were detected by MRI. Major <italic>et al.</italic> detected occult fractures using MRI in four (57%) of seven children with traumatic elbow effusions but without any fractures visible by radiography, and these findings are in line with our study results concerning elbow injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C11">11</xref>). In the study by Griffith <italic>et al</italic>., 17 children with elbow joint effusions but without radiographic signs of fracture (representing a subgroup of the study population) demonstrated a 53% prevalence of occult fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C7">7</xref>). The additional findings that were revealed by MRI, however, had no appreciable bearing on patient treatment or outcome. A high incidence of 78% of occult fractures has been reported by Pudas <italic>et al.</italic> in children with trauma-related elbow effusion using MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C12">12</xref>).</p>
         <p>While bone deformity is the most troublesome sequela associated with growth disturbances following elbow injury, growth arrest is the main problem associated with distal tibial injuries. The incidence of occult fractures of the distal tibia that can be detected by MRI has been reported to be between 6% and 18%, which is lower than the 20% we detected in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C16">16</xref>). This discrepancy may be attributable to the use of different inclusion criteria (age of the children, seriousness of the injury) or the low number of patients included, with the exception of the study by Launey <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C17">17</xref>). The incidence of physeal complications following physeal fractures of the distal tibia is typically between 2% and 14.1%. In our study, the MRI results impacted the therapeutic management of the patients mainly by influencing the duration of cast bearing.</p>
         <p>There were several limitations to this study. First, the low number of patients included could have led to an over-estimation of the accuracy of MRI. Second, there was no gold standard for fracture detection, which meant that sensitivity and specificity calculations for the MRI results could not be computed. The use of follow-up radiographs, which utilize new periosteal bone formation as an indicator of occult fracture, is a frequently recommended reference method. Using periosteal changes on follow-up radiographs, Donnelly <italic>et al.</italic> reported an incidence of occult elbow fractures of only 17% compared to 57% reported by Major <italic>et al.</italic> on MRI and 46% by Chapman <italic>et al.</italic> on CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475606C18">18</xref>). This method, however, is problematic for patients with an open physis, as subperiosteal bleeding indicative of new periosteal bone formation may not always occur, and this would result in an under-estimation of the incidence of occult fractures. In addition, over-estimation of the incidence of occult fractures may occur if subperiosteal bleeding and periosteal elevation/disruption are used to diagnose occult fractures (as in certain ultrasonographic studies) because these signs may be the result of other concomitant injuries, such as ligamentous tears. Observations from our study corroborate both of these objections, as two patients without fractures had periosteal alterations (subperiosteal bleeding or periosteal separation from bone by fluid collection), and three patients with fractures demonstrated no signs of subperiosteal bleeding.</p>
         <p>One disadvantage of MRI is the extended examination time, which may be uncomfortable for young patients and may result in motion during the examination. Depending on a child's age, sedation may be necessary to perform MRI, whereas it is generally not necessary for CT or ultrasonography. Although none of the patients in our study received sedation, the data from one patient could not be evaluated due to poor image quality caused by motion artifacts. High costs restrict the widespread use of MRI for the assessment of bone injuries, and therefore, the application of MRI must be limited to specific cases.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, MRI was able to detect occult fractures in 34.8% of patients who demonstrated signs of joint effusion but had negative radiography findings. Thus, MRI should be regarded as a complementary method that can be used for evaluating children with acute trauma to the physis when there are inconsistencies between the X-ray examination and clinical findings.</p>
