<p>
<italic>Darwin’s Pious Idea</italic> was a highly touted and anticipated volume. Its author, Conor Cunningham, is assistant director of the Centre of Theology and Philosophy at the University of Nottingham, England. The book seeks to move beyond the impasse created by ultra-Darwinists (Dawkins, Dennett, etc.) on the one hand and Christian creationists on the other, though much more time is spent on the former. The goal is to “baptize” the theory of evolution (ix; citing Asa Gray). The way in which Cunningham attempts this is by “out-narrating” the ultra-Darwinists in going over the details of modern evolutionary theory while resisting what he sees as materialistic reductionism on all fronts. Cunningham does not merely suggest that theistic and evolutionary perspectives are complementary, but argues that scientific method and discoveries need metaphysics, and perhaps even theology, to ground ethics and our commonsense view of life.</p>
<p>The first three chapters of the book critique three common assumptions: that Darwinism leads to disenchantment, that genetics controls evolution, and that natural selection explains everything. First, he highlights well Darwin’s contributions but warns that common ancestry does not necessarily mean a lack of dignity in humanity or lead to a disenchanted view of nature. This is demonstrated by interpreting Darwin in his historical context and noting the influences on him and the varied responses to his discoveries. Noting that Darwin’s theory elevates change, struggle, and individualism (“survival of the fittest”), the second chapter challenges this in light of recent science. For example, the traditional view is complicated by altruism and infertility; neither phenomenon purports the survival of the individual but both focus on the group. Following this, Cunningham correctly questions Richard Dawkins’ notion of the “selfish gene,” which gives genes an almost immortal and all-powerful status. This is difficult to hold, however, since evidence suggests that information does not only move from DNA to protein but the reverse as well. The genome is a dynamic unity not a static one, and there is “no simple relation between the genotype and phenotype” (60). What this means is that “a ‘self’ is already a product of difference, the fruit of community and cooperation” (69). Populations, groups, and the convergence of structures are every bit as important for evolution as genes. Readers might also be interested in the work of Harvard’s David Nowak, whose recent <italic>SuperCooperators: Altruism, Evolution, and Why We Need Each Other to Succeed</italic> (Free Press, 2011) focuses on the important role of altruism in evolution (incidentally, he is also a theist).</p>
<p>The third common assumption is that natural selection is the only mechanism of evolution. At the basis of this debate is adaptationism, which suggests that “each and every particular part of an organism’s phenotype – every trait or characteristic – is the result of natural selection” (80). This has been challenged on various fronts, as some traits in an organism are random or even neutral and thus go unnoticed by natural selection. As it stands, insisting on strict adaptationism is pre-Darwinian and akin to the natural theology of Paley, wherein every system in nature is evidence of divine design. The insistence on a static view of evolution, Cunningham suggests, is usually motivated by “the ideology of secular materialism. … By contrast, evolution is an open-ended yet lawlike phenomenon” (109). Drawing on the work of Stuart Kauffman and others, the focus on the environment suggests the emergence of laws of self-organization that work with or above natural selection. Natural selection is in fact an emergent phenomenon itself, a product of evolution. The theory of evolution, then, is evolving.</p>
<p>There has often been a resistance to the idea of progress in evolution because of the problematic way in which it has been used in modernity. In Chapter 4, Cunningham defends the controversial idea and begins to show some of his theological commitments. It should be clear, he argues, that evolution leads to larger, more complex and sophisticated organisms and systems. He develops a version of the fine-tuning argument in suggesting that given the chemical makeup of the universe it was inevitable that complex forms of life would emerge. The pinnacle of this progress, thus far, is the evolution of conscious human beings, which he connects to the doctrine of the <italic>imago dei</italic>. Cunningham is careful to note, however, that humanity’s emancipation from nature means an increase in “cooperation” and “heightened vulnerability” (166). This is not a support for environmental abuse or cultural imperialism. Within the discussion there is also the suggestion that the rationality, order, and structure that emerge from evolution are akin to “consciousness” or “mind,” an insight that he returns to later.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 continues the critique of reductionism by drawing in the reins of those who seek to universalize Darwinism into a first philosophy. The main point is that attempts to universalize Darwinism also end up leveling or reducing the human in some way. Beginning with hints of “social Darwinism” in Darwin’s diaries, this movement had devastating effects for western culture. In the recent movement of sociobiology, which focuses on the present, Darwinism is used to explain all social and moral behavior whatsoever (including science, ethics, sex, etc.), as individuals and groups only work together for survival. Even reason itself is something of a myth used by evolution to trick us into reproducing. Evolutionary psychology, which focuses on the past, tends to freeze the explanation of the human in the past; our brains are the brains of the caveman. The last two movements level the social and psychological to “the transference of genes across generations” (206). He effectively defends science, society, ethics, sex and religion as human activities which cannot be flattened in this way. Towards the end of the chapter he defends religion as a natural and universal tendency of humans as they develop symbols and language, and exist in community (drawing especially on the work of Girard). As will become important later, Cunningham wants to move beyond the idea of the symbolic to suggest nature itself is sacramental (254).</p>
<p>The sixth and largest chapter (111 pages!), “Naturalizing Naturalism: Materialism’s Ghosts,” is an attack on philosophical materialism and naturalism at the heart of the new atheism. The problem is that science turns into “scientism,” in which Darwinism is made into a first philosophy. The chapter proceeds through a number of issues before his main critique: the paradigms for the dialogue of religion and science, historical examples of Christianity aiding science, Intelligent Design, and the problem of evil in relation to evolution. He is clearly doing too much in this chapter, as it is often difficult for the reader to keep all these issues together. Nevertheless, the claims of naturalism are not finally tenable for two basic reasons. First, since naturalism is traditionally based on atomistic physics and a mechanical view of the world, the arrival of quantum physics and the view that the universe is an open system calls this into question. The universe, Cunningham argues, displays something akin to information, mind, and consciousness even at the most basic levels. Following this, he defends the existence of human consciousness, minds, and phenomenology against charges that would see them merely as physical. The upshot of this is that the existence of people, subjects, ethics, truth and beauty may be affirmed. Naturalism, he argues, lacks the explanatory power to uphold these things we take for granted. Ironically, naturalism may end up being an aid to theology: “for if we search the ‘purely’ natural world for an actual birth of a person, we will not find one … They are servants of theology insofar as what they take to be negative findings can be read, instead, as iconic revelations of creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic>” (376). One of the main points of this chapter seems to be the comparison of human consciousness to the order and law within nature. For the theist, the “mind” or “consciousness” that accompanies matter has its source in the divine, while for the methodological or philosophical naturalist the order and structure in the world is “something like” or analogous to mind. Cunningham doesn’t clearly note the analogous nature of this reasoning. Moreover, the difference between fine-tuning and Intelligent Design arguments is that, for the former, natural patterns and organization in general are analogous to the human or divine mind, while for the latter, specific systems within nature “prove” design. The advantage of Cunningham’s approach is that it does not turn God into a scientific hypothesis, but is more of a suggestion that if the world was created by an intelligent agent then conscious human beings would not be unexpected.</p>
<p>Cunningham finally explores his theological commitments more explicitly in the last chapter – although Aquinas has been making appearances throughout. Of course, he rejects a literal reading of Genesis (a modern approach which both creationists and ultra-Darwinists share) in favor of the figurative and typological reading of the church fathers, an approach surely more faithful to the scriptures. He then expounds a Christocentric and sacramental theology of creation deeply influenced by Eastern Orthodoxy. While it makes the argument of compatibility easier, it avoids some of the recent issues in the science and religion dialogue, such as the manner of divine agency.</p>
<p>It is difficult to do justice to this work in such a review. The writing style is engaging, aggressive, and often humorous. Cunningham’s reading is wide and his analysis thoughtful and fair. Because Cunningham is not trained in science but theology and philosophy the scientific exposition relies a good deal on secondary quotations and might have been clearer otherwise. More importantly, however, unlike some of the new atheists on religion, he has taken the time to understand modern science, upon which he brings a profound philosophical analysis. One of the constant lessons throughout the work is that biology is not metaphysics. The jump from scientific description to metaphysical or ethical conclusions about “what is” and “what ought” cannot be made without an awareness of what is at stake. The ultra-Darwinists constantly make this jump in their desire to discredit religion, but their commitment to reductionism may come at the cost of their own humanity. For example, if one was to follow strictly the idea that humans are simply vehicles for the passing on of genes, there would be dire consequences for human freedom and responsibility. Moreover, while Cunningham may have a theological agenda, he is well aware that he is not going to prove the existence of God. In one sense, then, <italic>Darwin’s Pious Idea</italic> is a call for atheists to be more honest about the fallibility and limits of modern science and to appreciate the need for metaphysical, ethical and perhaps theological reflection.</p>
<p>The work was originally intended to be a book in Eerdmans’ Intervention Series, a series of short and critical introductions on important figures and issues in contemporary thought. But because it grew into something else, the book is not helpful for the undergraduate level. Perhaps a smaller version is in order. It is best suited for graduate students and scholars working in philosophy of science, the doctrine of creation, or in the dialogue between religion and science. It deserves to find a standing place in these fields. It is an important work that I will be sure to return to again and again.</p>
