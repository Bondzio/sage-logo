<abstract>
<p>This article presents a novel linear actuated chain test rig, which is capable of accelerated test speeds and continuous wear measurements. The ability to measure chain wear in situ saves time and expense compared to a conventional sprocket driven rig because the traditional rig requires the chain to be dismantled in order to monitor wear. In situ chain measurement reduces errors significantly. The novel test rig does not have a traditional set up of rotary driven sprocket and chain but uses a pneumatic linear actuator to articulate a short section of chain, which is preloaded between two cantilevers. This design leads to a compact rig with only few moving parts and allows accelerated testing at high frequencies. Linear encoder displacement transducers are used to measure changes in chain length down to 0.06 µm at a rate of 4000 readings per second. Sample wear tests on different chains have been conducted to compare life test results with conventional sprocket-driven tests rig. A good correlation was obtained between the steady-state wear rate for three different brands of roller chain.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406212451546" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Roller chains are an important power transmission component in machinery such as conveyor systems, engine cam drives and lifting systems. Roller chains are generally a safety critical component and so it is important to verify the performance of new designs by testing. One of the challenges of chain testing is that chains are very durable and long lasting. Typical test runs for roller chains are currently at least 300 h in length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212451546">1</xref></sup> Chain test rigs therefore need to be very durable.</p>
<p>The life of a roller chain is typically defined as the point when the chain extends by 2% of its length since this causes the chain to potentially ride up over the sprocket teeth and cause the chain to disengage. High chain wear can also cause uneven load distributions between the chain and sprocket, as reported in various studies conducted on chain loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212451546">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212451546"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212451546"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212451546"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406212451546">6</xref></sup> Chain extension is caused by wear at the pin bush interface within the chain links. Therefore, chain test rigs need to accurately determine the rate of change in chain length over time.</p>
<p>Current chain test rigs generally consist of a chain and two sprockets in a rotary drive system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212451546">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212451546"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212451546"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406212451546"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406212451546"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406212451546">12</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212451546">Figure 1</xref> shows a typical two-sproket chain test rig designed by Gray et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406212451546">13</xref></sup> In this design, two electric motors and the sprocket assemblies are mounted in parallel. One motor is used to provide drive torque to the chain system whilst the other motor is used to provide resistive torque and absorb power. The rig contains numerous components and mechanisms including sprockets, couplings, bearings, torque transducers and gear boxes. The chain typically contains around 100 links. During chain testing, the top span is under load whilst the bottom span is slack. Chain wear occurs when the chain is articulating under load which occurs when the chain articulates on to or off the tight span side.

<p>Current sprocket and chain test rigs for roller chains such as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212451546">Figure 1</xref> have a number of disadvantages. Firstly, sprocket and chain rigs require relatively large space to accommodate the chain and drive equipment. Secondly, it is difficult to accelerate the speed of the test because chain sprocket systems have limited speeds due to vibration of the chain. Thirdly, the test rig is expensive to maintain because the chain lasts so long that other parts of the rig suffer significant wear. Fourthly, the chain must be periodically dismantled during testing to make wear measurements which is time-consuming and introduces a significant source of error.</p>
<p>This article presents a novel test rig for testing of roller chains, which overcomes all of the disadvantages of current test rigs described above. The new chain test rig has potential for significantly shortening the testing time of new chain designs as well as reducing the cost of testing.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954406212451546"><title>The linear actuated chain test rig concept</title>
<sec id="sec3-0954406212451546"><title>Linear actuator chain test rig concept</title>
<p>A schematic of the linear actuated chain test rig is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212451546">Figure 2</xref>. The test rig has 5 chain links which are loaded in tension between two cantilevers. The central chain link is articulated by a section of sprocket that is pulled by an air muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212451546">Figure 2(a)</xref>). A spring is used to retract the sprocket when the air muscle is relaxed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212451546">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The compliance of the cantilevers accommodates the slight change in distance between the cantilevers as the central chain link articulates.
<fig id="fig2-0954406212451546" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Schematic of the novel chain test rig.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212451546-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The air muscle is a high strain linear actuator that contracts in length when pressure is applied. The air muscle consists of an air-tight length of rubber hose which is sheathed in high-strength fibres. The fibres create a rhomboidal pattern around the perimeter of the tube. When internal pressure is applied, the hose expands in its diameter, thus creating a contraction motion and force in the muscle’s longitudinal direction. To allow the sprocket to be retracted, an exhaust valve in the air muscle is opened to allow the air to discharge. The system is operated by controlling the pressure and frequency demand to the linear actuator, which results in reciprocating actions of pulling (contraction) and extension (relaxing). A load sensor is placed between the air muscle and sprocket in order to calibrate the relationship between pressure and force in the air muscle. The load cell is also used to check the force variation during chain articulation.</p>
<p>The test rig also incorporates an in situ chain length measuring system. Two displacement sensors monitor the distance between the cantilevers and a reference point on the rig frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212451546">Figure 2</xref>). The displacement sensors measure not only the displacement of the cantilevers during chain articulation, but they also measure the change in absolute length of the chain over time during testing. The displacement sensors have a high enough bandwidth in order to continuously measure the chain wear during high frequency testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406212451546"><title>Advantages of the linear actuator rig</title>
<p>The linear actuated chain test rig has a number of advantages over the traditional sprocket and chain test rig set-up:</p>
<sec id="sec5-0954406212451546"><title>(a) Space efficient</title>
<p>The rig has an envelope of approximately 630 × 360 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212451546">2</xref></sup> for 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch chains which is about a seventh of the footprint area of the smallest existing chain and sprocket test rigs.</p>
<p>This reduction in size is mainly due to the fact that the new rig has only 5 links compared to the 100 links that are typically used in traditional chain test rigs. Another factor that leads to compactness is that the air muscle fits inside the cantilever assembly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954406212451546"><title>(b) Enables accelerated life testing</title>
<p>In the new rig design, there are four chain articulations under load in the central link each time the sprocket is pulled forwards. This means that the number of chain articulations under load in the rig is double that of a traditional rig even though there are only 5 chain links in total. This doubling of chain articulations accelerates the wear rate by a factor of two. The air muscle also gives the potential to accelerate the testing further since rotary drives have limitations in speed due to chain vibration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954406212451546"><title>(c) Solid state design</title>
<p>The fully elastic configuration of the cantilevers removes any loaded sliding parts from the test rig making the rig more durable and cost effective to run. If cantilevers of sufficient dimensions are chosen, the maximum stress in the beams will be significantly lower than the yield stress of the material, giving the cantilevers an infinite fatigue life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954406212451546"><title>(d) Compact and low cost linear actuator</title>
<p>The air muscle is a compact and cost effective actuator capable of delivering high loads, strokes and frequencies required for chain wear test. The muscle is relatively inexpensive to replace, as the valves and regulator are contained as separate systems. The muscle also comes in different sizes for different loading scenarios, providing the required strokes and frequencies to articulate the chain links under test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954406212451546"><title>(e) Lower power consumption</title>
<p>The new rig configuration acts as an energy storage system whereby the energy delivered by the air muscle is stored in the cantilevers and then released to return the chain back to a straight configuration. In contrast, a traditional test rig usually has a braking system that has to consume and dissipate a quantity of energy approximately equal to the energy put into driving the sprockets. This means that the power consumption on the novel test rig is approximately half that consumed on traditional rotating sprocket driven rigs. Even though a traditional rig could use regenerative braking, this adds cost and complexity to the system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954406212451546"><title>(f) In situ wear measurement</title>
<p>The new rig is inherently suited to performing in situ wear measurements because the chain is held in an elastic preloaded assembly with no backlash. By placing displacement transducers on both cantilevers, it is possible to accurately monitor changes in chain length.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0954406212451546"><title>(g) Easier to incorporate an environmental chamber</title>
<p>The new rig is inherently suited to having an enclosed environmental chamber because there are only 5 links, while the actuator is connected to the chain via a slender link. In contrast, it is difficult to create an environmental chamber around the chains in traditional rigs because the chain is very long and there are also delicate components such as bearings inside the sprockets.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0954406212451546"><title>Linear actuator test rig for 12.7 mm pitch (0.5 in.) roller chains</title>
<sec id="sec13-0954406212451546"><title>Linear actuator test rig</title>
<p>A test rig for 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch roller chains was designed and manufactured to demonstrate the new test rig concept. A photograph of the rig is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212451546">Figure 3</xref>. A chain size of 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch was chosen because this is a very common size used in industry and commonly tested in research laboratories. The cantilever beams are made from alloy steel (yield stress of 690 MPa). The sprocket is guided by linear bearings and connected to the air muscle via a rod-clevis shackle. The chain links are isolated within an environmental chamber (the lid is removed in the figure) to allow testing to be carried out in controlled environmental conditions. The chain links are air cooled and temperature sensors are used to monitor the chain temperature during testing. The rig is fully interfaced with a computer for operating the rig and data acquisition purpose, while a web cam installed next to the rig allows the rig to be checked remotely.

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954406212451546"><title>Air muscle selection</title>
<p>The rig is designed to be able to test chains with up to 25° angle of articulation at up to 10 Hz. To achieve this, the actuator must have a maximum pulling load of up to 1.5 kN, a maximum displacement of at least 6.35 mm and capable of running at 10 Hz. To meet these requirements, a fluidic muscle was selected. The muscle has a nominal diameter of 20 mm and length of 175.7 mm (excluding pneumatics connector, spacer block and cleat adapter) and can develop a load of up to 1.5 kN at its maximum operating pressure of 600 kPa. A pneumatic regulator is used to ensure that the air muscle is operating at the correct pressure. Fast switching valves are used to enable the actuator to operate at high frequencies. Each switching valve is capable of delivering 100 L of air per minute to the muscle with response times of less than 2 ms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0954406212451546"><title>Linear displacement transducer</title>
<p>Two Solartron linear encoders (type DP1S displacement transducers) were chosen for measuring wear in the chain. These linear displacement transducers have a range of 1 mm and accuracy of 0.06 µm. The shortest chain wear test is typically 1 million cycles and produces between 25 and 60 µm of wear. Therefore, an accuracy of 0.06 µm is adequate for determining a wear profile for the shortest tests.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0954406212451546"><title>Chain load variation due to cantilever deflection</title>
<p>The forces in the chain and cantilevers were measured using load cells in order to determine the chain force characteristics during articulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212451546">Figure 4</xref> shows the forces in the chain and actuator as a function of articulation angle for the case of an initial preload of 800 N.
<fig id="fig4-0954406212451546" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Chain load versus articulation angle for an initial preload of 800 N (straight chain).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212451546-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The results show that when the chain is straight (0° articulation angle) the chain load is 800 N and that as articulation angle increases, the load in the chain increases. This is expected since the deflection of the cantilevers increases as the chain articulates. This means that during testing, the tension in the chain is not constant but fluctuating. For example, for an articulation angle of 15° (which is the typical test angle), the load varies between 800 N (minimum) and 880 N (maximum). This represents a load variation of around ±5%.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0954406212451546"><title>Chain load variation due to polygonal action in traditional test rigs</title>
<p>A fluctuation in chain load also occurs in chain and sprocket set-ups (as in traditional chain test rigs) due to the polygonal action of the chain. Polygonal action describes the change in effective radius of the sprocket as the chain bush passes over top dead centre. When a chain bush and pin is at top dead centre, the radius of the sprocket, <italic>R<sub>s</sub></italic> is the pitch circle radius (<italic>R<sub>PCR</sub></italic>).

For an articulation angle of 15°, polygonal action causes the chain force to vary between 840 N (maximum) and 800 N (minimum). This corresponds to a variation of about ±2.5% which is half the variation of the cantilever set up.</p>

<p>A set of chain life tests was carried out on the new rig to compare results to those obtained on a traditional chain and sprocket rig. Lodge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212451546">1</xref></sup> carried out a series of wear tests on three different brands of 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch roller chain using a chain and sprocket rig. Those tests involved an average chain tension of 800 N with a total of 4 million articulations under load of 15°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212451546">1</xref></sup> Therefore, it was decided to emulate these test conditions to study how well the test results compare between the two rigs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406212451546">Table 3</xref> summarises the chain wear test carried out on the new rig. Tests were carried out on three brands of 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch roller chain supplied by three different manufacturers. The tests were repeated four times for each chain brand and therefore a total of 12 tests were carried out. Each test took 55.6 h to complete and the tests were carried out without any stoppage. On the other hand, the same tests on the chain and sprocket rig took 300 h. The acceleration in life testing occurred partly due to the doubling of chain articulations under load (4 compared to 2) and partly due to an increase in frequency of articulations (a factor of nearly 3).

<p>The data generated on the test rig was post-processed using Matlab’s Curve Fitting Toolbox. Curves were generated using ninth order polynomial curves and robust least squares fitting based on bi-square weights. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212451546">Figure 5</xref> presents the results for wear tests carried out on the Brand A chain. The main central line shows the average results for the four tests. The upper and lower dotted lines represent the maximum and minimum wear results. The individual asterisks shape points correspond to the chain and sprocket wear test results performed by Lodge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212451546">1</xref></sup> on a Brand A chain. The results for both tests follow a characteristic pattern for new chains with an initial high rate of wear as the chain beds (removing high spots) in and then a steady-state lower rate of wear.

</fig></p>
<p>The results from the Brand A chain from the new test rig correlate very well with the results obtained using the traditional test rig in terms of trend and absolute values. Both results show an initial high wear rate and then give a similar slope for the steady-state wear rate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212451546">Figure 6</xref> gives results for wear tests carried out on Brand B. As before, the main central line shows the average wear rate for the 4 tests with the dotted lines showing maximum and minimum wear rates. The triangle points show results for a chain and sprocket test carried out by Lodge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212451546">1</xref></sup> There is a very good correlation between the steady-state wear rate between the new test rig and the chain and sprocket test rig. However, the initial wear rate is lower for the chains tested on the new test rig.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212451546">Figure 7</xref> gives results for wear tests carried out on Brand C. As before, the main line shows the average wear rate for the 4 tests with the finer lines showing maximum and minimum wear rates. The square points show results for a chain and sprocket test. Again, there is a very good correlation between the steady-state wear rate between the new test rig and the chain and sprocket test rig. However, the initial wear rate is higher for the chains tested on the new test rig.

<p>When considering the results of an individual brand of chain on the new rig, the test results for the 4 tests show good consistency in the ‘steady-state’ wear rate between the maximum and minimum wear values. However, for each individual brand of chain, there is significant variation in the amount of wear during the initial ‘bedding-in’ phase. This variation causes the height of the wear curves to be quite different despite the fact that the steady-state wear rates are similar. The differences in the initial wear rates is an expected feature because chains tend to have a brief bedding-in phase at the start of their life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212451546">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>When comparing results between the new rig and the traditional rig, there is good correlation of the steady-state wear rate for all three brands of chain. The only significant deviation in results is that of the initial wear rate during the bedding-in phase. As before, the difference in results can be attributed to the initial wear rate being inherently unpredictable.</p>
<p>The steady-state wear rate for all three brands of chain can be observed by around 2 million cycles. The steady-state wear rate of chain Brands A and B is approximately 2.5 µm per million cycles which corresponds to a chain life of 7500 h assuming a maximum chain extension of 2%. The steady-state wear rate of chain Brand C is approximately 1.25 µm per million cycles which corresponds to a chain life of 15,000 h assuming a maximum chain extension of 2%. This result is consistent with the design life quoted by the manufacturer for that brand of chain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212451546">Figures 5</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212451546">7</xref> show that the new rig gives a continuous set of results in contrast to the discrete results of the traditional chain and sprocket test. The continuous nature of results have the advantage that it shows the wear rate more comprehensively and shows more clearly the point at which the steady-state wear rate starts.</p>
<p>The tests carried out have verified that the novel test rig is able to accurately reproduce sprocket and chain interaction. It should be highlighted that additional time saving was achieved with the new cantilever test rig because there was no need for chain dismantling. In contrast, each test run on the chain and sprocket tests had ten wear readings, and so the chain needed to be dismantled, measured and reassembled 10 times. This took on average 40 h for each test. So as well as saving around 240 h in the test itself, there was an additional saving of 40 h due to in situ wear measurements that was introduced on the novel test rig.</p>

<p>The linear actuated chain test rig presented in this article is a compact test rig that enables testing at accelerated speeds and with in situ wear measurements. The method of preloading through an elastic cantilever system means that the rig is robust with few moving parts. In comparison, it also reduces power consumption by a factor of up to 2, since there is no need for a braking and energy dissipation system. The ability to measure chain wear in situ means that it is not necessary to dismantle the chain during testing. This saves a substantial amount of time and cost while eliminating a significant source of measurement error. The novel test rig is also capable of testing different chain types by changing the link attachment components within the rig. A roller chain test rig has been designed and constructed for 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch chains. A typical wear test for 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) pitch roller chains is reduced from 300 h to 56 h. Sample wear tests on different chains have been conducted to compare life test results with conventional sprocket and chain test rig. A good correlation was achieved for the steady-state wear rate for three different brands of chain. These tests have verified that the novel test rig is able to accurately reproduce sprocket and chain load interactions.</p>
