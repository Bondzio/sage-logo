<abstract>
<p>Geographers to date have resisted writing about feelings, affects, places and spaces of love. It is timely to put love on the geographical agenda. We begin by addressing the question ‘what does love do?’, and we review the work of geographers who have been thinking about love via a number of different theoretical lenses. We then argue for a consideration of love as spatial, relational and political. We prompt geographers to think critically about love in its entire multisensory, lived, embodied, felt and contradictory guises. Finally, the work of Ahmed, Sedgwick and Berlant is useful for furthering geographers’ insights on love.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Most of us at some point have experienced the highs and lows of love, fallen in and out of love, been head-over-heels in love, felt love and hate simultaneously, stayed in dysfunctional and/or abusive relationships because of love, and felt the content and discontent associated with the unwavering regularity of love. Not surprisingly, relationships and intimacy are the main themes of many movies, television programmes, magazines, songs and advertisements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512462513">Redman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309132512462513">Stacey and Peace, 1995</xref>). There is also an endless supply of religious texts, self-help books, advice manuals and television talk-shows which present ‘models’ of love that aim to teach people how to love. A quick glance at almost any example of western media reveals expressions, subjectivities and spaces of sexuality, sex and love. As Jackie Stacey and Lynne Pearce (1995: 12, emphasis in original) argue, ‘we may (as individuals, as communities, as nations) no longer <italic>believe</italic> in love, but we still fall for it’.</p>
<p>Despite this, there does not seem to be a lot of love in geography, at least not love that is labelled as such. While the word ‘love’ pops up in various entries in <italic>The International Encyclopedia of Human Geography</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512462513">Kitchin and Thrift, 2009</xref>), geographers have not tended to engage in explicit, concerted and sustained ways with love. Undoubtedly, they/we have studied loving relationships (whether these be familial or other), sexual loving relationships (normative and non-normative) and, more recently, emotional and affectual relations, but these have not tended to be defined specifically as ‘geographies of love’. More than 30 years ago, Yi-Fu Tuan in 1974 argued that topophilia (literally ‘the love of place’) is a useful concept which allows for the exploration of emotional connections between physical environments and humans. His early work reveals the depth of human attachment to the ‘natural’ world. This attachment, he noted, is a central issue for geography and for him personally. In his autobiography <italic>Who Am</italic> <italic>I?</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0309132512462513">Tuan (1999</xref>) writes that his love of geography is his salvation, countering feelings of emptiness in his personal life. To date, there exists in geography, we argue, a great deal of resistance to academic engagement with the concept of love, spaces of love, and bodies that love. Geographers are not alone in their resistance. bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512462513">hooks (2000</xref>: xvii) observes that, while most people would admit that love is vitally important, there is a ‘lack of public discussion’ about the topic. Perhaps this is because love continues to be a feminized topic, associated with ‘private’ spaces and feelings, and it is discursively constructed in, for example, popular culture as ‘women’s gossip’.</p>
<p>We think that it is timely, then, for love to be taken seriously as a valid and crucial subject, especially by feminist, cultural and social geographers who are invested in understanding discourses of the Other. As feminist theorists have shown, discourses of love have not only been closely associated with women, they have been used against them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512462513">Toye, 2010</xref>). How, where and what one loves is deeply political. Given the recent upsurge in geographies of emotion and affect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512462513">Davidson and Milligan, 2004</xref>), it seems this might be a productive time to build on existing scholarship on love and consider how we might be able to extend thinking on this topic. Ultimately, we wish to encourage other scholars to formulate new kinds of love that may create more ethical relationships with others – such as friends, partners, significant others, families, communities – as well as places associated with feelings of love.</p>
<p>What we offer in this article is a conceptualization of love as something that is spatial, relational and political. We present possibilities for thinking <italic>critically</italic> about love in all its various guises. Despite the claims of some that love simply ‘is’ (i.e. it is ‘natural’, deeply felt, visceral and impossible to articulate), like any other notion it needs to be held up to critical scrutiny. It cannot be separated out from spatiality. It is relational and deeply political. We want to open up love’s pleasures and pains by focusing on spatiality, relationality and politics. We begin by addressing the question ‘what does love do?’. We reflect briefly upon the ways in which love’s power is constructed through discourse, language and representation, and in the process provide a glimpse of how love works to shape places and people, rather than what love might be. We then turn our attention to the work of geographers who have attempted to provide a sense of the places and spaces of love. Feminist, queer, humanist, phenomenology, non-representational, emotional and affectual theories are some of those employed by these geographers to make sense of love's spaces and places. Our attention is held by scholarship that seeks to unpack the ways in which power circulates in love relationships. Following this, and most importantly, we offer some research possibilities for developing critically some of the spatial, relational and political dimensions of love. In particular, we examine the work of Sara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512462513">2004b</xref>), Eve Kosofsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512462513">Sedgwick (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132512462513">2003</xref>) and Lauren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512462513">Berlant (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512462513">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512462513">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512462513">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512462513">2011</xref>) as useful for furthering geographers’ insights on love.</p>

<title>II What does love do?</title>
<p>The <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> (2010 edition) traces the origins of the word ‘love’ back to the 12th century, and yet ‘most analyses of love, contrary to normal social scientific practice, do not attempt a definition of the object of enquiry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512462513">Jackson, 1993b</xref>: 206). Across the social sciences, scholars (Jackson, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512462513">Johnson, 2005</xref>), geographers included, have had difficulty locating a language of love. Not having the words to speak about love and the spaces associated with love is significant. It means that love – and all the emotionality associated with love – has been passed over for topics that are associated with rationality and reason. Emotions have been subordinated in western thought and associated with the body and the feminine. The phrase ‘love is blind’ reminds us that to be emotional is to be affected, reactive and ‘less able to transcend the body through thought, will and judgement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed, 2004a</xref>: 3). It is not surprising, then, that love has caused academic anxiety. Sally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512462513">Munt (1998</xref>: 18) suggests that love is ‘a contentious term to invoke, a discomforting concept within … academic work, as it is associated with unanalysed feeling, and imaginary enchantment’. Similarly, Margaret Toye makes the point that:
<disp-quote>
<p>within contemporary theory generally, and feminist theory more particularly, the subject of love usually evokes embarrassed responses similar to what the formerly taboo topic of sex used to elicit. Unlike the discourse of sex, which evokes the risqué and the transgressive, the topic of love suggests a conservatism or even a denial of politics, not to mention an aura of naïveté, sentimentality and religiosity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512462513">Toye, 2010</xref>: 40)</p>
</disp-quote> In the 1970s, it was deemed acceptable for second-wave feminists to subject love, at least heterosexual romantic love, to a feminist agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512462513">Comer, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512462513">de Beauvoir, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512462513">Firestone, 1972</xref>). They argued that love is an invention of patriarchy and obscures gender inequalities and women’s oppression in intimate heterosexual relationships. This early feminist theorizing has been critiqued for its unequivocal and uncritical focus on heterosexual relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512462513">Jackson, 1993a</xref>). The ‘heterosexual nature of love was taken as given. These analyses of love did, of course, contain within them an implicit critique of heterosexuality, but this was not their explicit object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512462513">Jackson, 1993a</xref>: 41).</p>
<p>Jackson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512462513">1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512462513">1993b</xref>, 1995, 2010) makes important contributions to feminist understandings of love. Linking her ongoing interest in sexuality to the social construction of emotions, she argues that love is a product of social and gendered relations. Jackson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512462513">1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512462513">1993b</xref>, 1995) thinks about emotions as discursively produced and as experienced at the level of our subjectivities. In this way, the feelings, emotions and sensations of love are conceptualized not simply as internally felt subjective experiences. Instead, love, she argues, is theorized as a set of competing discourses, meanings, rules and practices which help give shape and form to sexual experiences, subjectivities and relationships. Love is a site of women’s and men’s complicity within heteronormative and patriarchal relations, but it can also be a site of resistance and subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512462513">Jackson, 1995</xref>). In her more recent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512462513">Jackson (2010</xref>: 99) notes that there is ‘still relatively little written about the meaning of love in everyday heterosexual relationships’, and considers the paradoxes of maintaining a feminist critique of heterosexual love while still recognizing that love is highly valued by many. One of us – Carey-Ann – explores this contradiction through the space of the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512462513">Morrison, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512462513">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309132512462513">2012</xref>). Critically examining ‘love (and the discourses surrounding romance) involves being both sceptical and open to the possibilities of love outside limited and limiting discourses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512462513">Johnston and Longhurst, 2010</xref>: 52). Jackson (2010: 99–100), like us, cannot answer the question ‘what is love?’ in any absolute way; rather, love ‘has many meanings and it is common to distinguish between types or kinds of love - forms of love proper to different objects (lovers, children or friends)’. Similarly, in <italic>All About Love</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512462513">hooks (2000</xref>: 7–8) writes that love is ‘a combination of care, commitment, trust, knowledge, responsibility and respect’. Rather than defining love, we think it is more productive to ask ‘what does the language of love do and how does power circulate in the name of love?’.</p>
<p>One of the most sustained sociological examinations of love is by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512462513">Johnson (2005</xref>), who examines the intersections of love, sexuality and gender. Using data from in-depth interviews with 24 men and women of a variety of ages and class backgrounds, Johnson investigates how heterosexuality, as both a subjectivity and set of social practices, is brought to life through love relationships. His aim is to ‘explore how romantic love is enmeshed in the construction of a particular way of ‘being’: specifically, how love forms a dynamic process for producing practices and identities deemed heterosexual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512462513">Johnson, 2005</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>Studies across the social sciences and humanities, including gender studies (Stevi Jackson, 1993a, 1993b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512462513">1995</xref>, 2010; Sue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512462513">Jackson, 2001</xref>), sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512462513">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512462513">Giddens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512462513">Jamieson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512462513">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512462513">Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132512462513">Lindholm, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512462513">Schäfer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132512462513">Swee Lin, 2008</xref>), leisure studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512462513">Herridge et al., 2003</xref>), masculinity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512462513">Allen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512462513">Redman, 2002</xref>), migration and mobility studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512462513">Frohlick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512462513">Gorman-Murray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512462513">Mai and King, 2009</xref>), psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512462513">Burns, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512462513">2002</xref>) and philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512462513">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512462513">Irigaray, 1996</xref>), have built on these early feminist studies and have developed new critical perspectives on a variety of forms of love.</p>
<p>As the above snapshot demonstrates, much of the existing work dedicated to investigating love focuses primarily on romantic love – love that likely involves embracing, touching, sex, kissing, caressing, bonding, sharing and caring – between heterosexual couples. Such work presents a useful intervention into the literature, but at the same time it risks reproducing a narrow, idealized and limited version of love as only associated with spaces and subjectivities of traditional romantic love. This is despite recent suggestions that modes of love and loving in late-modern detraditionalized societies have undergone fundamental changes with new patterns and forms of intimacy emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512462513">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512462513">Giddens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0309132512462513">Weeks, 2000</xref>). Increasingly, it has been acknowledged that it is not just sexual and romantic, but a variety of personal relationships – friendship, kinship, communities – which provide love in a progressively globalized world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512462513">Bell and Binnie, 2000</xref>). Moreover, there are now studies on different ways of ‘doing’ love including: non-monogamous relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309132512462513">Robinson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512462513">Wilkinson, 2009a</xref>); non-cohabiting relationships or families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512462513">Holmes, 2004</xref>); and relationships via the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0309132512462513">Valentine, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars are now exploring love, whether familial, sexual, religious, or the love of environments, without necessarily translating it into other concepts, such as care, labour, trust, commitment, Self-Other relationships and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512462513">Jónasdóttir, 2010</xref>). This opens up the way for questions such as ‘what does it mean to do something in the name of love?’ and ‘how does love form subjectivities, boundaries, spaces and places?’ to be at the centre of academic inquiry. The small but growing body of work that considers the spatiality of love is considered in the next section.</p>

<title>III Where is love?</title>
<p>Geographers first began using the language of love in the 1990s (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309132512462513">Tuan, 1974</xref>) when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512462513">Hay (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512462513">1992</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512462513">Bell (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512462513">1994</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512462513">Robinson (1994</xref>) engaged in a heated discussion about heteronormativity. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512462513">Hay (1991</xref>) offered a conception of people-love and place-love, he drew primarily on normative heterosexual practices and expressions: marriage, family and domesticity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512462513">Bell (1992</xref>) reacted to Hay’s article, claiming that the model of love put forward excluded sexual minorities and reinforced heteronormative and sexist concepts of people and place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512462513">Robinson (1994</xref>) entered the debate, attempting to clarify Hay’s argument, pointing out that by identifying one particular, normative form of love ‘he [Hay] tacitly recognizes love’s existence in differently constituted human relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512462513">Robinson, 1994</xref>: 84). This early hotly contested love dialogue can be credited with opening up a space in geography to discuss the intersections of love, sexuality and space.</p>
<p>For two decades, feminist, social and cultural geographers have shown a keen interest in sexuality, sex and space, focusing on a wide range of topics which occasionally includes discourses of love (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512462513">Gabb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462513">Johnston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512462513">Wilkinson, 2009a</xref>). For example, the connections between nature, love and heterosexuality can be seen in work on romance and wedding tourism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462513">Johnston (2006</xref>) contends that weddings are an important public performance of normative heterosexual love for each other and nature. They are ‘powerful markers of a couple’s normality, morality, productivity and appropriate gendered subjectivities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462513">Johnston, 2006</xref>: 192). The representation of New Zealand, alongside other tourist destinations such as Costa Rica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512462513">Frohlick and Johnston, 2011</xref>), as some of the world’s ‘pure’ nature spaces, for example, romanticizes the wedding, the couple and love. In these powerful tourism representations, heterosexuality is made to appear as ‘natural’ and as timeless as the environment in which it is celebrated. A connection can be seen here with Jo Little’s (2003, 2007) insights into rural spaces and heterosexuality. Her discussion of New Zealand’s ‘rural love train’ – which takes ‘city women’ to ‘country men’ for a night of entertainment – reinforces the links between rurality, nature and heteronormativity.</p>
<p>There is also a handful of geographical studies that problematize the normative love often associated with heterosexual couples. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512462513">Walsh (2009</xref>) in ‘Geographies of the heart’ examines British expatriates in Dubai referring to transient love and sex. These sexual entanglements challenge normatively domesticated heterosexual love relationships as they are institutionalized in British society. Walsh notes that many of her respondents felt ‘trapped’ in their heterosexual relationships and hence used migration as an opportunity to distance themselves, both materially and metaphorically, from domesticated couple relationships.</p>
<p>Making love and home-making are examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512462513">Morrison (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512462513">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309132512462513">2012</xref>) in her study of the spatial relationship between heterosexuality, love and home. She upsets taken-for-granted romantic notions of love in order to challenge the naturalness and normality of heterosexuality. Drawing on data from individual and joint semi-structured interviews, solicited diaries and self-directed photography with 14 heterosexual couples who live in Hamilton, Aotearoa New Zealand, Morrison offers an in-depth, critical and nuanced analysis of sex, love and home.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512462513">Bell and Binnie (2000</xref>) consider love and intimacy in relation to sexual citizenship, marriage, fidelity, friendship, and family. They suggest that by reworking what we mean by love, family and friendship we may also be able to envisage new forms of citizenship. Drawing on interviews with people who seek to challenge normative notions of intimacy through their rejection of monogamy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512462513">Wilkinson (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0309132512462513">2010</xref>) questions neo-conservative rhetoric which promotes monogamous coupledom as the ultimate source of care and love, and as connected to the ‘good’ of society. She argues that a rejection of the idea that care, love and responsibility are always associated with spatial proximity – living in the same house – has the potential to rework intimacy as it is currently understood. Her doctoral research on ‘Queering love’ involved using a blog to elicit responses from research participants, as well as providing a space to answer questions about love, sex and romance. Wilkinson contemplates the meaning of love in her first blog post:
<disp-quote>
<p>So to me normative coupledom was never something I wanted, it never made any sense, it filled me with horror. I don’t want to privilege new sexual partners over old friendships. I don’t want to have to compromise the ties and connections I already have. Love should be more open than that … I don’t want sexual/romantic love to be somehow seen as more important than other loves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512462513">Wilkinson, 2009b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote> It is still rare for geographers to reveal their own feelings, or emotional and embodied experiences (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512462513">Longhurst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0309132512462513">Valentine, 1998</xref>), yet it seems to us that writing about what love can do lends itself to these autobiographical approaches. Perhaps, too, given our roles as critics of hegemonic constructions of geographical knowledge, it is difficult to find feminist and/or queer geographers who explicitly articulate their love for the discipline. Gillian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512462513">Rose (1993</xref>: 15), in her important text <italic>Feminism and Geography</italic>, reflects on feeling ‘seduced by men’s systematic and exhaustive claims on our meanings and realities’ and desperately wanting to be part of the academy. Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512462513">Rose (1993</xref>: 16) notes: ‘I still do not feel part of it. I think that this is a shared experience: many women participate uneasily in the academy.’ Like Rose, then, we think this ‘love’ for geographical knowledge and the academy is – without a doubt – paradoxical for feminist geographers.</p>
<p>Similarly, this paradoxical position is occupied by feminist geographers when they come out as mothers because the boundaries between work and family blur. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512462513">Ekinsmyth et al. (2004</xref>) explain:
<disp-quote>
<p>love seems to change all, but despite this, love is not on the agenda in feminist geography, geography or academic endeavour in general, perhaps because it is so frequently the subject of the arts. The personal and transformative consequences of love for our children are different from those of the love that we might experience for another independent human being. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512462513">Ekinsmyth et al., 2004</xref>: 103)</p>
</disp-quote> Staying with mother-child love, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512462513">Gabb (2004</xref>) examines the complex boundaries between mother-baby and adult-lesbian sexual love. Mother-children love and adult-sexual love is usually differentiated by the absence/presence of passion and desire. In the course of her research on lesbian parent families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512462513">Gabb (2004</xref>) demonstrates the artificiality of this distinction. She explains how in attempting to describe their love for their children, mothers repeatedly said that they love their children ‘to bits’, want to ‘eat them up’, and feel ‘utterly passionate’ towards them. This particular language of love challenges the traditional sexual-sexless boundaries between parents and children. Gabb continues to extend scholarship on love by examining the ‘Enduring Love?’ of couple relationships (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove">http://www8.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Moving geographers to think about ‘love’s travels and traces’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien (2004</xref>) – with love on her mind and the feeling of ‘being in love’ – picks up the work of French feminist Luce Irigaray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512462513">Irigaray and Martin, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien (2004</xref>) is encouraged by Irigaray’s psychoanalytical approach and refusal to polarize self/other and subject/object, and her transformation of ‘I love you’ to ‘I love to you’. This linguistic shift brings about an intersubjective relationship between the ‘I’ and the ‘you’, ‘such that neither party is possessing or possessed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien, 2004</xref>: 45). For feminist geographers, this encourages a rethinking of ‘love, feeling our way in or out of all love’s guises’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien, 2004</xref>: 47). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309132512462513">Thien (2011</xref>) therefore draws attention to love as an ontology. She makes the point that if love is deemed to be a form of emotional knowing by which feelings and sensations are given meaning and made meaningful then love itself is an ontology. ‘Love makes intimate knowledge of particular places, is comprised of specific spatial practices, and attaches one to another, whether in affection or despair’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309132512462513">Thien, 2011</xref>: 316). As an ontology, love gives particular meaning to the production of feminine subjectivities. For Thien, it is the uncritical and universalizing association of women with love, which makes studies of love’s spatiality so deserving of critical attention.</p>
<p>Moving beyond romantic love, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0309132512462513">Wylie (2009</xref>) considers lost love in Mullion Cove. Sitting on memorial benches perched on cliffs overlooking the sea, Wylie decides that:
<disp-quote>
<p>the benches at Mullion Cove are about absence and love – and in this sense more widely about memory. They are visible makers or material manifestations of memory and love – very often they are put there precisely in loving memory. Remembering love, that is, and not just commemorating it, keeping it alive in other words, because remembering is a sort of loving. But once memory and love are even mentioned in this way, then just as with all the absences constitutively at work in the apparently seamless present landscape, so the purity of these terms is straightaway ghosted: remembering/forgetting, loving/losing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0309132512462513">Wylie, 2009</xref>: 278)</p>
</disp-quote> This non-representational phenomenological perspective allows Wylie to explore emotion as intrinsically difficult, if not impossible, to articulate. Sometimes focusing on unnameable emotional qualities associated with loss and love, Wylie’s work seeks to emphasize that which cannot be represented in words. The benches at Mullion Cove, therefore, allow for a different conceptualization of self–landscape relations, one that allows us to think about love in and through landscape as precarious, and the momentariness of interpretations. While this non-representational approach does not address the way in which power circulates, it prompts geographers to think specifically about the relationship between place, love and memory.</p>
<p>Other geographers have focused on love of animals and the making of pets. For example, some human families have ‘furry children’ that shape domestic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512462513">Fox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512462513">Nast, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512462513">Power, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132512462513">Tuan, 1984</xref>). Heidi Nast notes that pet love discourse (and its materiality) is so pervasive that people:
<disp-quote>
<p>with no affinity for pets or those who are afraid of them are today deemed social or psychological misfits and cranks, while those who love them are situated as morally and even spiritually superior, such judgments having become hegemonic in the last two decades. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512462513">Nast, 2006</xref>: 896)</p>
</disp-quote> She links this new form of love with globalization, race and elitism, asking ‘why are the most commodified forms of pet love and the most organized pets-rights movements emanating primarily out of elite (and in the US, Canada and Europe) ‘white’ contexts?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512462513">Nast, 2006</xref>: 898). Nast’s account of pet love pushes geographers to think about love at the intersections of non-human, gender, sexuality, race and capitalism.</p>
<p>In ‘nature spaces’, animal loving can sometimes extend to involve sex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512462513">Brown and Rasmussen, 2010</xref>, on human-horse sex) or erotic swimming with dolphins as affirmation of the love of ‘nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512462513">Besio et al., 2008</xref>). The challenge for geographers – and their love of animals – is to ‘seek to make nonhumans visible in order to ensure that their material (and in some cases, emotional) needs are not unthinkingly ignored or automatically placed below our own’ (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512462513">Johnston, 2008</xref>: 646).</p>
<p>Also addressing love that exceeds ‘the human’ is David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512462513">Ley (1974</xref>), who argues for the love of God and a Christian perspective which offered a challenge to Marxist geographers during the 1970s. More recently, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512462513">Cloke (2002</xref>: 593) employs the concept of ‘agape’ – the Christian concept of love as charity – as a moral code which reverses ‘the natural order of power – prioritizing the weak over the strong, the neighbour over the self, love over hatred’. The power of the ‘love of God’ has been a focus for a study of young evangelical Christians who participate in faith-based international volunteering projects in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512462513">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). This type of ‘God love’ reproduces a particular kind of subjectivity based on the necessity of a collective Christian ideal. The hegemonies of a Christian love ideal, however, have yet to be held up to scrutiny by geographers.</p>
<p>While these aforementioned scholarly contributions on love indicate that there has over the past few years been rapidly growing interest in this subject area, it seems to us that in many studies of love (but certainly not all, especially those carried out by geographers) some researchers are still failing to appreciate that ‘bodies that feel love’ do so in particular <italic>spaces</italic> and <italic>places</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512462513">Johnston and Longhurst, 2010</xref>). It is important to think about love as a spatial process because bodies cannot be divorced from the spaces and places in which they are constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512462513">Longhurst, 1997</xref>). It is through the body that we connect with and experience place. This is one area in which geographers can make a significant contribution to theorizing love relations. Thinking about the ways in which different places and spaces affect <italic>how</italic>,<italic> when</italic>,<italic> why </italic>and<italic> what</italic> people love reduces the possibility of an uncritical, placeless and essentialist account of bodies that love. We turn to this issue, in more depth, in the following section.</p>

<sec id="section4-0309132512462513">
<title>IV Spatiality, relationality and politics: developing geographical research on love</title>
<p>Having reviewed some of the existing social science (including geography) literature on love, we now offer some suggestions that might prove fruitful for furthering understandings of geographies of love. These suggestions are by no means the only potential areas of research; rather, they are meant to be indicative of the types of approaches, angles, topics and themes that could be explored in relation to geographical studies of love. We hope they act as a starting point for generating discussion, and encourage others to take an interest in love. There are three themes in relation to love that we think are potentially very useful – spatiality, relationality and politics. We address each of these in turn.</p>
<p>To restate the obvious, to geographers at least, we think it is vital to ask ‘what does love do to places and vice versa?’. Bodies are shaped by love and in the process become oriented to others – other objects, people and places. Some acts of love are deemed accepted, are enshrined in law and celebrated in particular places – such as heterosexual weddings. In these wedding spaces, love becomes a symbol of respectable femininity and masculinity as well as citizenship.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, we do not think that love is something that can be treated as a given, essential and buried deep within us, but instead feelings of love change and manifest differently in different spaces and places. Love, space and place are mutually constituted. For example, the act of ‘making love’ may feel different in the privacy of one’s bedroom than in a public park. Also, it is important to note that feelings of love not only change over space but also over time. The love a child feels for a parent and vice versa is likely to vary over the lifecourse. While temporality is not our concern here, the point remains that love can only ever exist within specific spatial and temporal contexts.</p>
<p>Not only do material places affect feelings of love, but so too do discursive spaces, such as representations of love in film, on billboards, in magazines and on the internet. For example, two of us are currently working with a doctoral student, Cherie Todd, who is carrying out research on players’ experiences (online and offline) of love and romance in the multiplayer online role-playing game ‘World of Warcraft’. People’s experiences of love do not just happen in ‘real’ space. Discursive spaces, including spaces of information communication technologies, are not separate or disconnected from the ‘real’ world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512462513">Kitchin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In an article entitled ‘Heterosexuality and digital foreplay: Cell phones and the culture of teenage romance’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512462513">Cupples and Thompson (2010</xref>: 2) explore ‘one highly gendered form of teen sociality facilitated by cell phones and their multiple convergences, that of dating and participation in the heterosexual economy’. They examine text messaging as it functions as a precursor to ‘meeting up’ or ‘going out’. The study highlights many implications of cell phone use in the construction of teenage femininities. They conclude that the ‘text message and the emotional, symbolic and material processes associated with its composing, sending, reading, forwarding, and deleting might consolidate existing gender relations and identities, or they might rework them in subtle or extraordinary ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512462513">Cupples and Thompson, 2010</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>Understanding more about how love is an affective bond between people and through technological interfaces such as the internet and cell phones is therefore important. Space is experienced through the loved and loving body, and the body is situated in space. Sometimes spaces are ‘real’, sometimes discursive, sometimes psychoanalytic and imaginary. The ways in which people ‘play out’ scenes of love in their thoughts, fantasies and dreams play an important role in shaping desires in ‘real’ world situations. Within psychoanalysis, love is deemed crucial to the formation of individual subjectivities, social groupings, and notions of civilization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2004a</xref>: 125) draws on Freudian psychoanalysis to show the ways in which love becomes a ‘form of dependence on what is “not me”, and is linked profoundly to the anxiety of boundary formation, whereby what is “not me” is also part of me’. Love, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132512462513">Freud (1961</xref>), is crucial in the pursuit of happiness, and in the process makes individuals ‘exposed to, and dependent upon another, who in “not being myself”, threatens to take away the possibility of love’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed, 2004a</xref>: 125). Paying attention to the way people think about love, desire love and imagine love could offer new insights into how they/we love ourselves, others, places and nations.</p>
<p>At a recent Association of American Geographers Conference in New York City, 24–28 February 2012, there were four sessions (16 presentations) on ‘Geographies of Love’. The papers ranged across a number of spaces and topics including: online infidelity; households; love in Ho Chi Minh City, Mumbai and Taipei; asexuality; lesbian parenting and mobility; family and friendship; love of (white-dominated) places; soldiers’ love-bonds and therapeutic spaces; state-sponsored coupledom; migration; childcare spaces; pets and population change; sex work; and Christian youth volunteering in South America. This suggests to us that it is indeed timely to consider love.</p>
<p>We think that the spatiality of love can usefully be combined with considering relationality. By this, we mean thinking through the relations and spaces <italic>between</italic> and among individuals, groups and objects. Two authors whose work can help here are Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Sara Ahmed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512462513">Sedgwick (1999</xref>), although perhaps best known by geographers for her work on queer theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512462513">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309132512462513">1997</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512462513">Brown et al., 2011</xref>, on how Sedgwick’s work has been taken up by geographers), offers a relational approach to emotion, affect and more-than-representational geographies of love. She seeks to go beyond what she refers to as ‘paranoid thinking’ (thinking that reduces all theoretical investigations to the power relations that are already ‘known’) and ‘paranoid love’ (which she describes as the most ascetic form of love that demands least from its object) to consider instead the possibilities of pleasure, hope and love which, she insists, are never autonomous but always relational, plural and multilayered. Sedgwick’s final book <italic>Touching Feeling</italic> (2003) illuminates the boundaries that we all tread as critical social, cultural, feminist and queer geographers. She asks scholars to be open to a reparative stance that makes space for love, hope and possibilities, and refuses to know too much. Rather than being suspicious and dismissive of social scientists, the reparative stance allows us to be receptive and hospitable, inspired to care for the world and its inhabitants (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512462513">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Sedgwick’s work entitled <italic>A Dialogue on Love</italic> (1999) is a type of cancer journal which combines storytelling, emails, therapist notes, poetry and prose. While her breast cancer is the trigger for the book, it is as much about love as it is about illness. She notes that her form of care is a type of love that is ‘unconditional but also not quite love’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512462513">Sedgwick, 1999</xref>: 260), and in doing so she conceptualizes love as a large circuit of desire that is open to possibilities. Many of us who have relied upon, and been inspired by, Sedgwick’s scholarship were deeply saddened by her death in 2009. In keeping her scholarship close to our hearts, we might understand that these feelings of loss sweep beyond that of love for an individual and towards thinking about love as a circulating energy. Sedgwick’s pathology and performative approach allows us to be guided into imagining diverse geographies of love. Victoria Lawson’s (2007) important article on geographies of care and responsibility is a good example of the way in which to map out some of these circuits of love. She asserts that ‘care ethics also demands attention to emotions and affective relations (of love, concern, and connection) because of the complex ways in which power is embedded within them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512462513">Lawson, 2007</xref>: 3). Using Sedgwick’s terms, we can then understand how geographies of love and affection exist in multiple directions, relations and manifestations.</p>
<p>Sara Ahmed also offers a reading of emotion, and of love, that is relational. In her book <italic>The Cultural Politics of Emotion</italic> (2004a) she addresses emotions (including love), objects and orientations, but also space, time, directionality, bodies and proximities. Ahmed develops a phenomenological model of emotions as being ‘directed’ towards objects. She argues that ‘Emotions [including love] are relational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed, 2004a</xref>: 8). While some theorists have argued that emotions are tied primarily to bodily sensations (e.g. Descartes), others have argued that they are tied to cognition and judgment (e.g. Aristotle). Still others argue that emotions are sensations and tied to cognition. Ahmed, however, makes a case that emotions, again including love, are shaped by contact with objects. She explains: ‘Emotions are both about objects, which they hence shape, and are also shaped by contact with objects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed, 2004a</xref>: 7). Her work opens up possibilities not just for thinking about love between and among individuals but also between individuals and objects. Consider, for example, the relationship that some people come to have with a piece of jewellery such as a ring. Rings are often used to symbolize a relationship with a partner or sometimes with God, such as a ‘Christian promise ring’ that symbolizes a promise someone makes before God. Objects (such as rings) can become hugely invested with a range of emotions. Examining the relationality between an individual and objects is one way of furthering geographical work on love, and Ahmed’s work provides a useful platform for this.</p>
<p>We think that Ahmed’s work (2003, 2004a) is also useful for helping geographers consider further some of the politics of love. Take for example, her research on multiculturalism and national identity where she examines the ways in which love of an individual person, object or place can be transferred to a collective. Using the example of ‘hate groups’, who have renamed themselves as ‘love groups’, in the USA, she demonstrates how love is crucial to how people align themselves with an ideal, an alignment which she suggests relies on the existence of others who have failed to live up to this ideal. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2004a</xref>: 122), love ‘is narrated as an emotion that energizes the work of such groups; it is out of love that the group seeks to defend the nation against others, whose presence then becomes defined as the origins of hate’. Here we see the intersection of love and politics where the personal is very clearly the political. Cultural geographer Divya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309132512462513">Tolia-Kelly (2006</xref>: 214) brings geographers closer to Ahmed’s (2004b) scholarship by reminding us that affective economies are ‘defined and circulate through and within historical notions of the political, social and cultural capacities of various bodies as signified rather than those specifically encountered, felt, loved, loathed and sensed’. Love gets transferred onto some groups, objects and nation states and becomes a way of bonding with others in relation to particular ideals and hegemonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512462513">Ahmed, 2003</xref>). Inequalities are expressed vividly and spatially through these forms of love/hate bonds.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2004a</xref>: 124) draws attention to collective love, where she explores the ways in which ‘the pull of love towards another, who becomes an object of love, can be transferred towards a collective, expressed as an ideal or object’. For example, love can be understood as producing a heterosexual ideal that some bodies move towards and other bodies move away from. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2004a</xref>) suggests that those who fail to live up to the norm, in this instance anyone who deviates or ‘moves away’ from monogamous heterosexual couplehood, work to affirm the ideal. These discussions about love being normatively mapped on to the spaces and subjectivities of heterosexuality alert us to the fact that love is always political.</p>
<p>Other work that we think is useful in helping geographers think through the politics of love is that of Lauren Berlant. Like Ahmed, Berlant considers what love does in constructing political communities of insiders and outsiders. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2004a</xref>) asserts that love does not equal justice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512462513">Berlant (1998</xref>: 282) considers the way in which a sentimental politics ‘builds worlds: it creates spaces and usurps places meant for other kinds of relations’. This work has been helpful for thinking through the affective economies and geographies of mother activism. Geraldine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132512462513">Pratt (2007</xref>: 435) picks up the work of Ahmed and Berlant to consider the affective economies that circulate in and through Philippine ‘families who have been separated for many years as a result of the Live-in Caregiver Programme’ in Canada (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512462513">Pratt, 2012</xref>). Thinking through the relationship between emotion and political activism allows for an examination of the power of love as productive, exploitative, manipulative and even ineffectual.</p>
<p>In ‘Love, a queer feeling’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512462513">Berlant (2001</xref>) draws attention to the contradictory possibilities of love. For Berlant, love’s ‘oxymoronic structure’ allows it to be subjectively felt by individuals and expressed through normative convention; ‘repetition and uniqueness are the antithetical qualities that make up the experience of love’ (p. 437). Love has a specific form but retains enigmatic qualities. Berlant is interested in the conventions that bind affects to forms and suggests that the ‘installation of romantic love as the fundamental attachment of humans has been central to the normalization of heterosexuality and femininity in consumer culture; it has become a way of expressing desires for normal life’ (p. 440). Berlant finds it surprising that love’s conventionality is continually undertheorized by queer theorists as they map love on to sexuality. Indeed, Berlant (p. 443) thinks that ‘love is a site which has not been queered enough’ and seeks more from love as an analytical concept than resistance to norms and conventions. Importantly, this scholarship is informed by notions of ‘sentimentality’ as a:
<disp-quote>
<p>public form of intimate sociality where love’s aura of authenticity and claim for recognition shape sentimental stories about democracy … [as well as] a therapeutic mode that organizes even the feminist-inflected fantasy of what being normal might be like, if it could only be achieved and enjoyed unambivalently. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512462513">Berlant, 2008a</xref>: 28)</p>
</disp-quote> Beverly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512462513">Skeggs (2010</xref>) picks up Berlant’s ideas and turns to reality television – <italic>Wife Swap</italic> – in order to examine women’s domestic labour and the commodification of affect. The creation of new markets, she argues, relies on harnessing love and sentimentality with the aim of intervening in intimate, emotional and domestic spaces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512462513">Berlant (2008a</xref>) proposes that the love object is a magnet for desires, something we do not want to possess but to which we desire proximity.</p>
<p>Berlant, in later work, builds on ‘Love, a queer feeling’ to develop a concept of love as ‘properly political’. She says: ‘Many kinds of interest are magnetized to the rhythm of convergence we call love’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512462513">Berlant, 2011</xref>: 684). Love, Berlant argues, has the capacity to be a magnet that ‘could cluster around it a genuinely realistic and visionary set of transformations’ (p. 690). It seems then that love is political in that it cannot be extracted from contestatory relations but, according to Berlant, it can also be used <italic>explicitly</italic> as a political concept.</p>
<p>Thinking about love in the ways described by both Ahmed and Berlant destabilizes many of the binaries that have long been used in relation to love, such as love and hate. Bell and Binnie (2001: 138) make the point that ‘it seems that the anger/love dichotomy set up is a false one: isn’t anger part of love?’. Dominant discourses (re)produce idealized and romanticized notions of love and tend to link them to positive feelings, emotions and sensations; yet where there is love there is also hate, shame, fighting and emotionally charged discussions. Focusing on a diverse range of different kinds of love offers ways of destabilizing the binary logic that underpins the institution of love – for example, the divisions between love/hate, as already mentioned, but also proximity/distance, absence/presence, inside/outside, self/other, mind/body and so on. As Deborah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien (2004</xref>: 43) suggests, ‘Love enacted as a politics of (im)possibility blurs mental and visceral experience, moving us beyond the everyday metaphysics of mind versus body to a more complex and intersubjective reading’. While the critique of normative romantic love has been the subject of some geographers’ work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512462513">Gorman-Murray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462513">Johnston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512462513">Little, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512462513">2007</xref>), other forms of love have received less scholarly attention (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512462513">Gabb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512462513">Johnston and Longhurst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462513">Thien, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512462513">Wilkinson, 2009a</xref>; see also Wilkinson’s love research blog, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://queering-love.blogspot.co.uk">http://queering-love.blogspot.co.uk</ext-link>) and could certainly be developed more, drawing on the work of theorists such as Sedgwick, Ahmed and Berlant.</p>

<title>V Conclusion</title>
<p>Rather than resisting love, we ask geographers to consider more deeply what love does. Love is an emotion and affect that constrains and frees us on a daily basis. We think, therefore, that research on love can offer new and exciting possibilities in the fields of social, cultural, feminist, queer, embodied, humanist, phenomenological, non-representational, and emotional and affectual geographies. We are interested in what bringing geographical perspectives to bear on the relations of love can offer to understandings of power, knowledge and social relations between people, space, place, objects and politics. It has not been our intention to provide an exhaustive review of work on love in geography, but rather to identify some of the issues that may be useful when thinking about the relationship between love, space and place in order to push existing work further.</p>
<p>We argue that understanding love as spatial, relational and political opens up possibilities for geographers to consider love in all sorts of different spaces, places, configurations, blends and guises, as organic and inorganic, and as being about people and objects. It is vital that we begin to examine the multiple configurations of love, such as: love of cars, home and clothes; love of activities such as hiking, shopping, exercising, teaching, gaming and fighting; love of living things such as pets, siblings and friends.</p>
<p>It is evident that there are many kinds of love, just as there are many objects and spaces of love such as: love between a parent and child; love of a sibling or friend; love of an animal or pet; a spiritual relationship; love of a particular object or activity; love groups (which are often about hate); and love of one’s country, kin or place. These types of love are distinctive in character, politicized in that some ‘loves’ are deemed to be ‘in place’ while others are ‘out of place’, and performed in a variety of ways and spaces. They can, of course, intersect with other kinds of love, including romantic love, in numerous ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512462513">Gabb, 2004</xref>). Expressions of love beyond the heteronormative are also intimately bound to our subjectivities, but are sometimes seen as less important or legitimate than romantic love. Certainly, such forms of love are marginalized, even stigmatized, in popular culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512462513">Bell and Binnie (2000</xref>) stress the need to reformulate what love means outside the boundaries of heteronormativity.</p>
<p>There are exciting possibilities ahead for geographers who are willing to ‘fall for love’ as a subject of academic inquiry and the adoption of new methodologies may assist the spatial turn to love. For instance, in the study ‘Enduring Love?’, participants use ‘emotion maps’ to illustrate their affective economies of home spaces. Emoticon stickers are placed on a floor plan to highlight where and what kind of love interactions take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512462513">Gabb, 2010</xref>). Taking an autobiographical approach to explore feelings of love (or not) for the discipline of geography would provide feminist geographers, for example, with critical insights into the constructions of geographical knowledge. One of our PhD candidates, Elaine Bliss, is exploring the value of digital storytelling as a methodology for researching geographies of emotion and affect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512462513">Bliss (2009</xref>) considers the ways in which emotion and affect circulate within digital storytelling workshop spaces, how subjectivities are produced in the digital storytelling workshops, and how the spatial and temporal flows of emotion and affect create corporeal and ethereal geographies. The digital storytelling workshop spaces allow for the circulation of feelings such as love, lost love and grief.</p>
<p>For too long now, love has been conflated with romantic love. Most people in the West, and many beyond, have grown up being continuously exposed to images in the media and popular culture which present an idealized and essentialized version of romantic love – a version that is heterosexual and monogamous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512462513">Johnson, 2005</xref>). It seems that, wherever we go, romantic love ‘forms the background noise of our everyday lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512462513">Redman, 2002</xref>: 54). The concept of love needs to be widened. Romantic love is most commonly ‘thought of as a merging of selves, it presupposes the prior existence of two distinct selves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512462513">Jackson, 1999</xref>: 115). We argue that people are not distinct selves, and loving is not just about merging or blending. It is always already relational, inseparable. Moreover, the discourses of romantic love are often normatively mapped on to the spaces and subjectivities of heterosexuality. Heterosexual romantic love and its spaces constitute each other as ‘natural’, ‘normal’, moral and proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512462513">Hubbard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462513">Johnston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512462513">Little, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512462513">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512462513">Morrison, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512462513">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>We think more work is required to consider the intersections of love as it is experienced, performed, felt and shared by a variety of people. The embodiment of love – in all its multisensory lived, felt and contradictory experiences – needs to be part of critical geographical studies. We suggest that one way of doing this is paying attention to the spatiality, relationality and politics of love. Some studies will no doubt focus more on one or two aspects of this line-up than others. Regardless, we think that there is value in these concepts, especially as articulated in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512462513">Sedgwick (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132512462513">2003</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512462513">Ahmed (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462513">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512462513">2004b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512462513">Berlant (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512462513">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512462513">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512462513">2011</xref>), and we look forward to others developing new agendas and projects on ‘geographies of love’.</p>
