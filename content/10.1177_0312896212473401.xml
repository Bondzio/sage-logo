<abstract>
<p>This is the first paper to study the market response to “Joint Ore Reserve Committee” –compliant announcements made by Australian mining firms. Results from an event study based on matched firms suggest that these announcements are highly value relevant, with the market reacting in a significantly positive way to both exploration and resource announcements. Larger abnormal returns are found to accrue to smaller firms, to firms that use positive adjectives in their announcement headlines and to firms whose announcements imply larger percentage increases in resource levels. We also find evidence of markets anticipating both exploration and resource announcements a few days before they are released, which may be suggestive of some insider trading.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In this paper, we undertake the first empirical investigation into how share prices react to exploration, resource and reserve announcements made by Australian mining firms. Exploration, resource and reserve announcements are defined by the Joint Ore Reserve Committee (JORC) and contain data that is important to mining firms, as they provide important insights into the companies’ future geological asset bases. We believe that it is important to gain a better understanding of how the market reacts to the release of this information, particularly in Australia where the mining industry is a very important component of the economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0312896212473401">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0312896212473401">Ferguson et al. (2011a)</xref> suggest that the successful evaluation of exploration and mining firms requires that investors and equity venture beyond the familiar territory of financial statements, and into the analysis of complex geological reports that cover such matters as metal purity levels, drilling intercepts and geochemical composition. They may find these reports difficult to decipher, leaving them incapable of effectively evaluating these firms. As a consequence, signals released by mining firms may not be appropriately assimilated into the market price by investors. We suggest in this paper that for the majority of pre-production mining companies, the most important corporate announcements involve the release of information relevant to the estimation of their mineral resources and ore reserves. Event studies analysis in this study shows that investors quickly respond to these announcements released by mining firms, and that exploration and resource announcements are highly value relevant for exploration firms.</p>
<p>Key findings from this paper show that firms releasing exploration or resource announcements experience a significantly positive abnormal return of between 2.05% and 3.24% in the period from 10 trading days before the announcement to 20 trading days after the announcement. These results confirm that the release of such information is generally considered by the market to be good news. Significant abnormal returns are witnessed in the three-day window leading up to the information release window, showing a level of price anticipation of the exploration or resource results being announced, although to some extent this may be confounded by the market reaction to previous announcements. Our findings suggesting anticipation of announcements may be consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0312896212473401">Poskitt (2005)</xref>, who hypothesizes that exploration stocks are likely to be prone to insider trading.</p>
<p>Regression results used to explain the cross-sectional variation in returns at the time of an announcement suggest that exploration announcements with eye-catching headlines containing positive adjectives are associated with larger abnormal returns. This finding is consistent with textual analysis studies undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0312896212473401">Loughran and McDonald (2010)</xref>, who find that the language used by management in announcements has an impact on abnormal returns. One explanation for the favorable reactions to positive language is that mining firms often use their disclosures as a vehicle for self-promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212473401">O’Shea et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results differ to prior research in the oil and gas literature, which finds that there is little or no association between reserve disclosure and share price, as investors do not react to managements’ estimates of future reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0312896212473401">Clinch and Magliolo, 1992</xref>). Our results show a positive price response to exploration and resource disclosure, and provide evidence of a positive relationship between the announced percentage increase of a firm’s resource base and the abnormal returns.</p>
<p>The structure of the paper is as follows: in Section 2 we summarize the limited capital market publications dealing with the mining industry and make some predictions for the variation in announcement effects. Section 3 discusses the data sources and methodology used in this study. Section 4 presents the empirical results of how the market reacts to exploration, resource and reserve announcements. Section 5 provides us with the opportunity to summarize the results and to suggest opportunities for further research.</p>

<sec id="section2-0312896212473401">
<title>2. Prior literature and predictions</title>
<p>A review of the literature reveals a surprisingly small number of market-based studies that use data from the mining industry. To our knowledge no studies have examined the market reaction to the release of geological results by mining companies. However, several studies have highlighted the importance of non-financial disclosure to mining firms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0312896212473401">Ferguson et al. (2011b)</xref> report that exploration firms have operational and financing characteristics that differ significantly from those of similar sized non-resource firms. These differences include lower profitability and higher information asymmetry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0312896212473401">Ferguson et al. (2011a)</xref> show that non-financial information has greater value relevance to mining firms than financial information when it comes to predicting firm failure. Exploration, resource and reserve announcements are potentially the most value-relevant disclosures made by mining firms, and have not previously been the subject of empirical research.</p>
<p>The literature has also emphasized the need for a greater understanding of the effects of announcements in the mining sector. Several studies have shown that announcements by mining firms can have significant second-order effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0312896212473401">Ferguson and Crockett (2003)</xref> investigate the information transfer effects that occurred when a major discovery by one miner impacted the market value of miners with nearby exploration tenements. The firms that experienced the greatest impacts were those that got the most press coverage at the time, but these firms subsequently experienced the greatest underperformance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0312896212473401">Brown and Burdekin (2000)</xref>, using event study methodology, found that the spectacular fraud and subsequent failure of Canadian explorer Bre-X in 1997 resulted in a large drop in value across the whole Canadian mining sector, particularly for small miners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0312896212473401">Magness (2009)</xref> used event study methodology to examine the impact of an environmental accident at the Placer Dome mine on the market value of other Canadian mining companies. Magness finds that the disaster caused an overall decline in the value of mining companies, but the decline was less for companies with environmentally conscious management.</p>
<sec id="section3-0312896212473401">
<title>2.1. Oil and gas literature</title>
<p>The most voluminous literature on firm disclosure within the extractive industry undoubtedly deals with the accounting reporting requirements for oil and gas companies. Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0312896212473401">Magliolo (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0312896212473401">Harris and Ohlson (1990)</xref> find little or no association between the release of additional information required by the FASB (Financial Accounting Standard Board) on the value of proven oil and gas reserves and security prices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0312896212473401">Clinch and Magliolo (1992)</xref> propose that this weak association is due to investors putting much greater weight on the less encompassing but more substantive production numbers, indicating an unwillingness to act on estimates provided by management.</p>
<p>The institutional setting in which our study takes place differs in key areas to that which underpins the US oil and gas literature. As the majority of the firms in our sample are non-producers, investors are unable to act on production numbers, leaving estimates of resources as the most significant piece of value-relevant information disclosed. In addition, the JORC code regulating resource estimations is standardized, and this can be expected to increase the confidence investors have in the estimates provided by management. With these key differences in mind, we hypothesize that JORC-compliant mining exploration, resource and reserve announcements will be associated with large, positive abnormal returns on the announcement days. This differs from the weak value relevance found in the US oil and gas literature.</p>
<p>It is important to be mindful that that there are a number of factors that make announcements by mining companies significantly different to announcements by firms in other sectors. The remainder of this literature review outlines some of the issues and factors that must be considered in a study of announcements by mining companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0312896212473401">
<title>2.2. Pre-announcement anticipation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0312896212473401">Poskitt (2005)</xref> recognizes the important distinction between exploration firms and producing firms, and hypothesizes that exploration firms are more likely to be engaged in insider trading violations than producing firms. Geological results typically pass through many hands within, and often outside, a firm before being compiled and released to the public. Consequently there is an increased likelihood of insider trading within exploration firms, and so we expect to observe an anticipation of results in the event window prior to announcements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0312896212473401">
<title>2.3. Hype</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212473401">O’Shea et al. (2008)</xref> find that where more frequent disclosures are made by small Australian mining companies, the daily share price volatility is increased. This led them to conclude the announcements are often used to influence the market, or to engage in self-promotion, rather than to provide actual information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0312896212473401">Ferguson and Scott (2011)</xref> also investigate the self-promotion of mining firms, and find that resource presentations at conferences and mining clubs lead to significant positive share price returns in the short term. Positive returns were observed even when no new information about the firm was provided to the market in these presentations. These results are broadly consistent with the spin hypothesis, which proposes that when firms promote good news it leads to an increase in price that will be maintained until the release of additional evidence that allows correct inferences to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0312896212473401">Ferguson and Scott, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our expectations are that some managers may use the release of exploration results to draw attention to their firms in a manner similar to that suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212473401">O’Shea et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0312896212473401">Ferguson and Scott (2011)</xref>. While the precise JORC definition of exploration results is detailed in Section 3, it is important to note that exploration results are preliminary estimates, and are not easily quantifiable. As such it is very difficult for the common investor to judge whether exploration results are positive or negative. Managers may include positive adjectives in an announcement to create a positive impression. Examples include the use of ‘brilliant’, ‘outstanding’ or ‘bonanza results’, rather than less emotive terms such as ‘drilling results’ or ‘exploration update’. The link between managers’ word choices and abnormal returns has been shown to exist in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0312896212473401">Loughran and McDonald (2010)</xref> and other textual analysis studies, which show that investors are sensitive to the tone of words used in financial reports. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212473401">Solomon (2011)</xref> shows a positive link between the use of spin by firms hiring investor relations firms and abnormal returns surrounding announcements. In the absence of easily quantifiable data in announcements, it is expected that the use of positive adjectives in the headlines of exploration announcements will be associated with larger positive abnormal returns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0312896212473401">
<title>2.4. Resource estimates</title>
<p>Firms are required under the JORC to provide resource estimates that have a “reasonable level of certainty regarding future extraction”. It is possible to calculate the increase in the firm’s resource base associated with each announcement. In the studies of oil and gas literature no association was found between resource size and returns. However, this could be because any analysis that focuses exclusively on resource levels fails to take account of the economic characteristics of the deposit, the risk associated with extraction, the time required before the project can be undertaken and numerous other technological and political risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0312896212473401">Spear, 1994</xref>). However, this literature applies to US companies and the JORC has stricter requirements about how the level of resources is to be measured and so we would expect to see a positive correlation between the magnitude of any resource increase extracted from an announcement and the realized level of abnormal returns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0312896212473401">
<title>2.5. Other influencing factors</title>
<p>Other factors that we would expect to impact on how the market reacts to announcements by mining companies include firm size and the frequency with which the firm makes announcements. We predict that firm size will be negatively associated with abnormal returns, with smaller firms having more to gain from the announcement of new exploration or resource results. Larger firms are likely to have a range of projects, whereas small firms will often only have a single project. Consequently, a positive announcement by a small firm will be more likely to result in a substantial resolution of information asymmetry. Firms that have not made any exploration or resource announcements recently are more likely to release new information to the market, possibly resulting in price rises. Thus we would expect a negative relationship between the frequency with which a mining firm makes announcements and the impact of those announcements on the firm’s stock price.</p>

<title>3. Data and methodology</title>
<sec id="section9-0312896212473401">
<title>3.1. Definition of the event</title>
<p>Australia has a well-structured and reliable system for the reporting of exploration results to investors and this makes it possible to use an event study methodology. The reporting framework that governs announcements made by firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) requires that companies operate under a regime of continuous disclosure. Under this regime, an entity must immediately inform the ASX of any information that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity’s securities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0312896212473401">ASX, 2009</xref>). The announcements made by mining companies are subject to a code of disclosure established by the JORC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0312896212473401">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The JORC code was first released in 1989, with the latest edition being finalized and included in the ASX listing rules on 17 December 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0312896212473401">3</xref></sup> Since that date, Appendix 5A of Chapter 5 of the ASX has required listed companies to prepare exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves estimates in compliance with the JORC code. This code states that a company must disclose to the market any relevant information concerning a mineral deposit that could materially influence the economic value of that deposit, and that a company must promptly report any material changes in its mineral resources or ore reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0312896212473401">JORC, 2004</xref>). Thus these announcements should contain information relevant to the pricing of the underlying securities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0312896212473401">
<title>3.2. Data collection</title>
<p>The dataset for this study uses JORC-compliant exploration, resource and reserve announcements from ASX listed firms between 17 December 2004 and 31 December 2008. This sample period was chosen to comply with the current regulatory system, as the pre-2004 JORC code provided a different framework for reporting. The JORC-compliant announcements were obtained from SIRCA using a company announcement (Signal G) keyword search over the 2004–2008 period. The keyword used was “JORC”, as each announcement is required to include a statement to the effect that the report has been compiled in a JORC-compliant manner. The announcements were assigned to one of three categories: exploration results, mineral resource and ore reserves. These categories are clearly defined in the JORC code, as explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0312896212473401">Figure 1</xref>. As the three stages are discrete steps in the exploration life cycle, it is important that each stage be studied as a separate corporate event.</p>

<p>Data required for the event study and regressions was sourced from DataStream, from which we obtained daily prices, market capitalization, turnover, market-to-book ratios, daily bid and ask prices and level 6 Industry Classification Benchmarks (ICBs) for all ASX listed mining companies over the sample period from 2004 to 2008. The ICB is a system that classifies stocks by industries: it has been developed by Dow Jones and the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange (FTSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0312896212473401">ICM, 2009</xref>). In total, our sample companies are spread over 11 different industry categories, with the most frequent being General Mining, Gold Mining, Nonferrous Metals and Iron classifications. This code is used as the basis for matching companies. This is an important part of our event study methodology, as explained in a subsequent section. Firm age and operating revenue was sourced from FinAnalysis. Data relating to the size of the resource announced and prior firm resource levels was hand collected from the resource announcements.</p>

<title>3.3.1 Exploration result announcements</title>
<p>Exploration result announcements are defined by the JORC code as “including data and information generated by exploration programmes that may be of use to investors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0312896212473401">JORC, 2004</xref>: 8). The data made available is generally insufficient to allow any reasonable estimates of the extent of the mineral resources. Examples of exploration results include results of outcrop sampling, assays of drill-hole intercepts, geochemical results and geophysical survey results. Exploration results are announced to the market as they become available to the firm. As such there is no forewarning of the dates on which these announcements will be made.</p>
<p>We compiled a sample of 1378 exploration announcements consisting of drilling results, assays and other eligible announcements. The announcements came from 307 unique firms. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0312896212473401">Table 1</xref>, the frequency of exploration result announcements was found to increase over the sample period, consistent with previous evidence which indicates that the level of exploration tends to increase with commodity price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0312896212473401">Mohn, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As exploration results are the first stage in the discovery of a minable resource, the firms making these announcements can often be characterized as having low market capitalizations and poor liquidity. They are usually relatively young firms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0312896212473401">4</xref></sup> The summary statistics show that the median market capitalization of firms announcing exploration results is a tiny AUD$33.3 million, and that the median number of days on which a stock included in our sample trades is 23 days during the 31-day event window.</p>

<title>3.3.2 Mineral resource announcements</title>
<p>The JORC code defines a mineral resource as:
<disp-quote>
<p>…a concentration or occurrence of a mineral of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0312896212473401">JORC, 2004</xref>: 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As such, the reporting of a mineral resource will be made after sufficient exploration has been carried out to provide the firm with a reasonable level of confidence that they will proceed to the extraction stage.</p>
<p>We identified 678 mineral resource announcements made by 272 unique firms. As with the exploration sample, we found that the frequency of resource announcements increased over the sample period during which commodity prices were increasing. As mineral resource announcements are made at a later stage in the life cycle of a mining firm than exploration announcements, firms issuing resource announcements are likely to be larger. This is confirmed by the information contained in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0312896212473401">Table 1</xref>, which shows that companies making mineral resource announcements had a median market capitalization almost twice that of companies making exploration announcements.</p>

<title>3.3.3. Ore reserves announcements</title>
<p>An ore reserve “is the economically minable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0312896212473401">JORC, 2004</xref>: 14). Before announcing an ore reserve, appropriate assessments and studies must have been carried out, and exploitation of the resource must have been shown to be justified on economic and other grounds. Ore reserve announcements are only made after resource announcements have been made and significantly more research and exploration has been conducted. Ore reserve announcements are made much more sparingly, as they indicate that the company has mining production in mind. As a consequence, there were only 99 ore reserve announcements made during the sample period by 46 unique firms. As these announcements are made much later in the life cycle of a mining company, the summary statistics show that firms making reserve announcements are on average almost four times larger than resource announcing firms and six times larger than exploration-announcing firms. The reported statistics further show that reserve announcing companies trade slightly more frequently than companies making exploration or resource announcements.</p>

<title>3.4. Event study methodology</title>
<p>An event study methodology has been used to determine the stock price reaction over a period of time straddling the JORC-compliant announcements. The time period over which we report in this paper is from 10 trading days (i.e. two weeks) before the announcement to 20 trading days (i.e. four weeks) after the announcement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0312896212473401">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0312896212473401">Barber and Lyon (1997)</xref> developed a methodology for conducting event studies based on matching each firm subject to an event (e.g. making an exploration announcement) with a similar firm not subject to the event. An industry-based matched firm methodology was considered to be the most suitable market model for conducting an event study in the mining industry due to the return characteristics of mining firms differing from broader market returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0312896212473401">Ball and Brown, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0312896212473401">How, 2000</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0312896212473401">Tufano (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0312896212473401">Twite (2002)</xref> both find a strong correlation between mining company stock returns and underlying commodity prices. Thus, matching was conducted within the same level 6 ICB groups, to control for commodity price effects. The ICB level 6 classifications segregate firms based upon the general commodity in which they deal, allowing an announcing gold explorer to be matched to another gold explorer. The matched firm chosen was the closest size-matched firm within the same ICB level 6 category that traded for a minimum of 10 days over the event period.</p>

As noted previously, the announcements of exploration results are made early in the firm’s life cycle at a time when it is not possible to estimate the economic value of what has been identified. Any exploration result that increases the amount of a commodity expected to be found in a tenement is likely to increase the commodity base of the company; however, it is not possible to identify how the announcement will affect the market’s expectations. Encouragingly, the concerns of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0312896212473401">Czernkowski and Ferguson (2006)</xref> do not seem to be an issue. Although the announcements contain highly technical data, the market has responded in a significant and positive manner, in a timely fashion, with no significant reversion or drift in unreported tests. Longer event windows were also examined, with no significant drift or reversion being observed post announcement. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0312896212473401">Poskitt’s (2005)</xref> view that exploration firms are likely to be subject to increased insider trading appears to have support, as the pre-announcement abnormal CAR is statistically significant when measured over the three days (0.844%) prior to the announcement. These findings support the existence of significant anticipation of the announcements.</p>

<p>Resource announcements are made once sufficient exploration has been undertaken to be confident that a commercially viable prospect has been identified.

Of course, we do not know whether an announcement provided any new information and how it compared to the market’s expectations.

<title>4.1.3. Reserve results</title>
<p>Ore reserve announcements represent the end of the exploration process, when all of the work needed to proceed to extraction has been undertaken. The fact that we have only been able to identify 99 announcements over a four-year period indicates just how rare they are in comparison to resource or exploration announcements. As seen in the descriptive statistics, the median company making a reserve announcement is much larger than the median firm making a resource announcement. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212473401">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0312896212473401">Figure 4</xref> display reserve announcement results. There is a positive, yet statistically insignificant abnormal return on the announcement day, with no significant returns observed during the event window. As such it would appear that very little new information is provided by the majority of reserve announcements. This is not surprising, as a reserve announcement is an economically viable estimate based on the resource estimate of a firm, and as such there is a significant overlap between reported resource estimates and subsequent reserve estimates. This could mean that very little new information is presented in the majority of reserve announcements, as the market is able to estimate the reserves based on prior resource announcements. In addition, reserve announcements are often preceded by the company seeking funding, during which time feasibility studies and other important information might be disseminated. Thus there is less surprise surrounding reserve announcements compared to exploration and resource announcements.</p>

<p>To summarize the event study results, the market has responded in a positive and significant way to the release of exploration and resource disclosures by Australian mining firms. Abnormal returns in excess of 2% on the day of the announcement suggest that, unlike findings in the oil and gas literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0312896212473401">Clinch and Magliolo, 1992</xref>), JORC-compliant exploration and resource announcements are clearly value relevant. The market has been able to quickly respond to these announcements, which suggests that despite the highly technical nature of the reports, investors are still able to quickly evaluate and react to the information content. Exploration and resource announcements are associated with significantly positive pre-announcement returns, with the anticipation of announcements being possible evidence of insider trading. The results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0312896212473401">Poskitt (2005)</xref>, who outlines reasons for suggesting that exploration firms are more likely to be subject to insider trading breaches.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212473401">Table 3</xref> reports the results from the estimation of the ordinary least squares <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0312896212473401">equation (5)</xref> for the exploration announcement sample. As predicted, and in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212473401">Solomon (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0312896212473401">Loughran and McDonald (2010)</xref>, the use of positive adjectives in the announcement headline has a positive and significant impact on the exploration announcement abnormal returns. The fact that the information provided does not enable an exact quantification of the exploration results creates a difficulty in determining whether announcements containing positive adjectives reflect better geological results or the use by firms of catchy headlines for self-promotion purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212473401">O’Shea et al., 2008</xref>). However, the insignificance of the <italic>POSADJ</italic> variable in the resource sample suggests that when results are easily quantifiable, there is no association between word usage and returns. This result provides an interesting insight into the regulation of exploration results, with managers being restricted in their ability to report geological data, but being free to describe the results in whatever way they like.</p>

<p>Also of significance in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0312896212473401">Equation (5)</xref> is the momentum of resource prices captured by <italic>CRB</italic>, suggesting that when resource prices are appreciating during the period leading up to an announcement, the abnormal return attached to the announcement is likely to be smaller. This is likely to be due to the higher returns experienced by the matched firm when commodity prices are escalating, resulting in smaller abnormal returns being measured. Consistent with previous predictions, smaller firms are also found to have significantly higher abnormal returns. This reflects that smaller firms are likely to have fewer projects in development and so a positive exploration announcement has a significantly greater impact on the overall value of the firm. Finally, firms that experience higher market turnover in the period immediately prior to making an announcement enjoy a larger market response to the exploration announcement, which suggests that firms that receive more market attention are more likely to have the new information traded on.</p>

<title>4.2.2. Resource announcements</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212473401">Table 3</xref> also reports results from the estimation using the ordinary least squares <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0312896212473401">equation (6)</xref> for the resource announcement sample. As resource announcements are easier to quantify than reserve and exploration announcements, the use of positive adjectives in the headlines in resource announcement is much less common, and as such this sample does not see a significant response to the use of positive adjectives. It is much more common for resource announcement headlines to read “resource increase 75%” or “resource doubles”, with the variable <italic>RESINC</italic> capturing the increased resource base that has been announced. The positive coefficient attached to the <italic>RESINC</italic> variable, although not statistically significant, is large and it is an interesting finding given the relatively small sample size. It also suggests that there may be a more direct relationship between the reported increase in resources and the share price movement than was found to be the case in the oil and gas literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0312896212473401">Spear (1994)</xref> explains that resource and reserve volumes alone are an inadequate measure of a company’s exploration success or value. Resource amounts alone do not take into account the different economic characteristics of the deposit, the purity of the mineral, the risks involved in extraction, the time required before the project can be undertaken and numerous other technological and political risk factors. Thus it is often found in the oil and gas literature that the size of reserves and estimated increases in the size of reserves do not directly translate into predictable share price movements.</p>
<p><italic>INIT</italic> is a dummy variable capturing the first time a miner makes a resource announcement. It is expected that a firm’s first announcement will resolve much of the existing information asymmetry and thus it can be seen as a positive landmark for the firm, and therefore the impact of the announcement is predicted to be positive. This is confirmed in our finding that there is a significant positive relationship between the initial resource announcements and the abnormal returns realized on the announcement day. Finally, in results similar to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0312896212473401">Equation (5</xref>, the <italic>CRB</italic> control variable is negatively significant in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0312896212473401">Equation (6)</xref>. We believe this is due to the higher returns experienced by the matched firm when commodity prices are appreciating, resulting in a smaller abnormal return being measured.</p>
<p>Overall, the multivariate results are broadly consistent with expectations. Firms that experience the highest abnormal returns after announcements are smaller firms, firms making their first resource disclosure, firms that use positive adjectives in the headline and those that are announcing large increases to their resource level.</p>

<title>4.3.The timing of announcements</title>
<p>We initially outlined the expectation that firms that have not made any exploration or resource announcements recently are likely to release more new information to the market, leaving scope for larger price changes. Thus we expected a negative relationship between the frequency with which a mining firm makes announcements and the impact of those announcements on the firm’s stock price. The regression results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212473401">Table 3</xref> report the expected negative coefficient; however, no statistical significance is attached to the finding. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0312896212473401">Table 4</xref> reports the results of exploration and resource announcements conditional on whether an announcement had been made in the prior 20 days.</p>

<p>It would appear that the market reaction to an exploration announcements is unaffected by the release of another exploration announcement in the previous 20 working days. The market reaction to resource announcements was found to be similar both at the time of the announcement and during the post-announcement period. The patterns of price adjustment were unaffected by whether there had been a prior announcement. The one instance where we do see a prior announcement making a difference is in the reaction to resource announcements in the period immediately before the information release. This may reflect that during this period we are picking up some of the continuing reaction to the prior announcement.</p>
<p>Overall, we conclude that based on the regression results and subsequent event study, the timing of announcements does not have a substantial impact on the market reaction to exploration and resource announcements. Some firms may release regular exploration updates, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212473401">O’Shea et al. (2008)</xref>, to try and build momentum in their share price and keep their firm in the spotlight, while others will release results in a slower and less regular fashion, resulting in a larger resolution of information asymmetry and price movement upon release, with these two explanations largely cancelling each other out. Another interpretation of our findings is that there is only very limited evidence of our overall findings being contaminated by the release of information in the period immediately prior to the one for which we are gauging the market reaction. However, the evidence that we do have for resource announcements suggests that some of the behavior that appears to be an anticipation of the announcement may in fact be a reaction to a previous announcement. This raises the question of whether there is any significant anticipation of these announcements.</p>

<title>5. Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>We made the point earlier that there appears no way of determining in advance the market’s expectation as to the information content of exploration announcements by mining companies. Our proposition is that the market will respond in a positive way to the exploration, resource and reserve announcements by mining companies, as we believe that they are akin to good earnings announcements made by non-mining companies. Our findings confirm the importance of these announcements to investors, as the market responds very positively to the release of both exploration and resource announcements. Our inability to detect any market response to reserve announcements may simply reflect that our reserve announcements sample size is too small to unearth any significant relationships. Alternatively, it may be that all that reserve announcements do is affirm information that is already in the marketplace due to the high overlap between the information contained in resource announcements and reserve announcements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0312896212473401">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>We examined several mining company characteristics and market characteristics to evaluate how they impact on the market reaction to exploration and resource announcements. For exploration announcements, we found that the greatest excess returns were associated with announcements made at a time of low market sentiment for mining companies by relatively small companies that have recently been enjoying high turnover and that use very positive language to promote their claims. In the case of resource announcements, the greatest market reaction occurs for firms making their first resource announcement, again at a time when general market sentiment is low.</p>
<p>There are two particular findings from our analysis that might be of particular interest to the regulators. Firstly, we find some evidence to suggest that the market might be able to anticipate the release of exploration and resource announcements. This finding is consistent with the proposition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0312896212473401">Poskitt (2005)</xref> that mining companies are subject to more insider trading than is the case with non-mining companies. With geological information having to pass through multiple hands within and sometimes outside the firm before being released to the market, there is a great potential for the information to be leaked prior to the official release. Secondly, we find that the language used when making exploration announcements has a significant impact on the extent of the market reaction. The JORC code provides a strict framework for reporting geological information, but no guidance as to the words used in the information release. This leaves management free to put a positive spin on their results. The regulators may therefore be well advised to pay more attention to the market activity during the period immediately before the release of exploration and resource announcements and to give consideration to changing the JORC code to provide more guidance as to the descriptions provided in such releases.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings suggest that the current regime for the release of information by mining companies is well appreciated by the investment community, as indicated by their willingness to react to these information signals. However, we have identified two areas of potential concern to the regulators that might suggest grounds for changing the JORC code and/or tightening its implementation. However, it must be recognized that this is only the first study in what is an important area for investors and the Australian economy. Therefore, we encourage further research into the release of geological information by mining companies and, in particular, into the two areas identified as being of particular concern.</p>

With many listed companies conducting exploration overseas while being listed on the ASX, it is possible that in excess of 20% of the world’s exploration budget, amounting to US$2.5 billion, is being spent in Australia and/or by Australian companies.</p>

<p>With the significant majority of exploration research being funded by equity markets, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0312896212473401">Figure 7</xref> (Metal Economics Group, 2009), Australian capital market researchers should be particularly interested in how the market values these exploration projects, and how it responds to their success or failure. The ASX has over 1700 listed companies, of which nearly 800 are mining, energy and exploration companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0312896212473401">ASX, 2009</xref>). These companies represent over 20% of the total capitalization of the ASX, making the ASX second only to the Toronto Stock Exchange as the largest market for listed mining firms. The Australian mining industry was the largest contributor to Australian earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), earning AUD$74.0 billion in 2008-2009, which represented 23.9% of total maret earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0312896212473401">ABS, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>A recent review of the adherence to the JORC code undertaken by the ASX found 6% non-compliance, with the main failure being the absence of competent person compliance statements.</p>

<p>The text of several reserve announcements suggests that this is the case. In addition, in the case of junior mining companies, it is highly likely that they have had to make much of the information “public” in the process of trying to raise funds to develop the reserves.</p>
