<abstract>
<p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is frequently referenced within NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidance and is a recommended psychological therapy for a number of different mental health disorders for both adults and children. This is due to the current body of quantitative research around CBT demonstrating its efficacy for a range of mental health difficulties. However, CBT has not been as well addressed within the qualitative field and this gap in research is even more obvious when looking at CBT conducted with children and adolescents. This interpretative phenomenological study explored adolescents’ experiences of a course of CBT within a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in a one-to-one format. Three female adolescents who had completed an agreed contract of therapy with the CBT service took part in semi-structured interviews. Four superordinate themes emerged from analysis and highlighted components within CBT that were important to the sample. These were engagement, the therapeutic relationship, the impact of CBT on change and the manner in which CBT was delivered. The findings are discussed with relevance to current policy and pertinent literature as well as implications for service delivery and future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over recent years, research with children and adolescents has addressed the efficacy of CBT with this population via a number of quantitative studies. Several reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of CBT with children and adolescents for various disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359104512447032">Barrett-Waldron &amp; Kaminer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359104512447032">Cartwright-Hatton, Roberts, Chitsabesan, Fothergill, &amp; Harrington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359104512447032">Kendall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359104512447032">Kendall et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359104512447032">Sukhodolsky, Kassinove, &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359104512447032">Taylor &amp; Montgomery, 2007</xref>), and many quantitative studies have recently looked at the effectiveness of CBT and CBT programmes for a wide-ranging number of difficulties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359104512447032">Taylor and Montgomery (2007)</xref> conducted a systematic review of quantitative studies and reported that CBT showed promise as an effective treatment for low self-esteem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359104512447032">Sukhodolsky et al (2004)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of studies and found support for the use of CBT with children and adolescents with anger difficulties. Other studies have demonstrated effective use of CBT with children with body dysmorphic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359104512447032">Aldea, Storch, Geffken, &amp; Murphy, 2009</xref>), bulimia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359104512447032">Schapman-Williams &amp; Lock, 2007</xref>) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359104512447032">Smith et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359104512447032">Munoz-Solomando, Kendall, and Whittington (2008)</xref> conducted a narrative synthesis of systematic reviews of CBT exploring the efficacy of its use for particular disorders. They used reviews employed within NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidance and reviews published subsequent to the guideline. They found that the “best evidence for the potential of CBT in children and adolescents is in the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359104512447032">Munoz-Solomando et al. 2008</xref>, p.335). This study was of particular interest as it highlighted the variation in the quality of evidence used to inform NICE guidance between different mental health disorders. Despite this variation, the study asserted the generally positive effect of CBT on a number of disorders such as Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p>In the UK the NICE has issued guidance recommendations for children and young people between the ages of five and 18 which recommends that work done in the initial stages of a referral for mental health difficulty should be generic and involve “clarification of the problem…and locating the child’s depression within a wider psychosocial context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359104512447032">NICE, 2005</xref>, p. 76). However, once it is seen that the child or young person might need more input than ‘watchful waiting’, group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recommended and at the moderate to severe stage individual psychological therapies are recommended, one of which is CBT.</p>
<p>The proliferation and the assimilation of CBT into much of the structure of mental health care in the NHS puts therapists and researchers alike in a position of responsibility to assess the efficacy and acceptability of this approach to those it is being used with.</p>
<p>The use of standardised, quantitative measurement and operationalised intervention strategies in CBT means that it lends itself to systematic quantitative research. Studies may utilise standardised questionnaires targeted at measuring the severity and frequency of problem symptoms, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359104512447032">Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, &amp; Erbaugh, 1961</xref>); Beck Anxiety Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359104512447032">Beck, Epstein, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1998</xref>); and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359104512447032">Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983</xref>). Participants’ scores can then be reviewed at various time points during the intervention to ascertain whether there is an improvement in symptoms. In this way studies attempt to establish the superiority of CBT over a control condition or another therapeutic approach. For these reasons the amount of quantitative research into the use of CBT with children and adolescents by far outweighs the amount of qualitative research.</p>
<p>However, there continues to be relatively little research examining CBT and its use with children and adolescents. NICE guidance issued on the treatment of depression in children and young people noted the paucity and low quality of studies used to inform its recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359104512447032">NICE, 2005</xref>). In addition to this, quantitative research only provides a partial understanding of therapy and there are nuances to the therapeutic encounter that are distinct from its clinical effectiveness and are important to understand.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447032">Graham (2005)</xref> specified four requirements for client motivation to be maintained throughout a therapy such as CBT. Firstly the client needs to identify they have a difficulty, secondly they need to be able to acknowledge that they need help to deal with it, thirdly they must recognise CBT as an option that provides them with a reasonable opportunity for improvement, and finally the client must feel secure in the belief that the therapist is a person who will be able to help them work to recovery. If these are important factors for sustaining engagement in CBT, then understanding from the client’s point of view how such factors are experienced, how they contribute to therapeutic change and how they can be more effectively managed within the therapeutic environment, is also important.</p>
<p>Qualitative inquiry is well placed for probing such areas of interest due to its more flexible employment of data collection, such as semi-structured interviewing. With this in mind the present study aimed to understand how young people perceived and made sense of their experience of CBT, in order to develop an understanding of engaging and working with this age group within a CBT, one-to-one format. The study intended to gather an in-depth understanding of the experiences of a small number of participants to ascertain which aspects of CBT worked well for them and which aspects could have been adapted to improve their experience. This form of qualitative inquiry explores participants’ beliefs, attitudes, thoughts and the meanings of their experiences and is intended to further our understanding of how best to implement CBT with adolescents in a CAMHS setting.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1359104512447032">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The present study adopted a phenomenological and ideographic design to enable exploration of service users’ perspectives on CBT in a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the North West of England. In keeping with this, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359104512447032">Smith, 2004</xref>) was used to guide data collection and analysis. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with participants. The study focussed on how adolescents made sense of CBT and what it meant to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359104512447032">
<title>Sampling and participants</title>
<p>IPA promotes the sampling of small, homogenous samples to enable the interpretative level of analysis to be more meaningful. Participants are “purposively-selected and carefully situated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359104512447032">Smith, Flowers, &amp; Larkin, 2009</xref>, p.29) and are recruited due to their ability to represent a particular perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359104512447032">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). In accordance with this, three participants were recruited from a CAMHS team in the North West of England. Participants recruited into the study met the following inclusion criteria. They needed to: have been aged between 12 and 16 years of age; have completed an agreed contract of therapy with the service; only have engaged in CBT and no other talking therapy concurrently; have been able to converse in English without the aid of a translator.</p>
<p>The sample for this study comprised of three females (mean age 15). Each participant came from the same region in the North West of England but differed in socioeconomic backgrounds and attended different schools. Mary was accessing the service following difficulties with somatic symptoms and anxiety around eating related to this. Katherine wanted help with anxiety related to her perception of her appearance, and most particularly the restricted eating which resulted from this. Samantha accessed the service in relation to her low mood and self-harming behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359104512447032">
<title>Interview schedule and procedure</title>
<p>Ethical and Research and Development approval were applied for and obtained prior to the commencement of the research. An interview schedule was devised to elicit participants’ perceptions of participating in CBT. Questions were aimed both at content, such as the details of the experience, and also at the participants’ reactions to and perceptions of that experience.</p>
<sec id="section6-1359104512447032">
<title>Service user consultation for development of interview schedule</title>
<p>Prior to the commencement of the research, the interview schedule was shown to three service users, within the study’s target age range, in another part of the CAMHS department to assess its appropriateness for use with the target sample. Service users commented on the schedule’s language and comprehensibility and each of them felt that it was understandable and easy to follow. For this reason no changes were made.</p>
<p>Interviews were held either at the CAMHS building or in the participant’s home. Each interview was audio recorded.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359104512447032">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis conformed to the techniques of IPA suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359104512447032">Smith et al. (2009)</xref>. Analysis began with developing a high level of familiarity with each participant’s data. Transcripts were read a number of times and then each transcript in turn was annotated on three levels involving descriptive, linguistic (primarily metaphors) and conceptual comments, although the emphasis within this paper is upon the latter. The preliminary notes were used to develop emergent themes within each transcript, a process that is tied to the original data but also incorporates the researcher’s interpretation of the data. Emergent themes were placed into tables where the connection to the original text was demonstrable, and a narrative theme summary was developed. This was done individually for each transcript prior to the final stage where superordinate themes were developed by examining patterns across all three transcripts’ emergent themes. This generated an understanding of commonalities across all cases, whilst preserving the idiographic aspects of the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359104512447032">
<title>Credibility of analysis</title>
<p>This research has followed criteria suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359104512447032">Yardley (2008)</xref> in order to maximise the validity and quality of the analysis. These criteria are: sensitivity to context; commitment and rigour; transparency and coherence; and impact and importance. At each point of analysis the interpretations made were re-checked for appropriateness of fit with each of the original transcripts, and disconfirming cases analyses were also conducted to ensure that any data that did not corroborate themes was addressed. For example, some of Mary’s experiences appeared on first inspection to diverge from those of the other participants. These instances were noted and examined through disconfirming case analysis. This enabled consideration to be given to the reasons for such divergence, and as a result the themes were enriched by acknowledgement of the commonalities on a higher order level which were more varied on an individual level. The analysis of the researcher was audited by an IPA specialist who supervised the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359104512447032">
<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>From the process of analysis four superordinate themes emerged involving data from all three transcripts. These themes were: (i) conceptualising CBT – impacts on change and progression; (ii) process of engagement and its outcomes; (iii) developing a therapeutic relationship – a model for real life; (iv) the structures of therapeutic delivery. In order to achieve transparency within the analysis the data are grounded in examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359104512447032">Elliott, Fischer, &amp; Rennie, 1999</xref>); each theme is presented with supporting anonymised extracts from participants’ transcripts. Pauses are indicated by ellipsis points ‘…’. Material that has been omitted is indicated by ellipsis points in parentheses ‘(…)’. Pseudonyms are provided for each participant alongside their relevant quotations.</p>
<sec id="section10-1359104512447032">
<title>Conceptualising CBT – impacts on change and progression</title>
<p>All participants expressed that CBT had enabled them to make a change with regard to their difficulties. For some, change was experienced as an absence of the difficulties in their lives resulting from gaining control, which was a direct intention of the CBT techniques employed. For others change moved beyond this and they also experienced a development of their sense of self and character. Such outcomes are more global, and secondary to the problem-focussed targets of CBT. Mary experienced CBT as having enabled her to resume doing things she considered to be normal prior to her illness. This was characterised by activities such as shopping and seeing friends that, although commonplace on the surface, were imbued with meaning for her, and represented sociality, fun and being the same as others:
<disp-quote>
<p>(…) it was just like erm…normal things because (…) it was really just getting back on track after feeling ill every day and stuff, the tasks were more like erm, things like I didn’t I used to go out but like out to places with my friends. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mary’s reference to ‘getting back on track’ suggested a return to a previous state rather than moving forwards or a change in self-perception; in essence, the absence of problems. This is illustrated in the following response from Mary when asked to elaborate on what she meant by gaining control of her problems.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Like well my problem’s like feeling sick a lot and how that affected just daily things and school and things like that so erm I wasn’t always in school all the time but then I was in school all the time d’ya know towards the end [of CBT]. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to this, Samantha conceptualised CBT as enabling a move forward in her life. Similarly to Mary, CBT was a process of learning how to manage her difficulties and gain control, but in doing so she developed a different perspective on situations she encountered, which engendered a general change in her attitude and manner.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Erm, just learning how to deal with the stress I think, yeah learning different like coping methods and strategies and how I’m gonna like cope with things better in the future. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Samantha described CBT as an experience that enabled her to develop independence and autonomy. Her responses throughout the interview indicated that CBT promoted calmness and consideration where previously she felt chaotic and desperate.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t feel as reliant on certain things, I don’t feel like, erm, what’s the word, not bad if they’re not there (…) I don’t feel as desperate if certain things aren’t how they should be. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This change then drew a line in the sand; on one side Samantha’s previous life and difficulties lay, and on the other side was the future. Samantha emphasised that CBT enabled a growth in her personality and nature and so for her CBT was more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) it makes me feel better about myself because I know that I’ve, think I’ve like closed the door on that part of my life to be honest, moved on from that. (…) because it has helped me, I think it’s helped me to like grow as a person in general. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Katherine CBT was experienced as a development of new perspectives, both on life and the future. Katherine began therapy with a negative self-view and a pessimistic view of the future, which was starkly contrasted with her perspective at the end. This is perhaps why her focus in conceptualising therapy was related to the converse of these states – hope, determination and self-compassion. This is illustrated by her response when asked to explain how she would describe CBT to somebody who had never heard of it before.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I suppose it helps you like to find what’s like – help you deal with your problems, like help you find out what you can do to stop ‘em, like give you, like make you determined. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And similarly when she comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>(…) well when I first went it I weren’t confident at all, erm, I was like, wouldn’t open up to no one (…) at first I thought there was no hope, I felt like wanted to kill myself and stuff, so it were quite bad, and then when I kept meeting her and stuff I were like thinking there’s hope, I can get better. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Katherine’s account CBT also enabled her to see her difficulties differently. In turn she was able to re-orient her sense of self in relation to others and the future, and develop a more accepting and balanced perspective.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) before I used to think like erm, I weren’t important, I were just like nobody, erm, I used to think like nothing, I were never gonna get better, erm, I were gonna be ill forever. (…) [Now] I feel like there’s hope for the future, I think I’m gonna be well when I’m older. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Each participant’s self-efficacy increased through developing the skills CBT encouraged, such as cognitive challenging, problem solving and behavioural experiments. On a superficial level each participant conceptualised CBT as a process whereby a change is made and problems can be effectively managed. However, detailed idiographic examination highlighted that the meaning of CBT did not just lie in the change itself but in what that change meant to the participants in the context of their history, their family and their perceptions of the future. This resonates with research on the functional division of “psychotherapy into “input”, “process” and “output” variables” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512447032">Orlinsky &amp; Howard, 1986</xref>, p. 312). If each participant enters therapy with different ‘inputs’ – personal characteristics, different contexts of family, education and culture – it is inevitable that the ‘output’ of the therapeutic process will be different. Within Orlinsky and Howard’s model it is possible to understand both the commonalities in the current sample and the variation. The processes in delivering CBT may be similar and produce a commonality of experience, but the input variable for each participant will produce a different perception of those experiences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359104512447032">Greenberg’s (1986)</xref> three types of patient outcome are also relevant to these findings. Immediate outcomes are those that are specified and evident within individual sessions; intermediate outcomes are changes that take place within each session and can lead to “extra-sessional intermediate changes such as those measured by session outcome measures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359104512447032">Greenberg, 1986</xref>, p. 4); and ultimate outcomes are those representing definitive change.</p>
<p>These participants did not conceptualise the outcomes of CBT as a reduction in difficulty, an intermediate outcome, but rather in terms of the effect of that reduction in a wider sense, an ultimate outcome, such as growth in character, return to normality or development of perspective. This suggests ultimate outcomes, which the adolescent client in CBT wishes to make, might be hiding behind the more obvious, tangible goals set and furthermore, may not emerge until a good way through therapy. This highlights the importance of goal-setting in CBT. Ultimate outcomes that may provide hope and determination to clients may be obscured by a focus on the problem to be addressed and goals that reflect this. A potential service focus for those working with this age group may be around structuring therapy to encourage these secondary and ultimate goals to emerge and to direct the delivery of CBT towards promoting their development. This could be done by adding a more Solution Focussed Approach to CBT in the later stages to address life post-therapy and what that means to the client. In order for the therapist to do any of this though, some consideration needs to be given to the level of engagement, which is apparent in the next theme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359104512447032">
<title>Process of engagement and its outcomes</title>
<p>This theme encapsulates participants’ perceptions of their engagement with CBT. Each participant described a process whereby their levels of engagement with the therapy changed over time as if on a continuum, and individually they provided a picture of the factors that promoted and opposed this engagement. This continuum moved from a point of emotional detachment or lack of decision making, to a point where the participants are effectual and involved in the therapy. In some ways these accounts were influenced by the manner of delivery specific to CBT and in other ways they shed light on the more general experience of engaging in a therapeutic encounter for young people.</p>
<p>Mary described entering CBT with negative preconceptions about therapy and its relevance to her age group, which effected her lack of involvement in the making the decision to access CBT.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) that like it sounds like if you say to someone that you’re going to like behavioural therapy or like whatever it sounds a bit weird at first like not something that really a teenager would want to go to (…) I always thought that somewhere like that was where you go when you’re going mad. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite her initial lack of involvement, Mary exerted a level of subtle and unspoken control within the therapy itself, most notably in her chosen involvement when completing some activities as part of the therapy and not others.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well all like near enough every week she’d say try tomato but I never did but some weeks I’d have like 3 or 4 [tasks to do] so it was alright because I’d just do the others and kinda leave that one to the side. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Engagement for Mary is exemplified by an unspoken negotiation between therapist and client and she demonstrated her level of involvement with the therapy through her behaviour. The therapist appeared to respond to this by reducing or altering their expectations of her engagement.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) sometimes it felt like if I didn’t try it and went she be like, a bit, not angry but like why haven’t you done it sort of thing but some, so like I felt like I had to do it, but sometimes I didn’t wanna try new foods so it was, it was alright and coz I didn’t have to d’ya know like, obviously not a big pile or anything she’d just say, just a little bit so it was alright. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During CBT Mary’s preconceptions were challenged and this highlighted a fundamental change in her engagement levels. She was able to identify CBT as a helpful and worthwhile way for young people to deal with their problems and became more accepting of the approach.</p>
<p>For Samantha the process was characterised by a progression from being rationally engaged but emotionally uninvolved to emotionally investing in CBT. Samantha began the process similarly to Mary, with a lack of involvement in the decision-making regarding accessing the service. She referred to others as driving the help-seeking process.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) coz she [a friend] thought that my self harm was like getting out of control, so she wanted me to see someone about it, so she took me there. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Samantha also described being confused and forgetful regarding the initial stages of therapy. This detachment was a response to her own lack of readiness to address her difficulties and make a change at that time and meant that the nature of CBT, its structure, delivery and purpose, was difficult to grasp. This reinforced her low level of engagement in the early stages as she was unsure what was expected of her within the therapeutic encounter.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think I talked that much, I gave quite small answers coz as I say part of me didn’t really wanna be there and my heart wasn’t really in it, erm, I was rather sceptical. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, as the CBT progressed Samantha became aware of the need to explore the emotional connection to her difficulties in order to deal with them and move on.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) well I think there was a few cases where I really didn’t want to talk about it but we had to like, we had to really nit pick it because we needed to get to the like root of the problems, so I did say the stuff but a lot of me didn’t want to say because obviously it’s like really personal stuff. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Samantha engaging in CBT was therefore a process of accepting her difficulties and moving to a state of readiness to address them.</p>
<p>Katherine began her engagement with the CBT service experiencing a high level of intense emotion that she was no longer able to cope with alone. This contrasts with the other participants who either avoided connecting with their emotions or were already communicating with others about their difficulties.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I went a few months without telling no-one, I lost weight, and then eventually I couldn’t take anymore, so then I told my stepdad. (…) It felt like erm, they were like my problems at first, I thought I couldn’t share them with anyone, I were like ashamed. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Katherine referred to being too ill to participate in the decision about accessing therapy and associating disclosure with feelings of shame, which indicated feelings of ownership over her problems.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) at first I was like really ill, I felt like other people had to make the decisions for me I couldn’t do it myself, then I suppose as I got weller and like a lot better I was able to make like decisions and stuff. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From here Katherine found that the manner in which CBT was conducted promoted the development of her engagement. The graded way in which the therapist encouraged her to approach her difficulties enabled her to steadily develop self-control which led to a feeling of stability.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) she’ll just like say to me like, like try not wearing any makeup for like one day every week, or and it started off like just cutting down coz I used to wear loads and it could be like just not doing my hair for one day a week or something. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Katherine conceptualised CBT as a scaffold supporting her as she built up her capabilities and skills, which enabled her to deal with her problems independently. Her perception was that CBT enabled her to develop hope for the future. The generation of this hope is the point at which Katherine engaged in the therapy and expressed a determination to improve. For Katherine, engagement was a dual process of breaking down her barriers to accessing help and gaining support to start approaching problems in an achievable way.</p>
<p>This theme demonstrated how participants experienced engagement as a process. Each gave accounts that indicated engagement was on a continuum. The factors each participant needed to help them engage were different and so the perception of the process was consequently different. For Mary, a process of negotiation and asserting her independence meant she was able to engage to the extent that she wanted, whereas Samantha had to develop a rational understanding of the necessity of engaging to reach her goals – a cost-benefit analysis in a manner of speaking – and Katherine needed to feel there was hope and a reason to engage to make her determined to get there.</p>
<p>Service contact for young people is often instigated by a parent or guardian and not the young person themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359104512447032">Cresswell &amp; Waite, 2009</xref>). This was supported by the findings of this research and it raises interesting questions about who is in control. Each participant emphasised how glad they were at having completed their course of CBT, despite the fact that none of them were the ones to initiate access to the therapy. This indicates that although these power imbalances may come to exist through the manner in which young people are brought into therapy, they do not have to dictate the course of the therapy and the outcome. Power, and its ability to impact negatively upon therapeutic potential, might therefore be mitigated by a process of collaboration and encouraging the client to negotiate their position in the therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>There are some similarities evident between these findings and with the research published on working with adolescents in a cognitive-behavioural format. As mentioned earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447032">Graham (2005)</xref> highlighted four requirements for adolescents to maintain motivation to engage in CBT: the client needs to identify they have a difficulty; be able to acknowledge that they need help to deal with it; they must recognise CBT as an option that provides them with a reasonable opportunity for improvement; and they must feel secure that the therapist is a person who will be able to help them work to recovery.</p>
<p>Acceptance of difficulties and acknowledgement of the need for help were evident in the engagement processes of each participant. Samantha and Katherine collaborated with their therapists and addressed their difficulties despite reservations, which can be mapped onto Graham’s third and fourth requirements and go some way to explaining their high levels of engagement by the end of CBT. However, Mary’s acceptance of CBT and of the therapist as the person to help her through the process is more reserved than the other participants. This may lend support for Graham’s requirements for motivation as they are clearly factors that were in constant negotiation in Mary’s account.</p>
<p>With regard to service delivery, it seems important that therapists respond to the inevitable power imbalance present when an adolescent enters CBT whilst keeping in mind factors for motivation in the engagement process. These findings indicated that as the participants’ engagement increased, their therapeutic relationship strengthened, and the impact of power was minimised through collaboration. The fully engaged participants demonstrated trust and resolve, which are fundamental to feeling able to address painful and anxiety-provoking difficulties. The real world application of these findings lies in supporting the encouragement of control and motivation in adolescents accessing therapy. Holding Graham’s requirements in mind when working with young people, and considering the continuum-like nature of the engagement process for these young people, could help therapists to identify areas where motivation needs to improve to enable therapy to be more beneficial to the client.</p>

<title>Developing a therapeutic relationship – a model for real life</title>
<p>Analysis identified the importance of the therapeutic relationship in the participants’ accounts, the factors that expedited its development and conversely those that impeded it. Within this theme there were points of convergence and divergence in each participant’s account, but they all indicated the power of the therapeutic relationship to either promote or inhibit the speed of progress. For Mary the process of developing a therapeutic relationship is conveyed as stunted or hindered. This is demonstrated in the references she made to the lack of focus and lack of relatedness to her personal situation in some sessions of CBT.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) for an example she might use someone being scared of dogs and how the thoughts of the dog biting them would make them cross the road (…) it was like relates nowhere near to like feeling sick and how feeling sick affects ya it was nothing near that. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This perceived lack of focus led to Mary being confused and potentially thinking that the therapist was not empathetic to her difficulties and indicated a mismatch between the approach of the therapist and her own style of learning. This interpretation was reinforced by Mary’s suggestion that a younger therapist might have been more helpful to her.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) some of them are really old and it does help if you’re not talking to someone really old so like…it like I think for most teenagers you’d or like young people you’d feel easier to talk to someone who, not obviously dead young, but d’ya know not someone in their 50s or something or like old. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In considering what would make it easier to communicate with someone in a therapist role, Mary indicated a lack of ease in the relationship that she had. She made sense of this unease by reasoning that it was due to age. Of particular interest is that despite these obstructions Mary still considered CBT to have been effective for her and still recommended it as something others her age would benefit from. If Mary were to be included in a quantitative study looking at outcomes of CBT she would demonstrate a successful case. However, this qualitative exploration has enabled a deeper understanding of her experience – she improved by her own subjective standards, but the experience was not all it could have been.</p>
<p>For Samantha the development of a therapeutic relationship was a challenging prospect. She entered CBT with surprise at the therapist’s ability to relate to her situation. This acknowledgement led to her feeling understood and heard from an early point in the therapy and generated a level of trust between the therapist and Samantha.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) it was a bit disconcerting coz she like, not knew about it, but knew how to like deal with all this stuff, which I wasn’t entirely expecting but it was helpful. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Samantha then developed confidence in addressing her difficulties and, as theme two demonstrated, moved from being emotionally detached to emotionally investing in CBT. In order to make that change she needed to feel safe and secure and the language used indicated that she considered CBT to be a collaborative exploration of her difficulties.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) we had to like, we had to really nit pick it because we needed to get to the like root of the problems. (Samantha)</p>
<p>(…) in some cases there was stuff I didn’t wanna say but I felt I had to because it needed to be said and we needed to like sort stuff out. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This description conjures up images of Samantha and the therapist having worked side by side at an equal level to deal with the problems in front of them. In contrast to Mary’s experience, the therapist’s approach and Samantha’s style did match.</p>
<p>For Katherine the therapeutic relationship was an invaluable component to therapy. Katherine had difficulty in opening up to others regarding her difficulties due to feelings of shame around the outcome of her disclosure. She conveyed a sense of isolation as a consequence of this lack of communication. CBT was therefore an opportunity for Katherine to share her painful experiences with someone who could not be hurt by her disclosure.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) well at first I were ashamed like, erm I felt like if I talked to my mum I would upset her more, I couldn’t talk to my sisters because they were younger and they wouldn’t understand, so it were like the person that understood and could help me basically, was her. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The benefit to Katherine of seeing someone objective and uninvolved in her life was equated with permissiveness and enabled the exploration of her difficulties without fear of consequence. However, it also had secondary benefits for her in providing a model for communication that could be generalised outside of the CBT. Katherine highlighted the improved communication she had with the wider systems she was involved with as a consequence of CBT, such as her friendship group and her family.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) it was hard to coz I didn’t wanna upset ‘em, [family] I just kept ‘em all inside (muffled) and then I suppose as time got through the sessions with Ms A helped like to open up with my parents. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Katherine’s descriptions of life after therapy indicated that she had made a perceptual change in her view of disclosure. Previously she saw disclosure as shaming and burdening but after CBT she saw it as a potential benefit both to herself, in helping her to maintain the progress she had made, and to others, in helping them to feel less alone with their own problems.</p>
<p>This theme elaborates the way in which the therapeutic relationship held power for each participant to be a potential tool in itself to promote personal progress through the therapy. The divergence in accounts for this theme was not related to whether or not the therapeutic relationship was important but whether or not it fulfilled its potential.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359104512447032">Lafferty, Beutler, and Crago (1989)</xref> found that lack of therapist empathy, lower involvement from the patient and a more directive approach were associated with less effective therapy, which connects with the difficulties Mary had in forging a close alliance with her therapist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359104512447032">Horvath, Gaston, and Luborsky (1993)</xref> referred to three aspects of a successful therapeutic alliance: the client perceives the interventions are appropriate and effective; the client’s and therapist’s expectations of goals of therapy are congruent; and the client can develop a personal bond with the therapist, who can convey a caring and sensitive manner. For Mary each of these aspects were unfulfilled, which raises the question of whether addressing them would have promoted greater engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1359104512447032">
<title>The structures of therapeutic delivery</title>
<p>A final theme relates to the delivery of CBT above the content of the sessions. Each participant described sessions that lasted around an hour and had an underlying structured format. The pacing, timing and focus of CBT were common factors raised as important in how the therapy was experienced. However, these factors were perceived by each participant in different ways and each of them highlighted different aspects of CBT as the most important feature to them.</p>
<p>Mary described structured sessions with a similar format but with an additional element each week to progress the therapy slightly. From Mary’s perspective, although she could rationally understand the reasons for delivering CBT in this way, the delivery did not fit with her own pace of change.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well like most of the sessions like they were helpful but she’d go over the d’ya know like the same things (…) she might feel you’re not ready but erm…I think she could it could be made more interesting by well not interesting obviously but less boring if they don’t repeat themselves all the time. (Mary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The negative aspects of CBT for Mary were therefore not related to the techniques, interventions and core building blocks of the therapy but rather the manner in which it was delivered.</p>
<p>The timing and pacing of sessions was also evident in Samantha’s account but in a different way. Samantha referred to needing predictability and had come to rely on constancy in her life. In engaging in therapy she could have found the more open nature of other therapeutic approaches confronting and anxiety-provoking. However, the way in which this particular therapist delivered CBT provided structure and boundaries, which enabled her to feel relatively safe. At the same time progression of the therapy was evident and so in itself engagement in CBT was a gradual exposure to change and variation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(…) well I don’t rely on certain things being there, erm, it sounds weird but I don’t like change, its sounds really weird but I’m not gh, I’m not good with like different things as such, but I think I’ve got better with that, kind of (…) I don’t feel as desperate if certain things aren’t how they should be. (Samantha)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Katherine, the timing and pacing of therapy was also perceived positively and the graded and slow pace of the CBT was comfortable and appropriate. This approach enabled a gradual increase in her feelings of control, from a challenging starting point, that in turn provided confidence for continuing the therapy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I went in like not being able to eat anything, so erm, I found it hard, she would like say to me like, try eating like half a piece of toast, maybe not eat dinner but then try having something for tea, or try having little bits for meals rather than like big things. (Katherine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This theme can be linked to the third of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447032">Graham’s (2005)</xref> requirements for maintaining motivation in CBT; recognising that CBT offers a good chance of improvement for the client. The participants either valued the manner of delivery because of its fit with their style of engagement or interaction, or else they found it hindering because it held them back and prevented progression at an adequate rate. This reveals that not only is it important that the adolescents can recognise the potential benefits of engaging with CBT but that the reality then lives up to that recognition. For example, Mary recognised the potential benefits and attempted to engage but was obstructed by the mismatch between the delivery and her own engagement style.</p>
<p>Participants all referred to the value of CBT lying with the techniques they have learned, but underlying this was the importance of the structure of delivery surrounding those techniques. This suggests that buying into the model is only a step in the process and suggests the importance of exploring whether the usual format of socialising people to the CBT model is amenable to the client’s needs. Experimenting with different approaches to this and asking about clients’ learning styles in the initial sessions may improve motivation to engage, for example whether they work best with visual or verbal formats.</p>
<p>The findings presented here lend some credence to the suggestion made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359104512447032">Feehan and Vostanis (1996)</xref> that the attractiveness of CBT to young people might lie in its “definite plan of treatment with a defined end point” (Feehan &amp; Vostanis, p. 179, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359104512447032">1996</xref>) and suggest an explanation for why this is. The structure was not stifling and provided participants with a method for dealing with their difficulties and allowed personality and character development. However, Mary’s account also highlighted the need to deliver CBT in a way that allows the independence of the participant to be promoted right from the start.</p>

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>Research into adolescents’ experience of therapy in general, including CBT, is limited and what there is has usually been quantitative in nature. To date the exploration of young people’s experiences of therapy has been a relatively neglected area but despite this there has been advice about the optimum ways of conducting therapy with young people. The findings of this study have enabled the development of a more detailed understanding of what CBT was like for these adolescents and have attempted to address a gap in research. This is therefore a starting point and the conclusions made are tentative. Future research could build on the limitations of this study by using a data collection strategy which allows clients to be interviewed at different time points throughout their therapeutic experience. The current study was entirely retrospective and as such could have missed opportunities to explore the clients’ insights into their more fleeting or transitory feelings about their experiences, or the fine detail of what they went through. Future research could also consider conducting focus groups as a preliminary stage to examining this area. Such methods could identify key themes whilst allowing young people to interact and build on each other’s thoughts and reflections, providing a more substantial basis for a focussed interview schedule.</p>
<p>This study aimed to explore adolescents’ experiences of one-to-one CBT, with a view to understanding how they perceived working in this way and what CBT meant to them. The findings of this research demonstrate the importance of: the processes of therapy just as much as the content; the mode of delivery of CBT; and the more conceptual ways in which clients might understand their recovery. This has enabled the verification, from these participants’ perspectives, of some existing recommendations for working with this age group.</p>
<p>The current study has generated some recommendations for service delivery that both support and augment existing literature on working effectively with young people. The initial stages of therapy emerged as an important time for assessing the variables that might influence a client’s potential for engagement as the therapy progresses. There emerged a clear need to consider the context surrounding the client presenting for therapy. The therapist may promote the development of the therapy by focussing on the client’s learning style and their preconceptions about therapy. These can then be considered in relation to levels of motivation and help to inform the structure of therapy to promote engagement, for example, whether shorter sessions or a different format is more appropriate. The client’s goals for therapy should also be considered in the context of their more general aims and what impact such immediate outcomes might have on their life in a wider sense. This may help to instil determination in working toward the presence of a desired outcome rather than just the absence of problems.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrated the power of unspoken communication and the ability this has to hinder the development of a therapeutic alliance and engagement if not addressed. The potential for the effectiveness of the therapy may be improved by addressing the silent negotiations that might arise from a client’s behaviour or responses to different aspects of therapy. Lastly the power structures inherent within the therapeutic encounter are amplified in the context of working with young people, but this does not mean that extrinsic motivations for accessing therapy do not result in beneficial outcomes for the client. The service delivering CBT needs to promote the young person as being in control from the outset regardless of who is making the decision to access therapy. This may set the scene for them to develop control over their problems and establish stability in their life.</p>
