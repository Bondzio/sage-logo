<p>It was whilst working as a junior doctor for the Army, 12 months after finishing my second foundation year, that I met with an accident. I came off my motorcycle and a van ran over my chest. I was very badly injured suffering bilateral pneumothoraces, 6 rib fractures, 11 vertebrae fractures, bilateral scapula fractures and a torn aorta. I had a stent to repair my aorta, chest drains for my lungs and my fractures were treated conservatively. I am not going to dwell on my injuries or treatment as this article focuses on my experiences as a patient, and tries to relate them to my ongoing medical career.</p>
<p>I do not remember the accident; indeed, my first memory is being in the emergency department resuscitation room after the insertion of my first chest drain. I did not have a head injury, but ketamine was used early in my resuscitation, so I assume this is the reason for my brief retrograde amnesia. I had always been told to make sure I used a lot of local anaesthetic when inserting chest drains as they are painful. I was fully conscious for my second chest drain in A&amp;E (performed by an SHO), and I have to say that it was not very painful, better than I was expecting. It was after a trauma computerized tomography (CT) scan that the full extent of my injuries was discovered. My particular aortic tear and resultant false aneurism had a 90% mortality. It was necessary to stent the growing aneurism quickly, and a cardiologist came with a consent form for me to sign. I thought he explained the form well, but I was disconcerted as I read the risk of intra-operative mortality was quoted as 10%. My friends, who are also doctors at my level of training, were similarly worried at this figure. My mother, who is not medically trained, seemed quite relieved by this level of risk however. In reality, there was no decision to make, as, untreated, the mortality would be 100%, but it was still alarming to be confronted with this figure. I think this highlights the difference between the public’s perception of risk and that of the medical profession. As doctors, we have a different relationship with risk, being exposed to many similar patients and interventions, whereas patients tend to have a once-in-a-lifetime involvement. As we see many operations, I think we tend to imagine a complication will come round one of these days, maybe every 10th operation; patients just consider their one-off circumstance, and so tend to frame their risk differently. I have become accustomed to thinking of 1% as moderately risky, so 10% represented a significant leap for me. My mother saw a 90% survival as decent odds. I think doctors have to examine their own perception of risk and be mindful of how they convey this to patients. I do not know if you consider 10% particularly high risk, but I bet that a great deal many more people would play the lottery if there was a 10% chance of winning.</p>
<p>I spent the next 11 days after my operation in ITU. My initial trauma chest drains were removed, and after two pleural effusions had accumulated a few days later, bilateral Seldinger drains were inserted by a respiratory registrar. In contrast to the initial trauma drains, these were very painful. Going through my chest wall was not particularly painful, but the positioning was excruciating. I was aware of every agonising twist and turn the wire made, and the pain was worse once the drain was in position. It was a constant sharp pain, exacerbated by every breath I took. It was an unbearable pain, the worst pain of my life, and I could not get away from it. Pain is a remarkable, unusual thing. It is so difficult to accurately remember being in pain, hard to imagine what it is like to be in pain yourself, let alone imagine pain in others. Everyone can appreciate its negative emotional consequences, but it is such an intense physical feeling that it obscures all others. It only exists at that moment, and the only thing you can think of is how to minimise your suffering. The pain of fractures is not so bad, they pretty much only hurt when you move them, and you can distance yourself from a broken ankle. Pain that invades your very core is worse, because it seems inescapable.</p>
<p>I was on a morphine infusion whilst in ITU, and although it was the best thing to control my pain, I did find it quite disorientating. Every morning when I awoke, I thought I had moved bed space during the night, and one morning, I thought I had been flown to Bastion hospital during the night. This feeling was so strong that I had to check with the nurse to make sure it had not happened. I was fully awake and thinking clearly, but I just could not shake those feelings. It was unpleasant. I also experienced visual hallucinations. When I was wheeled to CT once, I saw little monkeys perched atop door frames and curtain rails, and I used to visualise trees quite often. For me, these side effects were worse than the pain, and I preferred to have less morphine and experience a little pain.</p>
<p>My spinal fractures meant that for 4 weeks I had to lie completely flat on bed, not being allowed to sit up or flex my neck, immobilised in a hard collar. I found this hellish. It was the absolute worst thing about my time in hospital. The sense of desperation and helplessness was overwhelming. It affected everything, even the most basic of human needs: eating, drinking, sleeping, toileting, washing, breathing and social interaction. Of these, I found eating, drinking and toileting to be the most humiliating. Lying flat on my back I could not see the food on my plate, I could not wield the cutlery, felt full quickly and I was reliant on others to feed me. It was frustrating because I felt well enough to do it, just unable because of my position. People were mindful of dropping food on my face and collar, and so would construct napkins and tablecloths of paper towels along the route of the food they thought they would drop. Despite this, they still managed to drop food in places. I can remember a young health care assistant trying to feed me, and just being overwhelmed by the wretchedness of it all and quietly sobbing, but he still continued to feed me, and I was grateful. I have not cried as much as I cried during those weeks in hospital. I tried to limit it to early mornings lying in bed before most people had woken up, when no one paid me much attention, but one morning it spilled over until the first nurse came round. She pulled my curtains around, and this was exactly what I wanted, to hide away until I felt better. Sometimes I would cry in front of my parents but not in front of any other visitors. I wept from sheer despair and utter helplessness. Despite it being only a matter of weeks, there were points where I could truly not see any end to it. The repetitive nature of hospital routine did not help me; I now understand the phrase ‘bored to tears.’ The passing of time was bizarre. Each day seemed to bring me no closer to any end point. The weekend before the Monday I was allowed out of bed seemed just as distant as the first weekend in hospital. I had a ‘patient line’ internet screen above my bed, and I relied on counting down the days on Facebook in an attempt to make it feel more real for myself.</p>
<p>I had to drink all of my drinks through a child’s plastic beaker with a straw. The opiates made me terribly constipated, and the laxatives just gave me awful abdominal cramps. When I felt as though I could not go any longer without having my bowels open, I asked for an enema. It worked over about an hour and a half. It was a nasty business of pushing, noises and smells, and I felt sorry for the other inhabitants of my bay, separated from me by only a blue curtain decorated with squares and waves. Of course, during all of this I had to remain horizontal, brace my feet against the bottom rail of the bed, and feel the warm products of the enema accumulate around my supine buttocks. Calling the nurses to change me, and the bed sheets, ranks among the most embarrassing situations I have been in. I feel glad that I was embarrassed though, and had not slipped so far into despondency that I stopped caring.

<p>I found it interesting how small a part the doctors played in my time in hospital. As a junior doctor, I imagined I was important in the running of things on the ward; after all, I was always busy, people always seemed to want me to do things, and I felt visible and available. This was quite removed from how I felt as a patient. More important to me than whether an X-ray was taken was whether my sheets were changed. I would rather the nurses came early in the evening with my tablets so I did not have to be woken up than the doctor spoke to me about whether I had any pain. I prioritised the consultants’ time above all else though. They were the people who gave me the answers to the important questions I had about my long-term health. It felt great to be visited by the consultants, but they came round infrequently. The tea ladies came round six times a day, and would spend roughly 10 min in my bay. I had more contact with them than any doctor, and every time they would bring me something that I wanted and gave me pleasure.</p>
<p>There are few personal dignities in hospital, and therefore when they exist they should be respected. Hospital curtains provide little privacy, but the privacy they do deliver is welcomed. The only people to come behind my curtain without asking were doctors. Unfortunately, I remember doing this as a junior doctor too. When you do not have much time, you need to speak to a patient and their curtain is drawn, you sit down at the nurses’ station, maybe fill out a few prescriptions whilst you are waiting. You look at your watch, you know you have to speak to the consultant radiologist across the other side of the hospital. The patient’s curtain is still drawn, it is been drawn for ages, they have probably just forgotten to open it up. You really need to leave soon, time is running out, so you walk over, discretely stick your head through, so other patients cannot see what is happening, and ask your question. Never mind that they were having a wash, at least you have ticked a job off your list, and you still respected their privacy as no one else saw anything, just you. If a curtain is drawn, it is equivalent to the patient’s front door, and you need to knock.</p>
<p>Working as a doctor you know that nurses work hard, but I did not really appreciate in how many different directions they are pulled. As well as all the visible things like drug rounds and meals and housekeeping, they have to respond to patients’ buzzers and doctors’ demands. It humbled me to see how nurses work, and it is worthwhile to know these things. Doctors like to think that they build a good rapport with patients, but it is nothing to what nurses can achieve. They are so welcome as they supply you with things that make your day more bearable. They do physical things like bring you pain relief, enable you to wash and feed you, and they clearly have more time to spend with patients than doctors do, but in addition to those things, their close proximity to your daily routine allows them closer than doctors can manage.</p>
<p>I saw a couple of patients’ discharges delayed by poor administration. I was constantly thinking of going home, and my whole focus was on achieving this goal. To get so close to going home and have it withdrawn from you at the last minute must be so frustrating, especially if it is due to paperwork and not ill health. I do not think there is any excuse for not getting discharge papers ready, one must set a discharge date and stick to it.

<p>People have asked me if my experience of hospital was worse because I was a doctor. They often say things like ‘It must be horrible to know what is going on inside you’ and ‘It must be awful to know about all the things that can go wrong’. I found my medical knowledge to be helpful though. I think doctors probably fall into the category of people who like to know what is going on, and therefore my medical awareness was able to help me understand better and, therefore, feel better about my situation. Knowing about certain procedures comforted me. I think uncertainty exacerbates fear. If you do not fully understand what is happening to you, you are more likely to invent complications and side effects, and falsely attribute unrelated occurrences to your treatment or condition. Knowledge was a wonderful thing for me, as it settled my mind and allowed me to concentrate on how to get better. I can see how people without knowledge could get easily scared or demoralised. People have also asked me whether the incident has changed me in any way. It seems to be a popular idea that if you have ‘stared death in the face’ a wonderful change comes over you and you see meaning in life where maybe there was less meaning before. This did not happen to me. Pre-morbidly, I considered myself to be an optimistic person, and I still am. I would describe myself as a lucky person, but I certainly think that you make your own luck, and a positive mental attitude is fundamental. The only thing it has left me with is a reluctance to drink out of straws, as I can remember how awful it was to drink tea out of them.</p>
<p>That all happened 5 months ago, and now as I write this, I am pretty much back to normal. I went back to work 10 weeks after my accident; in a limited capacity at first, but then gradually building up time and responsibility back to full time as I am now. I was having almost daily physiotherapy and rehabilitation. I climbed Snowdon 3 months after my accident, and 5 months after, I am close to passing the military fitness tests that are fundamental to service with the Army. I aim to be back to full fitness in a couple of months, and deploy to Afghanistan soon.</p>
