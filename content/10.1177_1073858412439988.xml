<article-title>Synaptic plasticity and the rapid antidepressant response to ketamine</article-title>
</title-group>
</front-stub>
<body>
<p>Currently available antidepressant drugs have low efficacy and take weeks to produce an antidepressant response. In 2000, a major breakthrough in the field of antidepressant treatments occurred when it was found that a low subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine (a nonspecific <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate [NMDA] receptor antagonist) produced a rapid antidepressant response within four hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858412439988">Berman and others 2000</xref>). Replications have shown that the antidepressant response can be observed as early as 40 minutes and that up to 70% of treatment-resistant patients respond. Most patients relapse within seven days following a single ketamine infusion, and even with six infusions spaced over 12 days, the average relapse ranged from 6 to 45 days (mean 19 days) in eight of nine patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073858412439988">aan het Rot and others 2010</xref>). Now, in a series of pioneering molecular and cellular studies on the signaling pathways and behavior altered by ketamine in rodent models, it has been shown that ketamine rapidly increases dendritic protein syntheses and synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including increased density and function of spine synapses in layer V pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858412439988">Duman and others 2012</xref>). This effect was dependent on the stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and was accompanied by behavioral antidepressant effects. A single injection of ketamine produced a brief activation of mTOR (less than two hours), a longer duration of increased synaptic proteins (at least seven days), and a longer duration of behavioral antidepressant effects (7–14 days). Ketamine also reversed the behavioral deficits and decrease in synaptic proteins and spine number and function produced by 21 days of chronic unpredictable stress, and this was also dependent on mTOR. The antidepressant effects of ketamine are impaired in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) conditional deletion mutants, and the synaptogenic and behavioral effects of ketamine are blocked in BDNF Met knock-in mice (the Met BDNF single-nucleotide polymorphism reduces activity-dependent release of BDNF). Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that low-dose ketamine increases glutamate signaling (possibly from disinhibition via GABA interneurons) through AMPA receptors, which increases BDNF release, which in turn stimulates mTOR, resulting in increased translation of synaptic proteins and increased synaptic plasticity that underlies the longer lasting behavioral antidepressant effects. The elucidation of this pathway is a major step forward because it demonstrates that the stress-induced structural deficits implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders are rapidly reversible, and it provides the opportunity for the development of other drugs or treatments that could increase the duration of synaptic plasticity and prolong the behavioral antidepressant effects. Because behavioral treatments are effective and produce a longer lasting antidepressant effect in depression, it may be possible to combine the ketamine-induced increase in neural plasticity with behavioral interventions in depressed patients to produce a rapid and longer lasting treatment response.</p>

<article-title>Melatonin 2 receptor and non–rapid eye movement sleep</article-title>
</title-group>
</front-stub>
<body>
<p>Within the highly prevalent sleep abnormalities, the impairment of “restorative sleep” that occurs during non–rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) is a central problem. Hypnotic drugs such as benzodiazepines affect both NREMS and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), and they usually produce some next-day cognitive impairment. The development of methods to selectively increase NREMS would be an important advance. Melatonin, which acts via MT 1 and MT 2 receptors, is reported to have hypnotic effects in humans, and in laboratory animals, it decreases the time to sleep onset and increases both NREMS and REMS. Now, it has been shown that a MT 2 receptor partial agonist selectively increase NREMS in rats and mice and that this effect is blocked by an MT 2 antagonist and is absent in MT 2 knockout mice. In addition, MT 2 but not MT 1 knockout mice have decreased NREMS. MT 2 receptors are located in sleep-related brain regions, particularly the reticular thalamic nucleus, where microinfusion of the MT 2 partial agonist increases NREMS. Systemic administration of the MT 2 partial agonist increased cell firing and rhythmic burst activity of reticular thalamic neurons, which was blocked with the MT 2 antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858412439988">Ochoa-Sanchez and others 2011</xref>). The data support the hypothesis that MT 2 receptors play a specific role in NREMS regulation, whereas MT 1 receptors are more involved in 24-hour sleep-wake regulation because the presence of MT 1 receptors in the MT 2 knockout mice left the sleep-wake cycle intact. The divergent function of MT 1 and MT 2 receptors is consistent with findings in the vascular system where MT 1 receptor stimulation produces vasoconstriction and MT 2 receptor stimulation produces vasodilatation. The selective enhancement of NREMS through MT 2 stimulation is an important new finding, and it now provides the opportunity to develop new selective and efficacious treatments for NREMS abnormalities in sleep disorders.</p>

<article-title>Chronic stress, CRF, and tau pathology</article-title>
</title-group>
</front-stub>
<body>
<p>Stress has been implicated in the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). During a 12-year follow-up, individuals in the 90th percentile of distress proneness (neuroticism) were 40% more likely to develop MCI than those in the 10th percentile, and over a 3-year follow-up of nondemented individuals, those in the 90th percentile of distress proneness were 2.7 times more likely to develop AD than those in the 10th percentile. It has been shown previously that in AD transgenic (Tg) mice, chronic stress increases β-amyloid (AB) accumulation and memory defects, and several environmental insults, including hypoglycemia, heat, starvation, social isolation, and restraint, increase tau phosphorylation. Now, using two Tg mouse models, one that overexpresses the AB precursor protein (Tg 2576) and one that overexpresses mutant tau (PS 19), it has been found that in both models, there is an increased activity in the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) in the unstressed state. In Tg 2576 mice, one month of restraint/isolation (RI) stress increased AB levels, decreased microglia activation, and impaired spatial and fear memory. In PS 19 mice, one month of RI stress increased tau hyperphosphorylation, insoluble tau aggregation, neurodegeneration, and fear memory impairment. These effects in the PS 19 mice were not reproduced with chronic corticosteroid administration but were prevented by administration of a corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) type I receptor antagonist, and in addition, mice overexpressing CRF had increased tau phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858412439988">Carroll and others 2011</xref>). The discovery of the role of CRF in increasing tau phosphorylation now provides new opportunities to reduce stress effects. However, the effects of CRF in producing increased AB levels were not reported, and it would be important to know the role of CRF in increasing AB levels. Further elucidation of the relative importance of the CRF and HPA pathways and their involvement in the stress-induced increase in MCI and AD could lead to the discovery of new preventative treatments.</p>
