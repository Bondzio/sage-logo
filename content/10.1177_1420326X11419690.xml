<abstract>
<p>This work is a part of the NANOSECURE integrated project, supported by the European Commission under Framework Programme 6, with the objective to use nanotechnology in developing sensing and detoxification devices. Besides being sensitive, flexible, compact and inexpensive, it is important that the sensors do not respond to normal indoor air pollutants in their typical concentrations, as false-positive signals can have serious consequences. The purpose of this paper is to list typical indoor air pollutants and indicate ranges of concentrations in which they normally occur. Among others, these results may draw designers’ and manufacturers’ attention to the importance of chemical selectivity, sufficient capacity and robustness to withstand normal exposures in buildings. The main focus is on assembly buildings, airport terminals, and train and metro stations, as spaces in these buildings can be especially endangered by attacks using chemical or biological agents due to their size and population density. The literature review shows lack of information on concentrations of chemical and biological pollutants in these buildings. It also points out a need for calibration and testing in both laboratory environments with clean and well-defined air quality and in atmospheres with typical and often complex compositions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11419690"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Use of warfare agents has been reported since ancient Greek and Roman times. Already 600 years B.C., Helleborus roots were used by Athenians to contaminate water supplies during the siege of Kirrha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419690">1</xref>]. Since then, chemical and biological agents underwent huge evolution. Compared to conventional weapons, modern chemical and biological agents are much more effective, and a relatively small amount may cause high numbers of casualties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419690">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Until the appearance of nerve agents (Tabun was synthesised in 1936 and Sarin in 1937), all accessible agents had characteristic odours or were irritating for mucous membranes. Since nerve agents nearly do not smell even at lethal concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419690">1</xref>], most armies have developed early warning devices. Several technologies are used today to detect chemical agents. Available detectors use, for example, enzymatic detection techniques, ion mobility spectroscopy, infrared radiation detection techniques, photo ionization detection, flame photometry, electrochemistry or surface acoustic wave detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11419690">2</xref>]. However, since attacks are also deliberated at civilian objects, it may be considered to implement sensing and detoxification devices in public buildings. Incidences like chemical attack with sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway in 1995, biological attacks on politicians and members of the press in United States with anthrax-containing envelopes or even contamination of food with Salmonella bacteria in order to impact the results of a local election by The Rajneeshee religious cult in 1984, illustrate the diverse use of chemical and biological weapons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419690">3</xref>]. To make these devices suitable for installation in big and complex buildings like airports, train and metro stations or assembly buildings, the devices should be highly sensitive, selective, flexible, compact and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Inexpensive chemical detection paper (using chromatic enzymatic detection technique) can be sensitive for detecting chemical agents. It may, however, react with more harmless contaminants such as brake fluid, antifreeze and insect repellent, resulting in false-positive detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11419690">2</xref>]. False-positives are especially undesirable in civilian buildings as they may lead to panicked situations. Other monitoring systems either have too long response time to be used in early warning systems, are not sufficiently sensitive (detection limits are above injury concentrations), too complicated or too expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11419690">2</xref>]. Moreover, currently no sensors are available that can detect all potential chemical or biological warfare agents, let alone both chemical and biological agents simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11419690">4</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11419690"><title>Purpose</title>
<p>Indoor air is polluted with a number of substances and particles. In order to avoid false-positive responses, the sensors must not be sensitive to typical indoor pollutants in their normal concentration ranges. At the same time detoxification devices should not lose their capacity to remove toxic agents, when they are exposed to normal concentrations of typical pollutants. The purpose of this review is to list normal concentrations of building-related pollutants and microbiological species in public spaces. This is not a toxicological-based review and thus risk assessments, clinical, environmental and occupational toxicology are outside the scope. The goal is to provide background information to be used by designers of sensing and detoxification devices, to acknowledge the difficulties originating from the complexity of indoor atmospheres.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11419690" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Three types of buildings have been taken into account as especially endangered for malicious attacks by toxic agents: assembly buildings (cinemas, theatres or auditoriums), airport terminals, and subway and train stations. To be included in this review, studies had to be published in English and contain quantitative results from measurements of pollutants’ concentrations inside selected building categories. Articles were identified by searching the Scopus database. The search was done using the following keywords [indoor air or pollution or PM or ultrafine particles or VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) or TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds) or carbon dioxide or carbon oxide or BTEX or ozone or NO<sub>x</sub>] in combination with [cinema or auditorium or movie theatre], [airport] and [subway or metro or train station or railway station]. Articles published before May 2011 were included. Broader keywords like chemicals and substances were also tried but they gave less relevant results. Few additional articles were also identified from the reference list of publications obtained by the described above search criteria. Moreover websites of World Health Organisation, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) and similar organisations has also been searched in order to look for non-peer-reviewed publications, internal reports, and so on. Due to limited data that we found by described above search, which did not allow us to set concentration ranges for most of the typical indoor pollutants, additional literature search was conducted. It included office buildings and schools. This search was done by using the following keywords: [ozone or NO<sub>2</sub> or CO or CO<sub>2</sub> or formaldehyde or acetaldehyde or benzene or toluene or ethylbenzene or xylene or naphthalene or VOC or TVOC or PBDE (Polybrominated diphenyl ethers) or DEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) or DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate) or airborne bacteria or airborne fungi] in combination with [school or office]. As it was supplementary search, only newer papers published after 2000 were considered. Moreover, because the literature for schools and offices is relatively rich and these buildings are outside the main scope of this paper, the selection was narrowed down to papers having school or office in the title. This was, however, not done for the last five pollutants (PBDE, DEHP, DnBP, airborne bacteria and airborne fungi), for which literature is already limited.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11419690"><title>Assembly Buildings</title>
<p>Only five studies performed in cinema, theatre or auditorium were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419690">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419690">9</xref>]. These studies are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11419690">Table 1</xref>.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Already in 1950, Clark performed measurements of carbon dioxide concentrations in cinemas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419690">5</xref>]. During the evening shows, when cinemas were occupied, the concentrations were between 1,210 and 2,500 ppm. The author also pointed out, that concentrations above 1,500 ppm were associated with sensation of stuffiness when coming from outside, however, acclimatisation was very rapid.</p>
<p>Concentrations of 15 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured in several microenvironments, including two cinemas located in central Birmingham, United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419690">6</xref>]. The measurements were taken during movie performances. Altogether six samples were collected, three in each cinema. Concentrations of individual VOCs varied between microenvironments; they were elevated in transportation microenvironments (e.g. buses, cars) and places where smoking was allowed (e.g. pubs). Cinemas were among buildings with the lowest concentration for most of measured compounds, except for 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene (1,3,5-TMB), xylenes and para-isopropyl toluene (p-IPT). Concentrations of these compounds were comparable to concentrations measured in pubs and train stations, or even higher.</p>
<p>Weng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419690">7</xref>] measured concentrations of six VOCs in three air-conditioned cinemas as well as in several other microenvironments (three shopping centres, two supermarkets, a furniture store, two railway stations and three bus stations) in Hangzhou, China. Concentrations of the individual compounds varied between microenvironments; as compared to cinemas, the concentrations were 2–3 times higher in two shopping centres, which were currently under refurbishment and in the furniture store. The largest variation was observed for formaldehyde. The highest concentrations were measured in environments which are suspected to have strong sources of formaldehyde (the furniture store, refurbished shopping centres) and also in cinemas, while the lowest concentrations were measured in transportation indoor environments (railway and bus stations).</p>
<p>El-Hougeiri and El-Fadel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11419690">8</xref>] measured indoor and outdoor concentrations of CO, NO<sub>2</sub> and total suspended particulate matter TSP in 28 locations representing different commercial, residential and industrial environments located in Beirut, Lebanon. Indoor air samples were taken at the breathing zone, while outdoor samples were taken near the outdoor air intake of ventilation systems in the sampled buildings. The measurements included two movie theatres, both located near busy roads. As a result of this localization, concentrations of CO and NO<sub>2</sub> followed concentrations measured outdoors strongly. Indoor concentrations of particles were about one third of outdoor concentrations, probably due to particle filters installed in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.</p>
<p>Ross et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419690">9</xref>] measured indoor and outdoor concentrations of biological species in a public auditorium, a shopping centre and an unspecified company in Londrina, Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419690">9</xref>]. Five replicates of air samples were collected and analyzed for presence of bacteria and fungi. The number of colony forming units (CFU) of fungi and bacteria was smaller in the auditorium compared to the shopping centre and the company. Indoor concentrations were lower compared to outdoors for all measured locations. The ratio between indoor and outdoor number of CFUs in the auditorium was 0.35 for fungi and 0.42 for bacteria, while for the other places it was in a range of 0.57–0.69. Different species werepredominant indoors and outdoors. Penicillium, Myriodontium, Fusarium and Emmonsia, and gram-<?tjl?>positive bacteria were the predominant species indoors.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11419690"><title>Airport Terminals</title>
<p>Several studies were identified with measurements taken outside the airports, for example, during take-off or landing of airplanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11419690">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11419690">11</xref>]. However, we found only two studies with quantitative measurements performed inside airport terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419690">15</xref>]. These studies are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419690">Table 2</xref>.
<table-wrap id="table2-1420326X11419690" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Literature data for pollutants’ concentrations measured in airports</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419690-table2.tif"/>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>In the first study, by Marchand et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>], measurements of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations were performed in several indoor environments in the area of Strasbourg, France. Four samples were taken in the main hall of an airport terminal. The concentrations were relatively low (10.8 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 3.5 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, respectively), and they were correlated with outdoor concentrations.</p>
<p>In the second study, by McKernan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419690">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419690">14</xref>], fungi populations were measured during 12 flights on board of Boeing 767, as well as inside and outside airport terminals at both the origin and the destination cities (unspecified). A total of 69 indoor samples and 68 outdoor samples from 24 airport terminals were taken. The frequency of fungi detection was lower inside airport terminals compared to outdoors and compared to inside aircrafts during boarding and deplaning. Even lower frequency of detection was observed on board, when measurements were taken during the flight. Measurements of bacterial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419690">15</xref>] were performed in parallel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419690">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419690">14</xref>]. Predominant types of bacteria observed inside the aircraft and inside the airport were Staphylococcus, <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>, Bacillus and gram-negative bacteria, while the most commonly found outdoors were gram-negative bacteria, Rhodococcus and Methylobacterium.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11419690"><title>Subway and Train Stations</title>
<p>A number of studies have focused on measurements of pollutants’ concentrations in subway and train stations. Seven studies with measurements of chemicals’ concentrations were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419690">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419690">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419690">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419690">19</xref>], four studies with measurements of biological species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419690">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419690">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11419690">22</xref>] and 18with measurements of particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419690">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419690">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11419690">39</xref>]. Results of these studies are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419690">Table 3</xref>. Number of studies performed inside transportation vehicles were identified, however, they were not included in the review, as the paper focus is on buildings only.

<p>The study by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419690">6</xref>] referenced previously included measurements in two train stations located in Birmingham city centre, United Kingdom. Samples were collected on the platform and in the waiting area. Except for 1,3,5-TMB, p-IPT and 1,4-dichloro benzene (1,4-DCB), concentrations were higher in comparison to the above described cinemas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11419690">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419690">3</xref>). Concentrations measured in train stations were comparable to places where smoking was allowed (e.g. pubs) or places related to car traffic (traffic roads, cars, busses).</p>
<p>Marchard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>] measured relatively low concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in departure halls and hall reserved for ticket counters of Strasbourg’s train station (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419690">Table 3</xref>). The concentrations were comparable to concentrations measured in airports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419690">Table 2</xref>) in the same study. Except for one location, indoor concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde did not exceed the outdoor concentrations.</p>
<p>Lu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419690">16</xref>] measured concentrations of polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in different public spaces in Hangzhou, China, including two train stations. Sampling was done in a waiting area. Concentrations of ∑PAHs were lower on train stations (1.55 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 3.43 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419690">Table 3</xref>) compared to other places (shopping centres: 24.6 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, 17.4 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, 9.57 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 21.5 µg m<sup>−3</sup>; hotel: 17.3 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and temples: 11.3 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, 18.4 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, 11 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 15.3 µg m<sup>−3</sup>). The biggest differences were found for naphthalene, acenaphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene.</p>
<p>The two enclosed, naturally ventilated train stations located in Hanghou, China, were also investigated in described previously study by Weng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419690">7</xref>], with measurements of concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, propionaldehyde, crotonaldehyde and butyraldehyde. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in train stations were five and two times lower than the concentrations measured in air-conditioned cinemas in the same study. Concentrations of remaining compounds were of the same magnitude.</p>
<p>Measurements of different VOC were performed in several indoor environments in Korea, including three metro stations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11419690">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419690">Table 3</xref>). The concentrations measured in metro stations were either of the same order of magnitude as in the other locations (library, public child care, medical centre, store, underground shopping area), or lower. The highest concentrations of formaldehyde, TVOCs, toluene, and xylenes were found in public child care centres and underground shopping area, which were up to 10 times higher than the concentrations measured in metro stations.</p>
<p>Feng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419690">19</xref>] measured concentrations of different carbonyl compounds in six underground metro stations in Shanghai, China: two small, two medium and two large-scale stations. Among the 19 carbonyls detected in the subway stations, formaldehyde was the most abundant one, followed by acetaldehyde and acetone. Concentrations were higher on stations then outdoors, except for the aromatic carbonyls such as o/m/p-tolualdehyde, benzylaldehyde and 2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde, which come mainly from the automobile exhaustion or are products of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Awad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419690">17</xref>] measured concentrations of ozone and total suspended particulates, as well as bacteria and fungi in two metro stations in Cairo, Egypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419690">17</xref>]. One station was an underground station, ventilated with mechanical ventilation and was one of the most crowded stations in the city. The other was a surface station, ventilated by natural ventilation and by far not as crowded. Air samples were collected near the ticket offices. Concentration of ozone was high in both stations (means: 181 ppb and 147.4 ppb). Suspended particulates concentration was significantly higher in the underground station compared to the surface station. Concentrations of total airborne viable bacteria and staphylococci were also higher. On the other hand, the surface station was characterized by higher concentrations of spore-forming bacteria and fungi.</p>
<p>Concentrations of airborne fungi and bacteria were measured in four stations of the St. Petersburg metro (Russia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419690">20</xref>]. Three of them were underground stations; two had automatic doors, which separated the tunnel from the platforms. The stations differed also in number of passengers per day. Measurements were performed twice: during February/March and April/May. The concentrations of viable air fungi varied at different stations from 45 ± 20 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> to 864 ± 374 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> and were higher in spring and in stations with more passengers. Acremonium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium were the prevailing species. Concentrations of airborne bacteria varied from 1900 ± 330 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> to 31552 ± 20 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> and the same tendencies as for fungi were observed.</p>
<p>Hwang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11419690">21</xref>] measured bacterial concentrations in indoor air at 25 underground railway stations in Seoul, Korea. Airborne bacteria were detected at 92% stations at concentrations up to 4,997 cfu m<sup>−3</sup>. Gram-negative bacteria were detected at two stations (8%). The authors observed that the bacterial concentrations of deeper stations were significantly higher than those of shallower stations. Furthermore higher concentrations were measured at the stations without platform screen doors compared to those with doors installed.</p>
<p>The concentrations of bacteria and fungi measured in a train station in Beijing, China, were found to be higher than concentrations in other sites measured in this study (office, hospital, student dormitory), except for subway train. Bacteria concentration of 12,639 and 12,083 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> and fungi concentrations of 1,528 and 1,806 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> were measured in train station and subway train, respectively, why they varied from 990 to 2,276 cfu m<sup>−3</sup>(bacteria) and 119–296 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> (fungi) for the other sampling sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11419690">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Monitoring of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations at different locations of Seoul’s subway system, Korea, was performed in two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419690">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11419690">24</xref>]. In the first study, concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and CO were monitored in addition to particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419690">23</xref>]. Concentrations of both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were significantly higher inside trains than on the platforms. They were also significantly higher in underground stations compared to surface stations. Concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> ranged from 500 to 1,500 ppm on the platforms (500–1,000 ppm on surface platforms and 1,000–1,500 ppm on underground platforms) and from 1,153 to 3,377 ppm inside the trains. Results from CO concentration measurements were not presented. In the second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11419690">24</xref>] study, 22 stations were selected, out of which 14 were underground. For each station, measurements were carried out at subway worker activity areas (station offices, rest areas, ticket offices) and passenger main movement areas (station precincts, platforms), as well as inside trains (driver compartments and passenger carriages). In addition, outdoor measurements were taken one metre away from each station. Concentrations in the passenger activity areas were found to be higher in comparison to worker activity areas (means: 114.1 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 78.8 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 284.2 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 131.0 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for PM<sub>10</sub>). Slightly higher concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were found in surface stations in comparison to underground stations, except for platform, where concentrations of both particle sizes were significantly higher in underground stations. Concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> measured on platforms and inside the trains were similar in both studies, but concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> were 2–3 times higher in the study performed by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11419690">24</xref>] compared to the one performed by Park and Ha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419690">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11419690">25</xref>] measured indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Taipei Rapid Transit System, Taiwan. Air samples were collected at six different platforms as well as inside trains. Indoor concentrations were significantly higher than outdoors in five of the six measured places; however, they were also positively correlated (with Pearson coefficient in the range of 0.53–0.93). This study included also measurements of ultrafine particles on the platforms and inside the trains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11419690">26</xref>]. No measurements in outdoors were made, however, based on comparison between concentrations measured in ground and underground stations during rush and non-rush hours as well as weekdays and weekends, the authors concluded that underground system does not contribute to levels of ultrafine particles in the air. Later the same group has measured concentrations of particles in Taipei main station, where commuters purchase tickets and in transfer areas to different types of railway transportation, showing slightly lower concentrations compared to the once measured previously on platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11419690">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Concentrations measured in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419690">27</xref>] were noticeably higher comparing to other Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419690">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11419690">25</xref>]. Ye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419690">27</xref>] measured concentrations of PM<sub>10,</sub> PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1</sub> in 16 underground metro stations in Shanghai, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419690">27</xref>]. The concentrations ranged from 81 to 975 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for PM<sub>10</sub>, 98 to 731 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 80 to 623 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for PM<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>Several studies have been conducted in Europe. Measurements of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were done on a platform of Stockholm’s underground (Sweden) as well as in a busy street [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11419690">28</xref>]. Concentrations measured in busy street was approximately 5 (PM<sub>10</sub>) and 10 times lower (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) than in the station. High correlation was found between both particle fractions.</p>
<p>A study investigating concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and respirable particles in a subway system was performed in Rome, Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11419690">29</xref>]. Measurements were taken on several platforms, as well as outdoors, in a place where air ventilation fans were installed. Inside concentrations were 2–7 times higher compared to outdoor concentrations.</p>
<p>Aarnio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11419690">30</xref>] measured concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and particle number concentrations (PNC) in the Helsinki subway, Finland. The measurements of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration were done on two underground stations, one surface-level station, and inside the subway cars, while PNCs were measured only in one underground station and inside subway cars. The concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in two underground stations were similar, and were clearly higher than concentrations measured in the surface station. Concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> inside the subway car was similar to what was measured in the surface station; however, it varied a lot between tunnels and the above ground parts of the track.</p>
<p>Concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles and PNC were measured on platforms of three underground stations in London, United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11419690">31</xref>], and in driver compartments. Mean concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> varied between stations from 270 to 480 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, and PNC from 14,000 to 29,000 particles cm<sup>−3</sup>. Average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in drivers’ compartments was about one half of those measured on platforms, whereas the average PNCs were similar to platforms. Both mass concentration and number concentrations were increased when the train was inside tunnels, compared to above ground; however, for mass concentration this dependency was more pronounced.</p>
<p>Salma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X11419690">32</xref>] measured concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> on a platform in the Budapest Metro (Hungary). The measurements show a large variability. The mean concentration while the station was closed was 36 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, while it was as high as 250 µg m<sup>−3</sup> during rush hours.</p>
<p>Branis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11419690">33</xref>] performed measurements of personal exposure with high time resolution to PM<sub>10</sub> during one subject’s trip from home to work in Prague, Czech Republic. This trip included walking on streets (outdoor exposure), waiting in underground station areas and trip by metro trains. The subject completed a written diary, which was used for classification of the environment. Measurements were performed during 11 months; however, the majority of data were collected during autumn/winter time. High seasonal differences were found for all three types of microenvironments, resulting in significantly higher concentrations in winter compared to summer (84.9 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 51.4 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for outdoor air, 120.2 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 71.1 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for underground station and 125.5 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 82.3 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for cabs). No significant differences were found between concentrations measured in the station and inside trains (102.7 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 113.7 µg m<sup>−3</sup>), however, they were both significantly higher in comparison to outdoor concentrations (74.3 µg m<sup>−3</sup>). The same pattern was observed when the measurement period was divided into summer and winter.</p>
<p>Personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles was also measured the Mexico City Metropolitan Area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11419690">34</xref>]. The study population included 40 volunteers, aged 21–40, all were office workers. The measurements included a period of 13 h, starting at 9 a.m. Each individual completed a written diary that was used for classification of the outdoor and indoor environments, which were further divided into home, work, school, public spaces and subway transportation. Outdoor levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were significantly higher than indoor levels (medians: 89.1 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 70.8 µg m<sup>−3</sup>). The highest indoor concentration was found in the subway system, while the lowest concentration was found at home (medians: 106.2 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 54.5 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, respectively).</p>
<p>In three studies personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles in New York City’s subway system was measured. In the first study, a set of duplicated samples was collected for about five hours in the underground subway stations and for about three hours of riding in subway cars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11419690">35</xref>]. Mean concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 62 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. More data on particles concentration are not given by the authors. In the second study, personal sampling of PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles was performed among 20 non-smoking volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11419690">36</xref>]. Participants were asked to complete a car, subway and walking trip, each planned to last 8 h. Subjects completed a written diary. The highest concentrations were measured in subway and the lowest in the car geometric mean (GM), 30.6 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for subway, 21.4 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for car and 26.7 µg m<sup>−3</sup> for walking). The difference between subway concentration and car concentration was significant after correction for humidity was applied. In the third study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11419690">38</xref>], authors investigated travellers’ exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> during different commuting activities including: walking on the street side, automobile driving, and riding subway trains, and at ground-level intermodal stations, underground stations and parks in New York City. PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentration at underground transfer stations was the highest among all location categories and subway trains were the second highest.</p>
<p>A sampling campaign was conducted in two lines of the Los Angeles Metro system: an underground subway line and a ground-level light-rail line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11419690">39</xref>]. The concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were measured at station platforms and inside train. The average PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations for the subway line at station platforms and inside the train were 78.0 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 31.5 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, while the average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were 56.7 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 24.2 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, respectively. For the light-rail line, corresponding PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations were 38.2 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 16.2 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were equal to 29.4 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 13.7 µgm<sup>−3</sup>.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X11419690"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The type, diversity and concentrations of pollutants present indoors depend on many aspects, including outdoor concentrations, type of building materials, furnishing, technological processes, occupant density, activity, ventilation, and so on. During the last 50 years, the type and concentrations of pollutants have changed significantly. Consequently, the exposure and the health risk from indoor pollutants have changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X11419690">40</xref>]. This paper, however, does not look at pollutants from a toxicological point of view. The main aim has been to summarise types and concentrations of pollutants typical for assembly and transport-related buildings in order to draw the attention of designers of sensing and detoxification devices to the complexity and composition of indoor air.</p>
<p>The literature search identified a sufficient amount of studies to establish ranges of particle concentrations in transport-related buildings. Concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> varied from 4 to 731 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. In general, higher concentrations were found in Europe and China compared to the rest of Asia and United States. The highest concentrations were found in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11419690">28</xref>], Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11419690">29</xref>], United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11419690">31</xref>] and in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419690">27</xref>], while the lowest were found in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11419690">24</xref>], Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11419690">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11419690">37</xref>], Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11419690">30</xref>] and United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11419690">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11419690">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11419690">39</xref>]. Concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> varied from 8 to 975 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. Similarly to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the highest concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> were found in Sweden, Italy and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419690">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11419690">29</xref>], while the lowest concentrations were found in Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11419690">25</xref>] and United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11419690">39</xref>]. Concentrations of particles measured in traffic-related buildings were similar to those measured inside vehicles. Concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> inside buses, taxis, ferries, trains and trams were measured in Hong Kong, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11419690">41</xref>]. The concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> varied from 20 µg m<sup>−3</sup> to 240 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and were the lowest in air-conditioned railway transport and the highest in non-conditioned road transport. The concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> varied from 21 µg m<sup>−3</sup> to 163 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and the same tendency as for PM<sub>10</sub> was observed. Few other studies showed PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations measured inside vehicles to be in the same range as the concentrations found in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1420326X11419690">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1420326X11419690">44</xref>]. All these studies allows us to suggest typical PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels to be in the range of 1–150 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and PM<sub>10</sub> in the range of 1–300 µg m<sup>−3</sup> with extreme values of 500 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and 1,000 µg m<sup>−3</sup> found in, for example, smoking environments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419690">Table 4</xref>). Particles were measured only in one study performed in assembly buildings; lower concentrations of total suspended particulates were measured indoors than outdoors (100 µg m<sup>−3</sup> vs. 150 µg m<sup>−3</sup>). No other studies have been found. There are, however, no strong sources of particles in assembly buildings, thus, we can expect them to be in lower part of the ranges determined.

<p>Very few studies of organic and inorganic chemical compounds and biological species in public buildings studied have been found. Concentrations of PAHs were measured in a public auditorium and in a waiting room of a train station in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Concentrations were in a similar range at both places, except for 1,3-butadiene, benzene, toluene and naphthalene, which were found at about three times higher concentration in train stations, and p-IPT, which was found at 25 times higher concentration in the public auditorium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419690">6</xref>]. These differences can be well explained by outdoor air (transportation) and tobacco smoking being the main sources of 1,3-butadiene, benzene, toluene and naphthalene and predominance of indoor sources of p-IPT (paints, furniture and other consumer goods). Concentrations of benzene and toluene measured in unspecified metro station in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11419690">18</xref>] were rather in the range of concentrations found in assembly buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419690">6</xref>], which suggests underground character of the station with electrical vehicles. Concentrations of naphthalene measured in the train station in Birmingham [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419690">6</xref>] were comparable with concentrations measured in a train station in Hangzhou, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419690">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Another study reported concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to be in a similar range at airports and train station halls. They were generally low and did not differ much from outdoor concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>]. However, concentrations of these aldehydes measured in train stations in Hangzhou, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419690">7</xref>], and in underground metro station in Shanghai, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419690">19</xref>], were up to 15 times higher than these measured in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>]; even higher concentrations were measured in three Hangzhou cinemas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419690">7</xref>]. Higher concentrations of aldehydes can result from the presence of strong sources and reduced ventilation. Higher concentrations measured in China could thus be explained by, for example, tobacco smoking or by more extensive use of wooden boards, while lower ventilation rate could explain the higher concentrations in cinemas compared to train stations.</p>
<p>Six studies over measurements of concentrations of biological species in the three categories of buildings are included in this review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419690">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419690">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419690">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419690">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419690">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11419690">22</xref>]. Concentrations of fungi in air varied widely from 8 to 2,500 cfu m<sup>−3</sup>. The lowest concentrations were found in assembly buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419690">9</xref>] and in airports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419690">14</xref>]. The highest concentrations were measured in a train station in Beijing, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11419690">22</xref>], and in a metro station in Egypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419690">17</xref>]; and these were probably, but not documented to be, related to high outdoor concentrations. Concentrations of bacteria ranged from 8 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> to 31,552 cfu m<sup>−3</sup> and were the highest in one of St. Petersburg’s metro stations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419690">20</xref>]. This was, however, the only study with such high levels of bacteria, and if excluded lowers the upper bacteria range down to 5,830 cfu m<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
<p>This limited data did not allow us to set concentration ranges for most of the typical indoor pollutants. Additional literature search was conducted and included office buildings and schools. The data from additional literature search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1420326X11419690">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1420326X11419690">90</xref>] together with the results from the main search conducted for the purpose of this paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419690">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419690">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419690">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11419690">39</xref>] are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419690">Table 4</xref>. Office buildings and schools differ a lot from buildings discussed in the present paper (mainly from airports, train and metro stations) in use, construction and pollution sources, thus, the type and concentrations of pollutants measured in these buildings can differ from pollutants measured in, for example, airports. Thus, results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419690">Table 4</xref> show quite broad ranges of concentrations. While concentrations of some of the pollutants in buildings discussed in the present paper are expected to be in the upper part of the ranges presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419690">Table 4</xref> (e.g. particles and ozone in train and metro stations), concentrations of other pollutants are expected to be in the lower range (e.g. aldehydes, phthalates). It results from different sources of pollution present in different types of buildings (e.g. presence of wooden boards will probably result in higher concentrations of formaldehyde) but also from differences in location, climate and seasonal variations (valid e.g. for bacteria, fungi). These ranges, although broad, are however typical for different indoor environments, thus, should be considered while designing sensing and detoxification devices.</p>
<p>Because of chemical warfare agents’ toxicity and restriction in use, research using these is usually conducted on similar but far less toxic compounds. The simulant compounds proposed to be used in the NANOSECURE project are dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), dimethyl phosphite (DMPI), dimethyl sulphide (DMS), diethyl methylphosphonate (DEMP), diethyl ethylphosphonate (DEEP) and triethyl phosphate (TEP). These compounds, but mainly DMMP, DIMP, DEEP and TEP, are widely used as simulants of chemical warfare agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1420326X11419690">91</xref>], however, some of them have also commercial use, for example, as flame retardants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1420326X11419690">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1420326X11419690">93</xref>], which makes them possible normal indoor air pollutants. However, no studies with measurements of their indoor concentrations were found. Such studies would be very useful for sensor designers and manufacturers, as making sensors too sensitive could create risk of false-positives signals.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11419690"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The selectivity issue is very important in the process of designing and manufacturing of sensing devices, as low selectivity may lead to false-positive alarms. Literature search focused on assembly buildings, airports and train/metro stations showed comprehensive but still rather incomplete information on concentrations of chemical and biological pollutants in these buildings. It also pointed out a need for measurements of concentrations of simulants of warfare agents, as some of these compounds are used commercially and thus might be present in indoor air.</p>
<p>Based on literature data for assembly buildings, airports and train/metro stations as well as office and school buildings, this paper lists ranges of the most typical indoor pollutants. These ranges can be used as a reference in designing of sensing and detoxification devices used for improvement of public security.</p>
