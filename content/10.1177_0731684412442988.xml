<abstract>
<p>The heated mandrel winding method is a new process based on the internal heat-curing method. With the advantages of high production efficiency, good pressure resistance, and so on, the thermosetting fiber composite shell produced using the heated mandrel winding method has been used as a high-pressure shell. Because of the differences between the heated mandrel winding method and the internal heat-curing method, it is especially important to ensure that the axial temperature is distributed as expected. To this end, the structure of the mandrel is improved, wherein the distribution of the holes is rearranged. An experiment shows that the improved mandrel improves the heat transfer. Furthermore, the steam heating process for mandrels with core pipes of different diameters is numerically simulated using FLUENT. The distributions of the flow field and temperature field are compared, and the influence of the mandrel-to-core-pipe diameter ratio on the temperature distribution on the external surface is analyzed based on the flow field characteristics of steam in a cavity. The conclusions provide the theoretical basis for the optimization of the mandrel structure.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412442988" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Based on the internal heat-curing method, the heated mandrel winding method has been used in composite shell production. The process principle of the heated mandrel winding is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412442988">Figure 1</xref>. The principle underlying this process is to heat the composite to the curing temperature while a fiber bundle infused with resin is wound on the mandrel. Compared with the traditional external heat-curing method, the new method produces higher efficiency and better quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412442988">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412442988">2</xref></sup> Heated mandrel winding is appropriate for a high-pressure shell because of the possibility of controlling the resin content in composites. In the finished product, the resin, as the adhesive, bonds the fibers together. The pressure-endurance capability of resin is far from that of fiber. Thus, an excessively high resin content makes the product fragile. The resin content must be controlled strictly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412442988">3</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0731684412442988" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Viscosity–temperature curve of thermosetting epoxy resin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412442988-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The viscosity–temperature property of a thermosetting epoxy resin is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412442988">Figure 2</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412442988">4</xref></sup> The viscosity is related to the temperature. The viscosity decreases when the temperature increases up to temperatures within threshold. When the temperature becomes higher, the resin starts to cure. Thus, the viscosity increases when the temperature increases.
<fig id="fig2-0731684412442988" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Viscosity–temperature curve of thermosetting epoxy resin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412442988-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The heated mandrel winding method controls the resin content of composite products based on this property. The composite is heated while winding, which causes a decrease in the viscosity of the resin, and the excessive resin drips off due to gravity. Therefore, the temperature of the composite surface should be controlled within a certain range so that the viscosity is low enough for the excessive resin to drip. Meanwhile, a high temperature could cause the curing reaction, which would block the fiber bundle being wound on the surface of the composite from the cross-linking reaction and would finally lead to stratification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412442988">5</xref></sup> In other words, it is important to ensure that the temperature of the composite surface is controlled to within the expected range.</p>
<p>The mandrel structure is one of the many factors that affect the external surface temperature. The mandrel consists of the core pipe and cavity. Small holes are distributed along the core pipe. High-pressure steam enters the core pipe and is ejected to the cavity through these small holes to heat the composite being wound on the mandrel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412442988">6</xref></sup> The distribution of the small holes and the mandrel-to-core-pipe diameter ratio affect the temperature distribution on the mandrel surface. Two challenges are faced for practical production: the axial temperature distribution is asymmetrical, and the temperature of the head is higher than the tail. Local peak temperatures occur, which is rather obvious when producing shells with a small diameter. These problems cause the composite to cure locally, which leads to delamination. Taking a DN65 composite shell mandrel as an example, the steam heating process for a mandrel equipped with an improved core pipe, where there is a greater concentration of small holes at the tail, is numerical simulated using FLUENT, and the influence of the new mandrel on the heat transfer is analyzed. The steam heating processes for mandrels equipped with core pipes of different diameters are also simulated, and the relationship between the inlet pressure, mandrel diameter and temperature distribution is obtained. An experimental verification is carried out, and the obtained results agree well with the analytical results. A heating method for the heated mandrel winding method based on the expected temperature is proposed.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec7-0731684412442988"><title>Experimental verification</title>
<p>In order to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulations, mandrel-heating experiments are designed, and the steam temperatures during these experiments are measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412442988">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>The steam temperature is measured using a temperature sensor installed at the exit of the steam pathway inside the mandrel. The mandrel temperature is measured using an infrared thermometer.

<sec id="sec9-0731684412442988"><title>Flow field analysis</title>
<p>As shown in the dynamic pressure contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412442988">Figure 4</xref>), the dynamic pressure in the core pipe of Model 1 is lower than that in Model 2, because the dynamic pressure inside the smaller diameter core pipe (Model 2) is higher under the same inlet pressure. Flowing inside the core pipe, the dynamic pressure decreases to a specific level when passing a small hole. The pressure inside the core pipe eventually reaches a specific equilibrium state, under which the pressure of the fluid at a different position is closely related to the structure of the core pipe. For the fluid at a specific position inside the core pipe, the dynamic to static pressure ratio determines which flow direction trend plays the dominant role, along the core pipe or perpendicular to it. Therefore, the fluid at a position near a small hole flows in a direction along the core pipe when the dynamic pressure is higher. In contrast, it flows through the small hole when the dynamic pressure is lower. Under this circumstance, a higher overall level of dynamic pressure makes it easier for the fluid to flow to the tail of the core pipe. Thus, the heat is transferred to the tail of the mandrel to improve the heat transfer efficiency.
<fig id="fig4-0731684412442988" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Dynamic pressure contour.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412442988-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412442988">Figure 5</xref> shows the dynamic pressure curves of the core pipes of Models 1 and 2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412442988">Figure 6</xref> shows the flow situation near the first and fifth small holes of Models 1 and 2. As shown in the figure, although the dynamic pressure inside the core pipe of Model 2 is higher, and the flow situation at the tail is smooth, the steam tends to flow along the core pipe rather than through the small hole, which affects the heat transfer effect at the head of the mandrel. Model 1, which is equipped with a larger diameter core pipe, has higher heat transfer efficiency at the head, while Model 2, with its smaller diameter core pipe, has higher transfer efficiency in the tail. The flow situation near the small hole is as follows. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412442988">Figure 5</xref>, when the dynamic pressure is low, the steam tends to eject from the small hole rather than flow along the core pipe. When the dynamic pressure is high, the steam tends to flow along the core pipe. Moreover, the steam ejecting through the small hole maintains a higher speed in the direction of the x-axis (the direction along the core pipe). It can be seen that the steam flows regularly after passing the fifth small hole in Model 1, but the vector of the same position is not obvious in Model 2.

<sec id="sec10-0731684412442988"><title>Temperature field analysis</title>
<p>The temperature distributions of Models 1 and 2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412442988">Figure 7</xref> with a flow time of 120 s. The black curve represents the temperature inside the core pipe; and the red curve represents the temperature of the mandrel surface. It can be seen that there is an increase in the average temperature of the tail of the mandrel equipped with the improved core pipe. The temperature difference between the head and tail is not obvious. This is because the denser distribution of the small holes in the tail makes it easier to eject the steam into the cavity of the mandrel, compensating for the local temperature difference caused by the heat loss. The improved core pipe solves the problem of the temperature at the tail being lower than that at the head.
<fig id="fig7-0731684412442988" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Temperature curves and contours with flow time of 120 s.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412442988-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The surface temperature peaks are found right over the small holes in the temperature curve; and the peak temperature is 100°C higher than the average temperature, which greatly affects the molding quality of the composite shell. The composite shell manufactured using the heated mandrel curing method cures while winding. The fiber layer that is being wound needs to be glued to the previous layer that has been wound by the resin. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that the previous layer has not cured; otherwise, the fibers may stratify. Therefore, the temperature of the previous layer must be controlled within some specific range. If the peak temperature is reached, the composite at that location may cure earlier than at other positions, which may cause uneven stress in the composite and affect the compaction rate of the resin.</p>
<p>The temperature distribution comparison shows that when the flow time is certain, the average temperature of Model 2 is higher than that of Model 1. Although the heating characteristics of the head and tail are different under the same inlet pressure, the heating rate of Model 2 is higher than Model 1. The difference is the head of the Model 1 has a higher heating rate, while the tail of Model 2 has a higher heating rate. When a smaller diameter is used, it is easier for the steam to flow to the tail, making the heating rate of the tail higher. When the diameter is larger, the situation is reversed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684412442988"><title>Comprehensive analysis</title>
<p>According to the above analysis, there are two methods to improve the heating efficiency: increasing the inlet pressure and reducing the diameter of the core pipe. The goal is to increase the dynamic pressure of the steam inside the core pipe to achieve a full flow. In actual production, the method used to increase the inlet pressure is increasing the inlet valve opening. However, either increasing the inlet pressure or reducing the diameter of the core pipe may affect the heating of the head to some extent.</p>
<p>When the actual temperature is lower than the objective production temperature, the following method is used to control the temperature. When there is a large difference between the actual temperature and objective temperature, a large inlet valve opening is used to provide a high inlet pressure, which heats the mandrel quickly. When the actual temperature gets closer to the objective temperature, the inlet valve opening is gradually reduced to lower the inlet pressure. Thus, the temperature of the mandrel increases slowly, which reduces the overshoot and shake. A small inlet valve opening produces a low dynamic steam pressure, which causes most of the steam to eject through the first several small holes. If a small inlet valve opening is adopted for a long time, the heating rate of the tail will decrease, which causes a discrepancy in the axial curing starting time. In actual practice, a large inlet valve opening is mainly used when the mandrel temperature is low. A small difference is allowed during this period because the temperature is far from the reaction temperature. When the mandrel temperature gets closer to the reaction temperature, and a small inlet valve opening is used, even a tiny difference could cause the inconformity of the starting time for the curing reaction, which should be avoided. Therefore, the core pipe to mandrel diameter ratio should be determined to ensure that the tail of the mandrel can be heated as quickly as the head when the inlet valve opening is small.</p></sec></sec>

<p>As shown by Line 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412442988">Figure 7</xref>, mandrel No. 1, which is equipped with a core pipe containing regularly distributed small holes, has a lower tail temperature. In the early stage, the tail of the mandrel maintains a high heating rate because a large inlet valve opening is adopted. When the temperature is higher than 120°C, the inlet valve opening is reduced and the inlet pressure decreases. Thus, the temperature of the tail increases slowly. At the same time, the temperature of the head increases quickly. In reality, when the actual temperature gets close to 80°C, the inlet valve opening starts to be reduced. Therefore, the temperature at the tail of mandrel No. 1 is much lower than the temperature at the head, and the largest difference between them is 17.7°C according to the experiment result.</p>
<p>Mandrel No. 2 adopts a core pipe with a dense concentration of small holes at the tail. It can be seen from the figure that the temperature distribution at the tail is obviously improved, especially when the inlet valve opening is small. The pressures at the head and tail are balanced because of the dense concentration of small holes at the tail. Thus, the heating curve for the tail is close to the one for the head. The largest difference between them is 5.4°C, which occurs during the cooling period and has little influence on the composite curing.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0731684412442988"><title>Experiment using core pipes with different diameters</title>
<p>The two same mandrels of DN65 are selected. One is equipped with a 15-mm diameter core pipe, marked as mandrel No. 3. The other one is equipped with a 10-mm diameter core pipe, marked as mandrel No. 4. These core pipes both have a dense concentration of small holes at the tail. The temperatures at the heads and tails of the two mandrels are surveyed. The results are shown below.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, during the period with the large inlet valve opening (the period when the temperature was lower than 80°C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412442988">Figure 9</xref>), the temperature of the tail of mandrel No. 4 increases quickly. Meanwhile, the temperature of the head follows the control temperature well when the inlet valve opening is small. The temperature difference between the head and tail of mandrel No. 3 is small, 5.4°C at the largest, while that for mandrel No. 4 is 9.5°C. The results for this experiment well match the results of the numerical simulation. These results illustrate that the temperature variation is related to the diameter of the core pipe, while the head to tail heating ratio depends on the core pipe to mandrel diameter ratio.

<p>
<list id="list1-0731684412442988" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The structure of the traditional mandrel used in the internal heat-curing method was improved, with the small holes in the core pipe being redistributed to give a denser concentration of small holes at the tail of the mandrel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The heating processes for two mandrels equipped with different core pipes were numerical simulated using FLUENT, and the distributions of the flow field and temperature field were analyzed. The results showed that the diameter of the core pipe affects the heating ratio of the head and tail of the mandrel. When using a specific inlet pressure, the head temperature of the mandrel with the larger diameter core pipe increased more quickly than one with a relatively smaller diameter core pipe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the goal of developing an actual temperature control method, the situation of a small inlet valve opening should be considered primarily to determine the appropriate ratio between the core pipe diameter and mandrel diameter. It can be concluded that this ratio must be determined to ensure that the temperature at the tail increases as quickly as that at the head when the inlet pressure is low.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two experiments were carried out in this paper. One involved a mandrel equipped with a core pipe that contained a dense concentration of small holes at the tail, while the other investigated core pipes with different diameters. Not only did these show that the improved mandrel improves the heating situation, they also proved that the conclusion about the relationship between the temperature distribution and core pipe diameter derived from the numerical simulation matches the actual experimental results. This conclusion provides the theoretical basis for the optimization of the mandrel structure.</p></list-item>
