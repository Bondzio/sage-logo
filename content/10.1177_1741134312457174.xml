<sec id="sec2-1741134312457174"><title>Patent/lack of inventive step</title>
<p>Commercial Court No. 5 of Barcelona</p>
<p>Pfizer/Activis Spain SA</p>
<p>On February 17, 2012, the Commercial Court No. 5 of Barcelona issued a judgment upholding a counterclaim brought by Actavis Spain SA and declared the invalidity of Pfizer Inc.’s patent EP1957452 (EP'452).</p>
<p>The judgment also dismissed in its entirety the infringement action brought by Pfizer and other defendants.</p>
<p>In May 2010, after Actavis and other companies had launched various generic drugs of Atorvastatin magnesium onto the market, Pfizer sued them for alleged infringement of the EP'452 patent, which covers a certain polymorph of atorvastatin magnesium, and unfair competition.</p>
<p>According to Pfizer, the defendants’ atorvastatin magnesium generic drugs infringed its patent because they contained the crystalline form of atorvastatin magnesium protected by it.</p>
<p>Pfizer also argued that the marketing of the defendants’ generic drugs resulted in acts of unfair competition, affirming that their advanced launch prior to the expiry of the atorvastatin calcium patent (EP409281) had given them a competitive advantage in the atorvastatin market.</p>
<p>According to Pfizer, by launching their products, the defendants’ actions had also created a market entry barrier for the plaintiffs that damaged their business strategy, which consisted of being the first to launch their own atorvastatin generic drugs little before the expiry of the atorvastatin calcium patent.</p>
<p>Actavis opposed the action brought by the plaintiffs, affirming that its generic drug does not infringe the EP'452 patent as it contains a crystalline form of atorvastatin magnesium which is different from the one protected by the patent. Also, Actavis filed a counterclaim seeking the revocation of the patent due to lack of novelty and lack of inventive step.</p>
<p>In its judgment of February 17, 2012, the Commercial Court No. 5 of Barcelona upheld Actavis’ allegation of lack of inventive step and revoked the EP'452 patent. In summary, the decision concluded that parting from atorvastatin magnesium as disclosed in the prior art, and based on his/her common general knowledge, it would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art to look for different crystalline forms of atorvastatin magnesium, which would have led him/her to the specific polymorph claimed in EP'452.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Court declared the invalidity of the patent and dismissed Prizer’s infringement actions, sentencing Pfizer to pay the Court costs of Actavis. Pfizer has not appealed the judgment of the Commercial Court No. 5 of Barcelona; therefore, the decision has become final.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741134312457174"><title>Supplementary protection certificate</title>
<p>Court of First Instance Paris (Tribunal de Grande Instance Paris), October 31, 2011</p>
<p>Claimant Sanofi-Aventis France, Sanofi Winthrop Industries, Zentiva</p>
<p>Defendant Novartis AG, Novartis Pharma</p>
<p>The Court confirmed the <italic>ex parte</italic> preliminary injunction against generics, prohibiting distribution of Zentica generic medicinal products and ordering a product recall. The Court held that the Zentiva generic medicinal product which is a combination of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, is likely to infringe Novartis’ European patent and SPC, which only protect valsartan, and said <italic>ex parte</italic> measures were justified with respect to the important financial damages suffered by Novartis and resulting from the loss of customers and the falling prices, due to premature market introduction of the generic medicinal product, albeit for a short period.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1741134312457174"><title>Patent/revocation</title>
<p>Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation), February 17, 2012</p>
<p>Claimant    Mr W</p>
<p>Defendant 1  Mr G</p>
<p>Defendant 2  LPG Systems</p>
<p>The Supreme Court clarified its prior case law by ruling that the decision to revoke a patent, having <italic>erga omnes</italic> effect, does not prejudice a prior irrevocable decision on infringement of that patent issued against a third party. Consequently, a revocation decision does not entitle third parties held liable for infringement on said patent to recover the damages paid in execution of the irrevocable infringement decision.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1741134312457174"><title>Infringement trademark/ unfair competition</title>
<p>TGI Paris, 3rd chamber, 3rd section, February 4, 2009, Onixxa Sarl et al. C. Skin'Up, 2007/08785 (TGI Paris, 3rd c. 3rd sect., December 16, 2011)</p>
<p>The company Skin'Up, holder of the French trademark Skin'Up, commercializes fabrics containing a substance to be released permanently on the clothing with effects on the plan of the lean, of the tone or of the hydration. This company also holds a French patent for this process. The competitor company Lytess commercializes also products which have the faculty to be rechargeable in microtextiles.</p>
<p>The company Skin'Up discovered that the company Lytess distributed a catalog denigrating the Skin'Up products to its customers. Therefore the company Skin'Up summoned the company Lytess for infringement of its trademarks and unfair competition, denigration, illicit comparative advertising and false indication of origin.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance (French Tribunal of Grande Instance) agreed partially with this request and considered that if the litigious catalog is intended, due to its technicality and its exhaustiveness, exclusively to health professionals, including pharmacists, “the reproduction of the mark Skin'Up in the catalogue is made for information in a comparison between products of the plaintiff and those of the company Lytess.” (…) “Consider that the comparison is an infringement would prohibit any possibility for economic actors to do a comparison between the products, which is a component of free competition.”</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no infringement of the trademark concerned.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1741134312457174"><title>Marketing authorization (MA)</title>
<p>Judgment of the Court (Third Chamber) of April 19, 2012, Artegodan GmbH v European Commission and Federal Republic of Germany</p>
<p>A company asked the Court of Justice to cancel a judgment of the General Court rejecting his request for compensation for the alleged damage resulting from the adoption of a decision of the Commission dated March 9, 2000, concerning the withdrawal of authorizations for the putting on the market of medicinal products for human use containing “amfepramone”.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice denied this request by specifying that “the decision of the Commission to use the criteria of effectiveness to the long term to evaluate the therapeutic effect of amfepramone in the treatment of obesity and to withdraw the marketing authorizations for medicinal products containing this substance is based on the existence of a consensus within the medical community on a new assessment criteria of this therapeutic effect, according to which an effective therapy in the treatment of obesity must occur during a long term, and on a questioning of the therapeutic effectiveness of this substance as well as on the report, in the light of this new criteria, of a balance of advantage/risk of it.”</p>

<sec id="sec7-1741134312457174"><title>Intellectual property – Seizure – Infringement</title>
<p>Article L615-5 of the French Intellectual Property Code – law no. 78-753 of July 17, 1978 Paris Appeal Court December 6, 2011, no. 11/07690, CIPLA Ltd c / Astra Zeneca AB</p>
<p>The company Astra Zeneca made seizures according to Article L615-5 of the Intellectual Property Code, to prove the existence of infringement acts.</p>
<p>One of the seizure has been conducted near the AFSSAPS (French Health Agency) and raised the question whether the seizure (“saisie-contrefaçon”) is possible whereas it could be applied the Law of July 17, 1978 about access to administrative documents.</p>
<p>The Paris Appeal Court confirmed the injunction rendered in first instance and considered that the dispositions of Article L615-5 of the Intellectual Property Code prevail over the Law of July 17, 1978.</p>
<p>This seems to be a good decision since Article L615-5 of the Intellectual Property Code is not meaningless and it is allowed to make seizures near authorities like AFSSPAS.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1741134312457174"><title>Provisional prohibition measures – Supplementary protection certificate</title>
<p>Novartis Ag (Switzerland) and Novartis Pharma Sas c.</p>
<p>Mylan and Qualimed Sas</p>
<p>Court of appeal of Paris, pole 1, 2nd c., March 21, 2012</p>
<p>According to Article L615-3 of the Intellectual Property Code, the Court judging/stating in a summary proceeding may order measures of prohibition only if any reasonably evidence available to the applicant make true an infringement of his rights or that such infringement is imminent.</p>
<p>The French Law of October 29, 2007 requires the likelihood infringement of the rights to make possible the provisional measures, which can be pronounced by the Court and not the likelihood validity of the patent.</p>
<p>In front of the Court, as obviousness’s judge, only the obvious/evident nullity of the patent can let to the likelihood of the infringement of the rights involved; it is not the case in the litigation involving Novartis.</p>
<p>The legislator authorizes the generic manufacturers to do for all the formalities required for the placing/putting on the market of their product before the extinction date of the rights of intellectual property of the princeps product.</p>
<p>They can register their product on the list of reimbursable medicinal products and on the “Répertoire des génériques”, the directory of generics.</p>
<p>The only fact of having done such diligence before the expiration date of the rights of the applicant is therefore not enough to establish the infringement imminent scope on the rights of the one concerned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the intent of the defendants to market their generic without infringing the rights the plaintiff on his SPC, within a period of six months after their registration in the Official Journal, i.e. before the expiration date of the rights, characterizes imminent infringement to the rights conferred by the title.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1741134312457174"><title>Execution/enforcement of provisional measures</title>
<p>Biogaran Sas v. laboratory Medidom (Switzerland) and Negma laboratories</p>
<p>Tribunal de grande instance of Paris, 3rd c., 3rd section, January 27, 2012</p>
<p>The holder/owner of an European patent who has obtained provisional measures against a generic manufacturer, before the cancellation of its title has been issued, has to indemnify the damage on the basis of liability according to section 31, al. 2, of the Act of July 9, 1991.</p>
<p>This article opens a right for any debtor to be indemnified if the title of the creditor changed, in the following cases:
<list id="list1-1741134312457174" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>–when enforcement has been prosecuted against him,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>–or when the decision has been spontaneously executed.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Therefore, the generic manufacturer is here well grounded to apply for its indemnification.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the liability of the holder/owner of the patent is not engaged on the basis of Article 1382 of the French Code Civil which is the usual basis on torts. If there is no doubt that he used all legitimate and rightful means to defend its monopoly and its industrial property rights, it remains that those means were licit due to the existence of the patent, therefore as long as the patent is not cancelled by a justice decision, the owner of the patent had all the rights attached to such a title.</p>
<p>The fact that a claim of the patent was subsequently avoided does not retrospectively modify the legal means used in unfair tactics.</p>
<p>According to the liability of section 31 of the Law of July 9, 1991, the debtor must obtain compensation that put it back in the situation in which he was, including the predictable consequences of this situation.</p>
<p>If there is no doubt that on the day of the order pronounced the provisional measures, he was the only one to market the generic drug, it does not prove that this exclusivity would have persisted during the period of the measures.</p>
<p>By the way, the behavior of the generic manufacturer does not justify a reduction of his right to be indemnified.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fact of the marketing generic drugs, while there was a patent in force and that the action in nullity had just been launched, is not in its own a fault. This is just taking a risk based on the assessment that the patent was invalid, which in this case, has been the case.</p>
