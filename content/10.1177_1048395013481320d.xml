<p>Here’s a fun way to develop Theory of Mind (ToM) and social thinking using a commercially made game from “Would You Rather . . . ?” card deck by Zobmondo. You can purchase the card pack for ages 7+ and 12+. (Make certain you purchase the children’s version. Some content in the adult version is not appropriate for children.) The cards have questions in five areas. Children are asked to make a choice between two options, for example,</p>
<list id="list1-1048395013481320" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>pain/fear/discomfort: Would you rather stick your hand in a waffle iron OR have someone step on your bare foot with a golf shoe?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>appearance/embarrassment: Would you rather go to your first day of school with your eyebrows shaved off or go with your bottom lip five times its normal size?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>food/ingestion: Would you rather drink a glass of really spicy mustard or eat a super-sized bag of French fries found in a garbage can?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ethics/intellect: Would you rather be able to talk with all animals or be able to understand all foreign languages? and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>random: Would you rather not be able to throw anything or not be able to kick anything?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A number of the questions are disgusting or unpleasant.</p>
<p>In the last issue of <italic>Word of Mouth</italic>, Carol Westby provided a chart outlining the development of cognitive and affective ToM. Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can answer cognitive ToM questions fairly well, but do not understand nor readily apply affective ToM very well. Finding ways to encourage, teach, develop, and generalize ToM principles can be challenging for speech–language therapists. The “Would You Rather . . . ?” cards provide a simple fun way to develop ToM in children with ToM. They can highlight both cognitive and affective ToM. We begin working on general interactive conversational skills with students, then moved to more complex conversations as required by the “Would You Rather . . . ” game. There are many ways to play this game, but this article will focus on ways the game can be played to develop ToM skills. The game can be played at two levels.</p>

<title>Level 1</title>

<title>Expectations for Level 1</title>
<p>Level 1 and the first two steps will be the easiest and most fun for players with ASD. Level 1, Step 3 will be harder. Be sure and review tone of voice and facial expressions that match voice and situations if your student struggles with this. You can still play all levels and review tone of voice and facial expressions while you play the game as some students learn best when they see exactly what is happening at the “moment” in real time. Some students might need the game to be videoed and then reviewed frame by frame to reduce the cognitive load of playing and monitoring the situation. Many need to be told what to pay attention to.</p>

<title>Steps for Level 1</title>
<list id="list2-1048395013481320" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Step 1.1: A student begins the game by asking three to four people and himself the same question to get everyone’s answer. The student checks how many people have the same or different answers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 1.2: Next, the student listens to each person’s reason for his or her answer choice. The student listens to each person’s reason and checks to see how similar or different they are from each other. This helps the student to see that persons may make the same choice but have different reasons for their choices. The “whys” of what we select are often different based on our own experiences and perspectives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 1.3: In this step, the student needs to pay attention to the person’s tone of voice and facial expression to assign and label the “emotion” given by each player. Here is an example of the task. The game question, “Would you rather run through a dark forest or stay overnight in a graveyard?” The student is directed to pay attention to the tone of voice (fearful) and their face (looking scared) for emotion clues.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After playing this phase for a while, the therapist will have to be the judge of when the student should stay with Level 1 or to move on to Level 2.</p>

<title>Level 2</title>
<sec id="section6-1048395013481320">
<title>Expectations for Level 2</title>
<p>At this level, students put themselves into someone else’s brain. “What will the other person ‘think’ (choose) and why?” This phase is very difficult for students with ASD. To make it less discouraging and less anxious for the player, be sure and let the student know that they do not have to say the exact answer the other person says. Rather, let the student know to “think” of something close, but it does not have to be exact. Level 2 takes longer to play then Level 1. You may need to remind the student that it is just a best guess choice and reason based on how well they know the other person or from clues the person gives them. Remind the players that they have to try and think what the other person might be thinking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1048395013481320">
<title>Instructions for Level 2</title>
<p>In Level 2, the plays are slightly different in that each player will use Token 1 or 2 to show his or her answer selection. You will also use index cards as barrier covers so that students cannot initially see one another’s choices. Players reveal their answers after everyone has selected his or her answers. Again, it is important to remind the students that they are to “think what the other person will think.”</p>

<list-item><p>Step 2.1: The student has to “think” what the other person might “think” their choice will be (just the choice not the reason at this point in time). All players use the number tokens (No. 1 and No. 2 tokens set for each player) to make their choice. They select Answer 1 or 2 and put Token 1 or 2 under their cards (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048395013481320">Figure 1</xref>). After everyone has selected a response, they remove the barrier cards to expose the number choice selected. Compare whether the choices are the same or different.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Step 2.3: Then the “meeting of the minds” can occur where the two express their reasons and check how close their “thinking” was. Students often struggle to comprehend this step.</p></list-item>

<title>Summary of the Activity</title>
<p>Level 1 is typically fairly easy for students with ASD, but some will need additional practice understanding tone of voice and facial expressions. Level 2 is much more difficult for them. The majority of students with ASD find it difficult to “think” what another person is thinking (the hallmark of ToM difficulties for players with ASD). By beginning with Level 1, students experience success and are more willing to attempt playing Level 2. The ultimate goal is to play several rounds of Level 2 successfully with several people to generalize ToM skills.</p>
<p>When we have played the game with four people, one with ASD and three being neurotypical, we found it was easy to predict the responses and reasons of the neurotypical players compared with the students with ASD. The rigid thinking of players with ASD made it difficult for them to predict why someone else would choose a particular answer. Students with ASD often chose an odd reason for their answer based on one aspect of the situation they focused on rather than a general reason behind why someone would choose an answer. They had difficulty predicting appropriate consequences of choices. For example, a card asked, “Would you rather have all loose teeth or have every fourth tooth missing?” The student with ASD chose “have all loose teeth” so he could eat potato chips. In contrast, the neurotypical players chose “have every fourth tooth missing” so they could eat more foods and have less pain. When the player with ASD was asked why he chose Option 1, he said, “You can eat potato chips with loose teeth,” obviously not fully understanding the concept of having every tooth loose. He did not draw on his experience of when he had one or two loose teeth. He did not recall how loose teeth can hamper eating many types of foods and how it can cause pain to have loose teeth. Students with ASD often had difficulty predicting what another person was thinking because they had difficulty logically reasoning through situations.</p>
