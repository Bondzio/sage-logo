<abstract>
<p>Within the first year following orthotopic heart transplantation, the patient is at risk of graft failure, rejection, and infection. Late mortality is often due to allograph vasculopathy. Most of the patients with primary graft failure will usually recover with temporary mechanical ventricular assist support; however, on occasion the patient must be retransplanted. For the patient who suffers primary graft failure necessitating explanation and bridging until a new suitable graft is found, there are several total artificial heart options. However, in the pediatric population these options are limited. The authors’ surgical colleagues were able to fashion a paracorporeal total artificial heart constructed with 2 ventricular assist devices. In this case report, the authors discuss a pediatric patient who had to be explanted and supported for an extended amount of time. This article describes the incidence of cardiomyopathy in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients, the choice of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/extracorporeal complete life support versus ventricular assist devices for support, the major causes of primary graft failure, and the authors’ experience in caring for an adolescent with such a device for a protracted length of time (118 days).</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 14-year-old black female with a past medical history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for 3 years and newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology was transferred to this institution from another state for evaluation for a cardiac transplantation.</p>
<p>At the previous hospital, the patient was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath, abdominal and flank pain. In the preceding 2 months she had complained of generalized weakness and fatigue but no chest pain, palpitations or edema. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed thrombosis of the spleen and bilateral renal arteries. Her chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly. The echocardiogram demonstrated severe decreased cardiac function, thrombi in left atrial appendage, left ventricle and dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient was admitted to pediatric intensive care unit and started on a Milrinone and heparin drip and then transitioned to coumadin. She received intravenous immunoglobulin 75 g and 4 units of packed red blood cells. Cardiac catheterization showed elevated end diastolic pressure and pulmonary hypertension. During her admission at the referring hospital she had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed.</p>
<p>A complete cardiac transplant workup was performed, but the patient was not accepted as a transplant candidate because of social and financial issues. The patient was transferred to this institution in south Florida where the patient’s father lives. Social service planned for the father to obtain custody of the patient, resolving social and financial issues, so that the patient could become eligible for heart transplantation.</p>
<p>Her past medical history was significant for fevers, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was on regular course of steroids for her juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for which she was on a course of steroids.</p>
<p>On physical examination, her height was 170 cm, she weighed 70 kg, and she was in no apparent distress. The patient was resistant to examination. Repeated cardiac echo exams showed an ejection fraction of 10%. Her preliminary laboratory exams were unremarkable except for mildly elevated liver function tests. Serology exams showed cytomegalovirus+ IgG, Epstein–Barr virus+ Ig, hepatitis B virus+, herpes simplex virus+ IgG, and varicella zoster virus+.</p>
<p>The patient was diagnosed with severe heart failure (NYHA class IV) secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy. She was Milrinone dependent and was listed for cardiac transplant.</p>
<p>On the ninth day of admission, the patient underwent an orthotopic heart transplant. However, at the conclusion of transplant in the operating room, biventricular function was so poor that the surgical team implanted 2 tandem hearts in a left and right biventricular assist device (BiVAD) configurations. The chest was left open and patient transported to the cardiothoracic surgical ICU.</p>
<p>On the following day, the patient was brought back to the operating room. It was clear that a large left ventricular thrombus extended beyond the aortic valve occluding the right and left coronary arteries producing global ischemia. The transplanted heart was removed because of primary graft failure, diffuse ischemic injury, and possible further thrombus propagation. The patient was transitioned back to cardiopulmonary bypass machine and then bilateral Thoratec devices (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) were implanted with the left and right ventricular outflow lines placed through the chest wall. The patient was transitioned off cardiopulmonary bypass, returned to the cardiothoracic surgical ICU and relisted for heart transplantation.</p>

<title>ICU Course</title>
<p>The care of a complex cardiac patient is tremendous in terms of attention to medical detail. Every single organ system is at risk and can sabotage the entire outcome. Our challenge was managing an adolescent patient on total paracorporeal total artificial circulation for an undetermined number of days; which turned into 118 days. At the same time we were charged with strengthening and preparing her for retransplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612456702">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>On return to the ICU, we had no idea of how long the patient would be “acardiac.” The immediate issues were physiologic, infectious, emotional/psychological, and last, the maintenance of the artificial circulation.</p>
<p>The hemodynamics supplied by the BiVAD was always sufficient. However, the need for full anticoagulation posed some problems with bleeding, including bright red blood per rectum within the first week. A gastrointestinal and general surgical consult found a clot at the ileiocecal valve possibly reflecting an episode of ischemic colitis. With conservative treatment and brief heparin holiday the issue resolved. Bleeding at operative site subsided and the chest was closed.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal bleeding became a recurrent problem. Upper endoscopy was performed without specific findings. This necessitated judicious but precarious holding of anticoagulation and periodic transfusions.</p>
<p>Within 10 days of original surgery, the patient experienced the effects of a systemic inflammatory response. This manifested as elevated liver enzymes, diminished renal function, and worsening interstitial lung infiltrates. Continuous veno-veno hemodialysis was started and the patient was removed from the transplant list.</p>
<p>On the 20th day, while still intubated and ventilated, acinectobacter was isolated from tracheal secretions. The patient became septic. Therapy with colistin was started. Although there was a persistently elevated white count the chest X-ray began to clear. A protracted course for ventilatory wean necessitated a tracheostomy.</p>
<p>Nutrition was complicated by regurgitation of tube feeds; a complete evaluation found no significant findings to explain this problem. This along with persistent nausea was a recurring problem throughout her acardiac course. The ICU team considered that this might be psychogenic in origin as this symptom tended to wax and wane.</p>
<p>From early onset we sought to empirically cover a broad spectrum of infection as the chest was left open for 24 hours before it could be closed. Despite and perhaps because of broad antibiotic coverage the patient developed a fever of unknown origin. A head computed tomography scan revealed an organizing sinusitis infection with hematoma. Patient underwent a maxillary antrectomy, total ethmoidectomy, and sphenoidotomy. An indium scan found no other sources.</p>
<p>On day 40 was our first significant neurologic concern with an acute change in responsiveness and delirium. With the need to pause anticoagulation previously our first concern was thromboembolism or seizures. A computed tomography scan of the brain was negative. The neurology service started patient on anticonvulsive.</p>
<p>With the white count trending down and decreasing ventilatory support the patient was able to participate in physical therapy and sessions with child psychology.</p>
<p>By the 60th day, we had negative cultures, and the patient was able to come off the ventilator for progressively longer periods of time. The tracheostomy was downsized and allowed the ICU to fit her with a Passy Muir valve allowing speech and better communication with the nursing staff.</p>
<p>By the 68th day, bleeding issues had subsided such that we could initiate coumadin therapy. The patient was eating a regular diet.</p>
<p>By the 75th day, renal function had improved so that hemodialysis was only required once a week and by the 92nd day not at all. The patient had transitioned from sitting and weight bearing to ambulating with assistance, including a brief period of walking outside the hospital. The ability to ambulate, albeit with assistance, was significant in the patient’s self-perception. Physical therapy and nutrition were now of paramount importance. The labile emotional course of an adolescent in this very critical situation proved challenging. There were episodes of passive aggressive posturing, defiance, outbursts, tears, and downright fear. The assistance of family was paramount in working through each new episode and getting the patient optimized for retransplant. We minimized the physician interaction as much as possible, particularly with consultants. Our handpicked nursing staff was our primary route of communication and information. They were able to build a rapport that allowed us to overcome the patient’s lability. On the 107th day, we received notice that a donor was available. The patient underwent device explantation and received an orthotopic heart transplant. On postoperative day 1, the patient underwent plasmapharesis and a kidney transplant. The patient’s chest was closed on postoperative day 3. The patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The issues of interest in this case are many; however, we will limit ourselves to addressing 5 key concepts.</p>
<list id="list1-1944451612456702" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The psychosocial aspects of caring for an adolescent in an adult cardiothoracic surgical unit who must deal with a life-threatening illness.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To quote one parent’s remark, “dealing with an adolescent who is in need of a transplant is like pouring gasoline on a fire.” Not only does the patient have profound organ dysfunction but now must face a life-changing event at a time when they lack maturity and are dealing with identity issues. Our situation was compounded by problematic family dynamics.</p>
<p>Mental health issues in this young patient were great. The patient’s parents were divorced. Her mother lived out of state whereas her father lived locally. The majority of siblings were also living out of state. Finances were highly problematic as the mother moved here to help with her daughter’s care. The patient herself had great fluctuations in mood and cooperation. Therapists were able to elucidate sadness, stress, loneliness, and anger. Collectively, we planned on designating a small cadre tasked with this patient’s care. It was our hope that there would be a better relationship and bonding between the health care team and the patient. In therapy sessions, the patient was able to discuss her fear of being connected to and dependent on an external device, which, if it failed, would mean immediate demise. There were additional episodes of emotional lability, mild disinhibition, and blunted affect. This has been associated with cognitive changes from cardiac arrest and post–organ transplant. Neurologists were consulted for episodic events including temporary hemiplegia and incoherent mentation. Despite a battery of studies no definitive etiology was found although they suggested microembolization from the device as a cause. One last stressor was that some of the family set up a Web site to help extended family to be connected to the patient’s progress. However, the mother was disturbed about unfettered information being disseminated.</p>
<p>The necessity of extrcorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; 0.2%) or BiVAD support (0.7%) is relatively low in the pediatric (&lt;16 years old) population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612456702">2</xref></sup> The use of ventricular assist devices has increased as devices become smaller and easier to maintain. The reason for implantation is similar to the adult population: destination therapy, bridge to transplant, or bridge to recovery. The literature is now growing on perioperative management of these patients. However, there remains little on the psychological overlay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612456702">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The initial transplant and its subsequent failures did not precipitate significant psychological issues as the patient remained sedated, intubated, and ventilated. It was after the implantation of the BiVAD and the patient’s emergence from a fog of sedation and systemic illness that we recognized the need for expert input. As a group, the cardiovascular and thoracic (CVT) surgeons, pediatric cardiologists, and adult CVT ICU intensivists called upon our colleagues in child psychology and pediatric psychiatry for input. Although the intensivists in the pediatric ICU may have had greater experience in dealing with life and death issues in the adolescent population, this unique set of circumstances had not been seen previously in our institution. In consultation, the mental health team met with the family, patient (when feasible), and the CVT surgeons/intensivists on a regular basis. The mental health experts gave a synopsis of the patient’s status and guidelines for management. The recommendations included (<italic>a</italic>) limiting patient interaction to a small cadre of nurses and respiratory technicians; (<italic>b</italic>) giving a daily update and plan each morning that included parent(s), limiting tests and blood draws to the morning hours; (<italic>c</italic>) answering all questions candidly and strictly limiting private side discussions with parents; (<italic>d</italic>) setting a nursing and self-care routine; and (<italic>e</italic>) returning patient to school work as early as possible. The literature suggests scheduled structured meetings with the family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612456702">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although our plan seemed meritorious, logical, and met with the blessings of our experts, the confounding factor was the fact that our patient was an adolescent and prone to lability. This too was prognosticated by child psychology. So, there was no surprise when detrimental behavior and outright defiance occurred. The family did try to coax a better response. But as there were already interparental issues neither parent wanted to be seen in a harsh light. Their roles tended to be passive. For the staff in an adult surgical ICU this was rather confounding to attempt both roles as empathetic nurse/direct caregiver and moderator of behavior. We felt that the role should not fall on the CVT surgeon as we needed the patient to give him ultimate confidence. So, it was felt that the ICU attending who rotated on a weekly basis would be best suited to deliver structure as needed allowing family, nurses, and surgeon to remain in good graces.</p>
<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder may be seen in the pediatric patient population. Mintzer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612456702">5</xref></sup> describe a nonreferred pediatric population aged 12 to 20 years who were 1 year out from their transplants, 16% of self-completed questionnaires met the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. An additional 14% had 2 to 3 symptom cluster criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612456702">5</xref></sup></p>

<list-item><p>2. The incidence of cardiomyopathy due to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and current thought about the illness and treatments</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Unlike other JIAs, there is no sex bias or peak age of onset although to fulfill diagnostic criteria the child must be younger than 16 years and the arthritis in one or more joints with a preceding fever of at least 2-week duration. In addition, the clinical picture includes macular rash, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and polyserositis that can overshadow the inflammation and arthritis symptoms. It is estimated that 40% of patients with sJIA have only one bout. Those who have the long-term chronic condition usually find that the systemic symptoms abate but the arthritis symptoms progress with joint destruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612456702">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is estimated that 4.7% of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have some cardiac involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and valvulitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612456702">7</xref></sup> The highest risk was seen in the first 3 years after diagnosis. Some patients with myocarditis were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and saw improvement; in other cases methotrexate and digitalis were added to steroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612456702">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612456702">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the exact triggers are unknown, infections are suspected. It is postulated that following the initial infection sJIA develops, as is either an auto-inflammatory condition or an inadequate downregulation of immune activation or perhaps some combination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612456702">10</xref></sup> There is evidence for both hypotheses although the first seems to have the most weight.</p>
<p>In sJIA, cytokine dysegulation with a decrement in interferon-γ is seen, although the proinflammatory cytokines are elevated. Excess interleukin 1-β (IL-1β) can result in fever, anorexia, pain, joint destruction, and vasculitis. An increased IL-6 parallels the fever curve and acute phase reactants, which in turn is responsible for the anemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612456702">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>As mentioned, the most common presenting feature is the fever followed by arthritis and rash. Laboratory findings indicating inflammation is seen with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis with increase in liver transaminases. Clinically, the fever is described as a quotidian pattern of spiking once or twice daily to 39°C with concomitant arthritis, rash, or serositis all abating with defervescence. Following fever, the next most common symptom is the arthritis itself although it may not be temporal and actually have onset until several years later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612456702">6</xref></sup> The wrists, knees, and ankles are the most commonly involved joints on initial presentation. Synovial cysts are also seen in sJIA occurring more frequently in the upper extremities.</p>
<p>The salmon pink nonpruritic rash is macular and widespread usually on the limbs and trunk and less on face, neck, palms, and soles. The rash tends to vanish within minutes to hours and correlates with the acute fevers.</p>
<p>Generalized lymphadenopathy is common in sJIA and was seen as a presenting symptom in 31% of patients. Hepatosplenomegaly is seen in approximately 50% of cases and is heralded by abnormal liver enzymes.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report, serositis is the major concern and the most common manifestation is pericarditis. In one study, 10% of patients presented with pericarditis while 14% had nonspecific serositis. The children who present with pericarditis are usually seen with nonspecific findings such as tachycardia, dyspnea, and may have a rub. The pericarditis may be a sign of evolving myocarditis resulting in cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias. In 1992, Goldenberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612456702">11</xref></sup> found 13 of 172 patients with sJIA had symptomatic cardiac manifestations. There was a relatively high incidence of myocardial involvement with or without pericarditis at 3.5% of all patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612456702">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the patient with myocardial involvement, florid clinical manifestations included tachypnea and dyspnea. A systolic murmur was found in 33% of patients as a clinical finding during the active phase of disease. This is because of a hyperkinesis and or widening of the fibrous ring secondary to enlargement of the chambers indicative or organic valvular damage with the most severe progressing to congestive heart failure. Treatment with at least 3 months of high-dose steroids is recommended because of the high potential for death from chronic cardiomyopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612456702">7</xref></sup> In our patient, recognition of her pathology was at the end stages of cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>Last, some of the less common neurological manifestation of sJIA is seizures, meningismus, irritability, ocular problems, and decreased level of consciousness. We saw each of these symptoms although it is more likely they were due to temporal causes rather then sJIA.</p>
<p>A significant complication of sJIA is amyloidosis, an acute phase reactant that is elevated with the inflammatory process. Amyloid is deposited in key vital organs like the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The first clinical sign is usually proteinuria and is commonly missed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612456702">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Treatment remains an evolving process. It includes nonsteroidals, anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, methotrexate, anti–tumor necrosis factor, cyclosporine, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide. A more targeted therapy in the form of biological blocking agents is transforming treatments. Anakinra, a IL-1 blocking agent, and tocilizumab, a IL-6 inhibitor, are 2 promising therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612456702">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the course and outcomes are highly variable in approximately half of the patients, the course of sJIA remains monocyclic with complete recovery within 2 years. Some patients have waning flairs and others achieve resolution of their systemic issues but with significant persistent arthritis. Clearly, our patient had sequelae from the serositis and myocardial involvement.</p>

<list-item><p>3. The causes of primary graft failure, why did we experience it and what to do now?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Primary graft failure accounts for 44% of mortality in the first 30 days postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612456702">13</xref></sup> How many patients succeed to get a second transplant is variable? The factors include comorbidities and the ability to support or bridge the failing graft to a retransplantation. In one study by Luo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612456702">14</xref></sup> the rate of cardiac retransplantation in the pediatric population was 7%. There is no one singular reason for primary graft failure. Several authors have done retrospective analysis and the characteristics of increased graft loss in the pediatric population are (<italic>a</italic>) older age of donor/mismatch for size, (<italic>b</italic>) elevated creatinine (renal dysfunction), (<italic>c</italic>) mechanical ventilation, (<italic>d</italic>) single ventricle, (<italic>e</italic>) age less than 1 year, (<italic>f</italic>) retrospective cross match, (<italic>g</italic>) liver dysfunction, and (<italic>h</italic>) recipient on ECMO. Additionally, poor preservation, long ischemia time, and undiagnosed anatomic pathological state of the transplanted heart are predictors of poor outcome irrespective of recipient age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451612456702">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451612456702"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451612456702"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451612456702">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In one rare case, a patient who received an orthotopic heart transplant had initial complete asystole secondary to the chronic high doses of multiple antiarrhythmics that the recipient was taking, which redistributed to the new heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612456702">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our patient, the first transplant was performed with patient already in congestive heart failure and failing renal function. The first graft was asystolic despite full chemotropic support. When the patient returned to the operating room it was no surprise to find significant thrombus in the quiescent heart despite anticoagulation. Pathological examination showed perivascular infiltration but definitive etiology of initial failure was not discernible. In reviewing the literature we clearly had risk factor for primary graft failure.</p>
<p>It was decided that the patient would need to be bridged to retransplantation. The graft was removed to diminish risk of cellular rejection or humoral rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451612456702">17</xref></sup> The cobbling of BiVADs has been previously reported even in excess of our own 118 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451612456702">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451612456702"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451612456702">21</xref></sup> The question of timing for optimal outcome was our paramount concern. The family was anxious for early retransplantation. In one study (Iribarne)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451612456702">22</xref></sup>, assessing decision for retransplantation in early graft failure, it was found that early (&lt;90 days) was not associated with an increased morbidity or mortality when matched with recipient characteristics. However, for our patient, timing was determined not only by donor availability but also by patient optimization. It was necessary to arrive at a solution that would give the patient time to resolve pulmonary, renal, and inflammatory issues before seeking another graft. This solution of BiVADs provided near native perfusion and resolution of extraneous risk factors.</p>
<list id="list4-1944451612456702" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. Of the options available, ECMO/extracorporeal complete life support versus BiVAD with or without salvage cardiectomy, why did we pick one over the other and what are the implications?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The use of ECMO in primary graft failure is usually a consideration when there is expectation that the graft will recover in short order. In comparing outcomes of using a ventricular assist device versus ECMO as a bridge in transplant Jeewa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451612456702">22</xref></sup> found there was a less than 50% survival to hospital discharge in the ECMO group.</p>
<p>Salvage cardiectomy described in 2007 by Robinson (23) and Ubilla Ubilla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451612456702">23</xref></sup> for a primary graft failure even with adequate extracorporeal support is considered preferential to leaving in the graft, which would necessitate ongoing immunosuppression further complicating care.</p>
<p>The idea of cardiac replacement using a total artificial heart as bridge to transplant has been described previously. In one nonrandomized prospective study, Copeland et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451612456702">26</xref></sup> used the corporeal CardioWest device. The exclusion criterion, however, were a body surface area of less than 1.7 m<sup>2</sup>, which would preclude our patient.</p>
<p>A retrospective analysis of 73 patients from The Texas Children’s/Baylor College of Medicine was published using the Berlin Heart EXCOR for support prior to transplant or recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451612456702">27</xref></sup> The length of circulatory support was significantly longer from 1 day to 7.7 months with a median of 1.6 months. Their experience and outcomes were promising using the Berlin heart. A significant difference from our case was that their patients were pretransplant whereas ours was posttransplant with graft failure that needed to be removed.</p>
<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has long been the sole means of mechanical support of pediatric patients with end-stage cardiac failure but has a high waitlist mortality and survival to discharge of less than 50%. Our patient would not only need support but strengthening while awaiting a second transplant; ECMO would have been a hindrance to that task. In a report by researchers in Canada, it was found that the waitlist mortality of patients on ECMO was 38%, which reduced to 13% with VAD, and survival post–heart transplant to hospital discharge was better at 93% versus 80% for patients on ECMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451612456702">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a separate article from the Texas group, a retrospective analysis of mechanical circulatory support after acute cardiac graft rejection was published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612456702">2</xref></sup> Of their 8 cases, 5 used the BioMedicus-LVAD, 1 on ECMO, and 2 had a Thoratec-LVAD implanted. Six of their patients were weaned to recovery with intensive therapy and 2 were bridged to transplant. One of the patients with the Thoratec-LVAD expired. While this study group suffered graft failure, as did our patient, the median age of the graft to mechanical circulatory support was 1 year (range = 1.2 month to 8.4 years). In our case report, the organ failure was recognized in the immediate perioperative period and removed.</p>
<p>The DeBakey VAD Child is a Food and Drug Administration–approved implantable device for the young pediatric population. In our situation, our surgeons would have had to insert a right and left device. However, thromboembolic problems with earlier modes seems have slowed the enthusiasm for this device, but there are conflicting studies in this regard, which found this choice simple to implant and outpatient treatment safe and efficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451612456702">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451612456702">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ventricular assist devices have been used successfully in children as a bridge to transplant most notably the DeBakey VAD. Given the size and indefinite nature of support bridging could have easily been accomplished with the Thoratec VAD, the Berlin Heart, or the Medos VAD. All 3 systems have been used successfully in the pediatric population with better survival outcomes than ECMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1944451612456702">29</xref></sup> The unique situation, options, and availability of the devices in this patient are described in a previous publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1944451612456702">30</xref></sup></p>

<list-item><p>5. Finally, what are the consequences of a prolonged artificial circulation?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When reflecting on this question, it must be put in context of progress in the field of artificial circulatory support. In one article from 1998, researchers concluded that “In view of the poor results, the use of mechanical assist devices should not be recommended in the case of heart failure caused by acute rejection.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1944451612456702">31</xref></sup> However, in 2002 the same group suggests a more favorable view of assist devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1944451612456702">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our patient, the hemodynamics was quickly stabilized with the 2 ventricular assist devices and was of little issue throughout her care. Volume status is paramount in artificial circulation but again it can be easily managed.</p>
<p>Blood loss and dropping hemoglobin proved a challenge. Adverse events in previous studies found bleeding to in the range of 62% of patient with a total artificial heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451612456702">26</xref></sup> There was the initial surgical loss at the onset.</p>
<p>In addition, with the necessity of anticoagulation, the raw surface, mucosal, and gastrointestinal bleeding was significant. Finally, the ventricular assist devices themselves have been shown to have some degree of hemolysis. Our goal in volume therapy had been adequate total systemic volume to yield a cardiac index of 2.0 or better. The decision to transfuse was difficult. Oxygen delivery to the tissues begins to decrease at hematocrit values lower than 25% (hemoglobin 8 g/dL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1944451612456702">33</xref></sup> We had concerns about increasing sensitization/ antigens in what could be a difficult match for an unpredictable wait.</p>
<p>The devices themselves were of little problem or inconvenience while the patient was in bed. However, as the patient reached the 75th day she was up and walking with the physical therapist and using the controller as a walker. The harnesses supplied by Thoratec were sufficient to hold the pumps while she ambulated but were slightly burdensome and constant reminder of her artificial circulation.</p>
<p>Ventilation was problematic from the start. The pulmonary edema initially seen after the transplant was remedied by the insertion of the ventricular assist devices. However, acinectobacter infection, volume overload from failing kidneys and the procedures themselves necessitated tracheostomy and slow wean from ventilation.</p>
<p>Despite the fact we had excellent pulsatile flow from the Thoratec devices, the patient did sustain renal failure and needed hemodialysis until 92nd day. Although her renal function had returned and was satisfactory immediately prior to retransplantation, it was thought that with immunosuppressive agents, an unknown postoperative course and previous damage to her native kidneys to proceed with kidney transplant following her heart retransplant.</p>
<p>As noted above, our course was complicated by an acinectobacter infection and sinusitis. This is consistent with other studies, which found an infection rate of 77% in these patients with a majority being respiratory in nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451612456702">26</xref></sup> However, extreme vigilance for infection must be a component of care each and every day. Device infection is not amenable to antibiotics and precludes moving forward on transplant list.</p>
<p>Following retransplantation, the patient had no further gastrointestinal bleeding problems. The necessity of full anticoagulation for the BiVADs was contributory to gastrointestinal bleed. Although brief interruption of anticoagulation was deemed risky to stop the melena, we were most fortunate in that no catastrophic events occurred.</p>
<p>Although there was an elevation in liver enzymes, liver function had always been sufficient as evidenced by our difficulty in anticoagulating the patient.</p>
<p>Last, and perhaps most important, is teasing out the entangled issue of neurostatus and emotional state of the patient. Studies found 26% of patients with total artificial heart had a neurological event, including stroke, transient ischemic attacks, seizure, and encephalopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451612456702">26</xref></sup> Even in shorter ventricular support reports, the embolic stroke and depression plague the younger population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1944451612456702">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous articles describe similar paracorporeal total artificial heart from available ventricular assist devices for nearly the same amount of time before destination transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1944451612456702">35</xref></sup> Our case however adds the overlay of adolescence. Our previously healthy patient with tenuous family support systems arrived from out of state in what was a relatively rapid transition from prospective heart transplant patient to a BiVAD supported circulation in an adult cardiothoracic ICU with uncertain future.</p>
<p>In addition to the many complications, physiological, pharmacological, and therapeutic interventions, the patient was contending with autonomy, body image, guilt, and fear of the situation. Our child psychology department met with the patient and family on a daily basis. Our ICU team introduced themselves and explained what each person’s function was. When there were changes to the ICU team, we would introduce the change ahead of time. The limiting of ICU nurses limited the coverage to as few people as possible was a successful strategy to establish better rapport. We set a daily time (usually morning rounds) to explain the day’s plan/goals and answer any questions. As the patient’s mood changed and at times became more sullen and demanding, we insisted on limit setting for nonessential access. Recognizing the familiar is the best antidepressant, the child life department prepared learning tools at the 75th day when the patient could participate. This gave the patient a structure of her days, which by then included a more active physical therapy.</p>
<p>No discussion of a case of this nature would be complete without considering resource utilization. One question that should be broached in transplant consideration is, what to do if another organ does not become available or if the patient becomes too sick to retransplant particularly if the patient was on ECMO. We previously reported our own experience when preoperative discussion was not fully vetted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1944451612456702">36</xref></sup> With contracted health care dollars becoming scarcer and patient care programs contracting one has to insure that any facility contemplating care of this magnitude has the experience and resources to provide complex care. Recent analysis suggests that with the increase of ventricular assist device support in children, they would best be served in high-volume large teaching hospitals where expertise, experience, and multidisciplinary team work can provide the necessary support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1944451612456702">37</xref></sup></p>
