<abstract>
<p>This article examines the politics of formal representations of environmental hazards. Certain environmental hazards are made publicly invisible when their formal representations are misaligned with what can be measured in practice under the existing socioeconomic and technoscientific conditions. Conversely, better aligning formal representations and measurement capabilities helps reveal the scope of such hazards. Such (mis)alignment of formal representations is a relative, dialogical, and historically specific process. It requires not only experts and their specialized knowledge, but also contextual knowledge of the actual local conditions. The work of alignment of formal representations requires public ‘un-black-boxing’ of these formalisms. It also depends on much infrastructural work, which I describe as the invisible work of making visible. (Mis)alignment of formal representations is illustrated here with the examples of three successive concepts of radiation protection in Belarus, a former Soviet Union republic that was covered with much of the Chernobyl fallout. Revisions to the radiation protection concept first expanded and then dramatically shrank the scope of the officially recognized and publicly visible radioactive contamination in Belarus.</p>

<p>The politics of formal representations – standards, thresholds, and visual mapping – lies in what ‘slides away when they are created’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712465356">Star, 1995</xref>). This article explores the politics of formal representations for environmental standards. Subtle changes to environmental standards can significantly limit the scope of risks recognized both officially and by the broader public. I approach the production of formal representations as both work and public debate – albeit the kind of debate that profoundly depends on experts (and where most people do not see the hazard, do not understand the technical language of the debate, and have limited channels of influence on it). I consider how formal representations can be used to limit the scope of recognized risks, through the example of several revisions to radiation standards in Belarus, a former Soviet Union republic that received most of the fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.</p>
<p>As with many other modern pollutants, radiation is not directly perceptible to the unaided human senses. People cannot see, hear, or feel radiation. Their senses register nothing. As a result, formal representations become doubly important in defining the scope of what is considered dangerous contamination. Acceptable thresholds of exposure, acceptable levels of food contamination, and other protection standards are the language of legal and administrative decision making. They also influence what the affected populations view as dangerous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312712465356">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, regulation of environmental risks affects corporate and state interests: more sensitive standards often mean greater recognized scopes of hazards and greater mitigation costs. This makes formal definitions of environmental risks the subject of fierce political struggles, or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712465356">Ulrich Beck (1992 [1986])</xref> puts it, ‘definitional struggles over the scale, degree, and urgency of risks’ (p. 46). Recognizing less hazard not only reduces the associated mitigation costs and the number of recognized victims, but also potentially increases the number of actual victims whose health is affected, even if they are unaware of their exposure.</p>
<p>One obvious way to reduce the scope of recognized hazards is to increase acceptable levels of contamination or exposure. I argue that a similar obscuring of risks can be achieved when environmental standards are not descriptive enough or when they do not account for what can be measured under the existing socioeconomic and technoscientific conditions.</p>
<p>Revisions of radiation protection standards in Belarus provide a telling example for the politics of formal representations; each revision reshaped the scope of contamination recognized as hazardous. While Ukraine inherited the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus had to contend with much of its territory being contaminated with long-living radionuclides.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306312712465356">2</xref></sup> The post-Chernobyl contamination was chronic, imperceptible to residents of the contaminated areas, and far too extensive for the country’s limited economic capabilities to respond to effectively.</p>
<p>I focus on the period in Belarusian history, starting from the last years of the Soviet Union, when a relatively open debate became possible, at least among experts in the know and in power. The revisions I describe happened before 2001, when Aleksandr Lukashenko – first elected in 1994 and building an increasingly authoritarian regime – was reelected in what many described as rigged elections. The period I focus on was not a period of democratic freedoms, but it was a period of transitions, which allowed for diverse voices to emerge. Shifts in political power affected approaches to dealing with massive radiological contamination. In turn, these led to strategic reconfigurations of Chernobyl-related standards. My focus is on the nature of these reconfigurations, including how formal representations were used to obscure radioactive contamination. I also describe some of the infrastructural work required to make the risks visible.</p>
<p>This article makes use of the materials collected during several years of research for a broader project. The larger study focused on practices that made imperceptible radiological contamination observable and publicly visible, as well as practices that made it invisible to the public. My data collection and analysis followed the grounded theory approach, which emphasizes ongoing analysis of data and inductive generation of theoretical concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312712465356">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312712465356">Clarke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312712465356">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712465356">Strauss, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712465356">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>). The broader project incorporated archival and ethnographic research, including interviews with experts and residents of the contaminated areas. Analysis in this article, however, relies on the following data: texts and unpublished draft revisions of the ‘concept of radiation protection’, as well as official responses from critics; related coverage in Belarusian official and oppositional newspapers; and published documentary accounts by politicians and scientists (with different political allegiances) who were involved in attempts to define Chernobyl-related policies in Belarus.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306312712465356">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Formal representations are created on the basis of ad hoc situated representations, through work such as ‘abstracting (removing specific properties), quantifying, making hierarchies, classifying and standardizing, and simplifying’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712465356">Star, 1995</xref>: 90). This study makes formal representations less dependent on local contingencies for their meaning. In Bruno Latour’s terms, formal representations are the most immutable and mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712465356">Latour, 1986</xref>), allowing for easier comparison across different sites and situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312712465356">Bowers, 1992</xref>). At the same time, formal representations still have to be ‘instantiated in’ or adapted to each specific work setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712465356">Star, 1995</xref>: 92). This tension between abstract formal representations and the real-time, concrete work of applying them in practice is what Susan Leigh Star calls the central tension of formal representations.</p>
<p>Though formal representations can appear neutral and objective, they are always incomplete and strategically selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312712465356">Bowers, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712465356">Star, 1995</xref>). The politics of formal representations is about determining their ‘degree of granularity’: their specificity and concreteness, or how much they make visible and invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312712465356">Bowker and Star, 1999</xref>). The politics of formal representations also is about which aspects of reality are made visible: which properties of empirical descriptions of reality are emphasized and which are discarded in the processes of abstraction, simplification, and standardization? Consequently, it is important to understand who has created the numbers, for whom, and why. Whose classifications are used? What is the basis for hierarchical ordering? Categories, standards, and other formal representations carry the influences that have shaped them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312712465356">Bowker and Star, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312712465356">Lampland, 2010</xref>). They legitimize some actors and judgments and delegitimize others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712465356">Ottinger, 2010</xref>). These politics become even more consequential when formal representations recede into large infrastructures and become invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312712465356">Almklov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312712465356">Bowker and Star, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712465356">Busch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312712465356">Lampland and Star, 2009</xref>). Particular categories or standards become ‘naturalized’, and the implications of their use have to be articulated. The politics of formalisms can be made more explicit with descriptions of their use in practice and of the biases and judgments that shaped their creation. As mentioned earlier, the general question for judging these politics is what has slipped away, ‘what is left out when formalisms are created’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712465356">Star, 1995</xref>: 101).</p>
<p>Star’s observation about the central tension of formal representations has particular implications for defining environmental hazards. Paying attention to the tension between abstract formalisms and situated work helps show how environmental standards can be used to conceal risks. Environmental standards can hinder public recognition of a hazard, effectively serving to conceal it when these standards are misaligned with what can be easily measured in practice under the existing socioeconomic and technoscientific conditions. The scope of recognized risks also shrinks when standards ignore what should be measured in practice to better represent the complexity of risks, that is, what should be measured to account for complex and changing patterns of the distribution of risks. Standards that are ‘good on paper’ but not sensitive to the conditions on the ground limit the empirical data used in decision making and contribute to public ignorance of a hazard. We need to attend to empirical complexity: what can be measured in practice, under the existing conditions, as well as what should be measured to describe patterns of risk distribution.</p>
<p>I refer to the work of adjusting formal representations with respect to empirical complexity as the work of aligning or misaligning. Neither alignment nor misalignment is an absolute state describing which representations are ‘true to reality’ or scientifically valid. Rather, alignment can be interpreted as the constant work of creating more useable and less problematic representations that are internally consistent and sensitive to relevant, collectable data. Better alignment – or greater misalignment – is thus relative to existing formal representations, as well as other groups’ perspectives on how to change them. It also depends on and is relative to available tools and infrastructures and broader socioeconomic conditions. Adjusting formal indicators to practical conditions of measurement is essential to the process of alignment. In many ways, alignment depends on the work of ‘un-black-boxing’ formal representations, monitoring their use, and articulating the inherent or emergent biases and oversight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306312712465356">3</xref></sup> It thus requires knowledge of local conditions, along with rich empirical data, which, in turn, is a product of sustained infrastructural efforts (as described in section ‘Invisible work of making visible’). The trade-off for more descriptive formal representations is potentially greater costs of mitigation and protection efforts.</p>
<p>Adjusting formal representations often can only be done from certain technoscientific and bureaucratic positions; it requires specialized knowledge and tools, along with access to the mechanisms and networks of decision making. But it is never just about expert knowledge. Adjusting formal representations of environmental standards critically depends on local, contextual knowledge. This raises questions of accountability of experts, transparency of decision making, and ways to ensure that experts and expert institutions are reflective of – or at least sensitive to – the plurality of local knowledge. Indeed, the early history of post-Chernobyl radiation protection shows the extent to which the conditions of secrecy and strict institutional hierarchies can obstruct developing responsible and sensitive formal representations.</p>

<title>Three concepts of radiation protection</title>
<p>The following sections provide background on the early history of post-Chernobyl radiation protection in Belarus and then describe three successive concepts of radiation protection: the concept proposed by top Soviet scientists in 1988; the alternative concept by Belarusian scientists approved in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union; and the revised concept adopted by the Belarusian government in 1995 after several years of independence. Taken together, these three concepts provide an example of efforts to conceal or reveal the scope of post-Chernobyl contamination in Belarus. They also illustrate how radical historical transformations allowed for sweeping reconfigurations of formal representations used in decision making and correspondingly for dramatic fluctuations in the recognized scope of hazards.</p>
<sec id="section3-0306312712465356">
<title>Background: early post-Chernobyl radiation protection</title>
<p>At the time of the accident in 1986, the Soviet Union had no laws regulating radiation protection of broader populations. Normative acts were limited only to those individuals working in NPPs or residing within a 30-km radius of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712465356">Nesterenko, 1998</xref>: 37). The Belarusian Soviet Republic did not have nearly enough radiologists and dosimeters of adequate sensitivity. Establishing appropriate radiation protection infrastructures in Belarus took several months. Early radiation protection efforts included training several thousand radiation control specialists, devising methods for various types of measurements, and establishing a network of more than 2000 centers of radiation control at affected collective farms, food processing plants, and other facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306312712465356">4</xref></sup> The state system of radiation control also included lines of communication and command; it produced radiological analysis and mapping. These early maps were not made public.</p>
<p>However, establishing elaborate infrastructures was not enough to improve radiation protection in the Republic, as the participants in these early efforts have documented (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712465356">Nikitchenko, 1999</xref>). Collected data about the levels of contamination were not made public, and it was ignored in policy decision making. Administrators within the system of radiation control made their decisions based on directives from above, often coming from Moscow, rather than the available empirical data. Belarusian legal documents often were based on similar documents adopted by the Council of Ministers, USSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712465356">Shevchouk and Gourachevskiy, 2001</xref>: 35). Selective approaches to radiological data that ignored many aspects of the complex, overwhelming situation were essential to sustain the control of the Soviet government and its experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712465356">Petryna, 2002</xref>). At the same time, everything from collected data to adopted policies that ignored that data were made invisible by strict secrecy, power hierarchies, and inconspicuous technical standards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0306312712465356">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some ways, the results of this policy-making were obviously inhumane. In parts of the Mogilev region – to the north of the recognized contamination ‘zone’ next to the Ukranian border, – people were left to live with levels of radioactivity comparable to those around the exploded reactor (evacuations were not organized until 4–7 years later). Residents of the 30-km zone around the reactor were resettled to other, still heavily contaminated areas, perhaps in an attempt to limit the scope of publicly recognized contamination and to maintain the region’s population levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312712465356">Matsko and Imanaka, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312712465356">Yaroshinskaya, 1995</xref>). High radiation doses received by groups of lay populations were either not registered or concealed. Medical staff were ordered to record understated doses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0306312712465356">6</xref></sup> Lay people could not officially receive the diagnosis of acute radiation syndrome and instead were given the diagnosis of vegetovascular dystonia. Agricultural production continued even in heavily contaminated areas. Indeed, most of the 1986 yield was processed for consumption, with the exception of yield from the 30-km zone. The only place where this produce was not brought to and sold was Moscow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312712465356">Matsko and Imanaka, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712465356">Nikitchenko, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>My point here is not to recount this well-documented negligence, but to suggest that these inhumane policies become more difficult to interpret when their description relies on formal representations. Formal representations add a level of ambiguity – they refer to a body of technoscientific knowledge as a framework for interpretation. The reader needs a background in radiation science to interpret the numbers. At the very least, those without the specialized background require explanations and comparisons. In addition to specialized knowledge, interpreting formal representations and what they mean in practice requires awareness of the local context. Thus, we may compare the post-Chernobyl exposure thresholds to the current international standard for the general public, 1 mSv/year, and they appear astronomical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306312712465356">7</xref></sup> On 12 May 1986, 2 weeks after the accident, the Soviet government set the maximum radiation dose limit at 500 mSv/year for the population in general and 100 mSv/year for children under the age of 14 years and pregnant and nursing women. On 22 May 1986, the limit was lowered to 100 mSv/year for all members of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712465356">Shevchouk and Gourachevskiy, 2001</xref>: 31). In 1987, the Soviet Ministry of Health set a new dose limit ‘per life’, 500 mSv over 70 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0306312712465356">8</xref></sup> That same year, Soviet scientists proposed radiation protection measures that promised to remove the need for relocating the populations – by providing them with ‘clean’ food supplies, especially milk, and administering decontamination measures to enable food production. These measures were to enable people to remain even in the highly contaminated areas, with levels of contamination exceeding 40 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> and up to 80 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712465356">Nesterenko et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the efforts to supply the affected areas with clean food proved unfeasible. Empty shelves and a shortage of food were widespread problems in the last years of the Soviet Union. Production of clean food in the contaminated areas also was unachievable, despite complex deactivation measures and restrictions on private farming. Residents in the contaminated areas often had to rely on subsistence farming to supplement their diets and had little or no information about radiation protection measures they could implement. The full volume of agricultural production continued in areas with up to 80 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> until 1990.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1988, experts in Moscow proposed a concept of radiation protection that would remove the problem of people living in the contaminated areas without access to clean food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306312712465356">
<title>Concept one: the Soviet concept of ‘Safe Living’</title>
<p>The first Soviet concept of radiation protection came as part of the comprehensive program that was intended to replace the initial response to the Chernobyl disaster, which consisted of numerous isolated decrees. It also was an extension of the earlier Soviet approaches to radiation protection. The ‘concept’ was an official document that specified standards for radiation protection, including permissible contamination levels and human radiation exposure, criteria to define populations at risk, and priorities for protective measures. It was meant to provide ‘a systematic solution’ to the problem of post-Chernobyl contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712465356">Shevchouk and Gourachevskiy, 2001</xref>: 36) and possibly serve as a foundation for further legislative acts.</p>
<p>The ‘Concept of Safe Living in Areas Contaminated after the Chernobyl Accident’ (often referred to as the ‘35 rem’ concept) was developed by the National Committee on Radiation Protection, headed by academician L.A. Ilyin, and approved in the late fall of 1988. It set a new maximum dose per life at 350 mSv for 70 years. The concept assumed that ‘the sum of external and internal exposure delivered to a person as a result of the Chernobyl accident will not exceed 350 mSv within a 70-year period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712465356">Malko, 1998</xref>: 7). Ilyin et al. also argued that doses equal or less than that would not have significant health effects; health effects caused by the Chernobyl accident would be ‘in the range of values less than standard deviation of spontaneous levels of the corresponding pathology’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712465356">Malko, 1998</xref>: 7). Based on these assumptions, further radiation protection measures, including relocation, were deemed no longer necessary in almost all affected areas of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Implementation of the program – lifting all restrictions introduced in the contaminated areas after the accident – was slated to begin in January 1990.</p>
<p>In other words, the concept claimed that people could live safely anywhere except for the zone of alienation (where the evacuations happened in 1986), and that agricultural production in the contaminated areas did not pose a problem (additional decontamination measures might be required if projected doses in particular locations were to exceed 350 mSv) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712465356">Malko, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712465356">Nikitchenko, 1999</xref>: 145).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306312712465356">
<title>Concept two: the alternative Belarusian concept</title>
<p>The last years of the Soviet Union were a period of a heightened engagement of the media and civil society. A number of public figures in Belarus, including some leading national scientists, challenged the Soviet handling of the aftermath of the accident. The challengers were not only emboldened by perestroika and glasnost, but also by hopes for international assistance in dealing with the fallout. They had access to more information than an average citizen and pressured the government to declassify Chernobyl documents in 1989, exposing nearly criminal negligence in radiation protection and in the collection of dosimetric information. To them, top Moscow scientists represented the interests of the Soviet establishment, and theoretical assessments made by Ilyin et al. were ‘concealing the truth’ of the real scope of the consequences of Chernobyl. The Belarusian scientists saw themselves as revealing what had been made invisible by methodological choices of the leading Soviet experts.</p>
<p>The Belarusian scientists’ critique of the Safe Living concept was concerned precisely with areas where the concept obscured the complexity of the post-Chernobyl circumstances. For example, the concept did not factor in accumulations of plutonium or strontium, and it did not analyze irradiation of different groups immediately after the accident, when people lived without any restrictions and without adequate iodine prophylactics. Furthermore, the Safe Living concept was a one-step system of making decisions about protective measures that ignored how people accumulated their doses and what could be measured in practice. It lacked effective mechanisms for keeping track of dose burdens. In the words of one of the most outspoken Belarusian radiation safety experts, ‘the Ministry of Health of the USSR effectively left the population without measures of radiation protection, inviting them to take care of their health in unrealistic ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712465356">Nesterenko, 1998</xref>: 38). Others referred to it as an ‘office concept’ to underline that it could not be actualized in practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0306312712465356">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Experts at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences proposed their alternative concept (reprinted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712465356">Nikitchenko, 1999</xref>: 62–65), which they presented to the government of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR). The Soviet government responded by inviting three World Health Organization (WHO) experts with ties to the nuclear community to visit Belarus and to join Ilyin et al. in the meeting at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences in June 1989. The international experts attempted to convince their Belarusian counterparts to endorse the Safe Living concept, even proposing a higher threshold and rejecting the possibility of any radiation-induced health effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712465356">Malko, 1998</xref>). Indeed, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts continue to refer to the Soviet estimates approvingly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0306312712465356">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite pressure from the Soviet and international experts, as well as resistance of some local scientists,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0306312712465356">11</xref></sup> the alternative concept was approved in 1990, and it later became the foundation for the Chernobyl laws in Belarus. The Belarusian concept was both more cautious in its estimates of radiation health impacts and more sensitive to the complexity of the post-Chernobyl situation, including to what could actually be done (and measured) in practice. The concept was based on two underlying assumptions: the no-threshold hypothesis of the relationship between dose and effect (i.e. there is no threshold below which radiation doses are safe) and combinatory effects (radiation exposure can increase sensitivity to the influences of nonradiological hazards).</p>
<p>The Belarusian concept recognized the lack of adequate data, as well as the impossibility of reliable monitoring of individual doses. Thus, multiple criteria were established to guide radiation protection. These criteria included not only effective equivalent doses, but also the levels of soil contamination, effectiveness of radiation protection measures, and changes to the structure of morbidity. The authors of the concept argued that people should not live where clean food could not be produced. Limitations on agricultural production and existing ways of life started in areas with 15 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> of Cs-137; resettlements adopted the same standard. Residents of areas with lower levels of contamination had the right to resettle if protective measures were not effective and annual doses exceeded 1 mSv (from external and internal exposures,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0306312712465356">12</xref></sup> in addition to background radiation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0306312712465356">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>To summarize, the Belarusian scientists attempted to remedy the misalignment between the one-step Safe Living concept and the complexity it denied – the multifaceted, compounded distribution of radiation risks, along with the challenging conditions of using radiation protection standards in practice. The Soviet Safe Living concept used only one criterion, effective doses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306312712465356">7</xref></sup> The practical impossibility of keeping track of such doses allowed for the Soviet experts’ boldly optimistic, reality-denying predictions that all the doses would be lower than dangerous levels. The Belarusian scientists’ concept was far more cautious about the nature of possible radiation effects. Their concept included lower thresholds, more criteria, and the kind of criteria that aligned well with what was easily measurable in practice (e.g. levels of soil contamination and effectiveness of decontamination measures). As a result, the concept revealed a much greater scope of contamination in Belarus and made radiation risks far more publicly visible. Moreover, dividing the affected areas into ‘zones’ based on the levels of soil contamination could easily be translated into contamination maps, which helped visualize the hazard for the public (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306312712465356">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Even though the Belarusian concept offered a more nuanced description that relied on measurements that could actually be made in practice, it was not a perfect description of radiation risks. In other words, its formal representations were better aligned with the complexity of the contamination, but not perfectly so. The Belarusian concept faced its own criticisms. For example, soil contamination did not necessarily predict people’s doses; there was no consistent correspondence. Later, local radiologists would often dismiss zoning maps while working with individual communities, noting that the coefficient of transfer (which depends on the type of soil and predicts the levels of contamination in food products) is what actually matters. Neither the maps nor the concept itself accounted for patterns of migration of radionuclides. The Belarusian concept also said nothing about great variability of doses within communities or irradiation duration and rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312712465356">Zgersky (1998)</xref>. Still, the zoning maps, sometimes posted in local administration offices or sold in bookstores, made the scope of contamination publicly visible. And they showed that almost a quarter of the country was contaminated with long-living radionuclides.</p>
<p>The final version of the concept was approved on 19 December 1990. It later became the foundation for two Chernobyl laws, adopted in 1991: ‘On legal regulations of the territories exposed to radioactive contamination as a result of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant’ and ‘On social protection of citizens affected by the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0306312712465356">14</xref></sup> These laws translated the zones into the levels of compensation and entitlements and laid the grounds for complex socioeconomic and bureaucratic processes associated with resettlement and claims of benefits. The number of people resettled in the years after 1991 is never discussed explicitly in the media or Chernobyl publications. It is often mentioned, however, that resettlements and compensations were a massive burden on the state, and that the state program of mitigating the consequences was never fulfilled completely. It did not take long for this approach to prove too expensive.</p>

<title>Concept three: the revised Belarusian concept</title>
<p>Political thawing in the last years of the Soviet Union made it possible for the Belarusian scientists to reveal a far greater scope of the hazard. Yet greater visibility meant greater cost. The alternative Belarusian concept was adopted with hopes for international assistance which never materialized. Mitigating the consequences of Chernobyl became prohibitively expensive after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the country faced the economic hardships of transitioning to a market economy. In 1992, 19.9 percent of the overall Belarusian budget was spent on Chernobyl-related expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312712465356">UNDP and UNICEF, 2002</xref>). In 1993, decree N57 of the Council of Ministers formed a working group to revise the existing concept of radiation protection and to create a new plan for rehabilitation of the contaminated areas. The group’s task appeared to be to reduce the recognized scope of contamination, and consequently, the costs of dealing with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312712465356">Marples, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The working group was headed by Evgenii Petrovich Petryaev. Their ‘Concept of Radiation Protection for the Recovery Period’ declared an end to the period of emergency measures. As the official media said at the time, one had to ‘learn to live with radiation’. Many Chernobyl experts criticized the newly revised concept. It was rejected by the Parliamentary Commission on Chernobyl and declined at least three times by the Belarusian Academy of Sciences’ Council for Radiation Protection. The new concept went through a number of revisions, but its key ideas remained the same, and the Council of Ministers approved a version of it in November 1995. It was not publicized widely, even though the media coverage at the time clearly signaled changes in the official approaches to Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Petryaev’s concept excluded all criteria of radiation protection but one – average annual effective doses, which became the only criterion for zoning. It eliminated the two criteria that were easy to use in administrative practices: levels of soil contamination and effectiveness of earlier decontamination measures. Focusing on people’s radiation doses might have been a good idea in principle (one could find high doses in areas with moderate soil contamination), but doses could not be measured easily in practice and had to be estimated by scientists using techniques that themselves were controversial and not transparent to the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0306312712465356">15</xref></sup> The areas where average doses were estimated to be less than 1 mSv/year – representing more than 70 percent of all contaminated territories in Belarus – would have no additional protective measures and would lose their social protection status (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306312712465356">Table 1</xref>: average doses of less than 1 mSv/year corresponded to soil contamination of 1–5 Ci/km<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0306312712465356">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Technically, Petryaev’s concept adhered to the original limit of 1 mSv/year. But the zone with protective measures and no right to resettle was defined so broadly, with a wide range of 1–5 mSv/year, that even average doses there could be close to 5 mSv/year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0306312712465356">17</xref></sup> Critics also pointed out that since radiation doses vary greatly, individual members could be receiving far more than 1 mSv/year, even if that were the average dose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0306312712465356">18</xref></sup> Higher doses were likely, since significant amounts of basic foods – milk, grains, and vegetables – were contaminated beyond the state acceptable levels known as RDU-92 (calculated on the assumption of 1 mSv/year of additional exposure from contaminated food).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0306312712465356">19</xref></sup> And rural residents typically relied on subsistence farming, which made their food products likely to be excessively contaminated. The critics were particularly concerned about higher accumulations for critical groups, such as pregnant women and children, who are especially vulnerable to the effects of radiation.</p>
<p>While no communities actually became less contaminated, the scope of contamination appeared to shrink. From the critics’ perspective, the concept used ‘artificial means’, simply redefining the criteria to eliminate protective measures in much of the affected territory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0306312712465356">20</xref></sup> Other critics described it as a ‘formalistic’ approach, since the only criteria left did not allow for keeping track of the actual distribution of radiation risks. As with the Soviet concept of Safe Living, the practical impossibility of conducting the measurements and the nontransparency of expert estimates were essential to what the concept meant in practice, namely reduction of the public visibility of Chernobyl contamination. In other words, the concept achieved the goal of reducing Chernobyl-related costs by increasing the misalignment between formal representations and the empirical complexity–what could actually be measured in practice. Predictably and in addition, little attention was paid to health impacts of radiation and possible preventive measures.</p>
<p>After Petryaev’s concept was approved in 1995, it became the foundation for the 1996–2000 State Program of Mitigating the Consequences of the Accident on Chernobyl NPP. The government started terminating social and radiation protection measures in the territories with the levels of contamination of 1–5 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712465356">Nesterenko, 1998</xref>). In 1996, the Council of Ministers approved the revised list of the areas that required radiological protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0306312712465356">21</xref></sup> Residents of these communities stopped receiving compensation and were left to assume that radiological contamination was no longer an issue (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306312712465356">Kuchinskaya, 2011</xref>). A number of other administrative measures were discontinued, including gasification, free lunches for schoolchildren (so that children could eat at least one ‘clean’ meal a day), and health recuperation programs.</p>
<p>Yet the 1991 Chernobyl laws were not changed during that period, and the zoning criteria in the law ‘On Legal Status of the Territories …’ remained the same,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0306312712465356">22</xref></sup> even though the requirements of that law were not met. The concept of radiation protection, on the other hand, underwent further revisions in the following years. The 1998 version of the official standards reintroduced the levels of soil contamination; indeed, most of the changes to the radiation protection standards made in 1995 were later repealed. Analysis of the subsequent legislative acts and revisions to the Chernobyl laws are beyond the scope of this article. It would suffice to say that the overarching tendency was still to cut Chernobyl-related expenses.</p>

<title>Invisible work of making visible</title>
<p>The 1995 revised concept provided the government with leeway to start shrinking the scope of the areas officially recognized as contaminated – or, in the official language, ‘rehabilitating’ them. That radiological contamination did not completely disappear in the public eye was, to a large extent, an achievement of a small group of experts from the Independent Institute of Radiation Safety Belrad. The late Vasilii Nesterenko, the head of Belrad at the time, recognized that post-Chernobyl contamination was too expensive a problem for Belarus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0306312712465356">23</xref></sup> Yet he defined his goal as a system of total control over individual doses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0306312712465356">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Belrad’s efforts to create this system illustrate the kinds of work needed to make radiation more visible, and this study includes better alignment of formal representations among themselves and with respect to empirical complexity. Two of the many of Belrad’s initiatives are particularly illustrative. In the period 1991–1993, Belrad established 370 Local Centers of Radiation Protection (LCRP), where radiologists – local residents trained by Belrad and equipped with Belrad’s meters – tested food samples collected from other local residents. The testing of food products allowed Nesterenko to demonstrate unexpectedly high levels of contamination in some cleaner communities. Belrad emphasized making the data public and educating local residents about ways to reduce their exposure. At the beginning, LCRPs were funded by the state and managed by Belrad. With new state approaches to Chernobyl, management of most of the centers was transferred to state organizations, and many LCRPs were closed soon after that.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0306312712465356">25</xref></sup> By 2003, there were only 40 state-managed LCRPs left; Belrad retained and funded 19 centers.</p>
<p>Belrad also organized testing of individuals’ internal doses with whole body counters (WBCs). By 1992, there were 102 WBCs in Belarus, most located in hospitals (the number of devices decreased in subsequent years). They were heavy and complex devices whose ongoing maintenance required expertise that the hospitals often did not have. As a result, less than a third of all state-owned WBCs complied with state standards of certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712465356">Nesterenko et al., 2004</xref>). As one physician put it, ‘The only functioning WBCs are at Nesterenko’s’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0306312712465356">26</xref></sup> Belrad acquired its devices in 1996, and they were light enough to transport in a minivan, which made it possible to conduct testing in remote communities. The data could then be compared with the national Catalogue of Doses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0306312712465356">27</xref></sup> In 2002, Belrad initiated its Forgotten Villages project after 146 more communities lost radiological protection status. Internal doses registered by Belrad were juxtaposed with existing norms and thresholds, and some of the decisions were reversed.</p>
<p>These examples show that making the hazard more publicly visible requires rich empirical data. This, in turn, means work. Furthermore, much of that work is of the kind that Star calls ‘invisible work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712465356">Star, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312712465356">Star and Strauss, 1999</xref>), as Belrad’s efforts to establish empirical measurements and ‘un-blackbox’ existing standards illustrate. It requires building the tools and infrastructure, sustaining lines of communication. It also includes the mundane, technical work of maintaining technical equipment, organizing measuring trips, calculating, negotiating, and fundraising.</p>
<p>Making the hazard visible is the kind of work that must be done by experts – experts credited by the state and with access to standardized, state-certified equipment and techniques. For example, essential to making visible is realigning formal representations among themselves (assessing consistency across standards, triangulating various measurements and standards). This work of realignment critically depended on Nesterenko’s own credentials and his ability to enter into dialogue with state regulatory bodies, as well as Belrad’s use of state-certified equipment and techniques. Indeed, Nesterenko’s own credentials – as a former head of the Institute of Nuclear Energy and chief designer of the mobile NPP Pamir – were instrumental to the Institute’s efforts to publicize its data and influence decision making to whatever small degree. And Belrad has done a commendable job of making its data public; almost everybody who writes about post-Chernobyl contamination in Belarus uses this information (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312712465356">Yablokov et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article describes a case of radiation protection standards revised twice, in opposing directions. The standards were set and revised during a decade of political transformations in Belarus, which accounts for the directional shifts and makes this example unusual and potentially revealing. Exactly how the post-Chernobyl standards were reconfigured provides an insight into the practical politics of environmental standards. It highlights how altering the practicality of standards can change, and potentially limit, public visibility of the hazard.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712465356">Star’s (1995)</xref> ‘central tension’ of formal representations – the tension between abstract formal representations and their use in concrete practice – has particular implications for environmental standards; it can be exploited to conceal or reveal environmental risks. I use the term ‘alignment’ to describe the degree of association between standards and what can be measured in practice, or what should be measured to better describe the distribution of risks. The term ‘alignment’ also refers to the constant work of monitoring this relationship in order to create more useable, descriptive, relevant, and consistent standards. Importance of the work of aligning is likely to increase with complexity and scale of the risk situation.</p>
<p>Analysis of the work of aligning has several broader implications. First, creating more descriptive standards, or adjusting environmental standards so that they remain descriptive and relevant, can be incredibly labor intensive. It might require not only specialized expertise, but also extensive infrastructural work. In case of the Belrad radiologists, this work included establishing infrastructures, obtaining appropriate equipment and certifications, maintaining equipment, and collecting and analyzing data. This infrastructural work is typically invisible to the broader public, but it is also indispensable for challenging existing standards and better aligning them among themselves and with respect to the empirical complexity of risk distributions.</p>
<p>Second, the work of alignment requires public ‘un-black-boxing’ of standards and questioning their politics and implications. This analysis suggests that institutional secrecy provides conditions for greater misalignment, and thus potential concealing of risks – not necessarily intentionally, but by way of removing structural opportunities for the work of alignment. Secrecy protects the ‘black boxes’ of standards and amplifies their politics.</p>
<p>Third, familiarity with local circumstances, including local socioeconomic and technoscientific conditions, is not secondary but essential to setting environmental standards and assessing their politics. This conclusion has much in common with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712465356">Lawrence Busch’s (2011)</xref> analysis of requirements for ethical production of standards (p. 301). Busch argues that production of standards should be delegated to subsidiary bodies, and analysis of the post-Chernobyl case illustrates why. Responsible configuration of environmental standards requires local, situated knowledge – including knowledge of what easily can be measured and done in practice. Technoscientific expertise is not enough; lack of local knowledge or strategic ignorance of it is likely to result in formalistic standards and, as a consequence, limited public recognition of environmental risks.</p>
<p>Setting environmental standards is a matter of public importance, though even the most descriptive, socially responsible and potentially actionable standards might not be applied in practice. Analysis of what politics do or do not give traction to standards and what work is required to instantiate environmental standards in practice is outside the scope of this article. In a broad sense, this article called attention to configurations of environmental standards, which is a consequential part of defining environmental risks; yet it is also one of the least transparent. This raises questions of accountability of experts, transparency of decision making, and ways to ensure that experts and expert institutions are sensitive to local, contextual knowledge and reflective of the possibilities on the ground, including possibilities to enable risk monitoring by broader groups of the public.</p>
<p>Fukushima might be another illustration of the politics of formal representations similar to those described here. The Belrad radiation protection experts, interviewed in May to June 2011, remarked on the feelings of déjà vu after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March 2011. The Japanese officials employed the old tactics of playing down the scale of the accident and withholding data, perhaps in attempts to avoid enlarging the evacuation zone and conducting more clean-up measures (<italic>The New York Times</italic>, August 8, 2011). Playing with standards for radiation protection was again part of trying to make contamination less publicly visible. For example, in April 2011, the Japanese government raised radiation exposure limits from 1 to 20 mSv/year, including for children. Parents of schoolchildren in Fukushima Prefecture responded with indignation; the top Japanese expert on radiation measurements, Toshiso Kosako (advising to Prime Minister Naoto Kan), resigned in protest, and after much public outcry, the thresholds were restored to their original values in May. They were then applied only to schoolchildren inside school buildings (<italic>The New York Times</italic>, August 8, 2011).</p>
<p>The socioeconomic and historical conditions in Japan after Fukushima are different from those in Belarus after Chernobyl. It is a wealthier country with a history of radiological research and different technoscientific opportunities. Dosimeters, including individual dosimeters, are much more accessible in Japan today. The particularities of the radiological contamination and exposure are also different. Yet old challenges remain. Not only is radiation itself imperceptible, but it can also be made doubly invisible with standards that appear neutral and objective, yet are obscuring the hazard by design. Standards become formalities, hiding the scope of the hazard when they are not descriptive, relevant, and easy to monitor, ideally by a greater number of experts and the public. Making the hazard more publicly visible is a matter of emphasizing empirical assessment, not just theoretical estimates, of examining the politics of standards and of creating conditions for the work of alignment.</p>

Ci/km<sup>2</sup> describes contamination of a site; Curie (Ci) is a unit measuring intensity of emitting radiation.</p>

What might be puzzling is the extent to which the perspective of the WHO mirrors the IAEA’s view on radiation health effects. This lack of independent assessment has been linked to the 1959 agreement between the IAEA and WHO. The agreement established the control of IAEA over the information released to the public, and consequently, the IAEA, and not WHO, took the leading role in estimating the health impacts from Chernobyl (Also see <italic>Guardian</italic>, May 28, 2009; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://independentwho.org">independentwho.org</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Not all Belarusian experts agreed with the concept, even though it was approved by the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, Belarus SSR. In September 1989, 92 scientists, including five Belarusian scientists, signed a letter to Mikhail Gorbachev that expressed their support for the Safe Living concept on the grounds that it was supported by the international experts and based on the data from Hiroshima and Nagasaki studies. Critics of the letter, such as Ivan Nikitchenko, described it as ‘smooth on paper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712465356">Nikitchenko, 1999</xref>: 60).</p>

<p>The fact that Petryaev’s concept did not recommend resettlements even in the areas with average annual dose close to 5 mSv/year led some critics to compare it with Ilyin’s ‘Safe Living’ concept, which allowed 350 mSv per life (70 years) (Smolyar, 1993).</p>

<p>Critics estimated that people who lived in the areas with 1 Ci/km<sup>2</sup> and consumed their own food received in the range of 4 mSv/year (<italic>Literatura I Mastactva</italic>, 1994). People were more likely to rely on subsistence farming in smaller rural communities. According to Vasilii Nesterenko, the head of Belarusian Institute of Radiation Safety Belrad, these communities were also more difficult to reach. As a result, studies by state and international experts often focused on towns (where people had smaller internal doses), thus creating a false picture of a generally lower range of doses of internal accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712465356">Nesterenko, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>The late Vasilii Nesterenko, former head of the Institute for Nuclear Energy and chief designer of the mobile NPP Pamir, opposed Petryaev’s concept and proposed his own alternative. He insisted that protective measures should focus on the most vulnerable groups of the population (children and pregnant women) and those with the highest doses. To better achieve that goal, he suggested using control levels (0.3 mSv) in addition to acceptable limits of exposure (1 mSv/year in access to natural background radiation).</p>

<p>Belrad could demonstrate that, for example, the average internal dose of the critical group (children under age of 7 years, pregnant and nursing women) in the village Olmany in 1992 was 7 mSv/year, compared to 3 mSv/year stated in the national Catalogue of Doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712465356">Nesterenko, 1998</xref>).</p>
