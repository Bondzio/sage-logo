<p>A novel three-component composite electrode consisting of a carbon current collector with conductive polymer and silver coating is described here. The composite electrode fabrication strategy is described and the composite electrode is evaluated as a cathode for oxygen reduction in non-aqueous media. This approach is utilized for the first time to prepare three-dimensionally structured carbon–conductive polymer–silver composites, yielding composite electrodes with ∼4× the oxygen reduction capacity of their planar counterparts. Improvement of cathode oxygen reduction activity will increase current capability and power output of metal air batteries, facilitating future development of small, lightweight, and long-life power sources.</p>

<p>Conventional battery cathodes are prepared from physical mixtures of conductive additives (carbon), binders (polymer), and active material particles which are coated onto current collectors (metal foils). The three passive components serve distinct functions, where the current collector provides structural support and a continuous conductive pathway, the binder maintains physical adhesion throughout the composite, and the conductive additives establish an interconnected conduction network via percolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312454316">1</xref></sup> Since, the capacity and energy density of a conventional battery is typically dictated by the quantity of active material within the cathode, minimizing the amount of passive material in the cathode is desirable. Previously, by replacing the three passive components (current collector, binder, and conductive additive) with a single three-dimensional (3D) carbon-based substrate (carbon nanotube substrate), we successfully prepared novel lightweight composite cathodes, establishing the potential for 20–60% increases in cathode specific capacity using our composite electrode strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312454316">2</xref></sup> This method is translatable for any active material which can be prepared using a sol–gel synthesis, where further improvements could be realized via optimization of active material properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312454316">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Metal air batteries are a desirable solution for next generation energy storage. Contrary to conventional batteries, where all of the electroactive material resides within the battery housing, the electroactive cathode material in metal air batteries (oxygen) is captured from ambient air and does not need to be incorporated into the battery structure. Even after considering the mass gained during discharge due to formation of oxygen reduction products,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312454316">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312454316">5</xref></sup> metal air batteries offer the opportunity for substantial energy density increases relative to conventional battery technologies.</p>
<p>Since oxygen is the electroactive cathode material in a metal air battery, all solid structural components on the positive end of the battery are ‘passive’ and traditional classifications of active material do not apply. While the specific chemistry of the physical structure residing at the cathode (the ‘air electrode’) can be varied, it must be structurally sound, conductive, and effectively catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Typically, a composite comprising a conductive material physically mixed with an oxygen reduction catalyst is utilized, often integrated with binder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312454316">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312454316">7</xref></sup> and a metal mesh as support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312454316">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312454316">9</xref></sup> A disadvantage of the conventional air electrode fabrication strategy is that catalyst particles positioned within the electrode interior will have limited access to oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312454316">Figure 1(a)</xref>).

<p>We recently reported a new design strategy for the preparation of air electrodes. Using electrodeposition methods, a planar three-component composite electrode consisting of a carbon (C) current collector substrate successively coated with a conductive polymer (cp) layer and a silver (Ag) nanoparticle coating was prepared and tested. Our planar C–cp–Ag composite electrodes exhibited 2× improved oxygen reduction capability relative to uncoated glassy carbon electrodes.<sup>10</sup> Counter to conventional air electrode fabrication strategies, our preparation method positioned all of the catalyst nanoparticles on the outer surface of the composite electrode, allowing facile access of oxygen gas molecules to the catalyst particle surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312454316">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Thus, we were able to establish optimum composite electrode activity at a low Ag catalyst loading of 0.08 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454316">11</xref></sup> An additional advantage of our electrodeposition strategy is the ability to easily generate 3D structured composites via use of 3D substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312454316">Figure 1(c)</xref>). This report describes our first preparation and investigation of 3D C–cp–Ag composite electrodes for non-aqueous oxygen reduction.</p></sec>

<p>CH Instruments potentiostats and electrodes were used for the deposition and oxygen reduction experiments. For aqueous measurements, a silver/silver chloride reference was used, while for non-aqueous measurements a silver/silver nitrate reference was used. Potentials are reported versus the appropriate reference electrode. Glassy carbon working electrodes were obtained from CH Instruments. To prepare the 3D composite electrodes, carbon felt (Cfelt) from Alfa AESAR or reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) from ERG Duocel were used as the current collector substrates.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998312454316"><title>Preparation of composite electrodes</title>
<p>Carbon–conductive polymer–silver (C–cp–Ag) composite electrodes were prepared using successive electrodeposition processes. Polypyrrole was the conductive polymer used for the experiments. The C–cp–Ag composite preparation procedures for planar (2D) composite preparation have been previously described,<sup>10,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454316">11</xref></sup> and these procedures were extended to preparation of 3D composite electrodes for this study using 3D carbons as the current collector substrates. Planar and geometric areas of the electrodes were determined from measurements of the outer dimensions of the electrodes using an optical microscope. Reported surface areas for the planar electrodes were determined using the vendor reported diameter of 3 mm. Reported surface areas of uncoated Cfelt electrodes were determined using the vendor reported value of 6000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g. Electrochemically active surface areas of uncoated and conductive polymer (cp) coated electrodes were determined using potassium ferricyanide. The uncoated planar electrode had a reported surface area of 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup>, while the uncoated Cfelt electrode had a reported surface area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The mass of the uncoated Cfelt electrode was 0.02 g. For potentiostatic polypyrrole depositions, a constant potential of +0.6 V was used versus a Ag/AgCl reference.</p></sec>

The oxygen reduction analysis was based on peak Coulomb flux and normalized based on the planar surface areas of the electrodes.

<sec id="sec8-0021998312454316"><title>Composite electrode concept</title>
<p>All three composite components were selected with specific motivations. Carbon (C) was selected as a current collector and substrate material of choice due to its low cost, strength, lightweight (1.3–3.5 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312454316">3</xref></sup>), low electrical resistivity (10<sup>−5</sup>–10<sup>−2</sup> Ω cm),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312454316">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312454316">21</xref></sup> and environmental sustainability. Carbon electrodes are stable under a wide voltage window, appropriate for use in non-aqueous metal air batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312454316">22</xref></sup> Conductive polymer (cp) was selected to provide physical and electrical contact between the substrate and catalyst layers. Conductive polymer offers the added benefits of being a lightweight (∼1.5 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312454316">3</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312454316">23</xref></sup> and low electrical resistivity (10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>0</sup> Ω cm) material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312454316">24</xref></sup> Conductive polymer based electrodes have been shown previously to support the ORR in aqueous solvent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312454316">25</xref></sup> but have been relatively unexplored for ORR use in non-aqueous solvents. Silver (Ag) was selected as catalyst for this study as it has lower cost relative to other precious metal catalysts, can be easily deposited using electrochemical methods, and exhibits high oxygen reduction activity in aqueous media,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312454316">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312454316">29</xref></sup> although it has been relatively unexplored for non-aqueous oxygen reduction.</p>
<p>Our composite electrode fabrication strategy has several desirable characteristics. Due to the electrodeposition method used, the entire composite should be highly conductive throughout. In addition, contrary to conventional air electrode fabrication strategies, our preparation method positions all of the catalyst nanoparticles on the outer surface of the composite electrode, allowing facile access of oxygen gas molecules to the catalyst particle surfaces. Finally, using 3D structured current collectors as substrates, this strategy provides a straightforward approach for the preparation of 3D composite electrodes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998312454316"><title>Role of the catalyst</title>
<p>Selection of an appropriate oxygen reduction catalyst is one of the major challenges to further development of viable non-aqueous metal air batteries. Slow kinetics of oxygen reduction at the air cathode remains a barrier which must be addressed.<sup>30</sup> Investigation of various catalyst alternatives to improve the ORR in non-aqueous electrolyte has been a subject of recent research focus. Metal oxide based catalysts have been materials of interest in this regard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312454316">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312454316">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998312454316">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998312454316">34</xref></sup> Precious metals including metallic gold, platinum, palladium, and bimetallic gold–platinum catalysts have also been tested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998312454316">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998312454316">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998312454316">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Silver metal has been shown to have high oxygen reduction activity in aqueous solution,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312454316">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312454316">29</xref></sup> but has been relatively unexplored for use in non-aqueous electrolytes. Silver (Ag) was selected as catalyst for this study as it has lower cost relative to other precious metal catalysts, can be readily deposited using electrochemical methods, and exhibits high oxygen reduction activity in aqueous media. Our planar carbon-conductive polymer–silver (C–cp–Ag) showed 2 × higher oxygen reduction activity relative to an uncoated planar carbon electrode, at a low Ag loading of &lt;0.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.<sup>10</sup> However, since the Ag catalyst is the most expensive component of the C–cp–Ag composite, a systematic study of silver loading was undertaken to determine the minimum Ag loading required to maximize oxygen reduction activity of the planar C–cp–Ag composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454316">11</xref></sup> Notably, a low Ag loading of 0.08 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> was determined to be optimum.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998312454316"><title>Role of the conducting polymer</title>
<p>The contribution of each individual component toward the oxygen reduction activity of the composite electrode has been assessed. The structural role of the conductive polymer (cp) in improving physical strength of a planar carbon-conductive polymer–silver (C–cp–Ag) composite electrode was evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454316">11</xref></sup> Polymer containing C–cp–Ag and polymer-free C–Ag composite electrodes were prepared, and their oxygen reduction activity in non-aqueous solution was measured. Both electrode types were then subjected to an electrode durability test which involved horizontally dragging the coated electrodes a fixed distance over a microcloth, while exerting a 4 N downward force. The conducting polymer was shown to significantly improve the structural durability of the composite, where polymer containing C–cp–Ag composites consistently retained 70% of their oxygen reduction activity versus ≤50% retention for a polymer-free C–cp electrodes.</p>
<p>To assess the Ag retention capability of the conducting polymer (cp) on a microscopic level, a cp–Ag coating with an Ag loading of 1.6 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> was removed from a planar substrate and placed into a SEM. Images were acquired at varying magnifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312454316">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312454316">3</xref>). No evidence of Ag loss was observed after flexing the cp–Ag composite. This SEM experiment verified that there was strong adhesion between the cp and Ag, and that it should be possible to prepare non-planar cp–Ag electrodes. Based on this result, it should also be possible to prepare a composite free-standing cp–Ag electrode in the future.

<sec id="sec11-0021998312454316"><title>Role of the substrate</title>
<p>The role of the chemical identity of the current collector substrate was investigated by utilizing two planar electrodes with different electrochemical profiles for oxygen reduction (glassy carbon – C and gold – Au), in conjunction with a conductive polymer (cp) deposition study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454316">11</xref></sup> After coating the planar carbon (C) and gold (Au) current collector substrates with conductive polymer (cp), both the C–cp and Au–cp composites showed similar oxygen reduction behavior at the same potentials and similar magnitude, regardless of the substrate. Similarly, after coating the C–cp and Au–cp current collector substrates with silver (Ag), both the C–cp–Ag and Au–cp–Ag composites showed similar oxygen reduction behavior at the same potentials and similar magnitude, regardless of the substrate. The data demonstrated that the conductive polymer coating was able to mitigate the impact of the current collector substrate.</p>
<p>In order to prepare 3D structured composite electrodes, Cfelt and RVC were employed as current collector substrates. To verify that the polypyrrole depositon process was not impacted by the current collector morphology, a series of current collector–conducting polymer (cc–cp) composites was prepared with different amounts of polypyrrole coating utilizing both 2D (planar) and 3D (non-planar) carbon-based current collectors as substrates. Specifically, a planar glassy carbon substrate, a moderate surface area RVC substrate, and a high surface area Cfelt substrate were used. Regardless of the current collector type used, a consistent mass–charge relationship was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312454316">Figure 4</xref>), verifying that the conducting polymer deposition was a well controlled process which was not sensitive to the geometry of the current collector substrate.

<p>The surface area measurement methods discussed above serve several purposes. The planar electrode surface area is the simplest description but it significant as it is the most representative of the electrode area as it would be described in a battery application. The geometric surface area is useful as it accounts for the thickness of the 3D electrode. The electrochemical surface area is an important measurement as it accounts for the thickness of the 3D electrode and provides insight into the amount of total electrode area which is accessible to electrolyte.</p>
<p>Assuming a consistent deposition of conductive polymer, based on the electrochemical surface areas of the substrates, the estimated cp thickness was ∼4× greater for the planar electrodes than for the 3D electrodes. However, conductive polymer deposition resulted in only 20% reduction in the electrochemically active area of the planar electrodes, but &gt;40% reduction in the electrochemically active area of the Cfelt electrode. Therefore, the data suggest that the cp may be preferentially depositing on the exterior of the Cfelt, blocking access to the interior and reducing the electrochemically accessible surface area of the composite. Thus, there is opportunity for refinement of the cp deposition conditions to improve the Cfelt–cp composite homogeneity.</p>
<p>Cfelt–cp composites were coated with silver (Ag) as described in the ‘Experimental’. Using the electrochemical surface area for the Cfelt–cp composite, and assuming uniform Ag deposition, the estimated Ag loading was 1.0 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.

<p>The Cfelt–cp–Ag composite electrode showed a range of Ag morphologies, ranging from nanosized to micron sized deposits. In addition, it was evident that the majority of the Ag deposit resided on the exterior of the Cfelt–cp–Ag composite electrode. Thus, there is also opportunity for further refinement of the Ag deposition conditions to improve the Cfelt–cp–Ag composite homogeneity.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998312454316"><title>Oxygen reduction activity of 3D composite electrodes</title>
<p>Linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry methods have been utilized to assess the electrochemical activity of our planar (2D) carbon–conductive polymer–silver (C–cp–Ag) composite electrodes.<sup>10</sup> Our planar C–cp–Ag composite electrode exhibited improved oxygen reduction activity relative to uncoated carbon (C) and platinum disc (Pt) electrodes in a pure oxygen environment. A concentration study was undertaken where the composite electrode exhibited a linear dependence on oxygen concentration, consistent with a first-order reaction. The planar C–cp–Ag composite demonstrated repeatable behavior with no significant loss in oxygen reduction activity over multiple reduction–oxidation cycles.</p>
<p>For the first time, the oxygen reduction activity of a 3D Cfelt–cp–Ag composite was evaluated. Comparisons of our planar C–cp–Ag composite electrode and a 3D Cfelt–cp–Ag composite electrode are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312454316">Figure 8</xref>).

<p>Cfelt: carbon felt.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312454316-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On cycle 1 reduction, the 3D Cfelt–cp–Ag composite exhibited ∼4 × enhancement in oxygen reduction activity over the planar C–cp–Ag electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312454316">Figure 8(a)</xref>). This data highlights the significant opportunity that transitioning to a 3D architecture can provide for metal air batteries. However, as discussed above, refinement of the cp and Ag deposition conditions should result in a more homogeneous composite electrode with the opportunity to further improve oxygen reduction activity.</p>
<p>While the peak Coulomb flux in cycles 1 and 2 was unchanged for the planar C–cp–Ag electrode, the Cfelt–cp–Ag composite showed a significant decrease between cycles 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312454316">Figure 8(a) and (b)</xref>). We hypothesized that the current produced by the Cfelt–cp–Ag composite was lower on cycle 2 because the oxygen supply within the electrode interior was not replenished within the time scale of the experiment. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the data. The quantity of oxygen available within the Cfelt–cp–Ag composite interior was estimated based on the void volume of the electrode and the oxygen solubility within the electrolyte. Assuming a one-electron oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) reduction process resulting in formation of superoxide (<inline-formula id="ilm1-0021998312454316"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021998312454316"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), 0.23 C could be generated from the oxygen available within the electrode interior. On cycle 1 reduction, 0.59 C were generated, while 0.36 C were generated on cycle 2. Therefore, we propose that during cycle 1, oxygen was reduced both within the Cfelt–cp–Ag interior (0.23 C) and on the Cfelt–cp–Ag surface (0.36 C) while during cycle 2, oxygen reduction occurred on the surface of the Cfelt–cp–Ag composite electrode (0.36 C), resulting in &gt;1.5 × higher current output for cycle 1 versus cycle 2. This data illustrates that while 3D composite electrodes offer the potential for significant improvement over planar electrodes, appropriate tuning of the 3D electrode porosity is an important consideration.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0021998312454316"><title>Summary</title>
<p>A new design strategy for the preparation of air electrodes has been presented. Using electrodeposition methods, three-component composite electrodes comprised of carbon (C) current collector substrates successively coated with conductive polymer (cp) and silver (Ag) nanoparticle coatings have been prepared. This approach has been utilized for the first time to prepare 3D structured C–cp–Ag composites. The 3D composite electrode fabrication strategy has been described and the composite electrode has been evaluated as a cathode for oxygen reduction in non-aqueous media. A ∼4× enhancement in the oxygen reduction capacity has been demonstrated for a 3D structured Cfelt–conductive polymer–silver (Cfelt–cp–Ag) composite relative to its planar glassy carbon–conductive polymer–silver (C–cp–Ag) counterpart. Improvement of cathode oxygen reduction activity will increase current capability and power output of metal air batteries, facilitating future development of small, lightweight, and long-life power sources.</p></sec>
