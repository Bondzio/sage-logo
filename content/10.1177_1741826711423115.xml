<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The first (VT1) and second (VT2) ventilatory thresholds are landmarks to tailor exercise rehabilitation in coronary artery disease (CAD) or chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods allowing VT1 and VT2 determination based on heart rate variability (HRV) have been proposed but not yet evaluated in these patients.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> To determine the heart rate (HR) associated with VT1 and VT2 by three methods of HRV analyses.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fourteen CHF and 24 CAD patients performed an exercise test on a cycle ergometer (10 -W every minute until exhaustion). VT1 and VT2 were determined with the ‘respiratory equivalent’ method. HR at VT1 was determined with the standard deviation (SD) of R⊟R intervals (VT<sub>SD</sub>) and of the instantaneous beat-to-beat variability of the Poincaré plot method (VT<sub>Poincaré</sub>). HR at VT1 and VT2 was determined through a time-varying HRV analysis method (VT<sub>TV1</sub> and VT<sub>TV2</sub>, respectively).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> HR at VT<sub>SD</sub> was significantly higher than HR at VT1. No significant differences were observed between HR at VT<sub>Poincaré</sub>, VT<sub>TV1</sub>, and at VT1, nor between HR at VT<sub>TV2</sub> and VT2. HR at VT<sub>SD</sub>, VT<sub>Poincaré</sub>, and VT1 were significantly correlated, but with a low <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value and a large mean HR difference. With the time-varying method, the mean HR difference was lower than 5% and the correlation coefficients were higher (especially for VT<sub>TV2</sub>).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> SD and Poincaré plot methods lead to substantial inaccuracy in HR estimates. The time-varying HRV analysis led to strong correlation coefficients and low limits of agreement. Therefore, this method may be a promising, low-cost tool for non-invasive assessment of the ventilatory thresholds in cardiac disease.</p>

<p>The benefit of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is well established and physical activity is a recognized intervention recommended for prevention in coronary heart disease (CAD) and chronic heart failure (CHF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711423115">3</xref></sup> However, determining the appropriate exercise intensity remains a challenge. For both efficiency and safety, the first (VT1) and second (VT2) ventilatory thresholds are indicators of interest that should be determined to help in exercise prescription in cardiac disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711423115">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711423115">6</xref></sup> Indeed, there is some concern that exercising above VT1 may induce left ventricular wall stress and function deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711423115">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711423115">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, evidence has accumulated about the possibility to train cardiac patients also beyond VT2 without incurring additional risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref></sup> Hence, an intensity at or below VT1 is appropriate for cardiovascular patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711423115">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711423115">10</xref></sup> with the upper limit of prescriptible aerobic training intensity represented by the critical power,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711423115">11</xref></sup> which is strictly related to VT2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711423115">12</xref></sup> Thus, determining VT1 and VT2 is of primary importance. They are usually assessed during a maximal incremental test with measurements of respiratory gas exchanges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711423115">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711423115">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711423115">15</xref></sup> However, these measures are limited to specialized centres because of methodological, technical, and financial reasons.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it has been suggested that analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) could be a reliable non‐invasive and low-cost method of assessing VT1 and VT2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref></sup> In healthy subjects, VT1 has been successfully determined from HRV with time domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref></sup> and the Poincaré plot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711423115">19</xref></sup> analyses while both VT1 and VT2 could be determined from spectral analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> To our knowledge, only one study has used time domain and Poincaré plot HRV analyses for determining VT1 patients (type 2 diabetes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> No study used one of these three methods with cardiac patients.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the heart rate associated with VT1 and VT2 by means of HRV analysis and to compare it with the more traditional respiratory determination in a sample of CHF and CAD patients. For this purpose, VT1 was assessed with HRV analyses based on time domain (standard deviation of R⊟R intervals - VT<sub>SD</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> and the nonlinear Poincaré plot analyses (VT<sub>Poincaré</sub>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711423115">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> and VT1 and VT2 were assessed with a time-varying HRV analysis (VT<sub>TV1</sub> and VT<sub>TV2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> The tested hypothesis was that the time-varying HRV analysis method, which is a method integrating both autonomic nervous system and breathing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> information, could allow the ventilatory thresholds to be assessed with sufficient precision to permit its use in clinical routine in cardiac patients.</p>

<p>This study involved 14 male patients with stable CHF patients with impaired systolic function (CHF) and 24 male patients with stabilized coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function (CAD). The patients’ main characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711423115">Table 1</xref>. CAD patients had preserved left systolic function (ejection fraction &gt;50%) and were referred for cardiac rehabilitation after an acute coronary syndrome with or without ST segment elevation. CHF patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction defined by an ejection fraction ≤40%. The mean values for the left ventricular diastolic volume, the left ventricular systolic volume, and the left ventricular ejection fraction were 60.7 ± 4.8 mm, 43.9 ± 8.0 mm, and 32.7 ± 5.3%, respectively. A coronary angiography was performed in all patients. Patients were included if their clinical condition had been stable for at least 3 weeks and if they had stable ECG sinus rhythm. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to exercise stress testing or stress test stopped for complications such as early residual myocardial ischaemia or complex ventricular arrhythmia. The study protocol complied with the declaration of Helsinki and was reviewed and accepted by the ethical committee of Tours (France). The subjects were informed about the study procedure and gave their written informed consent.

A ramp protocol was used with a 10 -W increase every minute until exhaustion. Achievement of the peak effort was assumed in the presence of at least one of the following criteria: failure of oxygen uptake (V;O<sub>2</sub>) and/or heart rate to increase with further increases in work rate; peak respiratory exchange ratio (V;CO<sub>2</sub>/V;O<sub>2</sub> &gt;1.10⊟1.15).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711423115">6</xref></sup> Peak oxygen uptake (V;O<sub>2</sub>peak) was measured breath-by-breath using a Vmax Spectra system (SensorMedics Corporation, Yorba Linda, CA, USA).

<p>VT1 and VT2 were determined with the ‘respiratory equivalent’ method, based on breath by breath measures of V;O<sub>2</sub>, carbon dioxide production (V;CO<sub>2</sub>) and ventilation (V;E) with the values being averaged every 10 seconds.

VT1 corresponds to a first nonlinear increase in the V;E/V;O<sub>2</sub> curve while the V;E/V;CO<sub>2</sub> slope remains constant. In addition, VT2 is indicated by the nonlinear increase in the V;E/V;CO<sub>2</sub> curve concomitant to a second strong increase in V;E/V;O<sub>2</sub> with further increase in exercise intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711423115">15</xref></sup> We chose this method because it was proposed that the ventilatory equivalent method appeared to yield the best results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711423115">13</xref></sup> and a 10 W/min protocol during bicycle exercise appears convenient for the determination of the ventilatory thresholds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711423115">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>It is known that, at rest, HRV mostly depends on autonomic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711423115">24</xref></sup> while during exercise, the short-term variability of R⊟R intervals is more tightly related to breathing patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> Because of cardiorespiratory coupling between HRV and ventilation, both the mean peak of high-frequency (HF) power (fHF) and the absolute HF power (HFp) derived from the spectral analysis of HRV are governed by breathing frequency and breathing depth (tidal volume).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711423115">25</xref></sup> The instantaneous high frequency power (HFp) trend as a function of time and frequency over the entire exercise period was calculated from R⊟R-interval series using a time varying short-term Fourier transform method with 64-s moving windows. A time shift of 3 s was chosen between two successive spectrogram windows (Kubios HRV Analysis Software 2.0, Kuopio, Finland). HFp range was extended from resting recordings (&gt;0.15⊟0.5 Hz to &gt;0.15⊟1.8 Hz) in order to remain in the high breathing frequency ranges reached at high exercise intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref></sup> Fitting the mean peak of high-frequency power (fHF) to a third-order model allowed a modelled fHF (fHFm) to be obtained by automatically corrected artefacts (Sigmaplot 8.0, ESPSS Science, Chicago, IL, USA). This procedure increases the association between fHF and breathing frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref></sup> The fHFm×HFp product was then calculated. The fHFm×HFp was finally log transformed to increase the readiness of its instantaneous changes over time [Ln(fHFm×HFp)]. The first (VT<sub>TV1</sub>) as well as the second (VT<sub>TV2</sub>) thresholds were visually determined from the Ln(fHFm×HFp) curve versus time. VT<sub>TV1</sub> corresponded to the first nonlinear increase in Ln(fHFm×HFp) after it had reached a minimum.

<p>Based on the above criteria, two experienced researchers independently and with blinding assessed VT1 and VT2, VT<sub>SD</sub> and VT<sub>Poincaré</sub>, and VT<sub>TV1</sub> and VT<sub>TV2</sub>.

<p>The method of Bland and Altman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711423115">26</xref></sup> was used to compare the different methods of assessing heart rate at the ventilatory thresholds and evaluate whether there was agreement or bias. The relationships were initially made using linear regression, and Pearson’s coefficient correlation (<italic>r</italic>) was expressed. Agreement between the methods was then determined by calculating the difference between the reference method (heart rate at the ventilatory thresholds from gas exchange measurements) and the methods tested (heart rate at the ventilatory thresholds from HRV analyses). The difference was then plotted against the mean of the two methods compared. Limits of agreement were defined as means ± 2SD. The Gaussian distribution of the data was verified by the Kolmogorov⊟Smirnov goodness-of-fit test (Z value &lt;1.0). Statistical significance was assumed for a <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 and data are presented as mean ± SD.

<p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that heart rate variability analysis (and especially time-varying HRV analysis) could allow ventilatory thresholds to be determined in CAD and CHF patients with impaired systolic function. Our results showed that the standard deviation of R⊟R intervals and the standard deviation of the instantaneous beat-to-beat variability of R⊟R intervals (SD1 of the Poincaré plot analysis) are less accurate than time-varying HRV method. They cannot allow the detection of both the first and second ventilatory thresholds whereas it is possible with the time-varying HRV method.</p>
<p>The ventilatory thresholds allow for exercise intensity prescription, even though their physiological and clinical significance is uncertain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711423115">22</xref></sup> They are usually determined from respiratory measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711423115">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711423115">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711423115">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711423115">27</xref></sup> In CAD and CHF, a high reproducibility has been found during ramp cycling ergometry for duplicate measurements of cardiopulmonary and haemodynamic variables, including heart rate at ventilatory thresholds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711423115">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711423115">28</xref></sup> The determination of these thresholds is recommended both to assess the training effect and to specify training intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423115">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711423115">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711423115">29</xref></sup> However, such determination required measurements of respiratory gas exchanges. Consequently, the ventilatory thresholds assessment is limited to some specialized centres. This also hinders the generalization of their assessment for prescription of exercise rehabilitation, especially when long-term home-based programmes are planned.</p>
<p>Other non-invasive and more easily usable methods, based on heart rate recordings and analysis of heart rate variability, have been proposed to identify the ventilatory thresholds and several studies carried out on healthy subjects showed good agreement for heart rate at ventilatory thresholds determined by respiratory measurements and HRV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> Although further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of HRV, HRV is considered valid and is widely used in the acute and chronic evaluation of CAD and CHF patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711423115">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are a variety of indexes that can be used to assess HRV. They can be divided into three major categories: time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear domain indexes. In the present study, we tested the evaluation of the ventilatory thresholds through the standard deviation of R⊟R intervals (a time domain index),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> the time-varying HRV analysis (frequency domain),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> and the standard deviation of the instantaneous beat-to-beat variability of the data (Poincaré plot analyses of HRV, a nonlinear index).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711423115">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> In our results, SD and SD1 led to conspicuous errors in determining VT1. The use of these indexes is based on the idea that vagal R⊟R modulation is no more present beyond VT1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711423115">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711423115">31</xref></sup> When these indexes reach low values and do not fall any further (usually, under 3 ms), VT1 is attained. Contrary to the results obtained in the present study, these indexes and VT1 appeared to be linked in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423115">20</xref></sup> On reason may be the fact that in these previous works, the incremental exercises used were based on 3-min stages with calculation of the indexes during the last minute of each stage, whereas we used 1-min stages. Moreover, it has not been conclusively shown that vagal modulation is the mechanism responsible for VT1 and the sole evaluation of parasympathetic activity during incremental exercise seems insufficient to assess VT1 in cardiac patients properly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, better results were obtained with the time-varying method we used. This method computes high frequency power (HFp, index of parasympathetic activity) and the frequency associated with HF (fHF), providing instantaneous breathing frequency without the use of any respiratory device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> It has been reported that VT1 and VT2 could be determined from breathing frequency only and thus from fHF only because breathing frequency increases when VT1 is exceeded and abruptly increases when VT2 is exceeded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> Moreover, the thresholds assessment from HRV was more accurate when using the mathematical product of HF by fHF because it also takes into account changes in tidal volume on which HF power depends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> More detailed discussions have already been provided to explain the method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Heart rates at the ventilatory thresholds are often used as targets during the training sessions. In this study, the limit of agreement between the ventilatory thresholds from respiratory measurements and the ventilatory thresholds from time-varying analysis was low (2⊟3 bpm). This agreement (less than 5%) was comparable or lower than that obtained in healthy subjects in terms of heart rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423115">16</xref></sup> oxygen uptake,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423115">18</xref></sup> or power output,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423115">17</xref></sup> suggesting that this method is promising in assessing heart rate associated with the ventilatory thresholds and thus in guiding the design of exercise intensity in rehabilitation programmes for cardiac patients.</p>
<sec id="sec15-1741826711423115"><title>Limits</title>
<p>Despite a limited number of subjects, we made the distinction between CHF and coronary disease patients (without performing statistical comparisons which would have been of limited robustness). The results were similar in each group, i.e. that time-varying analysis appeared the best method. Nevertheless, the ventilatory thresholds determination through time-varying analysis gave slightly better results in CHF, with lower limits of agreement and a higher number of VT determinations with differences lower than 5 bpm. Also, the judgement of ventilatory thresholds, from respiratory measures or heart rate variability analysis, remains subjective and operator-dependent, even among physicians familiar with the procedure. At least two independent observers are required for a reliable determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711423115">14</xref></sup> and sometimes three are indeed involved in the determination. We did not see any difference between the methods we used in the present study (a third investigator was necessary in about 10% of the cases whatever the method). A valid and objective procedure is still lacking for assessing VT from both respiratory measurement and HRV.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1741826711423115" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that heart rate at the first and second ventilatory thresholds could be reliably determined through heart rate variability analysis in CAD and CHF patients. We found that indexes derived from time-domain and nonlinear analyses should not be used because of considerable errors in the determination in the heart rate associated with the ventilatory threshold. On the other hand, the method based on time-varying spectral analysis gave strong correlation coefficients and low limits of agreement. These results suggest that HRV may be a promising, low-cost tool for non-invasive assessment of the ventilatory thresholds. Further studies are required to confirm our encouraging results on a larger population, with patients with different kinds of diseases, and with other HRV indexes.</p>
