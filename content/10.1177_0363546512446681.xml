<sec id="section3-0363546512446681">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512446681">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Thirty-one consecutive patients treated with anatomic glenoid restoration surgery using the J-bone graft for posttraumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability with a significant bony glenoid defect were included in this study. Twenty patients received 3-dimensional computed tomography scans of the affected shoulder preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1-year follow-up.

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Anatomic glenoid reconstructive surgery using the J-bone graft technique benefits from a physiological remodeling process, molding the bone graft closely into the original shape of an uninjured anterior glenoid rim. While parts of the graft lying inside the projected former surface area of the glenoid are preserved, the parts lying outside are resorbed over time, suggestive of strain-adapted graft remodeling.</p>

<body>
<p>Posttraumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability is usually associated with structural damage of the labrocapsular complex or bony damage of the anterior glenoid rim. Labral damage is present in nearly all cases of recurrent anterior shoulder instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512446681">21</xref></sup> and is commonly treated with arthroscopic Bankart repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512446681">13</xref></sup> In case of significant glenoid bone loss, Bankart repair is not recommended because of the high risk of recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512446681">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512446681">16</xref></sup> From a biomechanical aspect, an anterior glenoid bone defect measuring 6 mm at the 3-o’clock position, which corresponds to approximately 20% of the long glenoid axis, has been shown to significantly reduce the glenohumeral stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512446681">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512446681">20</xref></sup> Various surgical techniques have been proposed and successfully employed for surgical stabilization of shoulders with a significant anterior glenoid defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446681">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446681">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512446681">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446681">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446681">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512446681">18</xref></sup> The J-bone graft technique, which has been utilized since 1988, is one of the reported techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446681">1</xref></sup> The aspect that sets off this technique from others, such as the widely used Latarjet procedure, is its aim at anatomic joint restoration accomplished by press-fit insertion of a bicortical J-shaped iliac crest graft at the glenoid defect site. Accordingly, the J-bone graft technique does not usually require the use of any foreign material such as screws for the fixation of the graft. This technique’s effectiveness regarding restoration of shoulder stability in case of posttraumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability has previously been reported as excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446681">1</xref></sup> Generally, most bone restoration surgeries such as the J-bone graft, Latarjet, or other bone block procedures were shown to generate good results in terms of shoulder stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446681">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446681">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512446681">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446681">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446681">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512446681">18</xref></sup> However, the long-term effect of such procedures on the occurrence of early-onset osteoarthritis in the affected shoulder is still under debate and requires further investigation of the graft integration process and the physiological adaption of the stabilized shoulder in the long run.</p>
<p>As we know from fracture treatment, bone tissue shows great healing and remodeling potential in the attempt to regain its former stability and morphology. While excessive strain to bone results in fractures, moderate strain can trigger a bone increase, and lack of strain can lead to bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512446681">8</xref></sup> These bone remodeling processes can be observed throughout the whole body and enable the maintenance of an ergonomic skeleton as strong and as light as possible.</p>
<p>The current literature lacks information regarding the destiny of bone grafts used for anatomic anterior glenoid rim reconstruction, and precise data of preoperative and postoperative glenoid articular surface quantification are not available. The purpose of the present study was to document and to analyze the remodeling process of the J-bone graft used for anterior glenoid bone restoration in posttraumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Between September 2008 and September 2010, 31 consecutive patients underwent a J-bone graft procedure for posttraumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability because of a clinically relevant glenoid defect at the first author’s institution. All patients received preoperative and postoperative (maximum 2 days after surgery) computed tomography (CT) scans of the affected shoulder with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the glenoid and were invited for a follow-up CT scan alongside clinical examination 1 year postoperatively. Twenty patients (64.5%) were available for follow-up. In 15 cases, this was the first stabilizing procedure attempted; the remaining 5 were revision cases for arthroscopic Bankart procedures performed at other institutions. Of the 11 patients lost to follow-up, 8 had primary surgeries, and 3 had revisions to arthroscopic Bankart procedures. Six declined the invitation because of geographical distance, 4 declined for personal reasons, and 1 patient could not be reached. All patients lost to follow-up showed no sign of joint instability during routine short-term postoperative check-ups and claimed during the invitation for the 1-year follow-up that they had no sense of joint instability (except the patient who could not be reached). The local ethics committee approval was obtained for this study.</p>
<p>Of the 20 patients available for the 1-year follow-up, 19 were male (95%), and 1 was female (5%). The average age of the participants was 29.1 years, with a range from 19 to 54 years. In 2 of the patients (10%), the J-bone graft could not sufficiently be fixated using the press-fit technique and had to be secured using cannulated titanium screws. At 1-year follow-up, none of the patients had experienced a redislocation or instability episode of the operated shoulder. One of the 2 patients with screw fixation of the J-bone graft claimed to experience a sensation of discomfort in typical abduction and external rotation positions of the affected arm. He denied any trauma after surgery. In none of the cases was a graft dislocation or graft nonunion noted.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512446681">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The J-bone graft technique has already been thoroughly reported by Auffarth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446681">1</xref></sup> In short, a deltopectoral approach is performed with the patient placed in the beach-chair position under general anesthesia combined with an interscalene nerve block. The subscapularis tendon and muscle are split horizontally between the middle and inferior thirds followed by a horizontal capsulotomy. Next, a bicortical bone graft harvested from the iliac crest is shaped into the form of the letter “J” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512446681">Figure 1</xref>) using an oscillating saw and a high-speed bur. The defect site at the anterior glenoid is prepared using a rasp, and a vertical osteotomy in an angle of 20° with a distance of 5 mm medially to the articular surface is created using a chisel. The keel of the J-bone graft is driven into the osteotomy crevice using a spiked impactor. Thus, press-fit fixation of the bicortical bone graft is obtained. Occasionally, additional fixation using titanium screws is necessary, for example if the outer cortex of the iliac crest (which forms the graft’s keel) is weak. Once in place, the graft is leveled down to the plane of the cartilage surface of the glenoid using a high-speed, olive-shaped bur to avoid step formation between the graft and the original articular surface. Finally, the labrum is sutured over the graft if possible, and the capsule is slightly shifted with side-to-side adaption of the subscapularis split. Postoperatively, the joint is immobilized in a shoulder sling for 3 weeks.</p>

<title>CT Scans</title>
<p>All CT scans were obtained at the first author’s institution using a 64-slice CT scanner (Somatom Sensation 64, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Three-dimensional reconstructions of the glenoid were obtained using the 3-dimensional plug-in for Impax EE R20 VIII (Agfa HealthCare, Mortsel, Belgium).</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512446681">
<title>Measurement Methods</title>
<p>All measurements were accomplished on 3-dimensional en face views of the glenoid. The glenoid diameter was measured according to the reported method by Sugaya et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512446681">15</xref></sup> (which represents a modification of the method described by Lo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512446681">12</xref></sup> and Burkhart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446681">4</xref></sup>), applying a best-fit circle to the lower portion of the glenoid and drawing a line from the posterior aspect of the glenoid through the midpoint of the circle to the edge of the glenoid defect or the edge of the bone graft, indicating distance “a.” Distance “a” was then divided by the diameter of the best-fit circle to obtain a relative value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512446681">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>The glenoid area was measured by applying a best-fit circle to the lower portion of the glenoid and calculating its area (area A) using the institution’s standard radiology software, Impax EE R20 VIII (Agfa HealthCare). All glenoid or bone graft surface areas lying outside the circle (area B) were measured using the free-form tool and added to area A. All parts of the circle not covered by the glenoid or bone graft surface (area C) were then subtracted from area A + B, rendering the true glenoid surface area (area D), which was divided by the area of the best-fit circle itself (area A). The result indicates the glenoid surface area in relation to the theoretical shape of the intact glenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512446681">Figure 2B</xref>). The glenoid defect was calculated by dividing area C by area A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512446681">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

(A) The glenoid surface area is calculated by adding area A of the best-fit circle to area B of the glenoid lying outside the circle and subtracting area C of the circle, which is not covered by a bony surface, and subsequently dividing the resulting area D by area A, rendering the true area of the inferior portion of the glenoid (B). The “remaining” glenoid defect is calculated by dividing area C by area A (C).</p>

Besides reachieving stability, the idea of the J-bone graft technique is to anatomically repair the glenoid without the need for any foreign material for graft fixation to restore the original structure of the affected shoulder as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are certain technical limits to the perfect anatomic restoration of the anterior glenoid rim. However, as known from fracture treatment, bone tissue possesses a vast remodeling capability and tends to return to the original, most ergonomic shape by means of adaption to the presence of different amounts of strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446681">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512446681">8</xref></sup> Of these rationales, the present study was performed to analyze the physiological remodeling process of the J-bone graft at the anterior glenoid defect site and to investigate if the biological principles of bone healing and remodeling are valid also for the treatment of this common shoulder injury.</p>
<p>According to our data, already 1 year after surgery, a remodeling of the autologous bone graft toward perfect anatomic restoration of the glenoid had taken place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512446681">Figure 5</xref>). Not only had the glenoid diameter shrunk from an excessive 110% postoperatively toward the ideally expected 100%, but the surface area also decreased from an excessive amount postoperatively toward matching the area of the theoretical ideal glenoid with a circular shape in the lower portion. This concept of bone adaption to the presence or absence of strain is well known as the “mechanostat” model. If an adequate amount of strain is applied, bone tissue is preserved. In case of diminished strain over time, bone tissue undergoes remodeling processes, reducing its mass and strength. In case of increased strain over time, bone mass and strength are increased, while in the case of excessive strain, a bone fracture occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446681">7</xref></sup> It seems that aside from full graft integration and bony healing, a reliable and physiological adaption of the graft to the new mechanical loads occurs, resulting in anatomic remodeling.</p>

<p>The discrepancy between the general decrease of the glenoid surface area and the unchanging glenoid defect size at 1-year follow-up is explained by the accidental placement of the J-bone graft slightly inferior to the actual defect site, which sometimes can occur in clinical practice. In these cases, the parts of the graft that were placed inside the projected former surface area of the glenoid are preserved, while the parts placed outside are resorbed over time. Thus, the portion of the graft placed too far inferior is resorbed, while the already postoperatively present notch superior to the graft remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512446681">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) In this postoperative image, an example of a too inferiorly placed J-bone graft is visible. (B) At 1-year follow-up, most bone resorption has occurred outside the best-fit circle, and only little remodeling occurred at the superior tip of the graft inside the circle.</p>

<p>In one of the 2 cases in which a screw had to be used to secure the graft’s attachment to the anterior glenoid rim, a near total resorption of the J-bone graft had taken place without any reported trauma by the patient. On the CT scans at 1-year follow-up, the exposed screw used for graft fixation is clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512446681">Figure 7A</xref>). Conclusions that graft resorption is sped up around overly rigid screws because of diminished strain are tempting. Yet, this assumption remains highly speculative, with only one documented case and the other case with screw fixation of the J-bone graft in this series showing the same remodeling patterns as the average graft fixated using the press-fit technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512446681">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>Drawing comparison regarding the graft remodeling process with other methods for anatomic bony glenoid restoration is not possible because of lacking data. In the current literature, only studies reporting clinical results are available, complemented by native radiographs at follow-up. No radiological measurement studies using multiplanar or even 3-dimensional CT scans have been performed previously, allowing for exact evaluation of the graft remodeling process for other surgical techniques as, for example, the tricortical iliac crest grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446681">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a recent CT-based measurement study by Di Giacomo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446681">6</xref></sup> the extent of graft osteolysis in patients after nonanatomic shoulder stabilization using the Latarjet procedure was reported to be approximately 60%. Despite the vast osteolysis of the coracoid graft, no recurrent instability was noted for this group of patients, leading the authors to the conclusion that the coracoid graft might not be the primary stabilizing factor after a Latarjet procedure.</p>
<p>We believe that the vast graft osteolysis found in this study is a result of the fact that most patients included in the study showed no glenoid bone loss before surgical stabilization. If a Latarjet procedure is performed in the absence of a glenoid bone defect, the coracoid graft unphysiologically augments the original glenoid surface area and, according to our interpretation, might therefore be subject to decreased amounts of strain, leading to graft resorption. The reason why in this case not the entire coracoid graft is resorbed might be explained by the exerted pull by the attached conjoined tendon on the inferior aspect of the bone graft, resulting in strain of the bone tissue in this area. Accordingly, the graft osteolysis in the above-mentioned study took place primarily in the superior aspects of the graft and not in the inferior aspects where the conjoined tendon inserts. What remains is the concern that if graft remodeling generally occurs in all stabilization techniques, and nonabsorbable screws are used for the fixation of the graft in many cases, at least the head of the screws will be exposed at some point, creating an increased risk for serious cartilage damage in case of redislocation.</p>
<p>Regarding the measurement methods used in our study, we can state that this study relies on the widely accepted principle that the lower portion of a “normal” glenoid has a circular shape. This assumption is justified by the anatomic and radiological results reported by Jeske et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512446681">10</xref></sup> Huysmans et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512446681">9</xref></sup> and De Wilde et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446681">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally mentioned, a certain limitation of this study is the short follow-up, giving rise to speculations about further remodeling of the graft in the long run. However, reasoning from biological rationales based on Wolff’s law, we believe that further deterioration of the graft is not to be expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446681">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, the present study allows only for assessment of the bony situation at the graft site. Providing information regarding the articular surface on the J-bone graft using CT scans is not possible. Previous revision surgery showed cartilage-like regeneration tissue covering the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446681">1</xref></sup> Currently, a magnetic resonance imaging follow-up study is ongoing to evaluate the formation of regenerative tissue on the graft.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In anatomic glenoid bone restoration surgery using the J-bone graft technique, at 1-year follow-up, a remodeling process of the graft can be observed. While parts of the graft lying inside the projected former surface area of the glenoid are preserved, the parts lying outside are resorbed over time. These observations underline the remodeling potential of a free bicortical iliac crest graft fixed press-fit to restore primary glenoid anatomy in posttraumatic bone loss situations in patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability.</p>
