<abstract>
<p>This article centers the experiences of women of color in academia by placing my narrative alongside literature about shapeshifters/werewolves and racism and sexism in the academy. I use my narratives as a queer feminist of color in the academy to draw parallels between these experiences to explicate how women of color are constructed as monstrous Others. Through the performative rendering and naming of this parallel or metaphor the author hopes to evocatively implicate and draw readers into action or spaces of resistance.</p>

<p>I’ve seen her several times and each time I am drawn in. I look closely at her thin frame, the white hair across her brown skin. She removes her coat and begins caressing herself as she lifts her head to let out an orgasmic howl. Reveling in her monstrous femininity she turns to give the camera a shot of her behind. She is the werewolf woman in Kanye West’s “Monster” video (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mypinkfriday.com/news/35881">http://www.mypinkfriday.com/news/35881</ext-link>). I watch the video over and over again pondering my relationship to her. Since I was a little girl I have been drawn to monsters. Little did I know I would be framed as one.</p>
<p>Monsters are said to reflect the anxieties of their times. I wonder what the construction of the werewolf woman means in this current “post-feminist/post-race” space and time. Many times over in the 13 years since I entered my master’s program and began my journey in the academy, I have been made to feel like a monster. I have been animalized, exoticized, tokenized, and sexualized. The “excesses” of my body and my emotional affect mark me as a monstrous Other in the sanitized world of the White academy. White women colleagues have cried in my presence at my monstrosity because I have dared to challenge their status quo performances of femininity. I have “infected” students with critical theories of race, class, gender, and sexuality, and it has been suggested by a faculty assigned mentor, a straight man of color, that I be placed in a cage naked on display in the quad like a freak. Therefore, this monstrous trope feels oddly familiar to me. I also know I’m not alone.</p>
<p>It seems that monsters are everywhere these days, whether they be in our horror movies, in popular music through Lady Gaga’s invocation of them, or in the scapegoating of racial and ethnic groups—we cannot escape them. In 2009 after Kanye West came on stage interrupting Taylor Swift when she accepted an MTV video music award he was vilified and constructed as an out of control monstrous figure. West was admonished across the blogosphere and Twitter by fans and celebrities alike, which led to several public shamings and apologies. More than a year later, West spoke out about the incident noting that Swift benefited from the controversy; “Taylor never came to my defense in any interview, and rode the waves and rode it and rode it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0196859912443382">Hill, 2010</xref>, para. 4). West’s comments coincided with the release of his album, <italic>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</italic>, which in many ways seemed to be a response to the tumultuous year he had just experienced. In the song “Monster” West addressed his critics by exploring the monstrous construction of him; however, it is women of color who are the monsters in West’s video fantasy.</p>
<p>On the initial release of the “Monster” video, there was quite a bit of uproar over the imagery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859912443382">Latoya Peterson (2011)</xref> notes that while many critics commented on the images of dead women that permeated the video, there was less discussion about the fact that the majority of the dead women were White, and the monsters were women of color. She writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In some ways, the conversation around dead women in Kanye’s video reminds me of the conversations that happen around feminism and black women. The reality of black women is <italic>assumed</italic> to be exactly the same as white women—if it is mentioned at all. The fact that the majority of the women pictured lying dead were white, while black women are all part of the monster crew is generally not mentioned. So, I’m not surprised that no one has looked at the very specific positioning of white women in the video as opposed to black women, which dives deeply into the history and construction of black women as beast-like and fearsome, the sexualization of violence, and how the video is a win for both misogyny and upholding ideals of white supremacy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859912443382">Peterson, 2011</xref>, para. 4-5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When West rereleased the video in June of 2011 it was edited to include a message for viewers that the video was a piece of art and not meant as misogynistic. The rereleased video also included dead bodies of women of color. Given the context from which this song and video emerged, the monstrous construction of women of color is curious.</p>
<p>The connection between racist ideologies and monster imagery is not new. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859912443382">Patrick Gonder (2004)</xref> notes that discourses of civilization and primitivism were connected to horror films of the 1950s as monsters represented Others who needed to be civilized by Whiteness. These films were tied to anxieties about integration and reflected anthropological Othering. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859912443382">Gonder (2004)</xref> comments on films of the 1950s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0196859912443382">Kristian Jensen (2010)</xref> makes a similar claim about the more recent <italic>Twilight</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859912443382">Hardwicke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0196859912443382">Slade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0196859912443382">Weitz, 2009</xref>) film series. She notes that the Native American werewolves in the books and films are cast within the stereotype of the noble savage. She further argues that the werewolves, figures of “primitive humanity,” are contrasted against the vampire family, the Cullens, who have “repressed their bestial instinct, the vampire bloodlust, to retain some semblance of their human core” (p. 101). Thus, the vampire figure comes to embody Whiteness and enlightenment, especially when juxtaposed to the “primitive” werewolf figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0196859912443382">Jensen, 2010</xref>, p. 101). This dichotomy also permeates the popular <italic>Underworld</italic> series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859912443382">Tatopolous, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0196859912443382">Wiseman, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0196859912443382">2006</xref>), in which we discover that werewolves were the slaves of the vampire elite. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">du Coudray (2002)</xref> argues, “Like other monsters, then, the werewolf embodied a composite Otherness which gave expression to anxieties about working class degeneracy, colonial insurrection and racial atavism, women’s corporeality and sexuality, and the bestial heritage of humanity” (p. 7).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">Chantal Bourgault du Coudray (2002)</xref> in her reading of 19th century literature about werewolves notes that, “anxieties about race, class, gender, and sexuality are concentrated in the monster’s form to produce a powerful visual representation of Otherness” (p. 2). The Otherness of the werewolf figure is not just connected to the werewolf after transformation; even in human form the werewolf is marked as Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">du Coudray, 2002</xref>). It was however, the transformation that further distanced the werewolf from “the model of the white, middle-class male which was assumed to represent the ‘human’ in most nineteenth-century discourse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">du Coudray, 2002</xref>, p. 2). Usually human Otherness was connected to the fact that the werewolf could be from another land or a different race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">du Coudray, 2002</xref>), such as the low-budget horror film <italic>Mexican Werewolf in Texas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859912443382">Maginnis, 2005</xref>) or the more mainstream <italic>An American Werewolf in London</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912443382">Landis, 1981</xref>) and its sequel, <italic>An American Werewolf in Paris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859912443382">Waller, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently in a study of the female werewolf figure in contemporary film, Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912443382">Clark (2008)</xref> argues that the werewolf figure still demonstrates what should not be, as it is coded as non-White and or/working class. Additionally, “the more integrated and pleasurable a female character finds the conditions of being a werewolf, the more sexual and evil she is shown to be,” similar to the werewolf in West’s video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912443382">Clark, 2008</xref>, p. 67). Women’s sexuality is once again marked as taboo and named as the location of devious Otherness. The werewolf figure is most often connected to maleness because of the propensity toward violence (connected to hegemonic masculinity) and through signifiers such as body hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912443382">Clark, 2008</xref>). The horror of female werewolves, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912443382">Clark (2008)</xref> argues, lies in the female body “becoming grotesque, through the taking on of masculine/male traits” (p.3). However, she states it is almost unimaginable to conceive of a woman of color werewolf. Commenting on the film <italic>Dark Wolf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859912443382">Friedman, 2003</xref>), which highlights the Whiteness of the lead character through her physical transformation to a darker Other, Clark writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If horror of the female werewolf is the shock of female moving from sexual-object spectacle to grotesque/ambigendered spectacle, then the biggest contradiction is a move from the most feminine (slender, blonde, white) to dark, hairy, muscular wolf. White women represent the feminine ideal in this culture, and this is what we see in <italic>Dark Wolf</italic>; it would be impossible for a woman of color to play Josie, since during her transformation the contrast would be minimal. (p. 83)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Women of color already embody monstrosity; therefore, the transformation is rendered mute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0196859912443382">1</xref></sup> While women of color werewolves are frequently absent on the screen, the construction of the general monstrosity of women of color continues to permeate popular culture through the images of them as overly sexual (Molina-Guzmán) or welfare queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912443382">Hill Collins, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, shows like <italic>Teen Wolf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859912443382">Mulcahy, Andrew, &amp; Williams, 2011</xref>), <italic>True Blood</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859912443382">Ball, 2008</xref>), and films such as <italic>Twilight</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859912443382">Hardwicke, 2008</xref>) and <italic>Red Riding Hood</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859912443382">Hardwicke, 2011</xref>) have created a werewolf resurgence in popular culture that hasn’t been seen since the 1980s at the height of werewolf films such as <italic>The Howling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859912443382">Dante, 1981</xref>) and <italic>An American Werewolf in London</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859912443382">Landis, 1981</xref>). Using West’s werewolf woman as a starting point, I reflect on the archetype to begin a conversation about the ways women of color in the academy are marked as monstrous Others. Feminists of color have long demonstrated that women of color are dehumanized through discourses of Otherness tied to hegemonic definitions of femininity that extend not only to beauty standards but also to patterns of “acceptable behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859912443382">Hill Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912443382">Owens Patton, 2004a</xref>). Additionally, women of color are often constructed through contradiction in popular culture as asexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912443382">Hill Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912443382">Rodriguez, 2008</xref>), highly sexualized, commodified, and exoticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912443382">Hill Collins, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859912443382">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0196859912443382">Hooks, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0196859912443382">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0196859912443382">Molina-Guzmán, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912443382">Rodriguez, 2008</xref>), or positioned as superwomen who are masculinized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859912443382">Wallace, 1999</xref>). These representations work to perpetuate and “excuse” histories and contemporary instances of racism, sexism, and homophobia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912443382">Patricia Hill Collins (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859912443382">2004</xref>) labels these images “controlling images” that work within an ideological sphere that is tied to economic and political spheres of power, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0196859912443382">Bell Hooks (2006)</xref> marks these representations as part of a larger White supremacist capitalist patriarchy.</p>
<p>Similar to Robin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859912443382">Boylorn’s (2008)</xref> autoethnographic study of race and reality television, I performatively juxtapose my narratives of being a woman of color in the academy with literature associated with female monstrosity and shapeshifting (werewolves in particular). I performatively write to frame specific constructions of my monstrosity. In this postrace/postgender era, performative writing allows me to name this space of oppression, connecting media constructed monstrosity with the Otherness experienced in the academic practices of everyday life for many women of color. Through the meeting of the metaphor and performative writing I seek to evocatively implicate readers to consider ways to intervene in social justice imperatives that call us all to remake academic spaces more hospitable to women of color.</p>
<p>My turn to performative writing is guided by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859912443382">Soyini Madison (1999)</xref> who argues for an understanding of performances of the theories of the flesh in the lives of women of color. The theory of the flesh is tied to a history of theorizing through the body by women of color, similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859912443382">Gloria Anzaldúa (2002)</xref> terms the path of <italic>conocimiento</italic> which involves, “Breaking out of your mental and emotional prison and deepening the range of perception [that] enables you to link inner reflection and vision—the mental, emotional, instinctive, imaginal, spiritual, and subtle bodily awareness—with social, political action and lived experience to generate subversive knowledges” (p. 542). Feminists of color in the field of performance have argued for the importance of centering theories of the flesh when understanding the experiences of women of color (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859912443382">Calafell, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859912443382">Madison, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912443382">1999</xref>). I quote Madison at length in her approach to performance, as it guides my methodological choices of using the metaphor of monstrosity, and werewolves in particular, to understand the experiences of women of color. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859912443382">Madison (1993)</xref> writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Performance helps me see. It illuminates like good theory. It is a top spun out of control that could spin its way back to its beginning. Like good theory, performance is a blur of meaning, language, and a bit of pain. Whirling past, faster than I can catch up. Testing me, refuting me, pulling away and moving toward me. I am almost there with it. I hold on. I keep my hands on the performance and my eyes on the theory. I am playful, but not playing. I do not let go or look away, because I have learned all the meaning of language, and bit of pain will come into clarity and use like a liberation song. I need clarity for the ones I love. Now I enter a truth, a piece of the world, discovered. What is here is not an answer or a resolve but something more. It is a “realizing.” Whether settled or unsettled, finished or just beginning, this realizing is a truth. Performance helps me build a truth, while theory helps me name it—or maybe it is the other way around. My mind and body are locked together in a nice little divine kind of unity: the theory knows and feels, and the performance feels and unlearns. I know I am an un/learning body in the process of feeing. You too. (p. 109)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following Madison’s conceptualization of performance and performative writing, I draw on my lived experience in an Other body and literature on the challenges faced by women of color in the academy to bring forth connections in constructions of monstrosity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0196859912443382">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859912443382">Watts (2010)</xref> explores the film <italic>Zombieland</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859912443382">Fleischer, 2009</xref>) and the specific trope of zombies to explore race in a “post-racial” society. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859912443382">Saunders (1998)</xref> explicates constructions of gay monstrosity in popular culture. I similarly use the monster/werewolf trope in conversation with my own experiences.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to generalize my experiences to all women of color; rather, I consider literature that notes specific patterns of exclusion and patriarchy in the academy against Other women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912443382">Calafell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859912443382">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0196859912443382">2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859912443382">Hendrix, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912443382">Hill Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912443382">Owens Patton, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859912443382">2004b</xref>). I understand that as women of color we share experiences of oppression and marginalization; however, those experiences are colored differently by our multiple positionalities within a larger matrix of domination. I do not seek to further Otherize or reify the image of the animalistic or monstrous woman of color; however, as someone who has been constructed through this trope I seek to interrogate, problematize, and disidentify with it. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912443382">Madison’s (1999)</xref> call I use performance to explore and start to create realizations not only for myself, but also for those who have undertaken this journey with me through the reading of this article.</p>

The excessive Otherness and duality of the werewolf trope offer new ways to think about liminality and identities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912443382">Anzaldúa’s (2007)</xref> <italic>mestiza</italic> offers spaces of possibility precisely because she exists in the liminal state of the borderlands, drawing spaces of affirmation and marginalization, to rearticulate resistance. The <italic>mestiza</italic> must be a shapeshifter who is able to move in and out of different worlds, existing and thriving in each. Werewolf figures as shapeshifters must also negotiate multiple spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0196859912443382">3</xref></sup> Monsters stand “at the threshold of becoming”; by pushing at boundaries they ask us to consider how we have viewed the world while asking us to “reevaluate our assumptions race, gender, sexuality, our perception of difference, our tolerance toward its expression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859912443382">Cohen, 1996</xref>, p. 20). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859912443382">Clark (2008)</xref> argues that within this space of transformation comes agency as, “The woman-as-monster disrupts the male gaze’s desire for the fetishized female body and refuses to stay under the eye’s control” (p. 31).

<title>Werewolf Woman of Academia: Freak on Display</title>
<p>I haven’t been on faculty too long and this is one of the first meetings I’ve attended. In my naivety I thought it was incredibly progressive that the department would start the new academic year by having a series of talks on “diversity.” Little did I know that these talks were not based in any kind of ethics for social justice; rather they were mandated by the university because of some “bad behaviors” that had occurred prior to my arrival. As I listen to the first talk, presented by a White woman colleague, I find myself shaking my head in agreement with many of the points she has made. She offers a critical race perspective that connects to larger structural histories of inequity. I appreciate her perspective. The next speaker is my formal mentor in the department, the only other person of color in the department. I look forward to hearing him speak. Unlike the first speaker he argues for a move to understand “diversity” beyond identities. While I don’t agree with his argument, I listen to the rest of his discussion. He makes the point that we should also embrace Other types of research that defy our dominant ways of knowing in the academy. Given my experiences with gatekeeping in the academy I could not agree more. <italic>I am already on the border in this space. I hope this nudge might create a little more space for me</italic>.</p>
<p>But then <italic>it</italic> happens.</p>
<p><italic>I became the focus of his talk</italic>. All eyes are on me. As if my Otherness in this space wasn’t already apparent, it is once again marked. My “mentor” argues that colleagues should welcome the kind of work I do in performance studies: “If Bernadette wants to stand naked in a cage in front of the building and call that research we should accept that.” My face flushes red, my hands sweat, and I avert eye contact. I sit horrified and ashamed. <italic>Am I actually hearing this? Is this really supposed to happen at a faculty meeting?</italic> Suddenly the transformation has begun. <italic>No one will ever take me seriously again</italic>. I will always be marked by this monstrosity; the image of me naked in a cage. I’m trying to process everything all at once. I question everything that is happening to me and my place in it. I feel the weight of everyone’s stare. I want to retreat as everything is laid bare and I move from subject to object through his words. I become a “freak” or oddity whose only merit comes in sexual display of my Otherness. The display of women of color as sexual oddities or freaks is not new.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0196859912443382">4</xref></sup> Women of colors’ bodies are constantly on display because of their constructed Otherness and hypersexuality.</p>
<p>I keep looking at my watch hoping time will pass quickly and I can just go teach my class. <italic>Yes, I have to keep it together and teach after this. I have to escape</italic>.</p>
<p>Not only has this man embarrassed, humiliated, and sexualized me, undermining my credibility in this department but he also has done it in the name of “diversity.” He has also mischaracterized and trivialized my research. As a queer Chicana feminist performance scholar my work is about performance and everyday life. It is about resistance, agency, and performance. It is about performance on the page through performative writing. I am not a performance artist, or even a performance scholar who frequently stages performance. Where did this all come from? He has misrepresented and transformed me in so many ways and represented me as a stereotypical Hollywood spitfire Latina who is overly sexual. All of this happens in front of my new colleagues and graduate students.</p>
<p>Finally, the meeting is over, and I rush out to teach my class. I do not make eye contact with anyone. I keep my eyes down at my book hoping somehow my colleagues do not recognize my monstrosity or agree with him. At the end of the day almost every faculty member in my department has come to apologize to me for what happened. <italic>Did my “mentor” think of this ridiculous example ahead of time, or was it made up on the spot?</italic> I am too humiliated to go to work the next day. I do not want to show my face in the office. Yolanda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859912443382">Flores Niemann (1999)</xref> argues that shame disciplines women of color in the academy into assuming that they are the problem and leads them to question whether they belong. This certainly is the case for me.</p>
<p>When I finally return to work after a few days of hiding out at home and speak to my department chair about the incident, he doesn’t get it. He asks me not to pursue this matter because my “mentor” is in the process of going up for tenure, and this could hurt his case. He instead suggests that I talk to my “mentor” myself. Not sure what to do, I speak with my “mentor.” He doesn’t want to get it. Instead he tells me if he doesn’t get tenure it will be my fault. I feel conflicted and split into different selves. As a queer woman of color I am violated by his racist and sexist representation of me, yet he is the only other person of color in the department.</p>
<p>His behavior continues and gives others permission to treat me in a similar fashion—so much that a university appointed White “feminist” advocate advises me that nothing can be done to stop what I am experiencing unless one of my colleagues <italic>rapes and murders me on the quad</italic>. She laughs as she says this, again shaming me and trying to discipline and control my Otherness in the process. A colleague who frequently brings his dog to the office comments to some of the other tenured men in the department, “<italic>If only I could control all bitches this easily</italic>.” Another day a different “feminist” advocate, this time another woman of color, reminds me that I <italic>aspire</italic> toward tenure so that I can be protected from these kinds of behaviors and until I have it I will just have to suck it up. They all seek to tame me, putting me on display in a symbolic cage similar to the one my “mentor” suggested. I understand now that my presence in this space is conditional. I must pass and tame my Otherness, showing only the side of my nature that they see themselves in. I must perfect a performance of obedience and become a model representative of my Otherness. My shapeshifting is permitted only under certain restrictions. My Otherness makes for pretty pictures for brochures and the webpage, but that is only when my monstrosity is controlled and at the service of those. Yet another form of being put on display. I understand what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou and Ling (2002)</xref> mean when they write, “non-mainstream faculty cannot presume instant solidarity along ethnic, gender, or class lines. Those deemed Others usually face exile from or marginalization in the academy on the grounds of ‘disloyalty,’ ‘inadequacy,’ or ‘incompatibility’” (p. 371).</p>

<title>Intertwined Histories of Shaming</title>
<p>Mexicanas and Chicanas have long been disciplined through the virgin/whore dichotomy which serves to regulate sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912443382">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859912443382">Castillo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859912443382">Moraga, 2000</xref>). These images are directly connected to Malintzin Tenepal, the translator of Hernan Cortes and the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. Mexican philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859912443382">Octavio Paz (1981)</xref> helped condemn Mexican women’s sexuality through his demonization of Malintzin Tenepal as <italic>La Chingada</italic>—“the fucked one.” These figures have been used to enforce patriarchal domination by creating stark contrasts that do not allow for any gray areas or complexity. The virgin/whore dichotomy has been translated many times over in mainstream films as Chicanas are often portrayed as highly sexualized and violent spitfires or as self-sacrificing and long suffering mother figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0196859912443382">Keller, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859912443382">Rodriguez, 2008</xref>). I have felt the weight of these images throughout my life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859912443382">Amira De La Garza (2004)</xref> further articulates Malintzin Tenepal and the Virgin of Guadalupe as mother figures that shape her and other Chicanas’ experiences. In their juxtaposition, these maternal figures dictate proper roles for women’s sexuality. While each represents and connects to “nation” differently, their motherhood is clear. The figure of Malintzin, the symbolic and violated whore stands in as the ultimate symbol of abjection, demonstrating that women’s sexuality cannot be trusted because as a traitor figure she aided in colonialism and bastardized our race.</p>
<p>While I revel in and seek to rearticulate the story of Malintzin, the image of the whore, I feel the weight of abjection. The whore figure, the damned mother, overly sexual, is always put in her place. <italic>I am put in my place through public shaming</italic>. I become a monstrous freak Other who must be exiled and put on display in order to define what is proper in the academy. I am disciplined so that I might know my place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859912443382">Phillip Bernhardt-House (2008)</xref> writes that “werewolves have often been used as symbols of the uncontrollable and dangerous nature of female (and especially teenage female) sexuality” (p. 168). Certainly we see this in images such as West’s werewolf woman, the character of teenager Ginger who embraces her heightened sexual difference after being bitten in <italic>Ginger Snaps</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0196859912443382">Fawcett, 2000</xref>), or the African American werewolf Mariana, who in <italic>The Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0196859912443382">Mora, 1985</xref>) travels across the world to engage in a <italic>ménage à trois</italic> with the White werewolf queen Stirba and one of her minions. At this moment I feel the nexus of cultural disciplining and monstrosity in my public shaming.</p>
<p>These incidents of public shamings have transformed me. Years later the anger grows. But now I don’t avert eye contact. I meet the stares with defiance. My body still shutters with fear and frustration. I continue to shapeshift looking for a performance that best suits and protects me in this hostile space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859912443382">Anzaldúa (2007)</xref> argues that this is part of our strength as Chicanas: our shapeshifting ability and our tolerance for ambiguity.</p>
<p>“<italic>Why is she so angry?</italic>”</p>
<p>This is what some of my “critically oriented” colleagues ask about me.</p>
<p>“<italic>What has she become?</italic>”</p>
<p>They speak of my “transformation,” individualizing my pain and experience rather than seeing it within a larger matrix of domination. <italic>I was made this way by the academy</italic>. My monstrosity was literally named as such the day my “mentor” figuratively put me on display, and it continued as those in positions of power felt the need to taunt me, hoping to either break me or see a full on self-destructive transformation. But everyone seems to forget that, as I am individually pathologized. Scholars note that the experiences of women of color in the academy can be lonely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou &amp; Ling, 2002</xref>). After being constructed as monstrous I feel the loneliness even more.</p>

<title>The Revengeful Curse of the Werewolf Woman</title>
<p>Prominent werewolf scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">Chantal Bourgault du Coudray (2002)</xref> writes of the ways werewolves come to be associated and stigmatized within constructions of class. When associated with middle-class values, “lycanthropy posed a threat from <italic>within</italic> the normative social collectivity, it tended to be formulated as an interiorized invisible presence, emanating from the psyche” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">du Coudray, 2002</xref>, p. 9). While it is assumed to be natural for monsters to be male because of masochistic desires tied to constructions of hegemonic masculinity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912443382">Aviva Briefel (2005)</xref> notes that female werewolves are depicted in film as tending, “to commit acts of violence out of revenge for earlier abuse by parents, partners, rapists, and other offenders” (p. 20). Examples of this include Joanie in <italic>Cursed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859912443382">Craven, 2005</xref>) who kills women with whom Jake, the male werewolf, who infected and spurned her, is interested in dating. When the female werewolf engages in masochistic acts, “she does so either by coercion from an outside force or as a way of terminating her monstrosity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859912443382">Briefel, 2005</xref>, p. 21). A prime example of this is the film <italic>Werewolf Woman</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859912443382">Silvestro, 1976</xref>) in which a rape victim imagines herself as a werewolf and seeks revenge, or Tara in <italic>Blood Moon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859912443382">Fitzgerald, 2001</xref>)</italic> who kills a man who has bullied her. The construction of women within the frame of psychosis or mental illness is not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859912443382">Perkins Gilman, 2011</xref>). Irrationality is associated as an excessive trait of femininity that is further marked as Other when it intersects with race. Through putting these characteristics onto the body of women, women are further Othered, while larger structures of oppression remain unquestioned. The irrationality and Otherness associated with the bodies of women of color in academia further becomes dangerous when constructed through the lens of threat or contagion. The dangerousness of our presence is not simply that we exist, but that as teachers and mentors we have the opportunity to educate. Administrators fear that like werewolves, women of color “must ‘recruit’ and pass on their cursed state to others through various means” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859912443382">Bernhardt-House, 2008</xref>, on werewolves p. 164). This they fear often is projected into the classroom . . . <italic>I’m infecting them. That’s what they say. I’m infecting too many of the women, particularly women of color, graduate students with ideas. Critical race, feminist, performance, queer, you name it, I’ve got it, and I’ve done it. I have to say it feels good to revel in these knowledges and it feels good to infect others</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0196859912443382">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>How is it that I am desired precisely because I am a critical scholar, yet when I connect it to lived experience, I’m dangerous? Evelyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0196859912443382">Hu-DeHart (2000)</xref> writes, departments say they desire diversity and hire for it, but many refuse to change their chilly climates.</p>

<p>One administrator (town leader) gathers the students (villagers) together to rally against my presence and the White women faculty who have been infected by my “monstrosity.” The villagers are storming the castle. The angry mob is gathering to expel the beast in the dark forest. He exclaims to the crowd, “Those people that do the most things or are always in the drama are not necessarily the ones to go to.

<title>Unruly Bodies: The Beast Among</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou and Ling (2002)</xref> discuss the specific challenges women of color face in regards to teaching on the road to tenure. Women of color who teach classes that center Otherness are put in a complex and difficult position as they are often perceived to have an agenda and cannot be taken seriously on the subject as their White male colleagues who are deemed “objective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou &amp; Ling, 2002</xref>). Even if a woman of color may be an excellent teacher or mentor, evaluations of teaching by senior colleagues usually focus on “negative evaluations for one particular course. . . The lynchpin argument to undermine any explanation is that the candidate abused her students in the classroom” (Agathangelou &amp; Ling, p. 376). <italic>I have witnessed some of my White colleagues scream at students, yet they go unnoticed or unmarked. They are not monsters. They are having a bad day. I, however, am always on guard because as an assertive woman of color who knows the power of my voice, I am already pathologized and viewed as angry before I even speak. I cannot afford to lose my cool or transform myself the way they do. Nor, do I want to</italic>.</p>
<p>Considering the scrutiny under which women of color in the academy are placed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou and Ling (2002)</xref> “surmise that senior faculty tend to pathologize the faculty of color by labeling her teaching as ‘bad’ or ‘intimidating,’ with rumor, innuendo, and lies mixed in to strengthen the bias” (p. 380). <italic>Dr. Smith thinks you’re too emotional or get upset too easily. . . . When I sent out the announcement that you would be taking over as graduate director two students let me know they were concerned about you being in this position</italic>. I listen to rumors wondering how I might get them to see things for once from an Other perspective. That seems impossible as, “It’s much easier to individualize what is otherwise a structure problem and blame the faculty of color” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou &amp; Ling, 2002</xref>, p. 380).</p>
<p>Sorry I can’t disembody my difference and the affect it creates.</p>
<p>A White male colleague comes to my office after a meeting with a White male graduate student. He shares, “He asked me if the rumors are true . . . that White men don’t get funded in our department?!” My colleague, who I consider an ally, is astonished. Sadly, I’m not surprised. It’s more of the same, as my presence and my assumed agenda spark fear and mayhem.</p>
<p>“All faculty operate within structures ridden with stereotypes, prejudices, and misperceptions about people of color, women, and working class people” and “underlying prejudices about race-gender-class may remain unchecked and unexposed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou &amp; Ling, 2002</xref>, p. 375). These unchecked assumptions inform how faculty outside the “mainstream” are viewed. As they ask questions such as, “Should I conform or speak out? Should I teach mainstream or dissident material? Should I address a colleague’s or a student’s racism/sexism/classism publicly, privately, or not at all?” they may be further viewed through unrecognized stereotypes by senior colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou &amp; Ling, 2002</xref>, p. 375). The identities and commitments of women of color may place them in direct opposition to an academy that values “civility” and “getting along”—code words that squash difference. In horror films werewolves have often been “portrayed as outlaws, not only because they transgress the laws of society and stand outside of its boundaries, but because the ordered logic of society is unable to even account for, classify, or assimilate their existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859912443382">Bernhardt-House, 2008</xref>, p. 179).</p>

<title>A Case of “Civil” Disobedience</title>
<p>Every time my course meets, I am continually disturbed that the professor who uses the classroom before me cuts into my class time. My students are frustrated and annoyed. On this particular day, I see her and one of her colleagues in the room. This is another faculty who has done the same thing to me before. In this break between classes I use this opportunity to express my frustration with the situation. As I am speaking to her colleague, she interrupts me. The professor who has just finished teaching becomes defensive, arguing her right to be there. She eventually leaves and the class starts. It is later revealed this is all a misunderstanding because of bad scheduling. I email the faculty member to express my apologies for the misunderstanding with her, though the problem continues to persist with other faculty in her department. Later, a friend, a fellow shapeshifter who is another cultural Other in her department, tells me that the faculty member has had several “breakdowns” over her interaction with me and she tells everyone that she was scared of me. She cries as she says that her students felt they might have to come back into the classroom to “protect” her.</p>
<p>As a woman of color critical educator and researcher I am no stranger to the tactic of White women crying. In fact, I and other feminists of color have written about it before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859912443382">Calafell, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0196859912443382">Hooks, 1990</xref>) as we experienced this many times over in our lives as graduate students, untenured faculty, and tenured faculty. This strategy, often used by White women both in the classroom and in other professional settings against antiracist women of color, deflects blame and guilt, “victimizing” the White woman while centering Whiteness and reaffirming the savage Otherness of women of color. It also often functions as an opportunity for White women to reinforce the bonds of their privilege with White men through the role of innocent victim who must be protected from Otherness. Historically, as we have seen, White womanhood must be protected at all costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859912443382">Hill Collins, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859912443382">Agathangelou and Ling (2002)</xref> argue that “the US academy devolves into embedded racial, sexual, and class stereotypes. For women faculty, an unspoken heteronormativity further requires their adherence to conventional definitions of ‘femininity’” (p. 370). As a queer Chicana feminist I do not conform to these ideal or conventional notions of femininity. I feel the excesses of my body in this space. I am Chicana. I am fat. I am short. I am queer. I cannot and will not perform the femininity desired in this space. My “madness” or “unruliness” is really my feminist awareness, which unfortunately gets connected to monstrosity. I am like a werewolf that “has been in most cases portrayed as schizophrenic . . . as a human divided against itself, unable to control its emotions or its body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859912443382">Bernhardt-House, 2008</xref>, p. 162). All of my excesses cast me as out of control, uncivil, and scary.</p>
<p>In contrast to my excesses, the other instructor who cries, playing into a heteronormative performance that desires protection from her White male colleagues in power (reinforcing patriarchy), is tall, straight, thin, fair haired, and White. We could not be more different. Her idealized performance of femininity both in regard to her appearance, demeanor, and heteronormativity make her the desired female professor in this space. While it would an astonishing and rare case to imagine her as a monster, for me it is the opposite. On screen werewolf women are often cast within a dark or Other trope. For example, in <italic>The Howling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859912443382">Dante, 1981</xref>), Marsha Quist, a lead werewolf, adorns her body with tight black leather, wears a necklace garnished with teeth, heavy makeup, and seduces the main character Karen White’s husband Bill. Marsha’s dark and dangerous sexuality is further coded as primitive when she is seen laughing as she skins and cuts the head off a rabbit.</p>
<p>Against Marsha, Karen is blond, emotionally shaken, dressed in lighter colors, and cast throughout the narrative as the innocent victim who is continually subject to Marsha’s attacks. Marsha falls into the category of the Latina “dark lady” that is villainous, sexual, and often makes trouble for the poor innocent White woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0196859912443382">Keller, 1994</xref>). This same dichotomy frequently plays itself out in the academy as women of color are constructed as hyper aggressive or angry against while White women are constructed as innocents who can fall back on their White privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859912443382">Calafell, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>I continue to be astonished at the working of Whiteness in the quick race to protect White womanhood. I am astonished by the inability of those involved to critically reflect on constructions of me as violent, the woman’s continual victimization of herself, and the supposed fear of her White students. None of these are critically understood through the lenses of sexism, racism, heterosexism, and classism that work against women of color who don’t conform to the expected performances of White middle-class civility and passive aggressiveness in the university. I share this with those involved, but no one seems to hear and my account of the situation is never desired.</p>
<p>The situation reeks of inferential racism, or “nonracist racism” which is most often exercised by “liberals with an explicitly anti-racist intent” (Fiske, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912443382">Owens Patton, 2004a</xref>, p. 61). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912443382">Tracey Owens Patton (2004a)</xref> has tied inferential racism to hegemonic civility, which “refers to normalized or naturalized behavior—appropriate behavior—even as the action can be incivil or even silencing in order to uphold the hegemonic order” (p. 65). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0196859912443382">Raymie McKerrow (1993)</xref> elaborates on the oppressiveness of discourses of civility by arguing that “civil behavior may be more than politeness, but in its execution it may also serve to mask very real differences in power relations. In a word, civility may perpetuate servitude” (p. 9). Adding to this <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859912443382">Owens Patton (2004a)</xref> writes, “‘getting along’ is inferentially racist because many important issues regarding diversity, racism, and White supremacy must be glossed over in favor of the greater common good—which happens to be the good of the White hegemonic order. In addition, laws that protect marginalized people are ignored” (p. 77).</p>
<p>The characterization of me as “violent” or “threatening” is also consistent with the ways women of color have traditionally been characterized in society. Women of color are often read as non-normative, threatening, or violent in their communication because they do not confirm to hegemonic standards of White femininity and passive aggressiveness that is so often favored in the academy. The need for protection of White femininity goes back to slavery and histories of racism in which White women could easily cry foul and the community rallied around them in lynching Black men who stood accused of rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859912443382">Davis, 1981</xref>).</p>

I have been asked to speak after another colleague, but before he even speaks, a well-respected White male scholar’s words make my blood boil. Discussing some of his work, which has been well received, he begins to describe the population of men he works with in ways that, whether he realizes it or not, positions them as noble savages. <italic>His language should be offensive to everyone in this room who calls themselves a critical scholar</italic>. His participants, who I understand to be mostly men of color based on statistics of the population, are described as animalistic, barbaric, and primitive men who can be “rehabilitated” through the ancient canonical texts. It is not so much his project that bothers me as it is the lack of reflexivity about his White masculinity and the language he uses to describe the men of color. I am one of two people of color on the panel. I look over to see the faces of my graduate students, including several women of color whom I have recruited. They look disgusted. A pain sharply moves through my body. I start to shake and sweat. <italic>I know I am not the only one bothered by his language</italic>. I make eye contact with Others, shapeshifters like myself, who are just as offended. But no one speaks. The transformation begins.</p>
<p>Prior to coming to this conference I told myself I was not going to lose my temper. I knew what to expect. But I didn’t expect it at this panel. I didn’t expect it in a “critical” space. I have painfully learned the lesson of talking back, both in university politics and in the politics of an academic conference. I have been disciplined multiple times. I should know better. But I can’t stop my bodily reaction; my transformation. I’m sick. I’m embarrassed and humiliated. All eyes are on me as one of the few people of color on the panel. <italic>How will she react after that statement?</italic> People wait for the freakshow to begin. I don’t want to be on stage, but I can’t help it. The shapeshifter takes over and I speak. In my mind I hear the words of rapper, Nicki Minaj, the only woman (of color) that speaks in Kanye West’s <italic>Monster</italic>: “<italic>But really, really, I don’t give an F U C K. . . . I’m a muthafucking monster!</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859912443382">Bhasker, Carer, Maraj, Roberts, Vernon, and West, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>“As a performance scholar I have to acknowledge that I am really shaken up by what I have heard. In fact I’m having a bodily reaction. I am actually really upset by the description of Other masculinities, particularly when those masculinities were created by a White supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy, and are now being tamed by the classics.” There is no recognition of power and this is history. I further mark the need for rhetorical reflexivity by researchers given that this scholar showed no reflexivity about his White male privilege. My words are ignored, until a White male ally in the audience marks the fact that I have been disciplined through silence. Then the audience starts clapping. The panelist who I called out for his language thinks I’m just upset with his project as do some others on the panel. He doesn’t get that I am upset with his <italic>performance of White male privilege, of neoliberal anti-racist White hero</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0196859912443382">7</xref></sup> as he remarks that he will not make an apology for his work. One person in the audience, another White man, stands up and claps for him. I sarcastically thank him for being so benevolent. The panel is over and I am besieged by people (other shapshifters/cultural Others) thanking me for my comments. I need to get out before it gets worse. My frustration, hurt, and betrayal is too much. I did not want to play this role again. <italic>Why didn’t these Others speak?</italic> I do understand I have tenure. I understand that I am on the front of the stage. I want to howl. I want to cry. The pain reverberates weeks after the conference, as the story is circulated, and stories of my monstrosity or checking of privilege (depending on who you ask) become lore. As much as I did not want to be vulnerable and on display again it happened.</p>

<title>Realizings</title>
<p>I end with the narrative of the conference panel because it brings me back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859912443382">Madison’s (1999)</xref> discussion of the potential of performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0196859912443382">Madison (1999)</xref> sees performance as a space of radical creativity, accountability, and social justice. In performance and performative writing we have the potential to connect theory, performance, and lived experience. Performance provides the possibility to learn and unlearn. Performance implicates. Through these narratives connecting work on the lived experiences of women of color in the academy, literature on werewolves and monstrosity, and my narratives, I have taken heed of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859912443382">Madison’s (1999)</xref> words.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>What is here is not an answer or a resolve</p>
<p>but something more.</p>
<p>It is a “realizing.”</p>
<p>Whether settled or unsettled,</p>
<p>finished or just beginning,</p>
<p>this realizing is a truth. (p. 109)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These “realizings” have been part of my understandings of how I am framed through the lens of monstrosity as a women of color in the academy in the post-racial era. I performatively and vulnerably ask readers to be implicated or intercede in hostile academic spaces that continue to Other women of color. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859912443382">du Coudray (2002)</xref> argues that,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the monster is imagined as the mere receptacle for (or manifestation of) that which is abjected. Monsters, however, are not content to be inanimate vessels for the expulsions of the social collectivity; they want to change or destroy those artifices which insist upon their residual, marginalized status, and their bodies are their weapons. (p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While I am marked through the lens of monstrous femininity in the academy, I refuse to be marginalized. I name this space in order to disrupt it. I make this connection in order to disempower and disidentify with it. I name this space so that you might join the conversation and accept this invitational performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0196859912443382">Sarah Lawrence-Lightfoot (1999)</xref> writes, “Making oneself vulnerable is an act of trust and respect, as is receiving and honoring the vulnerability of others” (p. 93). I offer in my vulnerable self in the utmost respect to you.</p>

<p>Since I entered the academy I have attended and worked at five different institutions. Across each institution I have faced the same types of challenges. The narratives I share are not meant to be an indictment of any one institution or individual; rather they are symptomatic of larger problems regarding racism, sexism, classism, and heterosexism in academia.</p>

<p>The figure of the werewolf as hybrid is best represented in the character of Michael Corvin in <italic>Underworld</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0196859912443382">Wiseman, 2003</xref>), who is sought by Lucian, the leader of the underdog werewolves. Michael’s genes which allow him to be the perfect vampire/werewolf hybrid, not only give Lucian revenge for the killing of his vampire bride Sonja, by her vampire family, but also in a sense would eliminate hierarchies that exist between the groups based on a history of werewolf servitude. Michael’s embodiment and physiology holds the possibility for new ways of being, becoming, and social organizing, and because of this he is a threat to the vampires who fear a change in their way of life and aristocracy.</p>
