<abstract>
<p>Nociceptive stimuli are transmitted through thinly myelinated or unmyelinated primary afferent fibers called nociceptors, which terminate mainly in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. While most nociceptive fibers terminate in the spinal segment of the entrance, (collateral) fibers may ascend and descend several segments upon their entry into the spinal cord, which is reflected in the receptive fields of central nociceptive neurons. In chronic pain states like inflammatory or neuropathic pain, the area of nociceptive activity may expand even further in rostrocaudal and mediolateral directions. Also, within minutes (inflammatory pain) or days (neuropathic pain), an increased sensitivity of peripheral and central nociceptive neurons will develop, which is referred to as sensitization. While anatomical, physiological, and psychophysical techniques have focused on one particular aspect of central sensitization at a time, functional imaging techniques like functional MRI, intrinsic optical imaging, and autofluorescent flavoprotein imaging (AFI) are able to capture both spatial and temporal dimensions of central sensitization simultaneously. AFI and other neuroimaging techniques may clarify fundamental aspects relating to the spread of nociceptive activity within the spinal cord and may thus provide a practical tool to test the efficacy of new analgesic drugs or procedures in animals and ultimately in humans.</p>

<title>Functional Anatomy of the Nociceptive System</title>
<p>Nociception results from activation of primary afferent sensory fibers called nociceptors by intense stimuli that may become harmful to the body. The quality of these stimuli may be thermally, chemically, mechanically, or electrically in nature. Nociception should be distinguished from pain, which is a conscious experience usually accompanied by a particular behavior, in humans often in combination with verbal descriptors of pain. Nociception serves to maintain the integrity of the body and is therefore regarded as part of the interoceptive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858410391813">Craig 2002</xref>) that monitors the state of affairs within the body. In this way, nociception differs from other senses like vision, hearing, smell, and touch, which are part of the exteroceptive system that collects information from the outside world. Nociceptive information is conveyed to the spinal cord mainly by thinly myelinated Aδ fibers and unmyelinated, slowly conducting C fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073858410391813">Basbaum and others 2009</xref>). While the Aδ fibers are generally held responsible for the firstly felt sharp pain, C fibers transmit second pain, which is long lasting and dull in character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073858410391813">Lewis 1942</xref>). Apart from a classification based on fiber diameter and conduction velocity, nociceptors can also be subdivided based on chemical (peptidergic neurons containing neuropeptides v. nonpeptidergic neurons) or developmental properties (nerve growth factor–dependent v. glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor–dependent neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858410391813">Jongen and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073858410391813">Snider and McMahon 1998</xref>). Nociceptive fibers all terminate in the spinal cord, mainly in lamina I and II, which are the superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410391813">Rexed 1952</xref>), while Aδ fibers also project to wide dynamic range neurons in the more ventrally located lamina V. Within lamina I and II, 2 groups of spinal neurons are especially important for the transmission of nociception: large projection neurons in lamina I that are characterized by expression of the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073858410391813">Mantyh and others 1997</xref>) and excitatory interneurons in the inner part of lamina II, which express the γ isoform of protein kinase C (PKCγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858410391813">Malmberg and others 1997</xref>). The latter group of neurons not only receives input from C fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858410391813">Seal and others 2009</xref>) but also from myelinated fibers that are nonnociceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858410391813">Neumann and others 2008</xref>). Both NK-1 and PKCγ neurons are critically important for the development of hyperalgesia in chronic pain states. In lamina V, wide dynamic range neurons receive both nociceptive and nonnociceptive input, the latter from Aβ fibers for light touch and detection of movement and Aα muscle spindle primary afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858410391813">Melzack and Wall 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858410391813">Price and others 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>The Spatial Extension of Nociceptive Input to the Spinal Cord</title>
<p>In clinical neurology, sensory input to the spinal cord is considered to be highly restricted spatially; that is, each dermatome corresponds to a single spinal segment. However, it is known from anterograde tracing studies and even prior morphological studies that fine, presumably nociceptive, fibers may ascend and descend at least several spinal segments beyond the level of entrance in the spinal cord, through the Lissauer tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073858410391813">Light and Perl 1979</xref>). The exact extent of this rostrocaudal spread cannot be determined using anterograde tracing since labeling becomes increasingly faint at long distances. The rostrocaudal extension of nociceptive fibers described above has been confirmed by recording dorsal horn extracellular potentials up to 4 segments above or below a single stimulated cut dorsal rootlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858410391813">Devor and others 1977</xref>) or by field potentials up to 3 segments above or below a single intact, intracellularly stimulated spinal ganglion neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858410391813">Koerber and Mendell 1988</xref>), respectively. Within the dorsal horn in the transverse plane, there is somatotopic organization such that fibers from the proximal lower limb project to the lateral part of the dorsal horn, while fibers from the distal lower limb project to the medial dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073858410391813">Devor and Wall 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>In clinical pain states, input to the dorsal horn expands in the spatial domain. This is exemplified by intradermal injection of capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of chili peppers mimicking acute pain, after which it has been shown that spinothalamic neurons become significantly more sensitive to mechanical stimuli distant from the capsaicin injection site compared to vehicle injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858410391813">Simone and others 1991</xref>). After peripheral nerve injury, several mechanisms may contribute to the expansion of the receptive field of dorsal horn neurons: firstly, recruitment of subthreshold synaptic inputs to dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858410391813">Devor and others 1977</xref>); secondly, sprouting of normally nonnociceptive fibers into the superficial dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073858410391813">Koerber and others 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073858410391813">Woolf and others 1992</xref>) (but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858410391813">Hughes and others 2003</xref>); thirdly, a possible reduction of spinal inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073858410391813">Latremoliere and Woolf 2009</xref>); and finally, release of transmitters and cytokines from activated glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073858410391813">Tsuda and others 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While the above described anatomical structure of the dorsal horn and the processes taking place in pain states are involved in the spatial extension of spinal nociceptive input, none of those reports have demonstrated directly the rostrocaudal and mediolateral spread of nociceptive activity in the spinal cord, neither in the normal nor in the pathological situation.</p>

<title>The Temporal Profile of Nociceptive Input and Spinal Sensitization</title>
<p>Following activation of C and Aδ nociceptors, conducting at 0.5 to 20 m/s, a short latency and therefore presumed monosynaptic electrical response (in the order of tens of milliseconds) occurs in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858410391813">Brieu and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858410391813">Koerber and Mendell 1988</xref>). In addition, there is also activation of the contralateral side, which is likely attributable to polysynaptic mechanisms (see below). Using electrophysiological techniques in animals, it has been shown that following tissue damage, increased responses to nociceptive stimuli as well as expansion of the receptive field develop within 30 to 60 minutes after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073858410391813">Woolf 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858410391813">Ikeda and others 2006</xref>). These changes, collectively called central sensitization, are the result of long-term potentiation of synapses from fibers that originate in the damaged tissue (homosynaptic facilitation) or neighboring synapses (heterosynaptic facilitation). The changes after nerve injury that underlie the development of clinical neuropathic pain, described in the previous paragraph, generally take much longer to develop since these processes involve changes in transcription that alter many neuronal features like membrane properties, growth, and transmitter function of nociceptive-specific spinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858410391813">Costigan and others 2002</xref>). While electrophysiological studies have described the temporal profile of the nociceptive signal and its increase following tissue damage, it would be interesting to visualize the changes in the temporal and spatial domain simultaneously, in order to get better insight into how these 2 parameters of pain transmission relate, especially during pathological pain states.</p>

<title>Functional Imaging Techniques to Study the Propagation of Spinal Nociceptive Activity in the Spatial and Temporal Domains Simultaneously</title>
<sec id="section5-1073858410391813">
<title>fMRI</title>
<p>The above described advances in understanding the temporal and spatial propagation of the nociceptive signal within the spinal cord have been achieved using a variety of techniques, that is, (human) psychophysical techniques, electrophysiology, tracing studies, and expression of immediate early genes (IEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858410391813">Coggeshall 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073858410391813">Hossaini and others 2010</xref>). While some of these techniques are indirect measures of nociception (psychophysical responses and IEG expression), others are hampered by poor temporal resolution (IEG expression) or a very restricted spatial domain (electrophysiology). With the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the 1990s, spinal cord fMRI became a promising tool to study both temporal and spatial aspects of nociceptive transmission in a noninvasive way. Today, however, even using strong magnetic field strengths and sophisticated computing techniques, temporal and spatial resolution are still far from ideal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858410391813">Fig. 2</xref>). Besides, fMRI using blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) contrast, the most widely used technique, represents a hemodynamic response to (increased) neuronal activity rather than neuronal activity itself. Issues related to poor sensitivity and specificity therefore prevent fMRI from being widely applied in the study of spinal cord nociceptive transmission.</p>

<title>Optical Imaging Techniques</title>
<p>Optical imaging comprises several techniques that all involve functional imaging of activity at the surface of the nervous system, using optical cameras. A major advantage of these techniques is that they enable high-resolution imaging in the spatial and temporal domain simultaneously. Unfortunately, they do not allow imaging of deep structures and have a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. The latter may explain that optical imaging, with a history going back to the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073858410391813">Grinvald and others 1986</xref>), only recently gained increased attention due to technical advances in imaging and operation techniques. Not surprisingly, therefore, several recent studies (which will be discussed below) have used optical imaging of the spinal cord to study the spatial and temporal propagation of spinal nociception since nociceptive transmission occurs for a large part at the dorsal surface of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Some optical imaging techniques use indirect measures of neuronal activity, like intrinsic optical imaging and laser speckle imaging. Using intrinsic optical imaging, detailed maps of activation of the superficial dorsal cervical spinal cord were obtained after high-intensity electrical stimulation (i.e., nociceptive stimulation) of the radial, median, and ulnar nerve of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073858410391813">Sasaki and others 2002</xref>). Also, concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, total blood volume, and blood flow can be computed from intrinsic optical imaging and laser speckle absorbance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858410391813">Brieu and others 2010</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410391813">Figure 3</xref>, the hemodynamic response for oxygenated hemoglobin measurements is shown following electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve.</p>

<p>In contrast to intrinsic optical imaging and laser speckle imaging, the signal in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) imaging, autofluorescent flavoprotein imaging (AFI), and optical imaging using fluorescent dyes results from the changes in oxidation and reduction that occur with metabolic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858410391813">Johannssen and Helmchen 2010</xref>). Therefore, these techniques represent a more direct and thus better way to monitor neuronal activity. Among them, AFI has the highest potential to be used for in vivo optical imaging including clinical applications since it does not require potentially toxic exogenous fluorescent dyes and the signal intensity is high compared with NADH imaging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1073858410391813">
<title>Autofluorescent Flavoprotein Imaging</title>
<p>Flavoproteins are mitochondrial proteins that emit green fluorescent light only in the oxidized state. In the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073858410391813">Gao and others 2006</xref>) and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410391813">Shibuki and others 2003</xref>), it has been shown, after direct electrical stimulation close to the recording site, that the light phase of the AFI signal represents postsynaptic neuronal activity. We have recently shown that AFI can also be applied to study spinal nociceptive transmission in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858410391813">Jongen and others 2010</xref>). We found that the spinal AFI signal was both temporally and spatially strongly correlated to electrically evoked nociceptive input. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858410391813">Figure 4</xref>, which demonstrates an immediate increase of AFI intensity following the start of electrical stimulation restricted to the medial part of segments L3 to L6 of the spinal dorsal horn, the projection area of the sciatic nerve. Although AFI was most pronounced on the ipsilateral side, we also found considerable activity on the contralateral side. Contralateral spinal activity following unilateral nociceptive stimulation is usually disregarded and therefore not widely acknowledged. There are, however, a few previous reports demonstrating contralateral spinal activation after a nociceptive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073858410391813">Hudspith and others 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410391813">Ro and others 2004</xref>). Contralateral spinal AFI is thought to result from polysynaptic mechanisms and would therefore be expected to have a longer latency than the ipsilateral AFI response. Our set-up did not allow for verification of a difference in latency between ipsilateral and contralateral activity since frames were captured at a rate of 10 Hz, which is too slow to account for latency differences between ipsilateral and contralateral spinal activation. In contrast to nociceptive electrical stimulation, increased AFI activity was not observed after innocuous palpation in normal rats, consistent with the notion that nonnociceptive input mainly projects to the deeper layers of the spinal cord, which are not accessible for AFI.</p>

<p>After intraplantar injection of capsaicin, we found a slowly developing, up to 400% increase in AFI intensity, which was not observed after sham injection. The time course and magnitude of this increase were very similar to the time course and magnitude of the increased responses after capsaicin using electrophysiology (see above). At the same time, we also found a 400% to 600% increased area of AFI excitation, representing the rostrocaudal and mediolateral expansion of spinal dorsal horn neurons’ receptive fields described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1073858410391813">Fig. 5</xref>). Finally, it was shown that an AFI response occurred after normally nonnoxious palpation, which can only be explained by heterosynaptic facilitation. These experiments demonstrated for the first time both temporal and spatial aspects of central sensitization simultaneously in vivo.</p>

<p>Since AFI thus enables us to monitor in real time the key elements of central sensitization, a physiological phenomenon that occurs in almost all chronic pain disorders, it may be utilized as an objective measure to screen the efficacy of novel analgesic drugs or procedures. Effective analgesic or antihyperalgesic drugs or procedures are expected to result in a decrease in both the intensity and the area of spinal activation measured by AFI. This may provide a valuable additional tool to current preclinical testing of these drugs or procedures. Additionally, using ultra-fast cameras that have become available recently, spinal cord AFI is ideally suited to study contralateral effects of unilateral nociceptive inputs, an area of pain research not exhaustively explored so far. Ultimately, using fiber optics, AFI may also be applied in humans as a minimally invasive procedure. This would allow for a new and objective assessment of the effect of various therapeutic intervention techniques, like spinal cord stimulation, which are notoriously difficult to evaluate objectively. In conclusion, apart from providing insight into fundamental questions regarding how nociceptive activity spreads throughout the spinal cord both in the temporal and the spatial domain, functional imaging techniques, among which is AFI, may provide a practical tool to test the efficacy of new analgesic drugs or procedures, in preclinical testing and possibly in the future also in clinical trials.</p>
