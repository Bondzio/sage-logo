<abstract>
<p>African American spoken word art offers a window through which to explore how a cultural site of creative and artistic inquiry can simultaneously serve as a site of social analysis and change. Specifically, moving beyond the realm of pure aesthetics, the author explores the ways African American verbal art has functioned as a site of public knowledge and everyday politics—important though commonly overlooked features of social change projects. To make this case, the author conceptualizes culture, knowledge, and politics as a tightly connected trinity of social phenomena, thereby opening the door for an analysis of how a cultural object such as spoken word can simultaneously operate as a site of knowledge production and political practice. Next, using a genealogical approach, the author identifies patterns that appear across different black American verbal art forms in order to develop a typology of features characteristic of African American spoken word traditions. This typology highlights a constellation of themes that, collectively, shed light on how public knowledge and everyday politics can contribute to social change. Throughout this analysis, the author considers how this typology provides a broader framework for understanding the specialized political practices and public knowledge projects employed by present-day young adult spoken word performance poets, drawing upon her ethnographic fieldwork for support. Such a framework can encourage us to rethink existing models of social activism and invite us to consider the unique role of art in the pursuit of social justice and change.</p>

<title>Reflexive Statement</title>
<p>
<italic>I grew up in an artistic household where I learned to appreciate the value of aesthetics but I have never self-identified as an artist. As a sociologist, however, I have long identified as a person deeply committed to examining systems of inequality and exploring creative mechanisms for social change. My current ethnographic research on a local community of spoken word performance poets begins to bridge these two areas of inquiry: the arts and social change. My research questions were motivated by the art form’s distinctive relationship with social justice and democratic politics. Through direct observation, participant observation, and in-depth interviews, I examine the various modes by which poets interpret their artistic work in political ways, perceiving their poetry as a potential tool for transforming civil society. The more I learned, the more curious I became about understanding the origins of this social justice ethos; this article is an effort to contextualize contemporary spoken word performance poetry as part of a larger tradition of specialized knowledge and oppositional politics rooted in African American popular cultural oral traditions. This ethnographic project represents my ongoing commitment to understanding and challenging mechanisms of social inequality, and it has also allowed me to find my own artistic voice as a performance poet, and to discover my ability to provoke social change through artistic endeavors.</italic>

<sec id="section2-0160597612451240">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Various community advocates, cultural critics, and social theorists have sought to demonstrate the connections between the creative arts and social change projects (see e.g., Bradley and Esche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597612451240">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160597612451240">Creative City Network of Canada 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160597612451240">Duncombe 2002</xref>). Others, however, have questioned the ability for cultural artistic objects to serve as authentic sites of social change and power contestation. A classic example of the latter position is Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno’s ([1944] 1998) theory of the culture industry in which they argue that, with the advent of modern capitalism and mass media, art has been stripped of its ability to evoke truth and emotion and has instead become a mere vehicle for entertainment, distracting us from taking action against existing capitalistic power structures; in short, we have become preoccupied cultural dupes. According to this theory, present-day art serves to anesthetize, rather than incite, a critical social consciousness or action for social change.</p>
<p>In this article, I hope to challenge such a totalizing viewpoint of art’s impotence under modern-day capitalism by exploring the case of African American spoken word art. I argue that African American spoken word art has historically functioned as a site of <italic>public knowledge</italic>—where social consciousness is raised and alternative epistemologies are offered and legitimated—and <italic>everyday politics</italic>—where community members engage in protest, dialogue, and critical pedagogy. Both activities take place in the public sphere among a culturally specific community (Black Public Sphere Collective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597612451240">1995</xref>; Fraser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160597612451240">1992</xref>), outside formal political and educational institutions. While much of African American verbal art’s subversive power has historically been a function of its location in a “hidden transcript” (Scott 1990), outside mass media communications, a closer examination of public knowledge and everyday politics in these spoken word art forms reveal how contemporary spoken word performance poetry, practiced largely among young adults in urban communities, serves as a site of artistic social change under advanced capitalism, facilitated (rather than diluted) by mass media. Traditional features of African American verbal art help contextualize contemporary spoken word poetry’s explicit concern with social change, despite the increasingly mediated nature of the present-day art form. Notably, performance poetry has played a role in other social change movements, including the feminist and black power movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0160597612451240">Reed 2005</xref>) and the “political personalism” of the literary Beat movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160597612451240">Farrell 1997</xref>). While these social change projects are rooted in official movement politics, in this article, I show how spoken word and oral arts are significant for everyday politics as well.</p>
<p>This article consists of two parts. First, I suggest that African American verbal art forms can be understood as sites for public knowledge-making and everyday politics-doing. To make this case, I suggest that verbal art practices are “partially hidden” cultural sites where marginalized African American communities have historically challenged the systems of inequality that have functioned to shape their everyday social experiences and opportunities. Next, in the second half of the article, I identify a constellation of themes characteristic across a variety of African American verbal art forms as evidence of this. This thematic constellation serves as the foundation for an emerging typology of spoken word practices developing out of black American experiences and communities. Throughout this analysis, I consider how this typology provides a broader framework for understanding the specialized political practices and public knowledge projects employed by present-day young adult spoken word performance poets, drawing upon my ethnographic fieldwork for support. I conclude with a discussion of the social structural limitations and democratic possibilities associated with artistic creativity and everyday politics.</p>
<p>By spoken word, I refer to artistic cultural expressions communicated through orality and performance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597612451240">1</xref></sup> carried out in the presence of an audience or community of listening spectators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597612451240">2</xref></sup> I consider a whole host of verbal art forms in my examination of African American spoken word practices, namely work songs developing out of slavery, sermons, folktales, toasts,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160597612451240">3</xref></sup> the dozens, double-dutch chants, and hip-hop. In this work, I offer a challenge to Horkheimer and Adorno’s assertion that contemporary art forms in today’s culture industry are merely vehicles for entertaining what has become a popular mass audience of cultural dupes. Rather, I hope to demonstrate how popular forms of artistic creation, in this case, African American verbal arts, have historically served to raise social consciousness, provoke political acts, <italic>and </italic>entertain; this tradition has laid the groundwork for contemporary spoken word performance poetry. Such a framework can encourage us to rethink existing models of social activism and invite us to consider the unique role of art in the pursuit of social justice and change.</p>
<sec id="section3-0160597612451240">
<title>Culture–Knowledge–Politics</title>
<p>To make the links between spoken word cultural expressions, public knowledge projects, and everyday political practices, I conceptualize culture, knowledge, and politics as tightly interconnected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160597612451240">4</xref></sup> By culture, I refer to cultural objects—that is, “a socially meaningful expression that is audible, visible, or tangible or that can be articulated” (this includes artistic objects such as verbal art performances; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160597612451240">Griswold 2008</xref>:12)—as well as shared meaning-making processes. Given that meaning is not intrinsic to cultural objects or texts, culture is continuously being created and recreated by groups through a whole set of agreed-upon interpretations and shared understandings of the world (Glassner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160597612451240">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160597612451240">Griswold 2008</xref>; Maines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0160597612451240">2000</xref>; Spillman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0160597612451240">2002</xref>). My understanding of politics, like the Greek <italic>politikos</italic>, “involves the negotiations of a pluralist world, people of different views, interests, and backgrounds interacting in order to accomplish some task” (Boyte 2004:xi–xii); importantly, these are the activities of everyday citizens—amateurs, not experts. These negotiations and tasks concern the allocation of and competition over scarce material and symbolic resources, including power. As such, politics are closely tethered to, and often referred to as, power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160597612451240">5</xref></sup> By knowledge, I refer to the certainty that phenomena independent of our own volition are “real” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451240">Berger and Luckmann 1966</xref>). This perception of reality, manifested as knowledge, is rooted in an epistemological worldview shaped by one’s social experiences. As such, knowledge is not a cumulative, objective, or purely “scientific” endeavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0160597612451240">Kuhn [1962] 1996</xref>); rather, it is socially constructed, transmitted, legitimated, and reproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451240">Abbott 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451240">Berger and Luckmann 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451240">Bourdieu 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0160597612451240">Lyotard [1979] 1984</xref>). While some knowledges are taken for granted and perceived of as “Truth,” other knowledges are subjugated and delegitimized. Power hierarchies are integral to the process of knowledge subjugation and legitimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">Foucault 1980</xref>). Importantly, subjugated knowledges are often not conveyed through the written word but rather are found in oratory forms such as lectures, speeches, testimonies, sermons, music, oral histories, jokes, folklore, and popular childhood rhymes, as well as nonoratory, nonwritten forms (e.g., dance/movement, erotic spaces, and visual art).</p>

<title>Civic Engagement and Spoken Word Publics</title>
<p>The epistemological worldviews and political practices of marginalized communities are often overlooked in mainstream historical accounts (Scott 1990). Existing scholarship demonstrates the various ways in which this historical oversight is tethered to larger systems of social power and inequality, such as racism, patriarchy, and capitalism. The literature on collective memory, for example, underscores the ways in which different historical accounts are “remembered” or “forgotten,” and how these historical fates are tied up in the past and present power relations (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0160597612451240">Olick, Vinitzky-Seroussi, and Levy 2011</xref>). Groups with social power and privilege—such as whites, men, upper-class people, and Westerners—are more likely to be in positions to write history and tell stories from their own perspectives. Included in this biased portrayal is the dominant group’s failure to represent the subversive ideas and political actions held by the marginalized group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0160597612451240">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0160597612451240">Scott’s (1985)</xref> earlier work corroborates this point, illustrating how various “weapons” employed by the “weak” to combat systems of power are usually omitted from the public historical record. As such, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0160597612451240">Scott (1990)</xref> reminds us that the public transcript is only part of the story, since a whole host of discourses and practices take place outside the purview of elites, hidden from direct observation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0160597612451240">7</xref></sup> While this hidden transcript is always operating in tandem with the public transcript, it is difficult to empirically study since, <italic>by definition</italic>, these discourses and practices are concealed from public record.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0160597612451240">8</xref></sup> Yet, subordinate groups have been able to introduce pieces of the hidden transcript into the public record in “muted or veiled form” (Scott 1990:138). Scott identifies elementary and elaborate forms of disguise that serve as traces of hidden transcripts in the public record. Some elementary forms of disguise include anonymity, euphemism, and grumbling or veiled complaint. Elaborate forms of disguise include oral culture, folktales and the trickster figure, symbolic inversion, and other rituals, carnivals and fêtes. These instances are important to explore if we hope to understand a more comprehensive history—or rather, histor<italic>ies</italic>—of power relations and the status quo, beyond the hegemonic representations handed down to us from elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">Foucault 1980</xref>; Scott 1990).</p>
<p>As insinuated by Scott, African American oral culture is a useful site for examining subversive knowledges and political practices often overlooked in the public transcript. While the centrality of oral tradition and an appreciation for verbal dexterity in African American culture has been widely observed and documented (see e.g., Gates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597612451240">1988</xref>; Hecht, Jackson, and Ribeau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160597612451240">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0160597612451240">Perry 2004</xref>), admittedly, due to their sometimes “unwritability” (Wideman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0160597612451240">2001</xref>) and reliance on oral performance for survival, these spoken word traditions can be difficult to empirically study in a Western world of knowledge production, where the optical (Samuels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0160597612451240">2010</xref>) and textual are hegemonic modes of information sharing. Yet, these features of spoken word are also precisely what make them a valuable data source for studying the dissident ideas and political practices of subaltern African American communities, as they do not rely on the “master’s tools” (Lorde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0160597612451240">1984</xref>; i.e., written text) for survival and interpretation, and they are typically performed, at least in their original intent, for African American audiences.</p>
<p>These African American audiences can be understood as constituting a more cohesive and politicized “public,” a term that refers to a collective of people with “a common understanding of the world, a shared identity, a claim to inclusiveness, [and] a consensus regarding the collective interest” (Livingstone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0160597612451240">2005</xref>:9). Although intergroup diversity always exists, black American spoken word audiences do more than simply receive mediated information in the private sphere (i.e., the traditional conception of an “audience”). Rather, given shared interests, collective racial identity, material conditions, and epistemological standpoints under American racial and class power structures, black American spoken word communities, historically, can be conceived of as a subaltern counterpublic or, “parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, so as to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, and needs” (Fraser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160597612451240">1997</xref>:14). African American oral culture can be understood as a site to explore these types of subaltern discursive arenas, where alternative frameworks for interpreting the world and acting within it are formulated and legitimated. Such counterdiscourses about what constitutes reality (e.g., knowledge) and political action contribute to social change projects in that, as I demonstrate below, they cultivate social consciousness raising and a specialized form of civic engagement through various forms of protest, dialogue, and critical pedagogy.</p>
<p>Oral storytelling and other spoken word traditions have long been important to African American politics and “truth-telling.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0160597612451240">9</xref></sup> One early form can be seen in the slave narratives, which were firsthand, sometimes written, accounts by slaves depicting their experiences under the institution of slavery (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0160597612451240">Jacobs 1987</xref>). These written firsthand accounts became central features of the abolitionist movement, appearing in abolitionist pamphlets and other texts, in an effort to put a human face on the horrors of slavery. However, oral tellings of slave narratives were also vital, not only because slave masters often prohibited slaves from learning to read and write out of fear that education would facilitate rebellion and emancipation but also because, during the half-century following Reconstruction, the radical impulse endemic to the written slave narrative was coopted and “reread” through a romantic revisionist—that is, hegemonic—lens depicting southern slave life (Yetman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0160597612451240">2001</xref>). The oral telling of these slave narratives was important for keeping an “insider’s knowledge” about slavery alive; in this way, the spoken word tradition constituted a larger political knowledge project. The importance of the oral form of these slave narratives was later recognized and supported by the federal government through the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Writers’ Project (FWP). From 1936 to 1938, the FWP conducted more than 2,000 oral interviews with former slaves. These oral testimonies have served as an indispensable resource for the scholarship on slavery, as well as popular cultural representations of slavery, providing an insider’s view—from the slave’s perspective—of the institution.</p>
<p>However, the oral testimonies by former slaves as part of the FWP are different from the spoken word traditions that serve as the focus of my work. While the FWP spoken word testimonies are similar to the oral traditions I explore in that they are firsthand, insider accounts transmitted through oral tellings with the intent to depict and preserve knowledge that might get coopted in written accounts, they are fundamentally different in that they are part of the public transcript. As a federally sponsored project, the FWP testimonies were recorded with the understanding among all participants involved that the audience would be broad and, among other things, interracial; such knowledge undoubtedly shaped the presentation (i.e., performance) and content of the information shared. My analysis centers instead on spoken word performances intended, at least originally, for an insider, rather than broad, audience. I suggest that this insider audience—or spoken word public—creatively cultivated specialized forms of civic engagement, given social structural constraints historically prohibiting African Americans from more traditional forms of engagement, such as voting rights and participation in the bourgeois public sphere.</p>

<sec id="section6-0160597612451240">
<title>African American Spoken Word: A Genealogical Approach</title>
<p>Drawing upon folklorist Zora Neale Hurston’s autobiography <italic>Dust Tracks on a Road</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0160597612451240">1991</xref>), Hurston scholar Carla Kaplan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0160597612451240">2001</xref>) writes: “While she had to learn to build bridges between a heritage among free-flowing storytellers exchanging dramatic ‘lies’ (folk-tales), and an academic training that emphasized objective ‘facts’ and cautioned against ‘the habit of talking all over your face,’ Hurston ultimately amassed huge amounts of invaluable material” (p. xxii). Kaplan’s description of Hurston’s approach to researching and documenting an African American oral tradition, and specifically Hurston’s distinction between “lies” (folktales) and “fact” (academic knowledge), highlights the importance of a genealogical approach to historical research, particularly when it involves an attention to knowledge and politics. Foucault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">1980</xref>) employs a genealogical approach in order to excavate <italic>a historical knowledge of struggles</italic>, in which elite (e.g., academic) and popular knowledge (e.g., folktales) are always present. As such, a genealogy acknowledges that, when doing historical work, we are telling just one of many possible histories, and part of the genealogical project involves reclaiming histories by “entertain[ing] the claims to attention of local, discontinuous, disqualified, illegitimate knowledges against the claims of a unitary body of theory which would filter, hierarchise and order them in the name of some true knowledge and some arbitrary idea of what constitutes a science and its objects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">Foucault 1980</xref>:83). Like Hurston and Foucault, I recognize that academic facts and popular folktales are engaged in a historical knowledge of struggles; yet, unlike Hurston, I do not privilege the “facticity” of academic knowledge over folktale knowledge—both possess equally important knowledge claims. Indeed, I argue that the alternative epistemologies located in African American spoken word performances such as folktales serve as a site for social consciousness-raising, where the ability to self-reflect and imagine alternative social arrangements is realized, consciousness is transformed, and knowledge takes on an emancipatory potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0160597612451240">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Foucault’s genealogical insights inform my own historical telling of African American spoken word traditions, a story I convey through the telling of my typology. I search for patterns that appear across African American spoken word traditions and, in doing so, I identify nine themes characteristic of black American verbal arts; these themes serve as the foundation for my typology. Throughout this process, I recognize that I am telling one of many possible histories, and my analysis necessarily highlights a history of some oral traditions at the expense of excluding others. As Foucault points out, the history-telling endeavor is deeply rooted in power and my investigation is no different; I simply aim to be conscious, forthcoming, and self-reflexive about it. Moreover, consistent with Foucault’s genealogical approach, I understand my own project as “a kind of attempt to emancipate historical knowledges from that subjection, to render them, that is, capable of opposition and of struggle against” dominant discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">Foucault 1980</xref>:85). In this way, I hope that the public knowledge and everyday politics I identify in African American verbal art forms is rendered legitimate knowledge rather than, as Hurston suggests, mere “lies.”</p>
<p>Realizing that my analysis will always be incomplete, I highlight two analytic parameters I employ to develop my typology. First, I focus exclusively on traditions practiced in the United States. I recognize that such traditions did not spontaneously erupt on U.S. soil, nor have they been contained to the interior of U.S. borders. Rather, these verbal arts have been informed by spoken word traditions from different national and cultural traditions across the African Diaspora, as artistic objects are not isolated incidents but rather meaningful products of larger spatial and temporal contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0160597612451240">Panofsky [1939] 1972</xref>). In the case of African American spoken word, this cross national and cultural influence has been the result of, among other things, the voluntary and involuntary migration of people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0160597612451240">11</xref></sup> Nonetheless, while I recognize that these American verbal art forms are shaped by traditions from non-U.S. contexts, they have also been uniquely informed by the American national and cultural context, and performed in U.S. communities over time and space. For my second parameter, I focus on those traditions originating in/made popular by/associated with African American communities. This parameter acknowledges that many U.S. American communities, not only African Americans, are steeped in a rich tradition of oral culture (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160597612451240">Einhorn 2000</xref>). Moreover, while no single, monolithic African American culture exists, this analysis considers only those traditions originating in/practiced among/appropriated from peoples whose experiences have been collectively rooted in the black American racialization process, and the cultural/political/epistemological practices that arise from this experience.</p>

<title>An Ethnography of Contemporary Spoken Word Performance Poetry</title>
<p>Throughout the article, I consider how my typology provides a broader framework for understanding the specialized political practices and public knowledge projects employed by present-day spoken word performance poets, drawing upon my own ethnographic data for support. Focusing on one particular urban spoken word poetry scene, for nearly 2 ½ years (February 2010 to May 2012), I observed and participated in over 100 spoken word poetry workshops, open mics, poetry “slam” competitions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0160597612451240">12</xref></sup> fundraisers, and other poetry-related events. As a participant in this poetry community, I served as an event volunteer, a slam poet, a writing workshop participant and facilitator, an audience member, an open mic poet, and a member of the “entourage” supporting the local slam teams at the 2011 National Poetry Slam competition in Boston, MA. I have conducted dozens of informal field interviews, as well as 30 in-depth, semistructured interviews with 23 different members of this local spoken word poetry community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0160597612451240">13</xref></sup> I have also collected supplementary data via online discussions, archiving relevant Facebook and Twitter conversations; an analysis of selected poems serves as an additional supplementary data source.</p>
<p>This research is ongoing. As such, the examples I cite from my fieldwork are not conclusive findings, but rather initial observations that can illustrate how the contemporary poetic art form “articulates” with various other African American verbal art forms (Hall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160597612451240">1986</xref>). While the findings are not conclusive, they are informative. As part of the ethnographic method, I have engaged in an iterative or “constant comparative” process of data collection and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160597612451240">Glaser and Strauss [1967] 2009</xref>). I have been attentive to particular patterns and recurring themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160597612451240">Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw 1995</xref>), with the intent to uncover the deep structures of meaning that constitute this spoken word public and these poets’ worldviews (Geertz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160597612451240">1973</xref>). This spoken word community consists of predominantly young urban adults in their 20s and early 30s. While the community is transient and ill-defined, I have identified a core group of poets through my participation in the scene; these poets and the groups they represent are diverse along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, education, and ability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0160597612451240">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In the same way I am reflexive in my genealogical approach, I am also reflexive in my ethnographic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160597612451240">Davies 2008</xref>). As an unmarried, white woman in my early 30s who appreciates language, art, and progressive politics, and who has always been a part of multiracial friendship groups, in many ways my biggest challenge, contrary to those of many ethnographers, was not to mitigate social distance, but rather to maintain a productive amount of strangeness between myself and my subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597612451240">Bourdieu 1990</xref>). This is an ongoing challenge as I seek to ensure that the social similarities I share with this community do not prevent me from seeing or being critical of various phenomena. Like other ethnographers, I have developed strategies to cope with social distance issues (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0160597612451240">Pascoe 2007</xref>). For example, while in the field, I spoke often and freely about my research project and my status as a PhD student, emphasizing the different motivations bringing my subjects and myself to participate in the art form.</p>
<p>I now turn to my analysis of African American spoken word traditions in an effort to show how verbal art has served as a cultural site for marginalized African American communities to civically engage and challenge the systems of inequality that have functioned to shape their everyday social experiences and opportunities. Throughout, I consider how this typology helps to highlight alternative knowledge projects and political practices enacted in contemporary spoken word performance poetry.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160597612451240">
<title>Typology</title>
<p>This typology highlights a constellation of nine themes that, collectively, shed light on public knowledge projects and everyday political practices in African American spoken word traditions. These themes are not all present in every verbal art form, nor are they each unique to African American spoken word traditions. Rather, the varying combinations of these themes can be seen as distinguishing features of a range of spoken word traditions practiced by African American communities. Although I often refer to these verbal art genres in a monolithic sense, a spectrum of styles and variations exists within each spoken word genre; nonetheless, for analytic clarity, I discuss them in their ideal typical form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0160597612451240">15</xref></sup> I find that the distinguishing themes across genres tend to cluster—although not in mutually exclusive ways—around three distinct cultural elements: cultural object, cultural audience, and cultural process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0160597612451240">16</xref></sup> My typology points to the ways in which all three cultural elements (object, audience, and process) are in conversation with one another, all comprising a larger social world. This typology is useful in that it provides a context for understanding the historical and present-day forms and functions of African American spoken word traditions, including contemporary spoken word performance poetry (Figure 1).</p>
<sec id="section9-0160597612451240">
<title>Cultural Object</title>
<p>By cultural object, I am referring to “a socially meaningful expression that is audible, visible, or tangible or that can be articulated . . .[The] cultural object is a way of grasping some part of the broader system we refer to as culture and holding up that part for analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160597612451240">Griswold 2008</xref>:12). For my purposes, the cultural object refers to the particular spoken word art performance, for example, a double-dutch chant, a sermon, or a folktale. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597612451240">Bauman (1977)</xref>, I understand objects of verbal art as a performance. Below I identify three themes in African American spoken word practices that cluster around the concept of the cultural object. In other words, the three themes spotlighted in this section all relate, in one way or another, to the actual spoken word object, the “piece” of verbal performance art. These themes are: the African American verbal art performance is rooted in lived experience, it is “written” to be spoken, and it is ephemeral.</p>
<sec id="section10-0160597612451240">
<title>Rooted in lived experience</title>
<p>The subject matter of African American spoken word art forms are often rooted in lived experiences; that is, they tend to draw upon the actual life history of the performer or the community to which the performer belongs. As such, these spoken word traditions tend to employ the use of first-person narratives and take an autobiographical form. For example, rap songs frequently adhere to a first-person narrative structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0160597612451240">Perry 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0160597612451240">Pough 2004</xref>) and double-dutch chants and cheers will incorporate real-life names and romantic crushes, thereby “broadcast[ing] [girls’] local identities to themselves first, and later to boys on and off the playing field, in the name of heterosexual courting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160597612451240">Gaunt 2006</xref>:85). Even when the content of the cultural object is fictionalized, which it often is—for example, in the rap song about sensationalized violence or the church sermon’s paradigmatic parable—the fiction strays not far from a lived reality. As Jackson ([1974] 2004) writes of the African American toasts, while these oral narrative poems are typically based in “fantasies . . . they are attempts to deal with a difficult and problematic reality” (p. 39). Jackson highlights how this attempt to deal with a problematic lived reality is often achieved in “a special, highly filtered and exaggerated, way” (p. 13). Such is the case with trickster tales, which comprise a central feature of black American oral narrative art, rooted in lived experience (Gates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597612451240">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0160597612451240">Perry 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0160597612451240">Stallings 2007</xref>). Although trickster tales are mythical accounts, they draw upon metaphors to tell stories of unequal social power relations experienced by marginalized groups in everyday life. These tales subvert more traditional stories of everyday life found in the public transcript by demonstrating how the trickster figure of the subordinate group outwits, out-muscles, or out-endures the dominant group member. This alternative narrative can be understood as a form of empancipatory knowledge, in which the ability to imagine alternative social arrangements is a central feature of social change.</p>
<p>Contemporary spoken word performance poetry is also a narrative tradition rooted in lived experience. The poets in my study routinely use first-person narrative, and base their poems on real-world experiences from their own lives. For example, when describing her poetry, Adrianna<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0160597612451240">17</xref></sup> explains, “All of my work is autobiographical. Occasionally you’ll get a fiction piece but even the fiction is motivated, you know, like I wrote a piece about someone dying of cancer and being in this marriage and it was motivated by someone I knew. Or, I wrote a piece about Alzheimer’s and no one in my family has that condition but I know somebody going through that. So yes, it’s a piece of fiction but for me, I never stray too far.” Similarly, Kim says, “But I do feel like everybody’s poetry is personal in some aspect, even if it may be a fictional story. There is something that drove them to write that piece. So I feel like all poetry is personal. But when I say personal in regards to my poetry, I mean like personal as in I put all my business out there. I tell my story like it is.” Poetry workshops will often feature specific writing prompts that encourage participants to explicitly draw upon personal lived experiences in their writing. Indeed, scholars have described spoken word performance poetry as an identity-based art form (Olson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0160597612451240">2007</xref>), and one that especially values marginalized identities, experiences, and personal struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>). The poets I study talk about how their personal struggles, particularly as members of marginalized communities, inspire their work. Adrianna says, “I mean I often say if I were born in an able body, given my socio-economic background, I think I would have been a sorority sister or I think I would have been married to a straight man, living in a house, and I know it sounds cliché, but I don’t really think I’d have anything to write about.” Kim, who was born HIV+, speaks frequently about how her HIV status informs her poetry, and many of her poems explore various dimensions of her personal experience living with HIV. Time and again, spoken word artists draw upon their own life histories in their performance poetry, often focusing on those aspects of their lives most affected by their unprivileged social status, such as their experiences as members of racial, ethnic, gender, or sexual minority groups.</p>

<sec id="section11-0160597612451240">
<title>Delivery: It is “written” to be spoken</title>
<p>From its inception, verbal art is intended to be delivered via a spoken mode of communication. Because of this, the cultural object is designed to be conducive to memorization (as it is typically not read off a page) and word play. Verbal artists draw upon strategies that facilitate a spoken and memorized delivery of the object, such as rhyming patterns, rhythm, repetition, and improvisation; in turn, these all become defining features of the verbal art performance. Referring to oral traditions broadly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160597612451240">Finnegan (1977</xref>) asserts that some scholars “unequivocally regard repetition (including parallelism and formulaic expression) as characteristic of oral literature [and] even the yardstick by which oral can definitively be distinguished from written literature” (cited in Biakolo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597612451240">1999</xref>:60). Rhythm and repetition patterns help performers memorize narrative content, and norms around improvised material facilitate verbal artists’ ability to recite oral material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0160597612451240">Lord 1960</xref>). In the context of African American spoken word, rhyming patterns, rhythm—including the “vibration of the word” (Neal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0160597612451240">1972</xref>), repetition, and improvisation are predominant features of the art form, evident in verbal traditions such as sermons, toasts, rapping (especially freestyle), the dozens, and double-dutch chants but also in black musical oral traditions such as the blues and jazz.</p>
<p>The spoken word platform, as well as written text, also allows for and highly values word play, which includes metaphor, syntax play, euphemism, signifyin', and double entendre. The African American spoken word artist is especially valued for her lyrical dexterity and mastery of such word play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597612451240">Abrahams 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0160597612451240">Jackson [1974] 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0160597612451240">Perry 2004</xref>). While word play is not unique to spoken word or African American verbal arts, it is important in the African American context because, historically, it helped to disguise the knowledge-politics embedded in the cultural art form. Gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160597612451240">1988</xref>) locates a similar function in black vernacular, arguing that in the vernacular, “since slavery, the black person has encoded private yet communal cultural rituals” (p. 339). For example, the toast about Shine and the <italic>Titanic</italic> is full of double meaning, euphemism, and metaphor. While different versions of the toast exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597612451240">Abrahams 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0160597612451240">Jackson [1974] 2004</xref>), they all tell the general story of a black man named Shine who worked in the boiler room on the <italic>Titanic</italic>. When the Captain refused to heed Shine’s warning of rising water in the ship’s bottom floor, Shine jumped overboard and swam to safety, refusing calls for help from white passengers as they sank to their deaths. Jackson ([1974] 2004) describes the tale as “a response to racial indignities” (p. 37), not only by rejecting white authority but also by asserting one’s own physical and verbal power, a significant and defiant act in the context of the social and psychological harm resulting from American racial inequality and racism.</p>
<p>Although present-day performers need not disguise their social critiques in the same way that, for example, subordinate groups did at different points in history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0160597612451240">Scott 1990</xref>), the contemporary form employed by spoken word poets prominently features elements of rhyme, rhythm, repetition, improvisation, and word play. Poets are very cognizant of the spoken delivery of the art form, and they craft their pieces with the object’s intent to be spoken in mind. Some poets, such as Mia, even create their pieces verbally first and only later convert the cultural object to text, once the piece is fully composed. Poetry workshops are sometimes specifically organized around these features of the spoken delivery of the object, for example, I have participated in workshops organized around syntax, metaphor, and performance.</p>
<p>While features such as word play and improvisation are central to the spoken word cultural object, the object’s intent to be spoken also has implications for the cultural audience, as the cultural object is necessarily “written” or created to be spoken <italic>to</italic> someone. The presence of an audience is key to understanding the public knowledge and everyday political components of the spoken word object; in the case of Shine and the <italic>Titanic</italic>, knowledge and critique of racial injustice is circulated among black audiences through the toast, creating a sense of social consciousness and justice among all those who tell and listen to the story. While critiques of social injustice are not disguised in contemporary spoken word poetry, the present-day art form’s association with “revolution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160597612451240">Eleveld 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160597612451240">2007</xref>; Olson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0160597612451240">2007</xref>) and its relationship with social justice and democratic politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0160597612451240">Smith and Kraynak 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>) can be understood as part of a larger tradition of oppositional politics and public knowledge that is conveyed to an audience through the spoken word object.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0160597612451240">
<title>Ephemeral</title>
<p>A third theme characteristic of African American spoken word cultural objects is its ephemeral quality—it is never performed the same way twice and is continually open to change with each new performance, audience, time, and space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597612451240">Bauman (1977)</xref> accounts for this ephemerality in his notion of the “emergent quality of performance” and it is evident, for example, in double-dutch chants and hip-hop songs that adapt to regional geographical locations and local colloquialisms during the performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160597612451240">Gaunt 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0160597612451240">Perry 2004</xref>). This feature of spoken word art relates back to its improvisational character as well, in that “the flexibility of the form allow[s] the [performer] to adapt his performance to the situation and the audience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597612451240">Bauman 1977</xref>:39). Although ephemerality is a key feature of the cultural object, the art form’s ephemeral quality can also be understood as having strong links to the cultural audience, in that the object’s changeability is greatly dictated by the audience. Referring to toasts, Jackson ([1974] 2004) writes: “It is transitory and idiosyncratic; the artist’s perception of the audience’s response and interest influences length and decoration and design. The telling situation . . . the context, is as important as the text itself ” (p. ix). Jackson’s description of the African American toast illustrates how the audience—or the performer’s perception of the audience—fundamentally shapes the verbal art performance. Indeed, Wideman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0160597612451240">2001</xref>) laments over what gets lost in attempts to translate the ephemerality of the African American oral folktale to the written text: “[S]ome major missing dimensions are the immediacy and sensuousness of face-to-face encounter, the spontaneous improvisation of call and response, choral repetition and echo, the voice played as a musical instrument, the kinesics of the speaker” (p. xvii). Bauman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451240">2011</xref>) considers issues of translation in his discussion of the phonograph, and the influence of this new invention on the ephemeral quality of the spoken word object now that it can be archived with recording technology (see also Brady <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0160597612451240">1999</xref>). Like Wideman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0160597612451240">2001</xref>), Gaunt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160597612451240">2006</xref>) highlights the kinetics and ephemerality of verbal art performances and introduces her concept of “kinetic orality,” “interpreting black girls’ musical games as <italic>oral-kinetic lessons</italic> in black musical style and identity” (p. 4). Notably, Gaunt’s choice of word—“lessons”—underscores the knowledge-building quality available in the verbal art performance. The ephemerality of African American spoken word lends to the art form’s flexibility, thereby maximizing its ability to communicate knowledge claims across different audiences through everyday (political) spoken word practices.</p>
<p>As with other African American verbal art traditions, contemporary spoken word performance poetry is thoroughly ephemeral. This characteristic is especially highlighted during poetry slams, evidenced in artists’ strategizing techniques, where poets assess judges, audience members, and previous poems, all in an effort to spontaneously tailor their own work to the context at hand in the hopes of receiving a higher score.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0160597612451240">
<title>Cultural Audience</title>
<p>By cultural audience, I mean the collective of social actors who are witness to (and, by extension, participants in) the verbal art performance. Unlike other art forms created and consumed under more solitary conditions (e.g., a painting or a novel), verbal art forms (and other performance art) are fundamentally social in that an audience is necessarily present when they are enacted. Traditional audiences of African American spoken word, given their shared interests, collective racial identity, and similar epistemological standpoints, were well primed to serve as a spoken word public engaged in specialized (albeit often hidden) forms of civic engagement. I highlight three themes present in African American spoken word practices that relate to the cultural audience of verbal art forms. African American spoken word audiences are a folk or popular audience, a participatory audience, and part of the knowledge production and legitimation process.</p>
<sec id="section14-0160597612451240">
<title>Folk/popular audience</title>
<p>Contrary to a literary, professional, or academic audience, the African American spoken word audience is a popular or folk audience. These audiences are made up of everyday people engaged in everyday sorts of actions, including political practices. As noted above, political activities involve the interactions of everyday citizens—amateurs, not experts who are, by definition, a popular or folk contingency of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597612451240">Boyte 2004</xref>). To take an example from African American verbal art, the general audience of a sermon tends not to be a group of theologians, and the listening spectators of the folktale are typically not professionally trained literary critics. The folk feature of the audience has implications for how the art form is created and performed in that the audience does not “pretend their decisions are based on high and immutable aesthetic values; they do not pretend they have no gut reaction to things; they do not pretend to like things which make no sense to them. In a way they are the harshest of audiences, for they are intolerant of what bores them and tend to discard boring things quickly and to reject boring performances immediately” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0160597612451240">Jackson [1974] 2004</xref>:ix). The moment the verbal art performance defaults into the realm of overly abstract, academic, or emotionless, it becomes meaningless and boring to the popular audience, rendering the object unworthy of replication. In this way, to survive, the verbal art performance <italic>must </italic>entertain. This presents a challenge to Horkheimer and Adorno’s ([1944] 1998) critique of such popular art forms. In the case of a folk audience, entertainment makes the art form accessible and relatable.</p>
<p>The performance poets I study understand their audience to be a popular folk audience, and they work hard to make their poetry appeal to the masses. Poets talk about needing a narrative arc or story rooted in a lived experience in an effort to make abstract and hard-to-grasp ideas meaningful to their listening public; they seek to convey their message by tapping into emotional gut reactions. For example, at one of the weekly open mics, Derrick, who had been inspired by the momentum around the Occupy Wall Street Movement, was telling Neeta how he wanted to write more political poetry, but he didn’t “just want to be on a political soapbox spitting out issues.” The two poets talked about the importance of finding a narrative in the story they want to tell. Neeta recounted advice from a college professor, who once told her that the job of the poet is “to make the ordinary sound extraordinary.” By this she meant that the poet’s role and skill is to connect big abstract issues—such as the political issues around economic inequality taken up by Occupy protesters—to a personal narrative to which the audience can relate.</p>
<p>The folk audience plays a fundamental part in shaping this feature of the cultural object, in that the content of the object is necessarily produced and reproduced with a popular audience’s tastes, political leanings, and knowledges in mind. Thus, the storyteller of the African American folktale deploys cultural tropes, political sensibilities, and indigenous knowledges with which their African American folk audience will identify. We can return to the example of Shine and the <italic>Titanic</italic> to see how culturally specific understandings of and encounters with racial injustice inform the meanings embedded in that toast, and how this form of truth-telling, although contrary to cultural logics embedded in the dominant discourse, are a form of public knowledge disseminated among this culturally specific folk audience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0160597612451240">
<title>Participatory audience</title>
<p>In addition to a folk audience, African American spoken word traditions involve a participatory audience. Unlike other artistic performances in which the audience is expected to sit quietly, without disruption, saving all reaction until the end, African American verbal art forms encourage—indeed demand—audience participation. This can take the shape of a congregation singing or shouting during a preacher’s sermon, an audience laughing or injecting commentary throughout a performer’s toast, a crew of girls clapping or jumping during a game of double-dutch, or a group of bystanders jesting and reacting while watching a rap battle or game of the dozens unfold. In all these cases, the audience is so integral to the performance that, without them, the art form would cease to exist. While a participatory audience is not unique to African American spoken word traditions (see e.g., Caton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160597612451240">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0160597612451240">Narayan 1989</xref>), African American spoken word art forms are especially known for their call-and-response structure. A call-and-response format between performer and audience is evident in various African oral traditions but also in spoken word traditions practiced in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451240">Asante 1998</xref>). This is evident in African American work songs, various black American storytelling traditions, and double-dutch chants, among other verbal art forms. This “talk back” or audience response becomes part of the cultural object; thus, the church congregations’ “Amens” become part of the sermon, the girls’ stomping feet and claps become part of the double-dutch chant, and the group’s laugher and verbal injections become part of the dozens’ insults.</p>
<p>At the spoken word performance poetry venues I visit, the audiences are very participatory. In slam poetry, for example, the audience is explicitly encouraged to participate by shouting, clapping, booing, and judging, and instructions for doing so are part of the official “emcee spiel” recited before each slam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>). When a spoken word audience likes what a poet says or wants to help a poet remember dropped lines, the sound of snapping fingers spreads throughout the crowd, exemplifying the continuous communication taking place between the audience and spoken word poet throughout the performance. Hannah explains: “One of my favorite moments in slam is there’s kind of this—people think of poetry slams that everybody snaps to applaud. That doesn’t happen. But when they do snap is when they really like a line, usually if it’s a poet who does a certain poem, when they start that line and everybody knows what poem it is, they snap. But there’s also, if a poet trips up, and forgets their lines, there’ll be this moment where they kind of pause, and everybody can tell they don’t know, and people will snap or be like, ‘You got it!’ ‘Take your time, take your time!’ And it’s the most—to me it’s my favorite moment.” Although Hannah describes audience participation at the slam, this form of participation—snapping and shouting—occurs in noncompetitive spoken word settings as well, such as open mics. Similar to the folk quality of the audience, the participatory quality of the audience shapes of the cultural object, in that their audible utterances and gestures become part of the object. I describe implications of a participatory folk audience for public knowledge and everyday politics next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0160597612451240">
<title>Audience is part of knowledge production and legitimacy</title>
<p>Given the participatory and folk nature of the audience in African American spoken word art forms, the audience also plays a key role in the knowledge production and legitimation process. The epistemological content of the object is produced and legitimated by the community of listening spectators that contribute to its existence. This is consistent with Berger and Luckmann’s (1966) theory of how knowledge becomes legitimated: specialized communities of insiders or “specialists” are in a position to deem what constitutes knowledge. This knowledge production and legitimation process enacted by the audience occurs through means endemic to the art form, including multiple- or community-based authorships, artistic innovations, and judgment mechanisms. Take, for instance, the African American toasts, which “have had a number of authors rather than just one, or, to put it another way, various audiences have had an opportunity to modify the points or parts they didn’t much like . . . [one of the] major differences between written poetry and folk poetry: with written poetry, the audience makes its judgment after the fact; with folk poetry, the audience’s judgment is part of the fact” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0160597612451240">Jackson [1974] 2004</xref>:viii). These multiple authors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0160597612451240">18</xref></sup> opportunities to innovate or modify, and mechanisms for iterative and immediate judgment are all characteristics of the spoken word audience. This is why, for example, regional specificities emerge in double-dutch chants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160597612451240">Gaunt 2006</xref>) and folktales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160597612451240">Hurston 2001</xref>); these small innovations are possible in part because the cultural object is communally authored—the audience participates in the knowledge content created and serves as the knowledge legitimation source.</p>
<p>In the case of contemporary spoken word performance poetry, unlike other African American verbal art traditions, the cultural object is <italic>not </italic>communally authored and performers’ names are closely associated with their own specific performance pieces. For example, at one of the weekly open mics I attend, audience members frequently shout out requests from an artist’s personal repertoire of work; audience members never shout requests for poets to perform other people’s poetry (“O.P.P.”). When poets do perform O.P.P., they are always certain to give credit to the original author. In slam poetry, original and individual authorship is one of the core rules for competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>). In this way, spoken word performance poetry resembles rap, as “[r]appes have redefined this concept of communal authorship. Narrative originality is lodged in creating new stories, and these stories are associated with the rapper. However, rapper’s rhymes are clearly influenced by, if not a direct outgrowth of, the African-American toast tradition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0160597612451240">Rose 1994</xref>:86).</p>
<p>While contemporary spoken word poetry is not communally authored in the same way as, for example, a toast, contemporary performance poetry is open to innovation and modification, as well as immediate judgment via continuous communication between the audience and spoken word poet. Although not a common feature of the local spoken word scene I study, in other urban areas, I have observed audience members hiss when they disapprove of the knowledge content in a poem. Slam audiences participate in the knowledge production and legitimation process as judging mechanisms and participation protocols signal what the audience will stand for, support, object to, and affirm. Specifically, audiences use booing and cheering mechanisms to publicly legitimate or disapprove of a poet’s poem or a judge’s score, thereby offering multiple opportunities for the audience to participate in the knowledge legitimation process. Not only does this feature of the audience shape the content of the cultural object, but it also relates to the next cluster of themes in that knowledge production and legitimation can also be understood as a cultural process, priming an audience for <italic>action</italic> toward civic engagement and everyday political practices.</p>

<title>Cultural Processes</title>
<p>Cultural processes can refer to short- and long-term dynamics, either pertaining to operational factors that contribute to how cultures function in the everyday, or evolutionary factors involved in cultural change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0160597612451240">Kroeber 1948</xref>, cited in Lyman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0160597612451240">2007</xref>). My interest in cultural processes concerns the methods or operations associated with African American spoken word practices; however, I do not distinguish between operational and evolutionary cultural processes. Rather, I am interested in actions over time that produce some result; it is here where I locate the everyday politics of African American verbal art. I identify three themes related to cultural processes that are characteristic of African American verbal art forms: learning process, a concern with function in addition to form, and a concern with the creative act in addition to the object created.</p>
<sec id="section18-0160597612451240">
<title>Learning process</title>
<p>There is a pedagogical component to African American spoken word traditions, and these pedagogical processes can be understood as operating on several levels, all of which are communal in nature. First, there is a communal process of teaching the art form to others; this involves teaching the processes by which one creates performance pieces, improves one’s craft, and cultivates a performance style. This pedagogical commitment takes place at the level of community, as there are, for the most part, no books that teach others how to perform spoken word traditions. Thus knowledge about double-dutch chants and folktales are passed along through a community network of spoken word “teachers.” Second, the pedagogical process is communal in that, given the participatory nature of the audience and the audience’s role in knowledge production and legitimation, African American spoken word traditions are frequently authored by the community rather than by a single individual. Finally, communal pedagogical processes are central to African American verbal art forms in that they have historically served as a medium for teaching about the world.</p>
<p>Given that dominant modes of education have excluded African American history and experiences from mainstream curriculum, this cultural process of community education is a form of public knowledge or “another kind of public education” (Collins 2009). Such is the case with the alternative knowledge offered in the toast about Shine and the <italic>Titanic</italic>. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160597612451240">Gaunt’s (2006)</xref> understandings of the games that black girls play as “lessons” and more recent work on hip-hop pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0160597612451240">Hill 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0160597612451240">Low 2011</xref>) offer additional indications of the pedagogical potential of African American verbal art. Recently, education scholars have advocated for integrating a “spoken word curriculum” into the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0160597612451240">Low 2011</xref>). This explicit concern with the learning process through the medium of spoken word can be understood as an everyday political act, not only because of the political implications of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">Foucault 1980</xref>), but also because of the ways in which pedagogy can function as a tool to challenge oppression and achieve freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160597612451240">Freire [1970] 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160597612451240">hooks 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The poets in my study continually rely on each other to teach one another how to perform and write poetry and, moreover, they believe that they are teaching audiences about the world through their performance poetry. These poets are each other’s editors and they take turns organizing and leading workshops for one another. They apply for grants to go into schools to do workshops with grade school and high school students. They perform at political rallies. Although they do not use the language of “critical hip-hop and spoken word pedagogy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0160597612451240">Low 2011</xref>), the poets believe that their work has the power to teach audiences about issues that go unaddressed in mainstream educational and political institutions, and that these “lessons” can foster a critical consciousness, counter dominant ideologies, and be used in the service of social justice. Nicho expresses the political and pedagogical implications of the art form when he describes traditional performance poem topics as “clash[ing] with the mainstream,” tackling such issues as poverty, police brutality, racism, genocide, and a critique of the corporations that benefit from various atrocities. Spoken word poets’ concern with the learning process and pedagogy is also evident in the fact that an astonishing number of these poets have day jobs working in schools as teachers, poetry club advisors, or poetry workshop facilitators. Of the 23 poets I formally interviewed, 10 are teachers and one recently quit being a teacher to focus on poetry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0160597612451240">
<title>Concern with function in addition to form</title>
<p>While the African American spoken word tradition is attentive to form (evidenced by the earlier discussion of the verbal art performance as a cultural object), the genre is equally concerned with function. That is, the performance must engage in a process of “doing” something. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451240">Asante (1998</xref>) identifies a similar feature in African art, arguing that it is “never <italic>l’art pour l’art</italic>; it is always functional” (p. 75). Often, one of the functions of the black American verbal art form is to entertain (e.g., toasts), but there is also a strong tradition in which the art form is intended to inspire (e.g., sermons) or provide an accompaniment or rhythm for a task (e.g., double-dutch chants and work songs). Several strategies are employed to achieve such functions. For example, Jackson ([1974] 2004) discusses the toast’s function to entertain and the deployment of wit, comedy, and rhyme to achieve this, all of which are facilitated by word play and improvisation. Competition is another strategy characteristic of African American spoken word traditions seeking to entertain, evident in the dozens and battle rapping; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0160597612451240">Perry (2004</xref>) uses the term “competitive orality” to describe the dozens (p. 30).</p>
<p>The functional component is salient in the community I study. Poets talk about their poetry as a vehicle for moving people to act, inspiring people to be better, teaching people things previously unknown, and raising consciousness about social issues. After describing the various ways different poets are involved in the community, Deeana concludes, “And so it’s like, we’re all community-oriented. A lot of people just see us when we hit the stage but if you’re a poet and you don’t help out in the community, I don’t think you’re really a poet . . . The whole purpose is to give back to the people. We give back in our words, but words can only take you so far.” This deep-seated concern with function and giving back to the community sets the art form up nicely for a platform is from which to “do” everyday politics and public knowledge-making, given that it is action-oriented. This also relates back to the cultural audience, in that the aim for the verbal art performance to “do” something is directed toward a specific public of people; for example, the sermon is intended to inspire and the dozens are intended to entertain a particular community of listening spectators. This community audience is then well-primed to do, via their engagement with verbal arts, specialized forms of civic engagement and communicative action. Some of the most visible community work being done by spoken word poets in the urban area I study includes work around HIV/AIDS activism, body empowerment and self-love, and gentrification/responsible community development, among other social justice issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0160597612451240">
<title>Concern with the creative act in addition to the object created</title>
<p>For those who study the verbal art performance, including the artist practitioners committed to improving their craft, the creative act of producing the cultural object is equally as important as the final object produced or, the process by which one got there. Jackson ([1974] 2004) writes: “The various drafts and their meanings, the psychic states of the artist along the way are never fully open to the critic . . . But for the folklorists, the creative act is part of the product; each redaction of the text, each re-creation of the event is to some extent controlled or influenced by the situation” (p. x). Thus, the verbal art performance’s ephemeral quality means that it is always open to the possibility of change and innovation, and the changes that take place at any given time are equally as important as the creative processes involved in instigating these changes. This affinity for change and creativity position the art form well for an everyday politics engaged with creative forms of protest, dialogue, and critical pedagogy. Moreover, the process of creating art can serve a therapeutic function as well, evidenced by the rapidly growing field of art therapy. For example, hip-hop has been identified as a way urban black and Latino youth have sought to cope with—and speak back to—a social context characterized by poverty, unemployment, conservative economic policies, a crack epidemic, police brutality, and mass incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597612451240">Chang 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0160597612451240">Kitwana 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0160597612451240">Rose 1994</xref>). As such, the creative processes endemic to the verbal arts has enabled artists to better manage the personal and structural challenges they face, thereby positioning themselves to better serve their communities through their artistic work.</p>
<p>The creative act, as much as the creative product, is of concern to the spoken word performance poets I study. Poets describe the creative process as therapeutic, purposeful, emancipatory, and some even discuss it as a way to serve God or the universe. Poets are committed to this creative process, evidenced in their various efforts to develop their craft, which includes participating in workshops, coaching each other one-on-one, challenging each other to poetry writing games, and studying YouTube clips of poetry performances.</p>
<p>I organize these nine themes, which cluster roughly around three cultural elements (object, audience, and process), into a typological framework that serves as a starting point for exploring public knowledges and political practices historically overlooked in the public transcript. While these themes cluster around particular cultural elements, they are not necessarily unique to that culture element; I use brackets to illustrate this point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0160597612451240">Figure 1</xref>). For example, while the delivery of the African American verbal art performance is “written” to be spoken—and this is a central feature of the performance as a cultural object—this feature is also relevant to the cultural audience, in that an audience must be present for the performance to take place. Similarly, the art form’s concern with function—that is, the performance must <italic>do</italic> something—which I characterize as a cultural process, also relates to the cultural audience in that the performance must do something for a listening public. The three cultural elements of object, audience, and process can be understood as falling along a spectrum of social complexity, where the individual cultural object is the least socially complex, the cultural process is the most, and the cultural audience falls in between.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0160597612451240">19</xref></sup> Moreover, while the cultural object is part of the cultural audience, and both of these elements comprise larger cultural processes, these cultural processes feed back to inform the cultural object. For example, the cultural pedagogical processes characteristic of African American spoken word traditions feed back into the features of the cultural object in terms of performance styles and the knowledge content disseminated. I use this typology to contextualize contemporary spoken word performance poetry as part of a larger tradition of specialized knowledge and oppositional politics rooted in African American popular cultural oral traditions.</p>

</fig>
<p>This typology helps to show the close and frequently overlapping boundaries between the humanities and social sciences; often art is well positioned to highlight such commonalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160597612451240">Bingham 2012</xref>). Specifically, this analysis encourages scholars, artists, and ethnographers working across disciplines to consider methodological questions around the nature of artistic versus social scientific storytelling. Questions about artistic storytelling techniques are a touchy subject for social scientists, as they invite “un-scientific” elements such as beauty, personal experience, emotions, or improvisation into the scientific endeavor. However, as my analysis shows, these techniques can be effective in catalyzing interest, curiosity, and moral/emotional commitment to a cause, which are also goals of the scientific endeavor. Further, artistic techniques might be useful for social scientists to tell their stories to a broader public (Chepp and Dean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597612451240">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This typology also serves as a guiding light for scholars and practitioners interested in social justice work by demonstrating the unique role of art in social change projects. Specifically, this framework provides a platform for rethinking existing models of how to foster civic engagement, particularly among marginalized communities. In the case of African American spoken word, art’s ability to evoke emotion and entertain serves to make public knowledge and everyday politics accessible and relevant to everyday citizens’ lives. As such, artistic forms that have an ability to be flexible (e.g., ephemeral, improvisational, or transportable) and evoke emotion among the masses (e.g., appeal to folk audiences), particularly through personal narratives, might be especially well positioned to incite social change by raising social consciousness through public knowledge projects, and making everyday forms of political action accessible through the use of artistic protest, dialogue, and pedagogy. At the time of this writing, the Occupy Movement is in full swing, and creativity has been identified as a core feature to the movement’s success (Kilkenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0160597612451240">2011</xref>). What if we were to expand this concept of creativity beyond the domain of creative social movement tactics and also considered the role of the creative arts in social change?</p>

<title>Creative Politics and the Politics of Creativity</title>
<p>In this concluding section, I consider questions around artistic creativity, social change, and impact. I introduce two related yet distinct theoretical concepts—<italic>creative politics</italic> and the <italic>politics of creativity</italic>—in an effort to show the relationship between the possibilities and limitations of everyday politics in artistic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597612451240">Bourdieu 1984</xref>). On one hand, spoken word performance poets engage in <italic>creative politics</italic> by deploying artistic creativity as a political tactic, using their involvement in the performance poetry community as a vehicle for doing social justice projects aimed toward social critique and change. The typology introduced above provides a broader framework for understanding this alternative model of social activism. Poetry venues play an active role in the deployment and cultivation of creative politics in that they serve as incubators and outlets for artistic creativity. My conversations with venue representatives and my analysis of venues’ mission statements reveal that these poetry venues understand themselves to be a type of “free spaces” (Polletta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0160597612451240">1999</xref>) in that they perceive themselves to be community institutions that support counterhegemonic ideas and identities through art, and where poets and audience members can dialogue and cultivate a political agenda.</p>
<p>However, in their efforts to carry out an agenda driven by creative politics, poet and poetry venues face many challenges. By the <italic>politics of creativity</italic>, I refer to the ways in which larger social structures are arranged so as to discourage creative artistic pursuits. In this way, artistic creativity—traditionally conceived of as an individualistic and perhaps exceptional human trait—has a politics associated with it in that it is a field of social struggle, where scarce resources, various forms of capital, and power are at stake. Many (but not all) of the poets in my study are “amateur” poets attempting to transition to living off their poetry, or at least supplementing their income through poetry. Securing adequately compensated—or compensated at all!—poetry-related work is an ongoing struggle for these poets; this includes adequate compensation for performing in shows, facilitating poetry workshops in schools or the community, and coaching youth poetry teams, among others. As such, their art serves as a form of un- or under-paid labor that is monetarily devalued, thus sharing characteristics with other forms of exploited, second shift labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160597612451240">Hochschild [1989] 2003</xref>). Given spoken word performance poetry’s location within the structure of the larger art world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597612451240">Becker 1982</xref>), poets lack access to various credentialing mechanisms (e.g., there is no academic degree or specialization available for spoken word poetry) and other professional art networks (such as publishing houses or a philanthropic audience) that could help support their artistic/political work. Although venues understand themselves to serve similar functions as other free spaces, many poetry venues face continuous financial challenges staying open, as well as staffing difficulties. The demand for good available poetry venues exceeds the supply, and poets consistently face difficulty trying to locate and maintain relationships with venues for their poetry events.</p>
<p>Yet, the poetry community is not helpless in face of these social structural constraints, and they use creative politics to respond and circumvent these constraints. Poets have managed to support their craft and, by extension their politics, by reconfiguring financial support networks and employing do-it-yourself (DIY) techniques—made accessible through democratic digital technologies—to cultivate a vibrant and politically charged artistic public sphere. For example, they self-publish their books and rely heavily on free social media to advertise. They create their own opportunities to institutionalize, legitimize, and monetize the art form and profession through roles such as the “teaching artist,” participating in slam competitions, and continuously establishing new DIY income-generating activities (e.g., a rotating monthly writing circle provides compensation for hosts). Such examples from my fieldwork demonstrate how an art-centered analysis offers a redefinition of political action and social activism, and at the same time illustrates the challenges to such alternative forms of political participation and social change.</p>

<p>As an umbrella term, I follow Richard Bauman’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451240">2011</xref>) use of the phrase “spoken word,” referring to those sets of spoken word practices Bauman describes as “verbal art forms of oratory, theater, literature” (p. 6). He highlights verbal art forms such as chants, song, and oral poetry (e.g., folktales, legends, folksongs, and epics) in his discussion of spoken word “objects.” Here, Bauman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451240">2011</xref>) uses the term broadly and interchanges it with “oral expression” and “oral tradition.” The term has also, however, become shorthand for contemporary performance poetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160597612451240">Eleveld 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160597612451240">2007</xref>; Olson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0160597612451240">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>).

<p>Traditionally, spoken word audiences have been a live community of listening spectators. The rising proliferation of YouTube and other digital technologies raises interesting new questions around audience and spoken word. For example, how have new recording technologies of voice and video afforded spoken word objects an ability to travel in a way that only written objects could circulate in the past? Do these new distribution patterns aid in or coopt the ability for spoken word art forms to carry subversive knowledges or political practices?

<p>The case for a tightly interconnected conception of culture, knowledge, and politics has already been made, albeit somewhat indirectly. Scholars have argued that knowledge should be studied and conceived of as culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0160597612451240">McCarthy 1996</xref>; Swidler and Arditi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0160597612451240">1994</xref>) and that knowledge is synonymous with power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160597612451240">Foucault 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0160597612451240">Lyotard [1979] 1984</xref>) and, by extension, politics. Others have shown how the cultural becomes political (Büyükokutan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597612451240">2011</xref>), and specifically how art (i.e., a type of cultural object) is a means through which the political gets shaped (Negash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0160597612451240">2004</xref>). Political scholars have demonstrated how cultural processes such as framing, emotions, and storytelling inform political action (Benford and Snow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597612451240">2000</xref>; Goodwin and Jasper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160597612451240">2004</xref>; Polletta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0160597612451240">2009</xref>), and political claims making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0160597612451240">Tilly and Tarrow 2007</xref>).

<p>Black American spoken word culture can be traced to various African oral traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451240">Asante 1998</xref>); some examples of African oral forms include storytelling by West African griots, the <italic>finn duri</italic>—literally, “fertility of long ago”—of the Gabra people in East Africa (and Oromo culture more generally; Kassam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0160597612451240">1986</xref>), and the Basotho of Southern Africa (Lesotho; Coplan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160597612451240">1993</xref>). While oral traditions run deep throughout various cultures across the African continent and Diaspora, due to transatlantic slave trade patterns from Africa to the United States between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, the oral practices among West African cultures most likely informed the oral practices of slave communities in the United States.</p>

<p>Slam poetry is competitive performance poetry carried out in front of a live audience. During a slam, poets recite originally-authored, 3-min poems, after which audience members immediately judge the poems by assigning points to each artist’s performance. The highest-scoring poet wins the slam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160597612451240">Glazner 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Of the community members I interviewed, 10 are women and 13 are men. Thirteen identify as black, seven as white, one as Arab and white, one as South Asian, and one as Filipino American. Seven identify as queer, gay, lesbian, or bi; one has a physical disability and two others work with students with special needs. Although I argue that contemporary spoken word poetry is rooted in a larger tradition of black American verbal art, the modern-day form is practiced by a racially diverse community of artists. Nonetheless, socially marginalized groups, including African Americans, continue to gravitate toward the art form as a means of expression, and one’s marginalized status—and the various injustices that ensue from these power arrangements—frequently serves as the topic of performance poetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0160597612451240">Somers-Willett 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Max Weber uses <italic>ideal types</italic> as a conceptual tool to analyze empirical conditions. Here, “ideal” does not refer to a utopian type, but rather to an <italic>idea</italic>-construct that emphasizes the most common features of a given phenomenon in an effort to render the chaos of social reality into a systematic and examinable order. While Weber employs a comparative method in order to decipher patterns of historical change, I use the concept as a way to talk about a variety of verbal art forms in the abstract, while still recognizing the great diversity of styles and types within each genre.</p>

<p>These elements diverge from the four cultural elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160597612451240">Griswold (2008</xref>) identifies in her concept of the cultural diamond: cultural object, producers, receivers, and the social world. The cultural diamond is a device aimed to help understand how any cultural object relates to the social world. While I draw upon Griswold’s idea of the cultural object as a way to conceptualize verbal art performances, in the context of spoken word Griswold’s cultural diamond becomes fuzzy as producers and receivers coincide. That is, receivers (the audience) are also participating producers in creating the art form, and producers (the performing artists) are also receivers (shaping their art form in response to the reaction they receive from the audience). I also draw attention to cultural processes in my typology and, while processes are not absent from Griswold’s model, they are given a different emphasis in that they show relationships between elements (objects, producers, receivers, and the social world) rather than function as an element in of themselves.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0160597612451240">Lord (1960</xref>) critiques multiple authorship theory in the context of all those who participated in singing Homer’s texts, suggesting that such a theory implies a concrete original text, which is not the case “in the flux of oral tradition” (p. 152). For my purposes, I use the term multiple authors to connote community-based or collaborative texts, and I make no claims about an original fixed text.</p>

<p>My understanding of social complexity refers to levels of social interaction associated with the cultural object, audience, and process, whereby each social phenomenon can be understood as being roughly located at the micro-, meso-, and macro level, respectively. This is an imperfect theoretical framework for understanding these phenomena, but is useful nonetheless in that it offers a way to conceptualize the relationships among these discrete phenomena.</p>
