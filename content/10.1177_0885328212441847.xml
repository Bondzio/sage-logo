<p>In present study, the chitosan/starch/β-glycerol phosphate hydrogel was investigated as an effective carrier for chondrocytes and delivery of transforming growth factor-β1. In vitro study indicated that transforming growth factor-β1 was released sustainably for 14 days with its biological activity to stimulate chondrocyte functions, as indicated by the strong expression of type II collagen protein. Subcutaneous implantation to rats revealed the strong expressions of type II collagen and aggrecan messenger ribonucleic acids, and also type II collagen protein was observed in the hydrogel in combination with transforming growth factor-β1 within 2 weeks. Our collective results showed the potential of chitosan/starch/β-glycerol phosphate hydrogel for effective delivery of chondrocytes and transforming growth factor-β1, and preserve chondrocytes’ phenotype and functions in vitro.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328212441847" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Healthy articular cartilage is a semi-solid soft connective tissue composed of chondrocytes embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM). Such ECM molecules, glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen, are secreted by chondrocytes to maintain the mechanical properties of the cartilage tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212441847">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212441847">2</xref></sup> The articular cartilage has no blood vessels, lymphatic and nerve tissue. For this reason, natural healing of articular cartilage defects generally does not occur.</p>
<p>Currently, the development in therapeutic strategies for cartilage repair has focused on the promising technology as the in situ-forming system to regenerate articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212441847">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212441847">3</xref></sup> A promising in situ-forming technology is a thermosensitive hydrogel that forms a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold. The defective area is infiltrated with the hydrogel, while in the liquid state at room temperature. As it warms up to physiological temperature, it becomes a gel. Nevertheless, it is important that once inserted, the gelling is rapid to prevent liquid loss. A key feature to the success of this approach is that chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212441847">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212441847">5</xref></sup> and the necessary growth factors can be incorporated into the liquid solution prior to injection. This ensures that the encapsulated cells are able to proliferate and secrete the required cartilage ECMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212441847">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212441847">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily is a multifunctional polypeptide growth factor and has multiple isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3). TGF-β1, in particular, plays an important role in chondrogenic differentiation. It can promote the production of cartilage ECM including aggrecan and type II collagen produced by chondrocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212441847">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212441847">9</xref></sup> Added to hydrogel system, TGF-β1 can prevent the degradation of cartilage ECM by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and activating tissue inhibitors of MMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212441847">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previously, we reported that chondrocyte phenotype and functions could be retained after encapsulation in the chitosan/starch/β-glycerol phosphate (C/S/β-GP) hydrogel in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212441847">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it is important to demonstrate that our C/S/β-GP hydrogel can perform in situ without producing adverse reactions. Furthermore, successful cartilage engineering in the clinic necessitates vigorous chondrocyte growth for which suitable growth factors (e.g. TGF-β1) are needed. Thus, the present study aimed to (a) test the C/S/β-GP hydrogel in subdermal animal implants and (b) show that growth factor can be incorporated into the gel and stimulate chondrocyte function and proliferation. We show that the implants were well tolerated, and the chondrocytes multiplied and secreted ECMs, aggrecan and type II collagen.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328212441847"><title>Isolation and expansion of rat chondrocytes</title>
<p>Chondrocytes were isolated from knee joint articular cartilages of freshly sacrificed Sprague-Dawley rats (5–6 weeks) which were obtained from National Laboratory Animal Centre (Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand). Chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage tissues by digesting for 30 min at 37℃ in 0.25% trypsin. The digested cartilage was centrifuged at 1500 r/min for 5 min, resuspended in DMEM containing 0.2% weight by volume (w/v) type II collagenase and incubated for 2 h at 37℃. The dispersed cells were recentrifuged at 1500 r/min for 5 min and washed twice in serum-free medium to remove the residual collagenase. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37℃ in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The medium was changed every 3 days after seeding until enough cells were obtained (but not exceeding three passages).</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328212441847"><title>Preparation of C/S/β-GP solution containing chondrocytes and TGF-β1</title>
<p>The hydrogel system was prepared as previously discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212441847">11</xref></sup> Chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving crab chitosan as 1.70% w/v in 0.1 M HCl. For a pregelatinized corn starch solution, starch was dissolved as 1.70% w/v in deionized water, and the resultant starch suspension was then heated until gelatinization. The cross-linking agent, β-GP, was prepared as 60% w/v solution in distilled water. Chitosan and starch solutions were autoclaved at 121℃ for 20 min, and β-GP solution was sterilized through a 0.20 µm filter. After solution preparation, corn starch solution was added to chitosan solution (weight ratio of chitosan to corn starch, 4 to 1), and the total final concentration of the blended polymers was 1.53% w/v. The blended solution was constantly stirred at 600 r/min to obtain homogeneous solution, and then TGF-β1 was added to the chitosan/starch (C/S) solution. The final concentration of TGF-β1 obtained from our preliminary study was 25 ng/ml. The sterilized β-GP solution was then added drop-wise to obtain 6.0% w/v final concentration and constantly stirred for 10 min to obtain a clear and homogenous liquid solution. Chondrocytes (10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) were finally dispersed in C/S/β-GP solution containing TGF-β1.</p>

<p>The rheological property of the prepared C/S/β-GP was examined with an advanced rheometrics expansion system (Model ARES, Rheometric Scientific Inc., New Jersey, USA), as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212441847">11</xref></sup> Briefly, samples were covered with mineral oil to prevent water loss. The values of the strain amplitude were verified to ensure that all measurements were performed within the linear viscoelastic region. To determine the gelation temperature, oscillatory measurement was performed at 6.25 Hz. The temperature was increased at the rate of 1℃/min between 25 and 45℃, and the gel point was determined as the temperature at the crossover point of the elastic moduli, G′ and G″.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212441847">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>The possible interactions within hydrogel were investigated using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis (FT-IR spectrometer, Spectrum GX series, USA) with KBr pellet method. The solutions of crab chitosan, corn starch, the blending C/S were prepared and then lyophilized. The solutions of C/S/β-GP with and without TGF-β1 were prepared and then allowed to gel at 37℃ prior to lyophilization. The lyophilized powders were then mixed with KBr in proportion of sample:KBr as 1 : 10 weight by weight (w/w). The spectra were scanned over the wave number in range of 4000–400 cm<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<p>C/S/β-GP solution (500 µl) containing TGF-β1 was prepared, placed into 24-well plate and subsequently incubated at 37℃ to allow gel transformation to hydrogel. A total of 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin was added on top of the hydrogel surface. The samples were incubated at 37℃ in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. These are the same conditions used in experiments with cells. The medium was drawn off at times 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2, 24, 72, 168, 240 and 336 h and each time fresh medium reapplied. These were performed with triplicate hydrogels. The released TGF-β1 was determined using an ELISA kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the release of TGF-β1 was expressed as the cumulative release.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0885328212441847"><title>Immunofluorescence analysis of type II collagen expression in vitro</title>
<p>To verify that the released TGF-β1 was able to stimulate chondrocyte function, we measured the expression of type II collagen, a marker for these cells. The same conditions were used as described in the section <italic>Release of TGF-β1 from C/S/β-GP hydrogel</italic> above, but the C/S/β-GP/TGF-β1 hydrogel also encapsulated chondrocytes. After 14 and 28 days of incubation, the hydrogel was removed from its well and its upper and lower surfaces stroked across a glass microscope slide to deposit hydrogel and chondrocytes. The slides were allowed to dry and then lightly coated with ice-cold methanol to fix the cells/hydrogel for 15–20 min in refrigerator. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% volume by volume (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 for 5 min. The samples were blocked with 3% weight by volume (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min and then incubated with mouse monoclonal to type II collagen (1 : 250 [v/v]) at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The samples were washed with PBS for four times. Bindings were then visualized by incubating with secondary antibodies (FITC-conjugated goat polyclonal to mouse IgG, 1 : 250 [v/v] in PBS) at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. After washing with PBS for four times, the samples were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI) diluted in PBS at a ratio of 1 : 200 (v/v) and again incubated for 10 min. Finally, the samples were washed with PBS for four times before they were photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Ckx40, Olympus America Inc., USA).</p>

Another one is the wide absorption band at 3436 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which was due to the stretching vibration of O–H overlapping N–H stretching. For chitosan blended with corn starch, the spectrum was identical with that of chitosan alone. After cross-linking with β-GP, the characteristic absorption band for chitosan was shifted from 3436 to 3421 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which also became wider suggesting an increased hydrogen bonding.

<p>The strong expression of type II collagen in the hydrogel after 14 and 28 days of culture suggests the sufficient dose of TGF-β1 given and also the biologically active TGF-β1 release.

<sec id="sec26-0885328212441847"><title>Morphology of hydrogel implants</title>
<p>Our thermosensitive C/S/β-GP solution was determined by its ability to preserve chondrocyte viability and phenotype after injection and then solidification. Moreover, the effective delivery and release of TGF-β1 to help in chondrogenesis in the in situ-forming hydrogel were determined by the expressions of gene and protein markers of chondrocytes. When the appropriate liquid gel was injected subcutaneously, it formed a solid gel within 5–10 min and remained localized at the injected site, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328212441847">Figure 6(a)</xref>. Histology of implanted subcutaneous tissue in all samples exhibited no abnormalities in the epidermis, dermis or hypodermis. However, the fibrous capsules indicated by purple staining surrounding the implanted hydrogels were observed but neither these were found within the hydrogel core. This finding was corresponded with the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212441847">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328212441847">28</xref></sup> In any case, such fibrous capsules would be unlikely when the hydrogel is implanted within avascular cartilage.

<p>The results of RT-PCR analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212441847">Figure 7</xref>. Expression of type II collagen mRNA of the HCT sample was clearly visible at Week 4 and was still present at Week 6, whereas in the other samples it was undetectable.

<p>Next, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate type II collagen protein secreted by chondrocytes encapsulated within the implanted hydrogel. Immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328212441847">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that type II collagen protein (brown color) was being produced in the HCT sample by Week 2 and this progressively increased during Weeks 4 and 6. For HC, there was faint traces of type II collagen for Week 2, but this was not increased during subsequent weeks. The sample H had blue-stained hydrogel.

<p>The result of immunofluorescence staining correlated with immunohistochemistry staining reactions. Most of the type II collagen (green fluorescence) in sample HCT was deposited around the chondrocytes (seen as orange admixing with red propidium iodide reaction), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212441847">Figure 9</xref>. Deposition of type II collagen increased between Weeks 2 and 6. Type II collagen was also found in sample HC between 2 and 6 weeks but less than that in the HCT sample. Moreover, it was noticed that the number of chondrocytes in sample HC was lower than those in sample HCT. As a negative control, type II collagen could not be found in any of the H samples. The hydrogel network in this sample were loose in Week 6 compared with that in Week 2 suggesting degradation of the hydrogel in vivo.

<p>Thus, TGF-β1 encapsulated in hydrogel exhibited an ability to stimulate type II collagen production, a finding which accords with other studies on TGF-β1 where cultured chondrocytes increased type II collagen production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328212441847">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328212441847">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies reported that cell proliferation was down-regulated when cultured in chitosan-based systems in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328212441847">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328212441847">31</xref></sup> They considered that the chitosan posed a barrier to growth factor access to the cells. However, since the growth factor is encapsulated along with the cells in the C/S/β-GP hydrogel, the continued supply of TGF-β1 is ensured.</p>
<p>Our observations imply that the C/S/β-GP hydrogel system could act as an effective carrier for TGF-β1, while also supporting chondrocyte function and chondrogenesis.</p>

<sec id="sec29-0885328212441847" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The collective results demonstrate that our C/S/β-GP hydrogel is a capable matrix to support and encourage chondrocyte function and preserve TGF-β1 supply, while chondrocyte phenotype is able to elaborate a cartilage ECM. For cartilage tissue engineering, this process may be further enhanced by additional growth factors thus mimicking native cartilage. These may be more generic growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors and fibroblast growth factors.</p>
