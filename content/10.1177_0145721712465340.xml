<p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends routine A1C as a screening test for diabetes, and it is the most widely accepted outcome measure for the evaluation of glycemic control in patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref></sup> The A1C test, also called glycosylated hemoglobin, measures the average level of blood glucose over a period of 3 months. This test is considered to be the most reliable measure of long-term metabolic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712465340">2</xref></sup> As a gold standard measure of diabetes control, A1C provides important feedback to providers and patients. Tight glycemic control, which is measured by serum hemoglobin A1C levels, has been demonstrated to reduce both microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465340">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712465340"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712465340"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712465340"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712465340">7</xref></sup> The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) supports the importance of improved glycemic control in reducing the risk and progression of complications of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465340">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ADA specifically recommends A1C testing at least 2 times a year for patients who meet the treatment goals and have controlled glycemic index, and quarterly for patients not at goal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref></sup> The availability of A1C testing during a clinical visit is associated with improved glycemic control, and point-of-care (POC) A1C testing offers great benefit to patients with diabetes, especially those who have compliance problems in attending follow-up visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712465340">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712465340">9</xref></sup> The purpose of the research was to investigate the impact of point-of-care A1C testing among individuals with type 2 diabetes in a primary care setting.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721712465340">
<title>Point-of-Care A1C Test</title>
<p>For most people with diabetes, routine glycemic monitoring using of A1C levels by providers during office visits is not performed in clinical practice according to the ADA guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712465340">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref></sup> Previous research studied the determinants of glycemic status monitoring during primary care office visits among black and white adult Medicaid beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes using a retrospective cohort study design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref></sup> The study found that 80.4% of the patients did not have an A1C test in the first year of disease diagnosis, and only 7.5% of the study population had 2 or more A1C measurements in a 1-year period, as recommended by the ADA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref></sup> When A1C results are reviewed by providers, it is typically several days after the blood sample is collected. Communications with the patients and subsequent interventions are therefore often delayed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712465340">6</xref></sup> In response to these issues, POC A1C testing has been developed to check the A1C when the patient presents for care in the office.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465340">11</xref></sup> Point-of-care A1C helps the provider make clinical decisions while the patient is being evaluated by the provider.</p>
<p>The concept of point-of-care has existed for decades. Point-of-care A1C provides immediate feedback of A1C results during the clinical encounter between a provider and a patient at the site of patient care. This test can be used to intensify treatment, inform clinical decisions, and subsequently improve glycemic control while the patient is being evaluated by the provider. Point-of-care A1C results can enhance diabetes care by increasing education and ensuring appropriate changes to therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465340">11</xref></sup> Point-of-care A1C values have been associated with a significant reduction in A1C in less than 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712465340">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712465340">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712465340"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712465340">14</xref></sup> In a large, retrospective, cross-sectional study aimed at determining the effect of point-of-care on maintenance of glycemic control as measured by A1C, researchers found that the availability of POC A1C measures at the visit influenced the A1C in not only the short-term (&lt; 1.5 y), but also in the longer term (currently 3.5 y).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465340">11</xref></sup> The findings of an historical cohort study to determine the effects of improved glycemic control on health care cost and use showed that if patients with high A1C values can decrease their A1C value and keep it low for 2 years, their subsequent cost increase will be less by the fourth year than for those who have a sustained high A1C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712465340">15</xref></sup> High A1C values indicate poor glycemic control and are associated with higher rates of clinical complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712465340">16</xref></sup> Interventions targeting patients with higher A1C values may be more effective at decreasing diabetes complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712465340">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The accuracy of POC A1C has been documented in the literature. In a cross-sectional study comparing the POC and laboratory A1C, it was found that the POC A1C method yielded a mean measurement of 7.3%, which was almost equivalent to the mean A1C of 7.53% produced with all combined standard laboratory analyses. Point-of-care A1C test sensitivity was 81.8%, and specificity was 93.3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712465340">17</xref></sup> Other investigators used a descriptive correlation study to compare a POC A1C monitor with standardized laboratory testing in 23 patients who had type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712465340">18</xref></sup> They found a good correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.7583) between the result of POC A1C and standardized laboratory testing. They also found the A1C values were within a range of 6%-8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712465340">18</xref></sup> The POC A1C test is priced at approximately $25 and $10 per test for retail and bulk tests, whereas the standardized laboratory test ranges from $40-$80.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712465340">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Provider Adherence to ADA Standards of Care</title>
<p>Optimal quality of care for patients with diabetes hinges on health care provider adherence to the ADA evidence-based practice guidelines, in order to prevent end organ damage and other complications including microvascular and macrovascular complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712465340">19</xref></sup> In the United States, slightly more than half of all adults with diabetes receive the recommended care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712465340">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712465340">21</xref></sup> In a study to determine the adherence to ADA standards of care by rural health care providers, a retrospective chart review found that rural health care practitioners were not adequately following the ADA standards for comprehensive management of patients with diabetes and that patients did not have optimal control of their diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712465340">19</xref></sup> In another study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref></sup> it was found that routine monitoring of glycemic status during regularly scheduled physician office visits was not performed according to the recommended guidelines for most people with diabetes. In this study, 80.4% of the patients were found to have had no A1C testing in the first year of disease diagnosis, whereas only 7.5% of the study population had 2 or more A1C measurements in a 1-year period, as recommended by the ADA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref></sup> A comparative descriptive study was used to determine the impact of a program to improve adherence to diabetes guidelines by primary care physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712465340">22</xref></sup> Those investigators found that less than 5% of the patients with diabetes receive care that conforms to the ADA guidelines according to the analysis done by the United States Centers for Disease Control.</p>

<title>Theoretical/Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>As a chronic disease, diabetes requires ongoing health care in order to reduce the risk of acute and long-term complications, reduce hospitalization, decrease associated costs, and improve the patientâs quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712465340">23</xref></sup> The theoretical framework chosen for this study was the Chronic Care Model (CCM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712465340">Figure 1</xref>). This model is based on a collaborative approach that aims to create practical interactions between an informed patient and a proactive, prepared clinical team in order to improve outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712465340">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712465340"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712465340">26</xref></sup> The underlying premise of the CCM is that quality diabetes care is enhanced by the providers as well as practice systems that include links to community resources, patient self-management support, delivery system redesign, decision support, clinical information systems, leadership, and health care system organization, all working together to optimize patientâprovider interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712465340">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712465340"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712465340">26</xref></sup> Research has shown that implementation of the CCM has resulted in improvements in patient care and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712465340">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712465340">27</xref></sup> Two out of 6 core elements of the CCM, decision support and delivery system redesign, were addressed in this study. Incorporation of POC A1C testing represents the redesign of 1 system of community-based care, as well as an opportunity for providers in the selected system to access data that supports clinical decision making. Collaborating with health care providers and engaging in shared clinical decision making are associated with better self-care behaviors and improved disease outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712465340">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712465340"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712465340">30</xref></sup></p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>This study was approved by both the clinical and educational Institutional Review Boards. Using a quasi-experimental, pretest and posttest design, data from patientsâ charts matched for age, sex, race, BMI, insurance status, and the number of comorbidities were reviewed and compared. The pretest and posttest design allows for inferences to be made on the impact of the intervention by looking at the difference in the pretest and posttest results.</p>

<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Data were obtained from an audit of charts by the principal investigator; charts of patients with type 2 diabetes were selected through a process of scientific random sampling at 6 and 3 months before the implementation of the POC A1C testing, and again at 3 and 6 months post-implementation of the POC A1C testing. Numbers were assigned to the patients who met the study criteria and were seen in the clinic at the specified times pre- and post-implementation of the POC A1C testing. A table of random numbers was then used to select the charts for review. Based on a G Power analysis, a total sample size of 164 was necessary to complete the <italic>t</italic> test at 6 months and 3 months pre-intervention, and 3 months and 6 months post-intervention using an effect size of 0.4, <italic>P</italic> value of .05, and a power of 0.80.

Medical records of 164 patients with diabetes met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Subjects ranged in age from 25-94 years. The mean age was 54.53 years. In total, 95 (58%) women and 69 (42%) men were involved in the study. For ethnicity/race, 63 (38.4%) were Caucasian, 31 (18.9%) were black, 34 (20.7%) were Hispanic, and 36 (22%) were other. The mean BMI was 34.39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. For the number of comorbidities, 32 (19.5%) of the patients had fewer than 3 comorbidities, and 132 (80.5%) had more than 3 comorbidities. One hundred forty-five (88.4%) of the patients had insurance, and 19 (11.6%) did not have insurance. One hundred twenty-eight (78%) had documented A1C, and 36 (22%) did not have documented A1C in the past 6 months. In the 6 months pre-POC A1C testing, a total of 28 (68.3%) had documented A1C and 13 (31.7%) did not. For the 3-month pre-POC A1C testing, 27 (65.9%) had a documented A1C and 14 (34.1%) did not. In the 3 months post-POC A1C testing, 34 (82.9%) had documented A1C and 7 (17.1%) did not. Finally, for the 6 months post-POC A1C testing, a total of 39 (95.1%) had a documented A1C and 2 (4.9%) did not. The total A1C mean was 7.8%, with 8.1% for 6 months pre-, 7.6 % for 3 months pre-, 7.4% for 3 months post-, and 7.7% for 6 months post-POC A1C testing. A total of 55 (33.54%) did not need any change in treatment because they had an A1C of less than 7%; 66 (40.24%) of the patients with A1C greater than 7% did not have any change in treatment, and 43 (26.22%) of the patients had a change in treatment.</p>

<p>In response to research question 1 (âIs there a significant difference in the number of patients with documented A1C levels at the time of a clinic visit in the past 6 months pre- versus post-implementation of POC A1C testing?â), there was a greater number of patients with documented A1C levels at the time of their office visit (n = 39) 6 months post-implementation of POC A1C testing compared to patients with documented A1C levels (n = 27) 3 months pre-implementation of POC A1C testing (Ï<sup>2</sup> = 0.001; df = 1; <italic>P</italic> = .05). There was also a greater number of patients with documented A1C levels at the time of their clinic visit (n = 39) 6 months post-implementation of A1C testing compared to the patients with documented A1C levels (n = 28) 6 months pre- implementation (Ï<sup>2</sup> = 0.002; df = 1; <italic>P</italic> = .05). For the second research question pertaining to the actual number of A1C levels pre- versus post- implementation of POC A1C testing, there was a decrease in mean A1C value 6 months post-implementation (7.7%) compared to mean A1C 6 months pre-implementation (8.1%; t = -2.809; <italic>P</italic> = .008). Finally, for the third research question focused on the documented treatment changes made by providers pre- versus post-implementation of POC A1C testing, there were 18 patients who did not meet criteria for treatment change, 10 patients who did not require treatment change, and 13 who had treatment changes in the 6 months post-implementation compared to 6 months pre-implementation, during which 9 patients did not meet criteria for treatment change (Ï<sup>2</sup> = 0.041; df = 1; <italic>P</italic> = .05) .</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate an increase in A1C monitoring after the implementation of POC A1C testing. The significant difference between documented A1C pre- versus post-implementation supports the need for POC A1C testing. Prior to the POC A1C testing, providers were compliant with documenting A1C at 68.3% and 65.9% at 6 months and 3 months pre-implementation, but the percentages increased to 82.9% and 95% at 3 months and 6 months post-implementation. The 3- and 6-month post-A1C documentation at 82.9% and 95% may be compared to 85% of documented A1C in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712465340">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Health care providers must follow the ADA guidelines for diabetes management in order to prevent both microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with diabetes (ADA, 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref></sup>). In this study, provider adherence with the clinical guidelines increased with POC A1C testing. The mean A1C for 6-month pre-implementation was 8.1%, the 3-month pre-implementation was 7.6%, the 3-month post-implementation was 7.4%, and the 6-month post-implementation mean was 7.7%. The mean A1C improved from 8.1% at 6 months pre-implementation to 7.7% at 6 months post-implementation, and from 7.6% at 3 months pre-implementation to 7.4% at 3 months post-implementation. This result could be attributed to novelty effect associated with new intervention and clinical decisions made by providers based on the A1C. This result is in correlation with those of other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712465340">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465340">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712465340">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712465340"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712465340">14</xref></sup> which showed that POC A1C was associated with a significant reduction in A1C results. However, in this study there was a slight increase instead of decrease in the mean A1C from 7.4 to 7.7 from 3 months post-implementation to 6 months post-implementation. A good explanation of this increase is that A1C takes a couple of months to be controlled. There was a difference in the treatment changes, in both the pre- and post-implementation. In total, 55 (33.54%) patients did not require any treatment change because their A1C was less than 7%; 66 (40.24%) whose A1C were greater than 7% did not receive any treatment change, and 43 (26.22%) received treatment change. The ADA-recommended target A1C is less than 7%. Clinical intervention is recommended for A1C greater than 8% and is to be considered for A1C between 7% and 8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712465340">6</xref></sup> Clinical decisions regarding A1C result are an important factor in obtaining controlled glycemic effect. Although the mean A1C is improving, many patients are still not at an optimal level; intensification of diabetes management can achieve this goal. A major limitation of this study was not following the same patients throughout the months at 3 and 6 months pre-implementation and at 3 and 6 months post-implementation. Another limitation is that A1C changes may take longer to be seen than the study period allowed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The incidence of diabetes is projected by the Centers for Disease Control to increase if the current trends continue. The ADA recommends A1C testing for the evaluation of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, some providers are not adhering to the guidelines recommended by the ADA. Point-of-care testing represents an opportunity for improved care of people with diabetes. The significance of this improvement will become more critical as the number of people with diabetes continues to increase.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Monitoring of glycemic index is very important in managing diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465340">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465340">10</xref></sup> This monitoring will provide information for the providers and patients in the evaluation of the effectiveness of diabetes treatment. Lack of adherence to ADA-recommended standards of care will pose a great problem to patients with diabetes. Point-of-care A1C will provide immediate feedback of A1C results during clinical encounters between a provider and a patient, and this test can be used to intensify treatment, inform clinical decisions, and subsequently increase glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712465340">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712465340">29</xref></sup> Tight glycemic control and well-coordinated diabetes management will help to prevent complications from diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465340">11</xref></sup></p>
