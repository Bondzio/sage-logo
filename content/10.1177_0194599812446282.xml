<abstract>
<p>Age-related dysfunction of the central auditory system (central presbycusis) is common but rarely looked for by those who provide aural rehabilitation. Patients who complain of difficulty hearing in noise—the key symptom of central presbycusis—are generally disadvantaged with conventional rehabilitation. This symptom should be documented with commercially available speech-in-noise tests, which use materials that are uncomplicated to administer. Those patients who perform poorly on such tests should have a customized rehabilitation program aimed at optimizing their remaining communication abilities. Otolaryngologists who provide auditory rehabilitation may wish to consider expanding their practices to meet the communication needs of older patients with central presbycusis. Central presbycusis is an emerging area for basic and clinical research in auditory neurotology, particularly in the relation of cognitive dysfunction to impaired auditory processing.</p>

<body>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is universally acknowledged as the most common type of hearing loss. It is widely considered to represent the combined effects on the auditory system of aging superimposed on the effects of exposure to noise and other ototoxins and age-related diseases. Thus, older patients with complaints of difficulty in hearing may present with a variety of audiometric threshold configurations, making cell-specific diagnosis difficult. Conventional practice lumps these effects in the wastebasket category of sensorineural hearing loss, which reflects the limitation of conventional diagnostic methods. With the potential for regeneration of cochlear cells looming on the horizon, greater diagnostic precision will be necessary. Surely we should be able to know with precision, for example, that the hair cells are or are not affected (sensory), as well as the spiral ganglion cells of the eighth nerve and ascending pathways (neural). This applies to the status of the auditory portions of the central nervous system, which will undoubtedly affect candidacy for regeneration therapy in the future as well as rehabilitation measures in the present.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812446282">
<title>Central Auditory Dysfunction</title>
<p>Although it is common knowledge that certain types of hearing disorders may be due to brain dysfunction (central auditory dysfunction [CAD]), far less is known about this possibility than is known about peripheral (ie, cochlear) disorders. Models of CAD include auditory neuropathy of the eighth cranial nerve, retrocochlear lesions (such as vestibular schwannoma), and central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Central presbycusis is being used as a label for the age-related auditory processing disorder underlying poor speech understanding in noise, competing speech, or distorted speech (eg, compressed speech).</p>
<p>What are we to make of this the common clinical sign of central presbycusis: “I have difficulty understanding speech when it is noisy (cocktail party effect) but I do all right in quiet rooms”? In the past, it has been largely ignored on the assumption that most of the problem is peripheral (ie, cochlear) with, perhaps, some loss of spiral ganglion cells. Recent evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812446282">1</xref></sup> is not compatible with that assumption, so we need to look beyond our existing evaluative paradigms to find a new approach for accurate diagnosis and a rational therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812446282">
<title>Central Auditory Testing</title>
<p>Understanding speech obviously first requires adequate cochlear function and intact auditory pathways to and including the primary auditory cortex (ie, speech perception). But understanding speech requires more than perception: a complex array of brain functions are involved that may be considered anatomically as involving the associative cortical areas of the brain and physiologically as executive functioning, which includes short-term memory, attention, inhibition, and decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812446282">2</xref></sup> These areas and functions obviously call upon linguistic capabilities as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812446282">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A relatively simple, established method to evaluate the presence and extent of central presbycusis involves speech-in-noise testing; examples are the Dichotic Sentence Identification (DSI) test, where bilateral competing speech inputs are involved, or the Synthetic Sentence Identification (SSI) test with the Ipsilateral Competing Message (ICM) test, where unilateral competing speech constructs are introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812446282">4</xref></sup> Three criteria must be met. First, adequate peripheral auditory function must be present, such as a word recognition score in quiet of 70% or better. Second, the patient must have adequate vision to see the list of sentences to select the one heard. Third, the procedures are first administered in a “training” mode with the signal 10 dB louder than the message to ensure the patient understands the method. The actual tests are done at a 0-dB message-to-competition ratio; correct selection of 8 of the 10 presentations is considered normal.</p>
<p>It has been found that people with early Alzheimer’s disease—who usually have decreased executive functioning—fail these tests at the 80% correct level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812446282">5</xref></sup> Even more revealing are the observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812446282">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812446282">7</xref></sup> that people who do very poorly (&lt;50% correct) on the SSI-ICM or DSI have a 7- to 12-fold increase in risk of receiving an Alzheimer’s diagnosis in the subsequent 3 to 10 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812446282">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>How should we apply these observations to clinical practice? Two considerations come to mind. First, we could tailor auditory rehabilitation differently for people with CAPD. Chmiel and Jerger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812446282">8</xref></sup> showed that people with CAPD may perform better with a single hearing aid in the better ear than with binaural aids. Second, new, computer-based training programs may assist seniors with CAPD, but these programs are just becoming available, and their long-term success is yet to be determined. It goes without saying, then, that if we are to tailor rehabilitation to the patient’s diagnosis, we must first make the diagnosis!</p>
<p>I believe we are obliged by the mandates of modern patient care to apply central auditory testing to the evaluation of any older patient who complains of difficulty understanding speech in noise. A straightforward step to take is to add a query line to the intake questionnaire, followed by speech-in-noise testing for those who indicate they have this problem. These are reimbursable procedures that should be incorporated into the care of the presbycusic patient. In addition to a baseline study, follow-up testing would be indicated for patients whose complaints worsen. Referral to a neurologist or gerontologist might be considered for those with worsening symptoms and declining test results.</p>
<p>We are a long way from being able to consider CAPD testing as a screening method for Alzheimer’s dementia or pre-dementia. Standardization of equipment, procedural methodology, and outcome criteria have not been addressed. Nonetheless, in view of the intense global efforts to find a treatment for dementia, it is not outside the realm of possibility that very early detection of incipient dementia may one day assume importance. Until then, assessment of auditory brain function, which clearly deteriorates in Alzheimer’s dementia, is an emerging method for neurologic evaluation that provides a functional window into the auditory brain. It behooves the otolaryngologist and audiologist who work with patients with presbycusis to examine the existing evidence and consider what his or her role should be. This might stimulate interest in the nascent field of auditory neurotology. Given that understanding of speech involves cognitive function, neurotology training and continuing medical education programs should include elements of cognitive psychology as well as auditory neurology and hearing sciences. Such knowledge will put us in a position to make contributions to our understanding of these fascinating areas as well as providing missing elements in patient care.</p>
