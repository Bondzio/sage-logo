<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the utility of the attributes associated with information transfer events for classifying business clusters and understanding their workings. A field survey collected data from diverse actors in six business clusters located in Brazil, including: companies responsible for the development or final assembly of a product or service (central actors); the entity that represents the companies in each business cluster (the administrative body); and the entities seeking to transfer information to the central actors of localities (knowledge agents). We found that differences in the degree of productive complementarity on the part of central actors of business clusters were associated with variance in perceptions of information transfer events that took place in localities. To our knowledge this is the first research which analyzes and classifies business clusters based on dimensions of information transfer which are relevant to the practice of knowledge management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Michael Porter advanced the most widespread definition of a business cluster as a “geographic concentration of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266666912449829">Porter 1998</xref>:197). While this definition is widely accepted and used in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912449829">Maggioni and Riggi 2008</xref>) there is a growing recognition that there is considerable variation among entities that fit this broad definition. It is also the case that, unlike the overall definition of a ‘cluster’ around which considerable consensus exists, there is currently no dominant classification scheme or taxonomy of business clusters.</p>
<p>Business clusters are classified differently depending on the model of analysis used and the taxonomy suggested by the model. This lack of consensus arises from the fact that business clusters are composed of many elements and are characterized by diverse stakeholders with different interests and points of view that do not always overlap. This makes it challenging to develop useful schemes for classifying business clusters and understanding their workings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912449829">Benneworth and Henry 2004</xref>). The present paper seeks to enhance and supplement the study of business clusters by studying information exchange events across two types of cluster located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. We believe that the use of an emerging economy and a nontraditional research focus (information exchange) provide a fresh perspective that ultimately will enrich policy and theoretical debate as well as practical implications.</p>
<p>Bocquet and Mothe (2010:229) affirm that: “Despite the vast literature on knowledge management, little research has addressed the specificities of knowledge integration at the cluster level”. This gap between the studies of business clusters and knowledge management is a chief motivator and justification for the research reported in this study. By analyzing information exchange events as a means of capturing how members of business clusters are organized we attempt to follow the legacy of classic systems theorists like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912449829">Bertalanffy (2006</xref>) who saw information as a fundamental organizing mechanism.</p>
<sec id="section2-0266666912449829">
<title>Dominant approaches to business clusters analysis</title>
<p>Regardless of the analytical model used and how clusters are defined, the choice of any one taxonomy or typology carries the risk of oversimplifying the complexity of business clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912449829">Altenburg and Meyer-Stamer 1999</xref>). The four paragraphs below describe four taxonomies of business clusters that are based on different orienting themes: economies of agglomeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912449829">Marshall, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912449829">Garofoli 1991</xref>), technological maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912449829">Amin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912449829">Bell and Albu 1999</xref>), organizational integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912449829">Enright 1996</xref>) and degree of productive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912449829">Bianchi 1996</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912449829">Marshall (1890</xref>) is generally credited as the originator of the economic agglomeration approach, with subsequent enhancements by Garofoli (1991). As currently formulated, Garofoli’s classification includes the concepts of Local Production Systems and System Areas, and describes the rise in the complexity of the local system that may occur, with inter-firm and inter-institution synergies becoming widespread and effective. They propose three types of cluster: 1) First, Industrial Districts, which are self-organized systems characterized by a “deliberately” (depending on internal firm’s strategies of decentralization) and historically formed ample inter-firm division of labor connected with firm specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912449829">Whitaker 2003</xref>); 2) Second are Local Production Systems where “systemic” entrepreneurs can play a fundamental role in the creation of new scale and scope economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912449829">Bellandi 1996</xref>). Local production systems, through productive linkages and interaction among local actors, produce external economies (to local firms) and collective efficiency; 3) System Areas that are production systems in great scale (vertical nets), with space gathering of units and presence of entails strongly nested, that converge in the sense of great companies specialized in the assembly of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912449829">Bellandi 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on factors of spatial concentration and economic specialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912449829">Amin (1994</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912449829">Albu (1997</xref>) see technology as a central factor in the definition of business clusters. They proposed three types: 1.) Craft based, which uses traditional tools and techniques, 2.) High-tech clusters, which are made up of firms with high research and development expenses, vast reserves of risk capital and intensive use of technology and 3.) Large firm clusters, defined by the presence of large firms which receive regional institutional support, rely on intensive training and highly qualified and educated employees, lots of research and development, and highly developed communication infrastructure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912449829">Enright (1996</xref>) classifies business clusters based on the degree and type of interaction between their members. He proposes three types: 1.) The latent cluster, a group of firms that has unrealized potential for interaction, 2.) The potential cluster, which is a group of firms which share interaction but not sufficiently to take full advantage of the potential offered by geographic concentration, and 3.) The active cluster in which interdependence and interaction generate greater production volume that would be possible independently.</p>
<p>Bianchi’s (1996) classification scheme is based on the geographic scope of cluster membership: 1.) An embryonic cluster is made up of firms which are limited principally to the local market or which are subcontract suppliers to large firms from outside the local area. 2.) A consolidated cluster, which addresses a broader market and contains more specialized firms. The consolidated cluster has a greater degree of internal identity and is recognized as a cluster by external observers. 3.) The mature cluster is made up of firms that develop a capacity for successful innovation and superior valued added which permits them to compete in the international environment. In the mature cluster, intermediary governance structures play a vital role.</p>
<p>The diversity of characteristics of such entities – which are constantly changing open and dynamic systems, containing different possibilities of interaction among the actors, as well as diverse social, cultural and political dynamics – points up the limitations of any analytical and taxonomic model adopted in the sense that it cannot consider all of the multiple dimensions of analysis relevant to the context of these entities.</p>
<p>For this reason, theoreticians and practitioners ought to be aware of the range of classification options that exist and choose analytical models based on their utility for a given purpose. In this paper we propose a two category scheme based on information transfer which we suggest will be useful for those who are attempting to foment the knowledge development and storage capacity of a given business cluster. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912449829">Figure 1</xref> contrasts our research approach to the dominant models of business clusters in the literature. Our approach is distinct in that it uses Information Management as its focus of analysis.</p>

<p>The objective of this research is to identify the attributes associated with information transfer events occurring in the business cluster, and which are able to assist in its analysis and classification. This research does not aim at specifying and developing indicators for distinguishing and classifying business clusters but instead, it proposes and identifies attributes associated with the dynamics of information transfer events with the potential to create such indicators.</p>
<p>The main contribution of this research is to enhance thinking about types of business clusters and the kinds of indicators that are most useful for their analysis. Because public bureaucracies often make funding and other decisions based on quantitative indicators which attempt to describe attributes of geographic and administrative regions, enhanced typologies and indicators have the potential to yield both theoretical and policy benefits.</p>

<title>Conceptual issues</title>
<p>As mentioned above, there are many possible ways of conceptualizing business clusters, as well a variety of algorithms and variables which can be used in operationalizing classification schemes. For the comprehension of the proposed use of attributes associated with the dynamics of information transfer events for the classification of business clusters, some definitions are necessary, especially regarding business cluster categorizations.</p>
<p>Despite considerable diversity in the focus and definitions of the dominant approaches to business clusters described above, two dimensions which seem to underlie most if not all approaches are the productive chain and spatial differentiation. All of the dominant approaches use geographical space, usually operationalized as community or region, as establishing the boundaries of clusters. The production process, or “productive chain” also seems to figure in all approaches. The productive chain refers to a group of companies whose products and/or services converge around the creation and delivery of a product or service. Thus, the term productive chain covers the concept of supply chain, characterized by the group of suppliers that meet the needs of a company in the creation and development of its products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912449829">Shapiro 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912449829">Freeman and Audia (2006</xref>) define spatial differentiation as a small geographical distance between the constituent companies of the production chain, which may be a neighborhood, a city or region. We therefore chose to study communities in which regions were defined as a municipality, but the degree of integration in the productive chain varied.</p>
<p>A central term for differentiation and classification of a business cluster is the level of functional complementarity of the constituent companies. At the highest level of functional complementarity, each company in the chain is specialized in one of the parts or stages of the process, respectively, whether it be manufacture of goods or provision of services. Different organizations collaborate and integrate to deliver a product or service, which is the central goal of the productive chain. At the other extreme, with lower complementarity, each company conducts a more comprehensive set of activities in the chain; they are more independent from each other and less integrated in terms of the productive chain, cooperating only in a few areas of common interest.</p>
<p>In this research, two categories of business cluster are proposed, distinguished by the functional complementarity of the constituent companies. For localities where the companies act more independently and collaborate less but are close in terms of spatial location and act in the same productive chain, the term “non-integrated cluster” of enterprises has been adopted. For business clusters in which companies have a high level of functional complementarity between their products and services, we use the term “integrated cluster”. The central premise of this research is that within integrated clusters, there is more frequent exchange of information between firms belonging to the cluster (we call this “reticular information exchange”) while in nonintegrated clusters, information is more reserved (we call this “centripetal information exchange”).</p>
<p>The most prominent example of an integrated business cluster in Brazil is doubtless the São José dos Campos municipality in São Paulo state. The aerospace business cluster in São José dos Campos is the most prominent and sophisticated in Brazil at the moment. It is made up of highly interdependent firms which provide components to a few large and sophisticated manufacturers. It is responsible for a significant percentage of the country’s high tech production and exports. Because of the dynamic and competitive sector it serves, we expected that the dynamics of information exchange within the cluster would be distinct and might provide hints as to the direction of future cluster development in Brazil. We contrasted the São José dos Campos cluster to clusters in five other municipalities in the state which are much more typical of clusters in the country.</p>
<sec id="section4-0266666912449829">
<title>Actors involved in the dissemination of information</title>
<p>Prior research on clusters not only tends to overlook the dynamics of information exchange with members of clusters, it generally does not recognize that different actors within a cluster tend to occupy different roles with regards to information generation and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912449829">Bocquet and Mothe 2010</xref>). For the analysis used in this study, three groups of actors are of particular interest: central actor, knowledge agent and administrative body. To conceptualize these three types it is useful to recall the definition of business cluster as a: “geographic concentration of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266666912449829">Porter 1998</xref>:197). The “central actors” are the interconnected companies, that is to say, they are the firms which are responsible for the development or final assembly of a product or service. For example, in the aerospace business cluster, the central actor would be the aircraft manufacturing company. The other two entities are institutions. An “administrative body” is the entity that represents the companies of each business cluster. “Knowledge agents” are entities which aim to transfer information and knowledge to the central actors of localities. Thus, a central actor can collaborate with its peers at the locality in terms of information transfer and knowledge, making it also a knowledge agent.</p>
<p>Our effort to discriminate between business clusters based on the practices associated with knowledge transfer was based on the premise that the greater the agglomeration of enterprises of a locality around a few core processes of the productive chain, the greater will be the overlap of similar interests in terms of knowledge or know-how between (competing) companies of that locality. The contrary would also be true: localities with companies that complement and organize their production around the creation of a product/service and that possess less similarity in their production methods would exhibit a greater diversity in the constituents of the productive chain activities distributed among them. In other words, there is more complementarity than overlapping of interests, both for activities and demand for knowledge and know-how between those companies which are arranged and organized between one another. From this premise, the first hypothesis is derived:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>
<italic>h<sub>a1</sub> </italic>
</bold>The occurrence of information and knowledge transfer activities of common interest, (i.e. recurrent in terms of independent recollection and mentioning by central actors in the locality) is more likely to be found in non-integrated clusters of enterprises than in integrated clusters.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The second and third hypotheses address the term ‘quality of information’. There are many taxonomies for the dimensions of information quality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912449829">Garvin (1988</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912449829">Tozer (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912449829">Huang et al. (1999</xref>) have proposed different sets of dimensions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912449829">Huang et al. (1999</xref>), for example, developed a list of fifteen dimensions for analysis of information, classified into four categories:
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>intrinsic quality – accuracy, objectivity, credibility, and reputation; quality of accessibility – accessibility and safety</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>contextual quality – relevance, added value, time saving, completeness, and quantity of data</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>representational quality – interpretability, ease of use, concise representation and consistent representation</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In the data collection for every information transfer event cited by the central actor in the locality, the perceived quality of the event was assessed, which could in turn be explained or justified by indicating one or more dimensions of quality of information that influenced the construction of the perception. The set of dimensions adopted was a variation of the taxonomy proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912449829">Huang et al. (1999</xref>). Their fifteen dimensions were presented as potential information qualifying attributes.</p>
<p>“Research suggests that knowledge workers value their knowledge based on three dimensions: usefulness, benefits and source” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912449829">Ford and Staples 2010</xref>:398). For the integrated cluster with companies which are more specialized in a part of a product or a service phase, the demands for information and knowledge are more definite and specific around their information necessities. In this case, the perceptions of usefulness and benefits are equivalent to the variables of instrumentality and expectancy of Vroom’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912449829">1964</xref>) expectancy theory. Thus, the expectations of central actors in an integrated cluster are higher as per information transfer events offered by the administrative body. These higher expectations result in higher levels of attention and memory of events, which in turn result in a higher number of information transfer events which are valued and justified through the dimensions of the quality of information. The second hypothesis is thus:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>
<italic>h<sub>b1</sub>
</italic>
</bold> An integrated cluster has a higher incidence of information transfer events valued and justified using the dimensions of the quality of information.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Like the second hypothesis, the third hypothesis is also based on the memories and perceptions of central actors in regards for information transfer events which occurred in the local production cluster. We expected that central actors belonging to an integrated cluster will undertake a more detailed and minute evaluation of information transfer events in that they would mention a greater number of the attributes of information quality in their responses. The justification for this expectation is the same as that for the second hypothesis: specific information aimed at a specific audience will increase the involvement and consequently, the memory of central actors as per positive and negative aspects of the information transmitted. The third hypothesis thus reads:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>
<italic>h<sub>c1</sub>
</italic>
</bold> An integrated cluster exhibits a greater variety of information quality attributes indicated by the central actors for individual assessment of each information and knowledge transfer event.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The fourth hypothesis refers to the origin of the sources of information and knowledge remembered and mentioned by the central actors of the business cluster. It is based on the theory of peer learning, which was developed and researched by cognitive psychologists in the field of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912449829">Cohen 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912449829">Webb and Palincsar 1996</xref>), but which has also been successfully applied in business settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912449829">Mas and Moretti 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912449829">Eraut <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). In business contexts, work networks, personal contacts and organizational learning promoted by interaction between clients and suppliers have been the focus (Eraut et al. 2002).</p>
<p>The guiding premise of this hypothesis is that the central actors of an <italic>integrated cluster</italic> work more collaboratively with their peers as effective agents for the transfer of information and knowledge together with other central actors in the locality. This rationale led to the fourth hypothesis:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>
<italic>h<sub>d1</sub>
</italic>
</bold> The nomination of a central actor as a knowledge agent by his peers occurs more frequently in an integrated cluster.</p>
</list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The Department of Economic Development, Science and Technology of the State Government of São Paulo – Brazil recognizes 43 business clusters in the State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912449829">Secretaria 2008</xref>). Our sample consisted of six of these localities as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666912449829">Table 1</xref>. The criteria for the selection of the localities were: a) Existence of a formal and active administrative body as a starting point for contacts to be made, in order to schedule interviews for data collection at the locality; b) Willingness on the part of central actors to receive the researchers and participate in data collection interviews and c) Involvement in distinct business segments, given that among the 43 localities, some were similar in terms of core product.</p>

<p>The aerospace productive chain in São José dos Campos, SP was strategically selected as a central element of the analysis, because this locality is highly integrated in the organization and arrangement of products and services among the companies making up the cluster. All of them contribute to the production of a few types of complex and sophisticated products , in this particular case, aircraft, satellites and missiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912449829">Niosi and Zhegu 2005</xref>). The five other selected localities are characterized by central actors which have a lower level of mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>For each of the six business clusters that comprised the sample, we selected six central actors to be interviewed. The central actors were randomly selected from a list of companies associated with the administrative body of the locality. In each of the 36 organizations which characterized the central actors of the business clusters, the professional in charge of the process for creation and innovation in the organization was interviewed. In smaller organizations, this professional was in most cases, one of the owners of the company. The goal of the interviews was the identification of information and knowledge transmitted and/or developed among members of the business cluster through a knowledge agent employed by the administrative body. The subjects interviewed were questioned about the information and/or knowledge transferred during the years 2006 to 2008.</p>
<p>In the six business clusters surveyed, six central actors in the productive chain were interviewed as well as the person in charge for the administrative body of the locality, in addition to the knowledge agents mentioned by the central actors. For each locality, 10 interviews were held on average, totaling 60 interviews.</p>
<p>For the semi-structured interviews, a form was used as a supporting tool with open and closed questions. The interviews were filmed almost in their entirety. A few interviews could not be filmed due to personal restrictions of the professionals interviewed or for company security reasons, as was the case of companies which develop missiles and aircrafts at the São José dos Campos, SP locality.</p>
<p>The first contact at the locations took place with administrative professionals, with the purpose of presenting the research, and requesting about the possibility of the administrative body cooperating with the study and providing a list of members of the entity. After the interviews with the central actors of the business clusters and the mentioned knowledge agents, the professional in charge for the administrative body of the business cluster was interviewed. The purpose of this interview was to clarify issues about information and knowledge transfer events promoted by knowledge agents in the context of locality, and information was gathered, such as: contractors, executors, period of activity, schedule and time of occurrence of events.</p>
<sec id="section6-0266666912449829">
<title>Data collection, processing and validation</title>
<p>The main focus of the interviews with central actors was the identification of information transfer events sponsored by the administrative body of the local productive unit. Interviewees were asked to recall and describe any such events over the past three years which were related to innovation in products or services. In order to stimulate recall, at the beginning we presented interviewees with a list of typical information transfer events including: consulting, workshops, trade fairs, training, trips or visits to evaluate other firms or business cluster, talk by a specialist, delivery of media content such as technical notes or descriptions of recent developments, professional contacts, theatrical events, software implementation, analyses of prototypes or equipment, test copies of software, and explanation of technical specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912449829">Bukowitz and Williams 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>We undertook multiple levels of tabulation and checking of the data with respect to the information and knowledge transfer events promoted by the knowledge agents, which were recalled by the central actors of the localities during the interviews. For each business cluster, an intense process of data triangulation took place in order to identify incongruous information, validate and consolidate data from the three types of entities studied: central actors, knowledge agents and the administrative body. Special care was taken during the data collection and feedback because of three types of discrepancies frequently found in the six business clusters studied: a) divergence in terms of the scope of the information and knowledge transfer activity mentioned by the central actor, b) divergence in terms of the identity or name of the information and knowledge transfer activity declared by the central actor, and c) divergence in terms of the knowledge agent in charge of the information and knowledge transfer activity. Below we describe the causes for the three discrepancies identified.</p>
<sec id="section7-0266666912449829">
<title>Divergence of the scope of the information and knowledge transfer activity considered by the central actor</title>
<p>Many of the information and knowledge transfer activities developed by knowledge agents in the context of localities were multifaceted, including variance in regards to delivery times and stages or phases of activities. We sought to understand the scope of each information and knowledge transfer activity considered by the responding central actors, due mainly to the fact that data collection occurred via semi-structured interviews with free recall type of questions, i.e., those in which the respondent must reproduce, without assistance from the researcher, the names of the information and knowledge transfer activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666912449829">Wasserman and Faust 1994</xref>). We took pains to prevent the perceptions of central actors, who experienced only parts of the information and knowledge transfer activity, from being consolidated and analyzed together with the perceptions of other central actors who experienced all phases of the activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0266666912449829">
<title>Divergence of the identity of the information and knowledge transfer activity declared by the central actor</title>
<p>Even when two central actors recalled the same information and knowledge transfer activity, with the same perception in terms of the scope of activity considered, they may have used completely different terms to identify the named activity in interviews with the researchers. Another troublesome aspect related to the name of the activity was the opposite; the use of the same name for different activities. The use of data triangulation sought to identify and correct these discrepancies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0266666912449829">
<title>Divergence of the name of the knowledge agent declared as responsible for the information and knowledge transfer activity</title>
<p>The information and knowledge transfer activity may have involved more than one entity, which created difficulties for the central actors in identifying and recalling the knowledge agent responsible for the activity. We identified many partnerships among entities. For example, one entity may have taken care of technical and operational aspects, while another was in charge of the financial and administrative feasibility of the activity. Entities also frequently contracted outside professionals to carry out projects together with the central actors.</p>
<p>By the end of the data collection and triangulation process, 236 information transfer events had been identified from the central actors' statements, which resulted in 160 distinct and unique events. Of these 160 events, 67 (50.85%) had been characterized by at least one dimension of quality of information given to justify the importance attributed to the information transmitted. As a justification, for these 67 events, a total of 136 dimensions of information quality were mentioned. Out of these 136 dimensions mentioned, 123 were used to justify classification as valuable or very valuable information, while 13 dimensions were used to justify information as having little or no value.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666912449829">Table 2</xref> lists the knowledge agents recalled by the central actors of business clusters. Exclusively in the business cluster in São José dos Campos, SP, which deals with the aerospace industry, the presence of knowledge agents that also act as central actors was observed. Out of the eight knowledge agents remembered by the central actors, four of them also act as central actors: Liebherr Equipamentos do Brasil (ELEB) which makes landing gear and hydraulic and electromechanical equipment for aircraft; Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (EMBRAER) Company, which produces aircraft; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) – the National Institute for Space Research, which builds satellites, and Latecoere do Brasil , which produces equipment for the aviation industry.</p>

<p>The occurrence of information and knowledge transfer activities of common interest, (i.e., recurrent in terms of independent recollection and mentioning by central actors in the locality) is more likely to be found in non-integrated clusters of enterprises than in integrated clusters.</p>

<p>The 36 central actors interviewed in six business clusters identified 236 events promoted by knowledge agents. Those which were cited by more than one central actor in the business cluster, were designated as recurring events. Of the 236 events mentioned, 76 (32%) are recurrences of the 160 (68%) identified single events. The frequency of recurrences by business cluster is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266666912449829">Table 3</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0266666912449829">Table 6</xref> shows the total number of information and knowledge transfer events which have been justified with dimensions of information quality (TEJ) and the number of diverse dimensions of quality of information mentioned as justifications (DJ). Based on these two values, a variable has been defined: the average number of dimensions per event (MDE). The last two columns on the right refer to the calculation of the cutoff point for stratification of the MDE variable in class A and class non-A, according to Nihans index. It is observed that the cutoff point was set at 1.88 and that only one locality, (São José dos Campos, SP), has equaled or surpassed this point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0266666912449829">Figure 3</xref> illustrates this analysis, showing that there is a sharp distinction between the São José dos Campos, SP locality and other business clusters with respect to the MDE variable.</p>

<p>It is observed that São José dos Campos, SP stands out from the others. As this business cluster consists of companies that organize their production and assembly services around a central product unlike the other five localities analyzed, we surmise that the result <bold>corroborates hypothesis</bold> (<italic><bold>h<sub>c1</sub></bold></italic>).</p>

<title>Hypothesis h<sub>d1</sub>
</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>A central actor appointed by his peers as a knowledge agent occurs more frequently in an <italic>integrated cluster</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we used social networks analysis measures. Social networks are defined as a set of actors that relate to each other. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912449829">Marteleto (2001</xref>), a relationship depends upon the structural position of their links, and so does the status and role of an actor. The relationship which is the object of analysis of this hypothesis was cooperation between actors in the business cluster, in order to provide important information for innovation in products and services. The indicator of <italic>in-degree centrality</italic> indicates the knowledge agents of the network, as perceived by the six central actors from each of the six business clusters.</p>
<p>For analysis of the six social networks, the UCINET 6 software for Windows was used (Borgatti <italic>et al</italic>. 2002). Specifically, the <italic>in-degree centrality</italic> indicators and the <italic>out-degree centrality</italic> indicators of the central actors from the six business clusters described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0266666912449829">Table 7</xref> were analyzed. It is worth noting that at São José dos Campos locality there are nine central actors and not six as in the others, since the six central actors of the sample pointed out to three other central actors, which also play the role of knowledge agents.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Of the four initial hypotheses, three received support in the tests conducted:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(h<sub>a1</sub>) The occurrence of information and knowledge transfer activities of common interest, (i.e., recurrent in terms of independent recollection and mentioning by central actors in the locality) is more likely to be found in non-integrated clusters of enterprises than in integrated clusters;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(h<sub>c1</sub>) An integrated cluster exhibits a greater variety of information quality attributes indicated by the central actors for individual assessment of each information and knowledge transfer event;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(h<sub>d1</sub>) A central actor nominated by his peers as a knowledge agent occurs more frequently in integrated clusters.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Based on the hypotheses supported in this research, one can identify business information associated with knowledge transfer events as well as the elementary data necessary to generate this information (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0266666912449829">Table 9</xref>). These data are simple to understand and collect and are commonly known and used in organizations that practice knowledge management.</p>

<p>The fact that data related to knowledge transfer permit us to identify and characterize the degree of integration and collaboration between firms in a cluster should be of interest to those involved in the development of business clusters such as the local administrative body itself as well as entities with broader regional responsibility such as regional and national government agencies. For instance, based on these data, parties might be able to trace the evolution of cooperation and competition across firms making up a cluster.</p>
<p>We believe that our results have a number of policy and theoretical implications for business clusters and how they manage information. One clear implication is that the roles, techniques and practices associated with information exchange will vary by type of cluster. In the integrated cluster we found that a small number of central actors played important roles in sponsoring and supporting information exchange but that the events they sponsored tended to be differentiated by subject matter and were evaluated with considerable more care in terms of the number of dimensions of information quality considered. In other words in an integrated cluster, those firms and individuals who were engaged in manufacturing a specialized component or subassembly or providing a certain service tended to remember specific events clearly and assess these events on a variety of dimensions of information quality.</p>
<p>In more sophisticated and integrated clusters, clients of information events are likely to be more specific and critical and successful events will need to take account of this tendency by ascertaining exactly who would be ideal participants for a given event and what specific types of information should be delivered and in what format. This would logically call for smaller more targeted events that arise from specific concerns of subsets of members. It implies also that the planning of these events will require greater participation of target actors in determining what should be presented and how. By contrast, in less integrated clusters, it is likely that more generic events will be better received and that the social or networking functions of these events may be more important as participants will be less motivated to attend because of specific or specialized information that might be provided. Our results do not mean, however, that nonintegrated clusters will necessarily be less critical in their assessment of events. Our results indicated that actors in simpler clusters remembered fully as many positive or negative aspects of information transfer events as their peers in the integrated cluster. The differences lay instead in the number of different dimensions of quality they remembered. One might surmise therefore, that if events can be planned and executed to be positively memorable for nonintegrated clusters, there may not be such a great need to consider a wide variety of dimensions in setting up an event, nor be as concerned about the immediate utility of information conveyed.</p>
<sec id="section16-0266666912449829">
<title>Limitations and directions for future research</title>
<p>While this research took great care to capture and validate the impressions of important actors, we were limited, as are most studies of this type, in the number of clusters we were able to access. The exploratory and qualitative nature of the study also impeded the use of parametric statistics. While this research did not attempt to specify and develop indicators for classification of business oriented clusters, the variables and tests we developed might serve as a starting point for the development of indicators. The mathematical and logical operations required to develop these indicators would be quite simple, involving only sums and comparisons across a few variables, most of which are already implicit or explicit in the hypotheses.</p>
