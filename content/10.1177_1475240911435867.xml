<abstract>
<p>The present research explores the sociocultural adjustment of international students and the role played by university structures in the process. The adjustment process of international students has been modelled in psychological literature as a U-curve, a learning curve and most recently as a long, uneven and unending process of change. Yet, little of the literature has addressed the role played in this process by university structures. The research was conducted in the UK with 58 undergraduates from Malaysia. It utilized a qualitative design and consisted of two waves of semi-structured small-group interviews. It was found that university structures, in the form of accommodation provision, course provision, and student union clubs and societies, provide opportunities for integration and adjustment support in the early stages of the sojourn. However, the desire for contact with a wide range of others, central to the adjustment process, takes time to develop in international students. It is suggested that an understanding of adjustment as a long and uneven process should be built into structures aiming to support the adjustment of international students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>International students (in this context, students who travel to a country different from their own for the purpose of higher education) now make up a sizeable proportion of higher education students in many countries (15 per cent of the UK’s higher education student population in 2007–2008, for instance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911435867">United Kingdom Council for International Student Affairs [UKCISA], 2009</xref>) and provide an important source of income for universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911435867">De Vita and Case, 2003</xref>). Reassuringly, recent academic work has found the experience of studying overseas to be detrimental to the well-being of only a small proportion of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240911435867">Rosenthal et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, international students are thought to be advantaged as immigrants: they are a high-achieving and highly motivated group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240911435867">Russell et al., 2010</xref>) and are increasingly seen as active and strategic participants in their adjustment process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240911435867">Montgomery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Some researchers have suggested that the desire among international students to experience the world, to become independent and to learn more about and better the self, mitigate the negative effects associated with adjustment to a new culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240911435867">Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911435867">Gill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911435867">Hartshorne and Baucom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911435867">Senyshyn et al., 2000</xref>). However, other research has found international students’ capacity to become fully participating members of their host community to be seriously limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911435867">Lee and Rice, 2007</xref>). It has long been known that international students experience a good deal of stress on arrival in a new culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240911435867">Berry and Sam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1475240911435867">Zheng and Berry, 1991</xref>) and have greater need for support than home students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240911435867">Andrade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240911435867">Sawir et al., 2008</xref>). Further research into the experiences of international students is necessary both to ensure the welfare of the student body and to ensure that particular institutions and nations remain attractive destinations for such students.</p>
<sec id="section2-1475240911435867">
<title>Sociocultural adjustment</title>
<p>The success of a sojourn (that is, a temporary stay in a new culture, which typifies the international student) is often conceived, in the psychological literature, in terms of ‘adjustment’. Adjustment has been theorized as having two main aspects, namely psychological and sociocultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240911435867">Ward and Kennedy, 1993</xref>). Psychological adjustment is defined as relating to the mental health and overall well-being of a migrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1475240911435867">Ward et al., 2004</xref>), whereas sociocultural adjustment is defined as relating to the behavioural and cognitive factors that are associated with effective performance during cross-cultural transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911435867">Sam et al., 2006</xref>). While a small number of studies have explicitly focused on psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1475240911435867">Ward and Kennedy, 1992</xref>), the majority of research has focused on sociocultural adjustment.</p>
<p>Within the latter body of work, success in sociocultural adjustment is considered to be a function of a number of sociodemographic variables, such as education level, academic performance, prior cross-cultural experience, host language proficiency, and family income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240911435867">Ataca and Berry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911435867">Li and Gasser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911435867">Swami, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240911435867">Swami et al., 2010</xref>). Perceived cultural distance between a sojourner’s home culture and host culture has also been reliably associated with sociocultural adjustment, with studies suggesting that a larger perceived distance results in greater difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240911435867">Galchenko and van de Vijver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240911435867">Ward and Kennedy, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has particularly emphasized the positive effect of social interaction with host nationals on adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240911435867">Bochner et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240911435867">Swami et al., 2010</xref>). Although there is evidence that, in some circumstances, contact can be threatening and distressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240911435867">Greenland and Brown, 2005</xref>; Stephen and Stephan, 1985) and that contact with co-national networks in the host nation can provide a less ‘stressful’ adjustment experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240911435867">Carr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1475240911435867">Ying and Liese, 1994</xref>), it has long been argued that stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination are reduced by interactions between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911435867">Allport, 1954</xref>). Contact with host nationals has been shown to relate to successful adjustment by allowing international students to develop local networks, understand local cultures, and acquire necessary social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240911435867">Church, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911435867">Li and Gasser, 2005</xref>). Recent research has confirmed that students experiencing a strong sense of connectedness display a lower level of cultural stress and higher level of positive effects from studying abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240911435867">Russell et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>The process of adjustment</title>
<p>Researchers of adjustment have seen it as important to investigate the experience as ‘an active process of dealing with change rather than a noxious event’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240911435867">Ward et al., 2001</xref>: xii). Models have been informed by theories of stress, coping and social identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240911435867">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), but particularly relevant to the topic of sociocultural adjustment are cultural learning models that regard the adjustment process as the acquisition of new culture-specific skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240911435867">Furnham and Bochner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240911435867">Ward, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The process of migrant adjustment was first described as having a U-shape. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240911435867">Oberg (1960)</xref> found that those who had been in a new cultural context for between 6 and 18 months were less adjusted than those who had been in such a context for either less than 6 months or more than 18 months. An initial state of euphoria was thought to occur, develop into a time of crisis, frustration and anxiety, before resulting in adjustment and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1475240911435867">Ward et al., 1998</xref>). The U-shape model, however, has been challenged and largely discredited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1475240911435867">Ward et al. (1998)</xref> suggested that the greatest difficulties for sojourners come at the beginning of their stay, when they have the least familiarity with the host culture and limited experience of meaningful interactions with host nationals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1475240911435867">Ward et al.’s (1998)</xref> model, adjustment can be better described as a learning curve, increasing rapidly during the first few months of the sojourn and then levelling off in the subsequent period. Ward and colleagues acknowledge that, after these first months, the adjustment process becomes less predictable and is increasingly influenced by factors such as work responsibilities and relationships, but see the initial period as the crucial time in the adjustment process and the period where life changes are greatest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240911435867">Ward, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The understanding of adjustment as a learning curve, most rapid at first, is echoed in the support provided to international students. It is claimed that the early weeks at university are a time when patterns of relationships are formed that influence experiences in the longer term, and that the first year is critical in the process of socialization into university life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240911435867">Robinson et al., 2007</xref>). University investment in supporting adjustment is thus strategically focused on these periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240911435867">Ramsey et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, calls have been recently renewed for the most support to be made available to sojourners at the beginning of their stay, owing to the high level of suffering experienced during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240911435867">Brown and Holloway, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet much contemporary work has found that the time span for adjustment is not uniform, and that adjustment in different domains may not progress at the same rate. One study found that, although learning how to make friends, feelings of loneliness and ‘culture shock’ were problems experienced by international students in the early stage of their sojourn, perceived difficulties in making friends with host nationals increased among students as time progressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911435867">Daroesman et al., 2005</xref>). A recent longitudinal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240911435867">Brown and Holloway (2008a</xref>) found that international students often experience the first period of their sojourn as a stressful time of intense emotion, and that stress decreases over time. They also found, however, that this was not always the case; there were differences in the pattern of progress made by different students and also within each student’s subjective sense of success in different domains of adjustment. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1475240911435867">Zhou and Todaman (2009)</xref> described how international students are particularly in danger of feeling isolated at the time of their arrival, but also pointed to an increasing awareness among students, over time, of the difficulty of making friends outside of co-national circles. They concluded that the process of adjustment differs between different domains, such as social connectedness and educational efficacy.</p>

<title>The university context</title>
<p>The university structures that bring international students into contact with host nation students include course attendance, university accommodation, and clubs and societies. These can be seen as structures that facilitate the process of sociocultural adjustment and provide unique opportunities for international students to minimize problems associated with adjustment. Yet, despite these opportunities, international students may have severe difficulties interacting with host nation students. A report by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911435867">UKCISA (2004)</xref> found that only 7 per cent of international students were friends mainly with British students. Students from East and Southeast Asia were the least likely to have British friends (for example, only 15 per cent of Chinese students reported having any British friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911435867">UKCISA, 2004</xref>]). These findings support those of other work that identifies a lack of integration between student groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240911435867">Brown, 2009</xref>) and a lack of contact with host nation students as a concern of international students throughout their time at university (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240911435867">Allen and Higgins, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Few academic studies into adjustment detail the role played by university structures. One exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240911435867">Sovic (2009)</xref> who suggested, in relation to British universities, that carefully planned and managed accommodation can facilitate good inter-cultural contact, that formal or structured exchange as part of academic courses helps students feel that they might have something to say to each other outside the class and, furthermore, that university societies are felt by international students to be useful, especially at the beginning of the university year. These proposals are consistent with other studies showing that international students would like more support in developing social networks as part of their course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240911435867">Bartram, 2007</xref>). Policy-oriented research conducted by university and international student bodies has also considered the role of student unions, living arrangements and the structure of university courses in relation to the experiences of international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240911435867">Edwards and Ran, 2006</xref>). Such work reports that international students see student accommodation as a place where friends can be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911435867">Daroesman et al., 2005</xref>) and as crucial in protecting them from isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911435867">UKCISA, 2004</xref>). In addition, participation in campus activities is believed by international students to increase the likelihood of forming friendships with host nation students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911435867">UKCISA, 2004</xref>) and improves satisfaction with their sojourn in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911435867">Daroesman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This article addresses the paucity of research into the role played by university structures in the process of international student adjustment. It seeks to follow the trajectory of adjustment experienced by international students and asks what relationship exists between this trajectory and the university structures that assist adjustment. More specifically the research attempts, when considering the practical issue of supporting international students, to establish an understanding of the adjustment process as uneven and ongoing. Research with international students has increasingly questioned the assumption that there is a conclusion to the adjustment process, and has characterized it instead as ‘an unending recasting of positions with no end point’, the result of which is a hybridity in constant change rather than complete acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240911435867">Burnapp, 2006</xref>: 90). Yet this new understanding of the process is not currently reflected in calls for changes in the manner in which university structures that assist adjustment are focused. Using a qualitative design, the present study was conducted in the UK with first-year international students from Malaysia, one of the top five non-European Union countries in terms of the number of students who come to the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911435867">UKCISA, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>This article employed a qualitative design, as it was an exploratory project that aimed to allow the concerns of international student participants to emerge beyond those that might be already predicted. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were employed as the best method for accessing the motivations, thoughts and understandings of participants. Two waves of interviews were conducted, the first over the first half of the first term of the academic year 2009/10 and the second during the middle weeks of the second term of the same year. This allowed a longitudinal picture to be drawn regarding participants’ changing attitudes and feelings, which did not rely on participant memory or retrospective interpretation. An added benefit of re-interviewing was that it increased participants’ comfort with the interview situation, as well as facilitating a better quality of interaction between interviewer and interviewee, and a deeper, more open engagement with the topic.</p>
<sec id="section6-1475240911435867">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In order to ensure the data collected was as broad as possible, within the remit of collecting data on first-year international students from Malaysia, we wanted our interviewees to reflect demographically the Malaysian international student population. This was thought largely to reflect the demographic make-up of Malaysia, where 50 per cent of the population are Malays (by constitutional definition Muslims), 24 per cent are ethnic Chinese, 7 per cent are ethnic Indians and the remainder are of other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911435867">Government of Malaysia, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A total of 37 first-year undergraduate Malaysian students participated in the first wave of interviews. Similar numbers of male and female students were recruited (19 women, 18 men) and students were recruited from three different universities in Greater London referred to here as U1, U2 and U3 (16 at U1, 17 at U2, 4 at U3). The ethnic composition of the sample was less balanced, as Chinese Malaysian students replied more readily to invitations to participate (26 Chinese, 7 Malay, 4 Indian). In the second wave of interviews, 28 of the 37 students were successfully re-interviewed. There were no demographic biases in mortality (that is, those not included in the second interview: five were women and four men, while seven were Chinese and two Malay). The sample was expanded to 49 in the second wave to include more Malay Malaysian students (27 Chinese, 18 Malay, 4 Indian), as well as students at a university outside of London, U4 (16 U1, 14 U2, 4 U3, 15 U4). Several students in the expanded sample were second-year students, included in order to enhance understanding of the adjustment process over time.</p>
<p>When an interview is quoted in the following sections, the first number indicates whether it was held in the first (1) or second (2) wave or whether it was with the extra participants interviewed in the second wave (E). The next number identifies which interview it is within this wave. The letter denotes the speaker’s ethnicity, namely Chinese (C), Malay (M) or Indian (I), while the following number indicates the university they attend (1–4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1475240911435867">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethical approval to undertake this study was given by the appropriate university research ethics committee and the informed consent of participants was obtained at the beginning of each interview. All participants were informed of the confidential nature of the interviews and each was paid £10 in remuneration for their participation. For the first wave of interviews, participants were recruited by email invitations sent to university Malaysian Society email lists on our behalf by society officials, and paper invitations distributed at orientation events. During interviews, participants were asked to tell their Malaysian friends about the project and further participants were reached through snowball sampling. This recruitment method was repeated for the second wave of interviews.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted individually or with a friendship group of no more than five in a location on campus, usually in a quiet seating area in a university building. Interviews lasted about 60 minutes and were conducted in English by a British interviewer. Interview schedules were used to partially structure the interviews. In the first interview wave, a narrative technique was used. Students were asked to recall their motivations for coming to the UK, their experiences during their first days and how their experiences and feelings continued to develop over time. Through this technique, themes were allowed to emerge spontaneously. The schedules then included more directive questions, such as ‘Have you joined any clubs and societies?’, ‘Tell me about your friends in your accommodation’ and ‘Have you made friends on your course?’ In the second interview wave participants were asked about their Christmas holiday, and about what had changed and what had remained the same for them since the previous interview; they were also asked again the same more directive questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1475240911435867">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were recorded and transcribed. An initial process of coding and analysis took place after the first wave of interviews. Themes were selected to be further investigated in the second wave. Gaps in the data were identified and it was decided that, in addition to re-interviews, further interviews would be conducted to ensure data saturation on relevant themes. The complete set of data was read and coded by the interviewer (the first author) after the completion of the second wave of interviews. The second author read and coded a selection of transcripts and the coding was discussed and agreed upon. Categories and themes were then developed through a process of iteration between the developing map of categories and themes, and the transcribed texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240911435867">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). The Results section of this article developed out of one section of this map of themes and categories.</p>
<p>Some limitations need to be acknowledged of the study’s results. Participants did not speak their mother tongue in the interviews and were sometimes hindered from communicating in a flowing and unguarded manner. It is also possible that, due to cultural differences between interviewer and interviewees, verbal and non-verbal subtleties of communication may have been missed by the interviewer. A further limitation stems from the self-selecting nature of the sample. Those who volunteered were those confident enough to participate in an interview and interested in the unusual form of social interaction of the interview situation; it is possible that they may have followed an adjustment trajectory different from those who did not choose to participate.</p>

<title>Co-cultural groupings</title>
<p>Students had extensive support from co-culturals (that is, members of the same national, ethnic or cultural group). Many students came to the UK with school friends or met acquaintances from Malaysia on arrival. These connections were then expanded: ‘Where I went for A-levels, I would say 90% of us came to the UK. And we all knew seniors who had already come here’ (E.04 M1); ‘I knew a couple before I came, then you meet their friends, their girlfriends, their girlfriends’ friends …’ (2.11 C1). Networks of Malaysian students stretched across the whole country and it was common for groups to go on road trips to see friends from Malaysia studying in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The only limit to student co-cultural networks described by participants was a lack of places to go. Students complained of how early restaurants close and how the main places to socialize were pubs and clubs. Within this community, however, smaller cliques operated. The biggest divide was between Chinese Malaysian and Malay Malaysian students, who had almost completely separate friendship groups. At some universities, students were also divided according to which high school they had attended. Divisions also developed between students of different disciplines and students living in different accommodation. Only very occasionally were students excluded from these Malaysian circles: ‘My sister made me join the Malaysia society. I went twice and no more. They divided themselves by course – medics and law – so as I study film, it was a clique that was hard to break into’ (E.12 C2).</p>
<p>Many students blamed this large, well-connected co-cultural community for their isolation from British students and other international students: ‘We kind of have a community here and it denies us the opportunity to connect with Londoners’ (1.03 C1); ‘I have friends at other universities and I go and hang out with them, and when there are not many Malaysians they tend to hang out with international students’ (E.07 C2). This tight-knit community – at course and accommodation level, university level and national level – provides extensive support to students. Support from co-culturals remained constant; even those who spoke of quickly making friends outside of these networks still had access to them throughout their first year at university. However, this very self-sufficiency was seen as a block to the process of integration and adjustment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1475240911435867">
<title>Two adjustment patterns</title>
<p>Two rather contrary adjustment patterns over time were identified by our data. On the one hand, students found diminishing opportunities to integrate into the student community as their first year progressed; on the other hand, as time progressed they felt an increasing desire and confidence to break out of co-cultural groupings as time progressed.</p>
<p>The first weeks of university were seen as very important to students’ future social life. It was said that everyone was looking for friends and so it was the easiest time to meet people: ‘It’s this situation where they are all from their own country, they are lost. Everyone is in the same boat’ (1.09 M1); ‘I started talking to the internationals right at the start. They know my name and I have established a reputation there. They are cool with me’ (1.06 C1).</p>
<p>For those who did not break into non-Malaysian friendship groups during this initial period, it became harder to do so as time went on. It was felt that after the initial excitement of arrival at university, people retreated to the friends they felt closest to and who were often of the same nationality: ‘After a while, once people settle down, cliques start to form. Then there is no reason to look outside of them. It is then hard to break in’ (2.11 C1); ‘At the beginning of the term, ’cause it’s like the first year, everyone kind of mixes around, but after some time they just go back to the same group’ (2.05 C1).</p>
<p>This movement towards isolation was felt to deepen in the second term. It was said that, in the second term, the excitement of being abroad wore off and students became more open to feelings of sadness at being so far from home (the ‘second term blues’ [2.08 I1]); ‘The euphoria of coming here, where everything is new, you get used to it’ (1.09 M1); ‘In the first term, everything is very new and you are busy yourself. But during the second term, you have settled down and so you have more time to miss things’ (2.05 C1).</p>
<p>The second narrative told by students was of their growing confidence and sense of ability to interact with British and other international students as the year progressed. Students described how they had gradually found it easier to communicate with people: ‘I definitely feel more comfortable with them. Right now I am feeling more confident’ (2.13 C1); ‘At first the British were really difficult to talk to. But now I realize they are really friendly’ (2.01 C1). Despite having an awareness of the increasing difficulty of integration as time went on, students gradually became more eager and more prepared to engage with those outside of their co-cultural community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1475240911435867">
<title>Student accommodation</title>
<p>Participants generally saw student accommodation as one of the best places to meet British and other international students. Some successfully developed friendships with those with whom they shared a kitchen. These students went out for meals, to see bands and films, and tried new activities, such as roller-skating with their hallmates. Many such students described these friends as supportive and spoke of instances where they had been helped by them during times of stress: ‘We have assessments every few weeks and, before my first one, my flatmate said “I’ll make some tea.” It was quite refreshing and it was really helpful’ (2.2 I3).</p>
<p>Even when relationships were not close, the proximity involved in being neighbours and sharing a kitchen helped build connections between the students and those with whom they felt they had few other commonalities: ‘I don’t go out very often with them. I’m close to them because we stay in the same place, we share a kitchen, we pass by each other all the time, and have chats and things like that’ (2.01 C1). Some students, however, commented on the superficiality of such relationships. They felt this contact was insufficient to allow them to form the close and sustained relationships they needed: ‘You meet him or her today and tomorrow you forget about it. You do your thing and they do theirs’ (E.05 C2); ‘Here it’s like, ‘Hey, how are you? See you next time!’ But you never see them again’ (2.09 M1).</p>
<p>Others had been alienated by behaviour they had observed in their accommodation and had felt they had annoyed other students with their own practices. The most common concerns about students of other nationalities centred on their drinking and sexual habits: ‘When they are in the kitchen, they are always drinking beer and wine. It’s not a problem, but I don’t drink much so we can’t mix that well’ (1.02 C2); ‘Our friend shares a room with a German guy and he just does it [has sex] every night with him in the room … He complains but nothing happens’ (E.07 C2). Malaysian students often spent time cooking together in their halls and this upset some of their neighbours: ‘When you cook Chinese food, you have to cook lots of portions, so a few of us were cooking in my kitchen and the rest of them didn’t like it’ (1.02 C2); ‘People complained about my cooking. I was cooking with other people. They were saying “Are you having private parties?”’ (1.02 C2). The proximity of student accommodation provides opportunities for students to build supportive relationships with a variety of other students. Proximity in itself, however, was not always sufficient for these relationships to grow. Moreover, proximity in the absence of mutual cultural sensitivity also provided opportunities for conflict and alienation.</p>
<p>In the second year, students who moved out of student accommodation and into shared houses with their Malaysian friends often lost contact with this set of non-Malaysian students completely: ‘That is the good thing about staying in halls: I had international friends. The last time we saw each other was last year. We did plan to go out but we couldn’t find any time’ (E.03 M4). Relationships based solely on proximity disappeared at the end of the first year along with the structure that created them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1475240911435867">
<title>Lectures, seminars and labs</title>
<p>For some, it was easy to get to know lots of people on their academic course and, by the second term, classmates had become some participants’ main friends: ‘Everyone knows everyone. It’s very cosy. You never go into a classroom and feel alone’ (2.08 I1). Meanwhile, for those who felt less successful at making new friends, the structured interaction of group work on their course was described as the only time they had close interactions with non-Malaysians: ‘I interact with locals [Britons] when I join group work, an assignment group. I get to make some new friends. Apart from that, I am confined around my Malaysian friends’ (E.01 M4).</p>
<p>Some students felt that opportunities to make friends on their course were less than they could have been. They complained about a lack of contact hours: ‘We have four hours of classes, that’s it. You just have one hour with your classmates, then after class they just rush off to something else’ (E.07 C2); ‘My labs are only a few hours a week where I talk with others, so I spend a lot of time with other Malaysians’ (2.10 C2). They also criticized the number of other Asian students on their course, which they felt inhibited them from mixing with British students and other groups of international students: ‘On my course there are a bit too many Asians, so there is less of a chance to get to know people of non-Asian origin’ (2.13 C1).</p>
<p>Relationships with British and international classmates, like relationships with neighbours, were sometimes described as superficial and routine, rather than close and satisfying: ‘I speak with them when I go to lectures and we talk about how horrible our course is. We see each other every day in lectures, so we don’t have to hang out as well. We keep in touch. But I have never spoken to them about anything personal’ (E.02 C5). Opportunities for contact through course structures were appreciated and students desired their expansion. However, as with student accommodation, relationships based solely on interactions forced by university structures failed to flourish outside of these structures.</p>
<p>As the year progressed, work pressure increased and consequently lessened the time students spent socializing: ‘I was involved in societies and met a lot with British friends, but now I have no time’ (E.01 M4); ‘Last term we had more time to do stuff, like we went hiking and got to know people from different courses and different backgrounds, but this term I can’t do that because I’m so busy with my course’ (2.11 C2). Students described how, as the second term developed, they had less contact with all but their close friends: ‘As it got to second term, I realised I was so behind. I just stopped going out at all. That’s when the process of locking myself in my room started’ (E.12 C2). Courses sometimes became a hindrance to contact and sociocultural adjustment.</p>
<p>However, as time progressed, students also gained confidence in interacting with the British and other international students on their course: ‘I felt inferior … because we don’t have the same accent and I was afraid my English wouldn’t be as good. … But you are placed in smaller groups with all walks of life so in the second semester we got quite close’ (E.03 M4). One student spoke of how it was not until her second year that she really made friends with her course mates: ‘You get more of a sense of your identity; you start to be able to change your friends gradually. You go out for a coffee, for dinner. Now my main friends are my coursemates who are all British’ (E.06 C1). Opportunities to interact in seminars and labs were consistently available to students throughout their sojourn and could be taken up at many points in time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1475240911435867">
<title>University societies</title>
<p>University societies were another structure through which students knew they could meet people. Some students, who felt they could not be in places where alcohol was being consumed, did not join societies: ‘The activities are hard. There are lots of clubbing events and a lot of going out, that kind of event’ (2.04 M1). In the first weeks, other students reported joining a wide array of societies including ‘the cheese society, the chocolate society, skydiving society’ (1.04 C2). Students also joined a variety of business societies and sports societies. Such activities were not often sustained beyond the first few weeks, however. When they were, they did not always provide for positive contact. One student was troubled by the behaviour of his teammates in a sports society to which he belonged: ‘They normally swear, say bad words. It’s a problem. At one point they started invading my Facebook wall with “your mum” jokes and I worried what my Malaysian friends would think’ (E.03 M4). Initial bursts of joining societies mostly did not turn out to be a sustained avenue for social interactions. Like accommodation and course opportunities, where interaction was only superficial, contact dwindled or led to the perception of conflict and feelings of alienation.</p>
<p>Conversely, Malaysian societies dominated the social life of many participants. Activities included a ski trip at Christmas and meals out for Chinese New Year. A drama production called ’Malaysian Night’ took up all the spare time of many of those involved throughout their second term. Students involved in Malaysian Night felt they had been getting closer to other Malaysian students but had lost contact with other international friends: ‘We are getting closer to each other. It’s nice in some ways, but in other ways it means we stay in our comfort zone. I realised in the first term I still mixed with people from other countries, but now I mix mainly with Malaysians and it’s not a good thing’ (2.12 C2).</p>
<p>By the second term, students – critical of their failure to integrate – were sometimes planning conscious strategies to do better the following year. These plans often included becoming involved in other societies: ‘This term I mix around mostly with Malaysians because we are so involved with Malaysian Night. I don’t want to get tied into this community for the next year. I want to do something else. Like something I am not good at like debating’ (2.12 C2). One student had become more involved in university clubs and societies in her second year: ‘I joined the Economics Society and Entrepreneurial Society. I definitely feel more involved this year. It’s making the effort’ (E.07 C3). Particular societies may again have relevance for students, as they consider the help they may be to their future career and look for avenues to mix with wider groups of students in their second year at university.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article examined the adjustment trajectory of international students and the role played by university structures in supporting their adjustment. Our analysis suggests that students experienced diminishing structural opportunities to mix with British and other international students as their first year progressed. They described a movement towards isolation as the initial buzz of joining new societies and meeting new people wore off, socializing decreased due to work pressure, and students settled into fixed friendship groups.</p>
<p>The changing availability of adjustment opportunities may be seen as being related to changes in three structures in particular: student accommodation, labs and seminars, and student societies. Student accommodation was felt to be an important way to meet others; through everyday proximity, it was seen as a way in which close cross-cultural relationships could grow. Some students became totally surrounded by their co-cultural community in their second year, as they moved out of student accommodation. The structured interaction of group work in labs and seminars was similarly seen by students as an important opportunity to build relationships. This was particularly true for those students who found social activities difficult. Yet, at the same time, academic work was thought to hinder adjustment as work pressure increased and examinations neared, as it decreased the time students had for socializing. The role of the university societies was prominent in the first few weeks of students’ first year at university, where they provided a forum where many contacts could be quickly made, particularly for those students who enjoyed drinking alcohol. Societies became, however, rapidly less relevant to students after this period, although there were indications that particular societies were again utilized in the later periods of the sojourn.</p>
<p>This pattern of available opportunities runs counter to the levels of desire and confidence among students to break out of co-cultural groupings. Students spoke of their growing awareness of the limited extent of their adjustment, and a growing sense of self-efficacy in interacting with British and international students as time progressed. Our data also suggests that, while some students experience an initial stage of rapid adjustment, all subsequently encounter a long period of adjustment difficulty. Students’ learning curve regarding their own sense of control and desire to interact with the host culture, attributes which are supposed to situate them as particularly advantaged migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240911435867">Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911435867">Gill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911435867">Hartshorne and Baucom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911435867">Senyshyn et al., 2000</xref>), is shallow and extends well beyond this initial period. Moreover, the learning curve of student sojourners was not found to be as standard or smooth as recent research has predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240911435867">Brown and Holloway, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240911435867">Furnham and Bochner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1475240911435867">Zhou and Todaman, 2009</xref>). While some steadily adjusted, making friends in their accommodation or on their course, for others the learning curve was very shallow for a sustained period as they stuck to co-cultural support networks and only ventured outside those networks months or years later.</p>
<p>It may be that the initial period of rapid adjustment experienced by some is partially a function of the integration and adjustment opportunities open to students, which are at their maximum in the initial period after arrival. Structures that are themselves predicated on a steep learning curve model of adjustment are likely to create, at least to some extent, this pattern of adjustment in those who access them.</p>
<p>However, participants sometimes felt interactions based on proximity in accommodation and formal interaction on courses was superficial. Good quality contact has to be based on their own inter-cultural efficacy and sensitivity and on that of other students, as well as on university structures. The lessening of contact with the wider student community through the withdrawal of university structures designed to assist mixing, such as student accommodation, further demonstrates the limited power of university structures to facilitate real integration and adjustment in the absence of sojourner and other student motivation and ability. Moreover, sojourners sometimes found that contact in the absence of this cultural sensitivity and efficacy further alienated them and exacerbated their feelings of separation from the wider student body.</p>
<p>There currently appears to be a misfit between the gradual and uneven adjustment process of students and the clustering of opportunities for adjustment in the first weeks and year of university life. Those making policy relating to international student adjustment should be aware that student adjustment processes extend well beyond the first term of their sojourn, and that the most important time for interventions to assist adjustment may not be during the first few weeks after arrival, but in the second year of study. Certainly, our results suggest that the key concerns of international students were similar at both interview times, and were also similar for first- and second-year students.</p>
<p>In the light of our assertion about the agency of the sojourners themselves, it is also appropriate to make recommendations concerning the structure which they create. Co-cultural student networks were quick to develop among students and consistent over the period this study observed. They were seen as strong and supportive mechanisms that sometimes hindered integration into the wider student body. Students might make use of co-cultural structures by developing adjustment-promoting activities, but of an outward looking nature, which could assist them in engaging with the wider student body and host nation groups.</p>
<p>The present research has begun to understand the effect of university structures on the trajectory of student integration and adjustment. Future work should continue to take account of the changing availability of structured opportunities for contact when modelling the process of adjustment. Equally, when designing structures to assist contact and adjustment, an awareness of the long, uneven and possibly unending process of change and personal development that constitutes the adjustment process should be utilized.</p>
