<p><italic>Reflections from Common Ground . . . Cultural Awareness in Healthcare</italic>, written by Beth Lincoln, is a nonfiction textbook that offers simple, yet systematic and scientifically supported principles for operationalizing cultural competency in health care delivery.</p>
<p>Changing demographics present a daunting challenge for health care organizations and providers across the spectrum of health care delivery. Opportunities exist to improve outcomes in an ever-increasingly diverse patient population through cultural competency. Despite tremendous progress in the last two decades, challenges remain in how clinicians can effectively operationalize cultural competence in clinical settings. In recognition of these realities, Beth Lincoln raises awareness of several cultural nuances that have implications for health care outcomes. In this book, she provides tactics and strategies to help health care organizations and providers to mitigate the inherent challenges that often ebb from the patient–provider disconnect in explanatory models of illness and provides tools to meet the health care needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two main sections. Section 1, which includes chapters 1 to 9, entreats readers to self-reflect and appreciate individual and group experiences, including historical underpinnings and consequences of ever-evolving legislative policies, such as the civil and voting rights act of 1964 and 1965; and how the experiences of race, prejudice, and discrimination have together shaped cultural values, health, and health care beliefs. Additionally, the first few chapters review some of the ever-changing emigration/immigration policies of the United States, emphasizing the ramifications of forced migration (slavery) and personal immigration experiences, such as those of Manuel Pablo.</p>
<p>Next, the textbook underlines the long-standing disparities in health and health outcomes, providing troublesome statistics that demonstrate a higher burden of disease for minorities and/or culturally diverse patient populations. Beth Lincoln highlights the barriers that have contributed to these disparities, as well as the efforts of professional bodies such as the American Academy of Nursing, the Institute of Medicine, and others to bridge health care disparities. Furthermore, she draws attention to the very important and indispensable role of health care providers in helping eliminate disparities.</p>
<p>The chapters that conclude the first section of the book provide foundational tools that organizations and providers can employ to operationalize cultural competence in the clinical encounter. It sets the stage for the second section of the book where the author, using vignettes, provides several strategies for providing culturally competent health care services. The author also succinctly reviews Leininger’s Theory of Culture Care: Diversity and Universality, as well as her Sunrise Delivery Model, which together can serve as a framework to guide the provision of culturally competent care using three modes of care decisions and actions: (a) preservation/maintenance, (b) accommodation/negotiation, and (c) repatterning/restructuring. Beth Lincoln also underscores the importance of providers’ awareness by considering the power of culture and its influence on patient values, beliefs, and health care decisions, along with the application of the principles of cultural humility.</p>
<p>The second section of the book, chapters 10 to 23, describes some challenges within the domains of cultural competency using some cultural groups as illustrative exemplars. For example, chapter 10 discusses the influence of family support in patient adherence to care, using conflicting health care values of a Mexican grandmother and a nurse midwife, even when they share a common outcome for the patient. Other exemplars described in the book include challenges in the work place, from differing cultural values and belief systems, experiences of refugees, and why they all matter in the clinical encounter. The influence of time orientation across cultures and diverse religious beliefs and their consequences on health care decisions are also accentuated.</p>
<p>The strength of the book lies in the use of anecdotes that appeal to the spectrum of health care organizations and providers including students, faculty, and researchers. The author carefully and steadily applies an intentional lens for health care organizations, providers, and other stakeholders to reflect on the history of the United States and the implications of some legislations and policies. The vignettes promote self-reflection through soul-searching that can help any provider identify personal biases and organizational barriers to cultural competency. These also help increase an awareness of diversity as a strength and illustrate the need to garner resources to support and provide culturally competent care.</p>
<p>Beth Lincoln has successfully used historical, legal, and political evolvement of United States, along with the experiences of culturally diverse groups, to underscore the imperative for culturally competent health care services. The book will be useful for educating a wide spectrum of students and providers in health care. Her use of common sense, simple language, but scientifically supported approaches has helped simplify and put some structure around the often viewed as elusive concept of providing culturally competent care to diverse population. Her book will spark a desire to provide cultural competent care in any student, health care organization, or provider interested in helping bridge the long-standing disparities in health and health care outcomes. It is one of the most exhilarating books on cultural competence that I have read to date.</p>
