<abstract>
<p>H.U.B. City Steps is a 5-year community-based participatory research walking intervention designed to help lower blood pressure in a majority African American population in southern Mississippi via community collaboration and capacity building, increased walking, culturally tailored health education sessions, and motivational interviewing. Building community capacity for physical activity is a key component of this intervention. Qualitative and quantitative methods have been used to assess how project stakeholders perceive the community capacity-building efforts of the project. This article illustrates the baseline results of this mixed methods approach from the perspective of three groups of stakeholders: project researchers and staff, community advisory board, and intervention walking coaches. Eight constructs were examined, including leadership, resources, external networking, visibility and recognition, personnel sustainability, ability and commitment to organize, communication with community members, and relationships with influential others. Quantitative results indicated significant differences among stakeholder groups for project leadership and personnel sustainability. Qualitative perspectives provided an opportunity to examine possible reasons for these differences. Overall findings provide direction related to improving intervention outcomes and sustainability.</p>

<p>Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has commonly been used in low-income communities and communities of color to address the complex health issues they face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911404230">Minkler, 2004</xref>). The Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911404230">AHRQ, 2009</xref>) defines CBPR as
<disp-quote>
<p>a collaborative research approach that is designed to ensure and establish structures for participation by communities affected by the issue being studied, representatives of organizations, and researchers in all aspects of the research process to improve health and well-being through taking action . . . (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A core attribute of CBPR is the academic–community partnership in which both collaborate in an equal partnership to identify and address community health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911404230">Israel, Eng, Schulz, &amp; Parker, 2005</xref>) and to share knowledge and expertise with one another to further action and change within a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911404230">Israel, Schultz, Parker, &amp; Becker, 2001</xref>). This partnership must cross social, economic, political, and cultural barriers to reach goals and become sustainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911404230">Israel et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>CBPR has been commended as a process that facilitates community capacity building in terms of health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911404230">Shediac-Rizkallah &amp; Bone, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911404230">Poole (1997)</xref> indicated that “the purpose of capacity building is to foster conditions that strengthen the characteristics of communities that enable them to plan, develop, implement, and maintain effective community programs (p. 164).” Capacity building encourages community members to address their own health issues and allows health practitioners and organizations to assist in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911404230">Labonte &amp; Laverack, 2001</xref>), thus promoting sustainable solutions through community empowerment and leading to improved health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911404230">Israel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911404230">Smith, Littlejohns, &amp; Roy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Evaluation and measurement of capacity building within community projects has posed challenges to researchers that include, but are not limited to, a lack of valid and reliable instrumentation, ever-evolving community capacity constructs, and length of time required for community capacity building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911404230">Ebbesen, Heath, Naylor, &amp; Anderson, 2004</xref>). However, evaluation and measurement of capacity are critical to better define constructs of and track progress toward building community capacity and consequent health outcomes, as well as to understand elements and processes that contribute to capacity building. Various community capacity frameworks have been described that include a number of common constructs, among them resources, leadership, asking why, communication with community members, partnerships, and social or external networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911404230">Goodman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404230">Lempa, Goodman, Rice, &amp; Becker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911404230">Minkler, Breckwich Vasquez, Tajik, &amp; Petersen, 2008</xref>). Qualitative methods, including semistructured interviews and focus groups with academic representatives, community leaders, and members, in addition to the case study approach, have been extensively used to assess community capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911404230">Gibbon, Labonte, &amp; Laverack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911404230">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911404230">Labonte &amp; Laverack 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911404230">Minkler et al., 2008</xref>). A few studies have employed a mixed methods approach to evaluate community capacity, an approach that is considered to offer promise in better understanding its role in health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911404230">Gibbon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911404230">Labonte &amp; Laverack, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911404230">Smith et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>H.U.B City Steps is a CBPR walking intervention involving a collaboration among a public university, a local city government, and community members in a southern small city. A primary aim of this intervention is to lower blood pressure in participants who are drawn primarily from the African American population of the community. Elements of the intervention include empowerment, culturally tailored health education, and motivational interviewing to identify and track progress toward personal health goals.</p>
<p>As a CBPR project, a primary aim is to build community capacity to promote health through physical activity and nutrition. Aspects of the project that foster community capacity and therefore attainment of this aim include (a) inclusion of staff and faculty with a vested interest in the community; (b) involvement of project staff, a community advisory board (CAB), local city government, local agencies, and project participants in program development, implementation, evaluation, and overall guidance of project activities; and (c) development of participants’ skills and knowledge of health promotion to attain individual and community change. These are accomplished via core activities, including (1) recruiting and training community walking coaches (WCs) (a) to serve as role models and champions who will motivate their fellow residents to engage in physical activity and choose better eating habits and (b) to establish walking groups that will provide social support to program participants for healthy lifestyle changes; (2) conducting monthly nutrition education and physical activity sessions focused on making more health-conscious choices; (3) providing health screenings for program participants; (4) using motivational interviewing to encourage participants to identify lifestyle change priorities; and (5) promoting local community walking tracks to increase their visibility and use by residents.</p>
<p>The H.U.B. City Steps intervention also aims to assess community capacity for health promotion through the life of this CBPR project. The first step in this process was to engage the CAB in a collaborative process to identify and define a framework for assessing community capacity, through workshops conducted by research staff during the first project year. Having adopted the community capacity framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404230">Lempa et al. (2008)</xref> and its constructs, project staff guided the CAB in developing a working definition of each construct, from a community perspective. The CAB also developed a project mission statement and action plan for each community capacity construct. The H.U.B. City Steps community capacity framework and constructs then formed the basis for assessing perceptions of community capacity over the life of the project. This article describes perceptions early in the life of this CBPR community intervention, after intervention planning and walking coach recruitment and training but before intervention kick-off, across three groups of project stakeholders, using a mixed methods design.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This assessment included two components, described in more detail below. The quantitative component assessed community capacity perceptions using a questionnaire adapted from an instrument developed and empirically tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404230">Lempa et al. (2008)</xref> with participants from community initiatives across the United States. The qualitative component involved focus group–type listening sessions in which responses to the quantitative questionnaire were elaborated further.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524839911404230">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Three stakeholder groups were sampled for both components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911404230">Table 1</xref>). Project researchers and professional staff (RS) comprised a multidisciplinary team of researchers from nutrition, human performance, community health, and psychology, as well as the intervention, community, and recruitment coordinators who were all from the community. The CAB included members representing community-based and civic organizations, city government, and local health care agencies. WCs were volunteer community members who had been nominated by self, peers, or the CAB to serve as intervention walking group leaders. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board prior to data collection.</p>

<title>Community Capacity Questionnaire</title>
<p>Community capacity scales developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404230">Lempa et al. (2008)</xref> were utilized, asking representatives of each stakeholder group to rate the H.U.B. City Steps collaboration and its performance relative to selected community capacity constructs from a total of eight: leadership, resources, external networking, visibility and recognition, personnel sustainability, ability and commitment to organize action, communication with community members, and relationships with influential others. Item response was an 11-point Likert-type scale, with 0 denoting strongly disagree and 10 denoting strongly agree. Lempa et al.’s 44-item, six-factor scale for leaders was administered to the RS and CAB, and included items on leadership (10), resources (5), external networking (7), visibility/recognition (5), ability and commitment to organize action (10), and personnel sustainability (7). The 38-item, 5-factor scale for nonleaders was administered to the WC and included items on leadership (10), resources (4), ability and commitment to organize action (10), relationships with influential others (6), and communication with community members (8). Three scales—leadership, resources, and ability and commitment to organize action—termed <italic>universal constructs</italic>, were common to all groups. Questionnaires were distributed to RS through office mailboxes, to CAB members at a regular meeting, and to WC at a training meeting. Respondents were asked to complete the anonymous questionnaires at their convenience and return to research staff.</p>
<p>For analysis purposes, a construct score was calculated for each construct by averaging all items under the construct and transforming to a 10-point scale. Total community capacity scores were calculated by averaging the construct scores (6 for the RS and CAB leader scale, 5 for the WC nonleader scale, and 3 for comparisons across the three groups). SPSS 17.0 was used for all analyses. Total community capacity scores were compared between RS and CAB groups using an independent <italic>t</italic> test and across groups for the three universal constructs using an analysis of variance. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to examine differences: (a) between the RS and CAB for the six constructs in the leader scale and (b) among the three groups for the three universal constructs. For the MANOVAs, the Pillai’s trace test was interpreted to examine model significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) because of the negative skew of the data. This test is robust to such violations of multivariate analysis assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911404230">Field, 2005</xref>). Games–Howell post hoc tests were used to examine differences between groups due to unequal group sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911404230">Field, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839911404230">
<title>Listening Sessions</title>
<p>Listening sessions were conducted with volunteers from the RS, CAB, and WC groups. Questions were developed based on the results of the quantitative analysis. The listening session question guide included a total of 27 questions divided across 8 constructs. Special attention was given to the constructs for which there were significant quantitative differences between groups. The same questions were used for all three groups to elicit more detailed information about why the differences existed and how to address differences. Listening sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
<p>Themes elicited from the transcripts were used to develop a qualitative analysis codebook, which contained descriptions or definitions for each of the codes. The codebook was developed by a team of two researchers, one project staff, and one CAB member (qualitative analysis team).</p>
<p>The qualitative analysis team determined meaning and context using the eight constructs to help guide the interpretation. This method was used to increase internal consistency of code assignment. Once there was agreement across team members on context and meaning for each construct, quotes were extracted from the transcripts to provide examples for the interpretation. The team compared interpretations across groups and identified any notable differences between groups.</p>

<title>Listening Sessions</title>
<p>Two listening sessions were conducted with the RS (<italic>n</italic> = 8), one with the CAB (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and one with the WC (<italic>n</italic> = 12). Notable quotes for each construct from all groups are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524839911404230">Table 4</xref>. Data from the listening sessions on project leadership were examined closely because the CAB and the WC scored this construct significantly higher than the RS in the quantitative assessment. Of the nine questions asked concerning project leadership, one was “How do you think we can make the leadership more visible to people in our community?” There were several similar themes identified in the data analysis, including project members could attend community events outside of the project to build relationships with other community people and organizations (participation in community events), and they could make people aware of the project activities through networks such as faith-based, community organizations, sororities, and fraternities (awareness through visibility). Another theme viewed by project staff as a capacity building opportunity was that the community does not participate and understand the research aspect of the project (communicating knowledge about research with community members). Another question asked related to the leadership construct was “In what ways or areas could the leadership increase their follow through on commitments that have been made?” The CAB felt that the leadership was doing a great job, although the RS expressed reservations. One theme elicited from the RS reflected the need for more collaboration in the action plan (ability and commitment to organizing a collaborative plan). Like the WC, the RS felt that the community may not understand the research aspect of the project (communicating knowledge about research with community members). The CAB also expressed concerns in the area of leadership. One question was “In what ways or areas does the leadership need to show more compassion?” this elicited the theme that project members are not flexible by allowing the community to guide the project (flexibility in personnel sustainability). Conversely, another theme was that staff and community share openly and staff gives clear direction (leadership communication). When asked “In what ways or areas could the leadership increase their follow through on commitments that have been made?” WCs viewed themselves as the leadership indicating that project and community members working with the project may not motivate others in the community to adopt or maintain healthy physical lifestyle because they themselves did not display sufficient motivation (leadership not motivated).</p>

<p>The qualitative data focused on personnel sustainability were also examined closely since the CAB scored this construct significantly higher than the RS in the quantitative assessment. The first question asked concerning this construct was “If H.U.B. City Steps leaders left today, what do you think would happen with the project?” Themes elicited for the RS and the CAB included things such as all involved agree and understand the project (shared vision); all people are present that are needed to carry out the goals and objective of the project (human resources); training for community members to take on leadership roles and be effective in those roles (training community members); community and staff input in action plan (ability and commitment to organizing action); and personnel preparation for sustaining project (training of staff). Conversely, the RS expressed the sentiment that project and community members would not continue to actively participate over the length of the project (nonability and commitment to organizing action for sustainability), perhaps explaining the quantitative difference between the RS and CAB. A similar question asked “If H.U.B. City Steps leaders left today, what would need to happen for the goals of the project to be achieved?” Themes elicited from the RS and the CAB suggested opportunities for building capacity. The CAB noted availability of things such as money, people, community groups, and organizations to carry out the goals and objectives of the project (financial, human, and social resources), and that the project allows individuals to take on leadership roles (providing opportunities). Themes elicited from the RS reflected different perceptions of needs or limitations, and included things such as all people are not present that are needed to carry out the goals and objectives of the project (not enough human resources), and the project is not connected with all needed community groups and organizations to help carry out the goals and objectives (not enough social resources).</p>
<p>As previously stated, of the five constructs assessed quantitatively for the WC, four were rated 8 out of 10 or above. The fifth construct, communication with community members, had the lowest score among the constructs. The elicited themes related to this construct were that the community does not participate and understand the research aspect of the project (communicating knowledge about research with community members) and that information diffusion to the community may not be as effective as it could be (audience not reached).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The assessment of perceptions of community capacity for health promotion associated with the H.U.B. City Steps project described here was a baseline assessment before implementation of the walking intervention phase, but after considerable planning and training of WCs had been completed. This mixed methods assessment will be implemented annually to monitor changes in perceptions of capacity over the life of the project and to identify areas that need additional targeting for capacity building. The results suggest that the project is strong in its ability and commitment to organize; however, communication with community members and visibility/recognition of the project needs to improve. We are hopeful that this construct will be scored higher in the next round of data collection because we have taken suggestions from the listening sessions on the best ways to communicate and also better ways to make the project more visible. The project is naturally becoming more visible the longer it is in the community.</p>
<p>In the quantitative analysis, leadership was viewed significantly lower among researchers and staff compared with the other two groups. The researchers and staff also perceived personnel sustainability significantly lower when compared with the CAB members. Neither of these differences was apparent in the qualitative analysis. This may have occurred because the researchers and staff may not have felt as comfortable sharing their thoughts in the listening sessions because they were not anonymous as was the case with the self-administered questionnaire. Alternatively, this group may not have felt as confident about its own leadership role and performance on the project prior to the implementation of the intervention.</p>
<p>As stated previously, there have been few quantitative instruments measuring community capacity that have been developed and empirically tested. Community capacity is an abstract concept and difficult to measure quantitatively, therefore it seems helpful to use a mixed methods approach to obtain more comprehensive information as a basis for evaluation and future action. A limitation of this study is the small sample size, therefore decreasing the power to detect differences across groups. Thus, the potential for additional areas that needed to be addressed to increase the capacity may have been missed.</p>
<p>In this mixed methods assessment, the quantitative assessment allowed objective identification of specific areas where there were differences in group perceptions. The qualitative component then allowed further assessment of the reasons for these differences and ways to address them. This assessment has been a useful evaluation tool for this project in that it provides indications of strengths that are in place as well as weaknesses that need to be addressed to assure adequate community capacity for sustainability of project aims and accomplishments. Developing, identifying, and using methods to evaluate community capacity is an important adjunct to CBPR because of the importance in promoting sustainable community change.</p>
