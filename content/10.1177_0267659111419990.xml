<p><bold>Introduction</bold>: Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is suspected to be toxic for several reasons. During contact with a lipophilic medium, DEHP leaks from polyvinylchloride (PVC), but its influence on inflammatory reactions remains unknown. We examined specific DEHP leaching out of different tubing types, the possibly modulated liberation of proinflammatory cytokines and the induction of adhesion molecule expression in primary endothelial cells.</p>
<p><bold>Materials and Methods</bold>: Blood samples were circulated in traditional PVC, nodioctyl phthalate (DOP) PVC and heparin-coated PVC tubing within a Chandler loop model. The blood was tested for the concentration of DEHP and its active metabolites as well as the liberation of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL1ß. Furthermore, we exposed human endothelial cells to circulated blood and analysed them for the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: In contrast to the other tubing, PVC tubing showed significantly elevated DEHP levels, but no alteration was observed concerning a potential up-regulation of the cytokines or activation of the endothelial adhesion molecule receptors.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our data conclude that there is no correlation between DEHP leaching and the inflammatory response after ECC support, but this study showed that even DEHP-free material is leaching DEHP and its toxic metabolites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The polymer-synthetic material polyvinylchloride (PVC) is found in numerous medical products as a raw material, especially in the field of cardiovascular surgery during extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Additionally, PVC forms the basis for vascular catheters and tubing for dialysis or apheresis. It offers simple and cost-effective production, good processability and high bio- and hemocompatibility. By adding softener, a greater flexibility of PVC is obtained without reducing its consistency. The lipophilic Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is the most used plasticizer; however, DEHP can be released out of the tubing by evaporation, migration, rubbing or elution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419990">1</xref></sup>. When using PVC as a biomaterial that contacts lipid-containing substances (e.g., blood), a slow, but permanent release of DEHP is to be expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111419990">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111419990">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The application of plasticizers, especially of DEHP, has been discussed controversial for a long time. In animal experiments, the toxic features of DEHP and its metabolites, especially regarding deployment and reproduction, have been demonstrated. Additionally, DEHP-exposed animals showed endocrine disorders, but, indeed, its toxicity is still unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111419990">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111419990">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Tri(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate (TEHTM), also called noDOP, is a suitable alternative to DEHP. Compared to DEHP, it possesses a lower softening effect and is more difficult to extract from the polymeric matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111419990">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111419990">9</xref></sup>. However, materials that are added to TETHM as a plasticizer instead of DEHP also release traces of DEHP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111419990">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111419990">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Additional surface coating could possibly reduce the washing out of DEHP from biomaterials. Occasionally, extracorporeal tubing systems are coated with bioactive substances to increase their hemocompatibility. For this purpose, they are often coated with heparin (e.g., in the case of Carmeda® (Carmeda Bioactive surface, (CBAS®), Medtronic, Meerbusch, Germany) The extent to which the proven better hemocompatibility of the Carmeda® surface coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111419990">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111419990">15</xref></sup> effects a higher barrier regarding the release of DEHP has already been analysed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419990">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111419990">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To our current knowledge, there is no information available whether DEHP and its metabolites may trigger proinflammatory cytokine liberation, thereby, stimulating adhesion molecule expression and creating potentially serious perioperative complications. When inflammatory activation is observed, the endothelial cells express adhesion molecules on their surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111419990">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659111419990">19</xref></sup>. They represent a group of different glycoproteins and carbohydrates expressed on the surface of a wide variety of cell types, including endothelial cells. By interfering with receptors on the leukocytes, adhesion molecules allow initial contact between leukocytes and the vessel wall. Firm adhesion and transendothelial migration follow, resulting in a sequestration of leukocytes at the endothelium and the later infiltration of the interstitial space. The release of proteolytic enzymes and oxygen-free radicals damages cellular integrity and, therefore, the integrity of the affected organ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111419990">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659111419990">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our investigation series is based on the observations that operations performed with ECC support may induce severe inflammatory reactions and that this complication can be limited by shortening the tubing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659111419990">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659111419990">23</xref></sup>. This effect may not be explained by the reduced surface contact of the blood. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether there is a connection between the potential leaching of DEHP from tubing and the liberation of proinflammatory cytokines and, especially, the expression of adhesion molecules in human primary endothelial cells.</p>

<title>Tubing systems and blood donors</title>
<p>This study used human whole blood provided by six healthy donors of different genders aged 20-30 years. Exclusion criteria were as follows: smoking and taking medication within the two weeks prior to blood donation, especially those influencing blood coagulation (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid, contraceptives, non-steroidal analgesics). To determine their barrier effects towards DEHP release and, as a possible result, endothelial activation, the following three tubing systems were tested:</p>

<p>The tubing systems had a length of 50 cm with an inner diameter of 3/8” and a shore-hardness of 75±5 (according to DIN EO ISO 868).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0267659111419990">
<title>Chandler loop</title>
<p>Experiments were performed using an in vitro closed-loop model (modified Chandler loop) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659111419990">24</xref></sup>. In brief, the tubing was filled with 20-mL blood samples, closed and rotated vertically at 15 rpm in a water bath at 37°C for 60 and 120 minutes. Serum samples were retrieved from the 20-mL human whole blood after a circulation time of 60 and 120 minutes in the Chandler loop at 15 rpm and 37°C via centrifugation. Identical blood without loop contact was used as a control. Hence, per donor, two tubing systems of the three types were applied each time — one to determine the 60-minute value and one to determine the 120-minute value.</p>
<p>In detail: the experiments were repeated 6 times by using blood from 6 healthy donors in a Chandler loop model. This means that one experiment (blood from one donor) was performed in three different tubing types:</p>

<title>Analysis of the serum samples on DEHP and its metabolites</title>
<p>A quantitative analysis of DEHP and its metabolites was performed by selected ion monitoring gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer (Finnigan 4000 quadrupole mass spectrometer, Thermo Electron Corp., Bremen, Germany) equipped with a gas chromatograph MFC 500 (Carlo Erba, Mainz, Germany) was operated in negative ion chemical ionization mode to monitor the negative ions at m/z 148. For separation of the analytes, a 20-m capillary column (DB1, J &amp; W Scientific, 0.18 mm inner diameter and 0.18 mm film thickness, Langen, Germany) was used. Identification and quantification of the analytes were carried out by comparison with purchased and synthesized reference substances. Only the concentration of 4-hydroxy-MEHP was determined with the response factor of the reference substance 5-hydroxy-MEHP. The limit of detection was approximately 0.0001 mg/L serum for DEHP and metabolites and 0.001 mg/L for PA.</p>

<title>Cell culture experiment</title>
<sec id="section7-0267659111419990">
<title>Isolation and cultivation of the endothelial cells</title>
<p>Endothelial cells were obtained from vein specimens of the saphenous vein, which remained as remnants after elective CABG. All patients gave their written consent, and the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Tübingen, Faculty of Medicine. Exclusion criteria were on-going infections, usage of venous material other than the saphenous vein and a time delay between harvesting and further preparation of more than 3 hours.</p>
<p>Isolation and cultivation were done as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659111419990">25</xref></sup>. Briefly, all culture plates and flasks were coated overnight with collagen (40%) (Collagen G, Biochrom, Terre Haute, IN, USA). After incubation in Roswell Park Medical Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (containing 0.5%/ml gentamycin), the vein was rinsed with buffer solution (137 mM NaCl/ 5.4 mM KCl/ 4.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/ 5 mM D-Glucose in 500 ml H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.3, sterile). Endothelial cells (EC) were harvested by collagenase treatment (0.1% in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany) followed by culture in EGM-2 medium containing a final concentration of 5% FBS and growth factors (+bullet kit, Cambrex Bio Science Verviers, S.p.r.l., Verviers, Belgium). Cells were split after reaching confluence. For all experiments, cells from the third or fourth passage were used. The purity of the EC was controlled by staining with a FITC-labelled antibody for human CD31 (Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany).</p>

<sec id="section8-0267659111419990">
<title>Activations of the endothelial cells</title>
<p>For stimulation of the endothelial cells, the medium was aspirated. Afterwards, 500 µL endothelial cell medium and 500 µL of the corresponding serum were given to 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells and incubated for 12 to 15 hours under standard conditions. For analysis via flow cytometry, two negative controls were measured. One negative control “control 0” contained un-stimulated endothelial cells and one “0 serum” contained endothelial cells that were activated with serum that had had no contact with the PVC tubing. Endothelial cells that were stimulated with 2,5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α(BD Bioscience, D-Heidelberg, Germany) for 12 hours served as a positive control for ICAM-1 when flow cytometry was applied. For real-time PCR positive control, endothelial cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α (BD Bioscience, D-Heidelberg) for 12 hours to express intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1. To stimulate the expression of VCAM-1, a minimum TNFα concentration of 5 ng/ml is necessary. Therefore, we decided to stimulate the human vascular endothelial cells (HVEC) with 5 ng/ml TNF-α. Although the stimulation of E-selectin achieves the maximum after 4 h of stimulation, the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 reaches the maximum after 12h, therefore, the positive control for E-selectin was treated equally with 12h of stimulation. For the negative control, non-activated endothelial cells were measured.</p>

<sec id="section9-0267659111419990">
<title>Determination of ICAM1, VCAM1 and E-Selectin expression</title>
<p>To expose a possible endothelial activation expression of the adhesion molecules, ICAM1, VCAM1 and E-selectin of cultivated human endothelial cells collected from the vena saphena were measured. Measurements were performed after the endothelial cells were incubated with serum samples of the respective tubing with circulation times of 60 or 120 minutes in the Chandler loop. For ICAM-1, flow cytometry flow activated cell sorting(FACS) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied; for VCAM-1 and E-selectin, only real-time PCR was applied.</p>
<sec id="section10-0267659111419990">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>HVEC exposed to serum samples, TNF-α or untreated were stained for 1h at 4°C with PE-labelled ICAM-1 antibody (Becton Dickinson GmbH) diluted in 0.5 % FCS according to the manufacturers instructions. After washing and detaching, the cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Flow cytometric analyses (5000 cells/measurement) were performed in a FACScanTM (Becton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and evaluated with the CellQuestPro software (Becton Dickinson GmbH). The GeoMean values were used for further analyses.</p>

<title>Semi-quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) from cultured HVEC was purified using an Aurum<sup>TM</sup> Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). Consecutively, 200 ng of each RNA sample was reverse transcribed using an iScript<sup>TM</sup> cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer design was done with the software ‘Primer3’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267659111419990">26</xref></sup> and Primer Premier 5 (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA).

All PCR reactions contained IQTMSYBR®Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.,), 400 nM forward and reverse primer and 2 ng of cDNA in a total volume of 15 µl. All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. Normalized gene expression was calculated by the ΔCt method using glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a reference.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the software package JMP, version 7.0.1, (SAS Institute, Cary, IN). Box-Cox transformations were performed at most variables for variance stabilization. The transformed values were transformed back for interpretation of the results and presented as averages with their 95% confidence intervals. At some variables, values were logarithmised. For interpretation of the results, logarithms were de- logarithmised and output as geometric averages. The analysis of variance contained the tubing type as the fixed factor and the experiment number as the random number. Taking account of the different times (60 or 120 minutes), the different tubing types were tested in pairs on differences with the Tukey-HSD-test.</p>

Furthermore, the 60- minute (2.996±1.896 mg/l) and the 120-minute (5.233±1.024 mg/l) values of this group differed significantly. The noDOP® group also showed a significant increase in 2-ethylhexanol concentration in the serum samples (60 min: 1.148±0.408 mg/l and 120 min: 0.971±0.259 mg/l). The 2-ethylhexanol concentration of the 60-minute and 120-minute samples of the Carmeda® group remained below the detection limit of 0.1 mg/l.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Modern medicine, especially heart surgery, would be unimaginable without tubing systems and PVC is still the standard for fabrication. However, besides its highly visible benefits, PVC is still the subject of criticism (focussed on its plasticizer DEHP). The potential influence of DEHP and its metabolites on human fertility, especially the Sertoli cells of the sperm channel and spermiogenesis, is widely known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267659111419990">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267659111419990">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, some alternatives had to be found to eliminate DEHP from PVC. Actually, TETHM is widely accepted due to its make-up (which is comparable to that of DEHP) and its lack of negative qualities. Moreover, with the coating of the PCV material, leaching is theoretically disabled or delayed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111419990">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Within the present study, different tubing types were tested on their DEHP release into the blood under standardized in vitro conditions, the so-called Chandler loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659111419990">24</xref></sup>. We wanted to clarify the extent to which a coating of the PVC basic material affects the transfer of DEHP into the blood and whether the usage of TETHM eliminates DEHP entirely. Therefore, we investigated three different types of tubing materials used for manufacturing ECC systems, dialysis catheters and other tubing systems.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we were able to demonstrate that a CBAS-coating (as it is used in Carmeda® tubing systems, for example) reduces DEHP elution significantly compared to PVC tubing. However, the measured DEHP serum concentration of the Carmeda® group was significantly higher than that of the control group and still detectable on a basic level. Therefore, a CBAS coating, indeed, causes a barrier effect against the release of DEHP into blood, but it cannot prevent it completely. These results correspond to those of Haishima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111419990">16</xref></sup> and Burkhart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419990">1</xref></sup> The clinical consequence of these findings is that, because so little DEHP is released from heparin-coated tubing, the dose of DEHP received by many patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass will be less than those undergoing the procedure where uncoated PVC tubing is used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267659111419990">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we tested noDOP® material. It is an uncoated PVC tubing, where TEHTM is used as plasticizer instead of DEHP. TEHTM is distinguished by its low acute toxic potential compared to DEHP, as well as its low metabolism rate. Additionally, TEHTM is eluted much less from PVC than DEHP because of its higher molecular weight and its lower solubility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267659111419990">32</xref></sup>. As is already known, we also could detect DEHP in the serum samples of the noDOP® group. Indeed, the measured DEHP concentration was significantly lower than those of the others, but it was significantly higher than that of the control.</p>
<p>At a second level, we wanted to focus on a potential time dependence of DEHP release. Therefore, we analysed the serum levels after a circulation time of 60 and 120 minutes in the Chandler loop. The determined values for contact times of 60 and 120 minutes did not differ significantly between any of the groups. In contrast, Loff et al. determined a significant DEHP increase at PVC infusion tubing after a contact time of 24 hours compared to a contact time of 4 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267659111419990">33</xref></sup>. Haishima et al. also assumed a time-dependent increase of the DEHP serum level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111419990">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have dealt with DEHP release from PVC-based biomaterials and highlighted the question of a systemic inflammatory reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267659111419990">34</xref></sup>. However, studies focussing on concrete effects of immediately affected tissue (in particular, the endothelium) are currently lacking. Just as we are discussing DEHP lowering of PVC systems, it should kept in mind that the “infernal stuff” cannot be eliminated totally and, therefore, a relationship can still be hypothesized between an inflammatory reaction after the massive use of PVC products as it can be observed after ECC operations. Both TNFα and IL-1α were detected consistently in all samples; however, the determined values were not significantly different among the three groups. Nevertheless, there was a correlation between the corresponding DEHP release and the TNFα and IL-1α levels. The samples of the PVC group showed elevated levels of TNFα and IL-1α compared to the other groups. Our results corresponded with those of other investigators, revealing a lower TNFα and IL-1α level when coated PVC systems were used, but they did not show statistically significant differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267659111419990">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267659111419990">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Adhesion molecule expression in venous endothelial cells not only can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines, but by a lot of others as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111419990">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267659111419990">40</xref></sup>. Less is known about the capacity of DEHP and its active metabolites to react on the endothelial cell layer and, therefore, the impact of inducing adhesion molecule expression outside the liberation of proinflammatory cytokines. The in vitro expression of three adhesion molecules on human endothelial cells was analysed by flow cytometry, real-time PCR and the Western blot. With flow cytometry, we could not find significant differences for the expression of ICAM-1 among the three tested tubing types or within the corresponding groups between the 60 or 120-minute circulation time values. The results of the more sensitive real-time PCR confirmed those from the flow cytometry. No significant up-regulation in any of the three adhesion molecules was detected. Therefore, we could not find any indication that the well-known toxicity of DEHP on spermiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267659111419990">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267659111419990">30</xref></sup> has any relation to endothelial activation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Concerning the results of our study, we can state that there is no evidence of a connection between any pathophysiological inflammatory reaction and DEHP leaching and its active metabolites. This can be seen as a valuable piece of information, because the question of systemic inflammatory response after ECC is still imperfectly explained. Furthermore, as a result of our study, one should keep in mind that “DEHP-free” materials leach low levels of detectable DEHP and its metabolites, but they still exist.</p>
