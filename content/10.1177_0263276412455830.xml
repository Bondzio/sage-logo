<abstract>
<p>This article argues that Foucault’s account of the intersection between population, liberal economy, and biopolitics needs to be reconstructed in light of Malthus’ <italic>Essay on the Principle of Population</italic>. Taking Malthus into account brings to the fore how deeply the question of population is tied to a colonial hierarchy that differentiates between dangerous ‘savage’ and economic ‘civilized’ life. ‘Savage life’ is depicted as a catastrophic form of life, which uses resources in a non-economic way due to its forgetfulness of the future. The article shows how this notion of ‘savage life’ broadens the concept of liberal economic governmentality. Most importantly, it highlights the role of passions and futurity for liberal governmentality. As the discussion of Malthus’ texts demonstrates, the passions of hope and fear assume a crucial role for engendering futurity in the economic subject. As will be shown, while the more ‘savage life’ is considered to be made governable through fear, the more civilized life is supposed to be allured by hope. The article points out the implication of this analysis for Foucault’s notion of biopolitics in relation to liberal economy.</p>

<p>In his lectures on <italic>Security, Territory, Population</italic>, Foucault argues that the object of population transformed the meaning of politics and economy in modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 67). It might not be an exaggeration to say that Foucault’s innovative account of the history of liberalism is an outcome of taking population as an object of governing seriously. Discourses on population interlace political, economic, and biological dimensions (Bashford, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412455830">Connelly, 2006</xref>). By focusing on this ‘boundary object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0263276412455830">Star, 1989</xref>), Foucault makes two claims about liberalism. First, the question of population introduces a biopolitical concern for the life of the ‘species’ into liberal politics. Population is a type of collectivity that is looked at in terms of how it ‘exists, subsists and subsists at an optimal level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 44, 75; 1990: 142). Second, the problem of population furthers the elaboration of economic modes of governing. Economy is understood as belonging to a political rationality that works through the manipulation of milieus, incentives and interests. Liberalism, one could say, looks differently to Foucault because he looks at it through the lenses of population.</p>
<p>Taking into account the paramount importance of the question of population for Foucault, it is remarkable how little attention he granted to the fundamental ruptures in the genealogy of the concept of population itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 33). While Foucault did address changes in the notion of population during the 18th century, he never dealt extensively with one of the most important shifts in the discourse on population, which is commonly tied to the publication of Thomas Robert Malthus’ <italic>Essay on the Principle of Population</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276412455830">Malthus, 1986 [1798]</xref>). This is a curious omission to say the least. Within the intellectual history of economic thought, it is widely recognized that Malthus’ text marked a watershed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412455830">Halévy, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412455830">Milgate and Stimson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0263276412455830">Winch, 1987</xref>). As Milgate and Stimson put it, ‘[t]he introduction of the principle of population into British political economy in the late 1790s marked the most significant transformation that occurred in the subject as it moved into the nineteenth century. It could not have been more influential’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412455830">Milgate and Stimson, 2009</xref>: 121). The <italic>Principle of Population</italic> introduced a fundamental fear of boundless reproduction into liberal economic discourse. As to be detailed below, it raised the specter of overpopulation and made the notion of scarcity central for liberal economic discourse in ways that it had not been before. With Malthus, the sexual, the economic, the biological and political dimension of population acquired a sense of impending catastrophe and ‘bioeconomic’ necessity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 120, 149).</p>
<p>How does the understanding of economic governmentality change if one takes Malthus’ catastrophic notion of population into account? This question guides this article. It argues that re-visiting Malthus’ notion of population amounts to re-opening the question of how to write the genealogy of liberal economy. The article attempts to substantiate three interrelated claims. A reading of Malthus will show that the catastrophism of the notion of population is linked to a colonial hierarchy, which differentiates between dangerous ‘savage’ and economic ‘civilized life’. Putting it into a nutshell, it is only ‘savage life' that will produce a coming catastrophe due to its alleged forgetfulness regarding the future. Taking into account this definition of ‘savage life’ sheds a new light on the role of scarcity for economic governmentality. Scarcity does not simply denote a situation in which there are more needs than resources. Instead, scarcity appears in this discourse as a regulatory device to generate a sense of futurity over and against the immediacy of ‘savage life’. These findings make it possible to trace a broader meaning of economic governing. Within Malthus’ texts one can detect the outlines of an economic governmentality that consists of a politics of fear (and hope), which aims at inculcating a sense of the economic future into the mind of ‘savage life’.</p>
<p>In sum, taking note of the Malthusian notion of population demonstrates the need for a more variegated and critical genealogy of liberal economy that is able to address the internal hierarchizations of the notion of population and the role of futurity and affect for liberal economy. The intersections between ‘biopolitics and economic governmentality’ appear in a different light, and the role of colonialism for the ‘twinned genealogy of political economy and biopolitics’ comes to the fore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276412455830">Rasmussen, 2011</xref>: 35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0263276412455830">Stoler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276412455830">Venn, 2009</xref>: 209). Many scholars have begun to re-work and re-visit Foucault’s categories of governmentality and biopolitics, in order to address the ways in which a ‘politics of life itself’ is tied to economic calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412455830">Best, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412455830">Bröckling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412455830">Cooper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412455830">Dillon and Lobo-Guerrero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412455830">Hardt and Negri, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276412455830">Lemke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276412455830">Rose, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0263276412455830">Sunder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412455830">Waldby and Mitchell, 2006</xref>). This work seeks to contribute to these efforts of conceptual calibration. But it goes backwards in order to achieve this aim: it adds a new facet to the multiple genealogy of the economic governing of species-life and derives from this historical case the broader theoretical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412455830">Dillon and Lobo Guerrero, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The article starts by situating Malthus in the ‘epistemic break’ between the 18th and 19th centuries that Foucault himself had diagnosed in his early work on <italic>The Order of Things</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1994</xref>). The first part gives a short account of the changes in the notion of population that Malthus’ writings crystallize and reflects on the conspicuous negligence of Malthus in Foucault. A second section discusses the colonial genealogy of population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276412455830">Banerjee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412455830">Blaney and Inayatullah, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412455830">Kalpagam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0263276412455830">Zein-Elabdin and Charusheela, 2004</xref>). The third section demonstrates how the hierarchization between savage and civilized life is based on a problematization of economic futurity and brings these findings to bear on the notion of economic government in Foucault. The final section discusses how these findings relate to the Foucauldian conception of biopolitics and economy.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276412455830"><title>Malthus, Population and the Anthropology of Finitude</title>
<p>In his early work on <italic>The Order of Things</italic>, Foucault has located a fundamental epistemic break between the analysis of wealth in the 18th century and the science of political economy in the 19th century. Scholarship in the history of economic thought resonates with Foucault’s account. This literature describes the economic liberalism of the 18th century – as it can be found in the writings of the Scottish Enlightenment or as represented by the writings of Thomas Paine or Marquis de Condorcet – as being a world apart from the science of political economy that was to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412455830">Brown, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412455830">Hont and Ignatieff, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412455830">Milgate and Stimson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276412455830">Rothschild, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0263276412455830">Schabas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276412455830">Tribe, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0263276412455830">Winch, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0263276412455830">1996</xref>). While Foucault is thus not alone in emphasizing this break, he gave a specific account of the meaning of this shift. He reads it as belonging to the advent of the ‘anthropology of finitude’ that fundamentally altered the notion of economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In the ‘Classical age’, as Foucault calls it, the notion of economy was defined by a differential relation between desires, needs and goods that are ordered on the surface of representation. In this formation, scarcity was only an experience of a relative lack. In contrast, the economics of the modern age is precipitated on the assumption of a ‘fundamental insufficiency’: ‘What makes economics possible, and necessary, then, is a perpetual and fundamental situation of scarcity … it is no longer in the interplay of representation that economics finds its principle, but near that perilous region where life is in confrontation with death.’ Foucault notes that this understanding of a ‘fundamental insufficiency’ is related to a conception of the ‘biological properties of the species, which, as Malthus showed in the same period as Ricardo, tends always to increase unless prevented by some remedy or constraint’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1994</xref>: 256). Foucault goes on to explain the changed understanding of economic subjectivity. The economic subject finds itself suddenly in a<disp-quote>
<p>perpetual and fundamental situation of scarcity: confronted by a nature that is in itself inert and, save for one very small part, barren, man risk his life … [homo oeconomicus] is the human being who spends, wears out, and wastes his life in evading the imminence of death. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1994</xref>: 256)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Curiously, this account of the ‘anthropology of finitude’ only plays a minor role in Foucault’s later account of liberal economy. In his lectures on liberal governmentality he only mentions the ‘anthropology of finitude’ in passing. He asserts that the emergence of the living being, the working individual and speaking subject as foundational figures of the modern episteme should be seen in the context of the emergence of population as an object of governing; he also insinuates that the ‘opposition between Malthus and Marx would be proof that in the nineteenth century the problem of population is still really central’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 77–79). But beyond such cursory remarks that the ‘anthropology of finitude’ and the political-economic object of population are related, there is no analysis of how exactly the ‘bio-economic’ problem of population changes with the Malthusian rendering of the catastrophic population. Foucault never truly ventured to understand the figure of population in terms of the ‘anthropology of finitude’ that he had described in <italic>The Order of Things</italic> and the role he had granted to Malthus therein.</p>
<p>Foucault’s genealogy of the object of population emphasizes instead shifts before the emergence of ‘anthropology of finitude’ and the publication of Malthus’ principle of population. Let us recall shortly Foucault’s genealogy of population in order to pinpoint what goes missing by omitting Malthus. Foucault focuses on two changes in the notion of population that occurred in the 17th and 18th century respectively. Firstly, Foucault argues that the question of population acquired a ‘positivity and generality’ as an object of governmental reason that went beyond former concerns of undoing a previous de-population by hunger and war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 67, 68). He specifically points out cameralism and mercantilism as two governmental rationalities, which emphasize the dynamics of ‘population as a productive force’ in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 69; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 27–30, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412455830">Bayatrizi, 2008</xref>: 131). Secondly, and more important for the analysis of liberal governmentality, Foucault diagnoses another shift in the problematization of population after mercantilism. The population was newly regarded as a ‘thick natural phenomenon’ that is explicitly opposed to the ‘legalistic voluntarism’ of previous attempts to organize the productivity of the population. Population is now linked to the variables of a milieu and to the ‘naturalness of desire’, which Foucault understands as ‘the pursuit of the individual’s interest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 72, 73). Foucault links the birth of liberal economic governmentality, which works through and with the ‘laws, principles, and mechanisms of reality itself’, to this latter shift in population discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 48, 76).</p>
<p>But, as Mitchell Dean has perspicaciously argued, Foucault’s interweaving of the genealogy of population and liberal economic government misses the third ‘definite break’ at the close of the 18th century that Malthus’ <italic>Principle of Population</italic> paradigmatically stands for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 69). Different to his predecessors, Malthus’ concept of population gives the ‘naturality’ of the population a hue of impending and ingrained catastrophe: ‘Malthus introduced a constant and pressing disequilibrium between population and means of subsistence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 120). The ‘<italic>bioeconomic</italic> laws of population and subsistence’ were about a population that would by its ingrained ‘naturality’ always increase faster than the means of subsistence and thus invite a permanent and perpetual threat of scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412455830">Halévy, 1995</xref>: 66, 11). Dean concludes, ‘it is impossible to understand the classical liberal mode of government of poverty without understanding the Malthusian intervention and its consequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 68). It is all the more curious that Foucault himself did not grant a more pronounced role to the Malthusian intervention given that he had already contemplated on the importance of what he termed the ‘Malthusian couple’ as a central hinge in the biopolitics of population in <italic>The History of Sexuality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1990</xref>: 105). What happens if we take Malthus into account, who is both present and absent in Foucault?</p>
<p>Mitchell Dean’s work on the impact of Malthus on the government of the domestic poor already provides some leads for understanding how deeply the question of population is linked to differential regimes of valorizing and enhancing certain ‘forms of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 81). The last section will return to this argument. For the moment it is only important to realize that Malthus’ principle of population is a discursive knot in which all important aspects of Foucault’s argument on liberal economy, on the ‘anthropology of finitude’ and the biopolitics of population coalesce in a way that demands more attention. Malthus’ principle of population was an intervention in a heavily waged debate within liberalism about the ‘right to live’ (Malthus, 1986: 505). Engaged in a tug of war and written as an answer to Thomas Paine, Marquis de Condorcet and William Godwin, Malthus argued against the guarantee of the right to subsistence. Putting it in stark terms, Malthus contemplated that one had to let die those who have found no place in the circulation of labour and things.<disp-quote>
<p>A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society does not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders … if these guests get up and make room for him … the order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity. (Malthus, 1986: 697ff.)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Malthus used these stark terms only in the first edition of the <italic>Essay on the Principle of Population.</italic> It was removed due to the uproar it caused. But Malthus never wavered on the position he took in this debate. To him, the naturality of the population implied that the ‘right to live’ would be a threat to all. He expanded his original essay considerably to press his point and to prove the universality of the issue of population. The expanded edition of his essay from 1803 makes abundantly clear that for understanding this threat, one has to stray from the domestic scene and to take into account that this threat specifically was linked to ‘savage’ as opposed to ‘civilized’ life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412455830">Davenport, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276412455830"><title>Savage Life and Catastrophic Abundance</title>
<p>Malthus’ <italic>Essay on Population</italic> commences with lengthy descriptions of how the laws of population have been playing themselves out across the globe. These descriptions of geographically distant areas are linked to a temporal distance: Over one hundred pages are spent on a construction of a quasi-state of nature that is juxtaposed spatially and temporally to the civilized state of order. Akin to the canonical political treatises of modernity, the state of nature is not just a thought experiment but has a concrete historical-empirical referent in the colonies and at the shores of European expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0263276412455830">Shapiro, 2006</xref>: 46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412455830">Buchan, 2005</xref>: 5). What Malthus finds described in the travel diaries of James Cook, Alexander von Humboldt, by colonial administrators of India or anthropological accounts of the American Indians <italic>inter alia</italic> serves him as a witness’s report of the degrees of civilization found in different spots on the earth.</p>
<p>His narrative about the savage state commences with ‘the wretched inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego [that] have been placed, by the general consent of voyagers, at the bottom of the scale of human beings’ (Malthus, 1986: 22). Malthus depicts a bodily and social state of utter despair and dissolution. The description of the ‘race of savages’ as ‘half starved … shivering with cold, and covered with filth and vermin’ embellishes the Hobbesian account of the state of nature as being ‘brutish, nasty and short’ with further detail. The misery is written all over the individual body: ‘Their stature seldom exceeds five feet; their bellies are protuberant, with high shoulders, large heads, and limbs disproportionally slender … in general, [they] are neither tall nor well made’ (Malthus, 1986: 22ff.). The children are ‘deformed, dwarfish, mutilated, blind and deaf’. In extended descriptions, Malthus pictures a savage body that is marked by ‘perpetual diseases’, by ‘pleuritic, asthmatic, and paralytic disorders’ and that suffers from ‘inconsiderate gluttony in one case, and their severe abstinence in the other’ (Malthus, 1986: 32ff.). These ‘naked and despicable’ beings are depicted as ugly and deformed members of the human species. They are ‘at twenty two, according to Bruce, more wrinkled and deformed by age than a European woman at sixty.’ Their whole being arouses disgust in the gaze of the European observer: ‘Nothing could be so disgusting as their mode of living’ (Malthus, 1986: 97, 102).</p>
<p>As scholars have pointed out, the colonial imagination had a ‘lengthy and timeless fascination with colonial nakedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276412455830">Levine, 2008</xref>: 189). The depiction of natives’ nakedness signified a lack of shame, a state of unconsciousness and a ‘monstrously and overly sexual’ being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276412455830">Levine, 2008</xref>: 192ff.). Racism and sexuality have been inextricably linked in modern discourses on the proper civil order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0263276412455830">Stoler, 1995</xref>: 35). The abundance of clothes and of things, as Susan Buck-Morss has put it in her account of the visualizations of modern economy, makes the civilized body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412455830">Buck-Morss, 1995</xref>: 450). Corporeal vulnerability, savagery and sexuality are conjoined with the images of the naked native, in all respects the opposite of what was understood by social and economic refinement by the West in the 18th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0263276412455830">Young, 1995</xref>). But how far and in which ways are these lengthy references to the colonial body constitutive or crucial for the articulation of liberal economy in the 19th century? How has the ‘disciplinary development of economics been implicated in the West’s strategy of alterity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412455830">Callari, 2004</xref>)?</p>
<p>The context of Malthus’ writings suggests that the colonial imagination had an impact on the articulation of political economy. The administrative changes in colonial government and the revolutionary upheavals abroad form the backdrop of Malthus’ writings on population. Malthus obtained one of the first chairs for political economy at the East India College, subsequently named Haileybury College, that was founded by the British East India Company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412455830">James, 1979</xref>: 168–175). Its purpose was to train Company servants for administration. At the beginning of the 19th century, the British East India Company was in the course of becoming a governing body instead of a merely trading body and British Empire understood itself less and less as a purely commercial undertaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412455830">Pitts, 2005</xref>: 13). But this contextual backdrop does not yet allow pinpointing a profound link between such invocation of the abject colonial body and the re-framing of liberal economy. It signals a conjuncture, but no systematic connection. For exploring such systematic connection, it is instructive to compare the role that the ‘savage state’ has played for Adam Smith’s account of liberal economy to the role it played for Malthus.</p>
<p>The savage state is a common trope for 18th-century political and social thought and by no means specific to Malthus. But the way the ‘savage state’ was referred to changed at the turn of the 19th century in slight but consequential ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412455830">Pitts, 2005</xref>). For Smith, just as it has been for John Locke before, the savage state is characterized by a lack of differentiation in the division of labour, in property and trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412455830">Blaney and Inayatullah, 2010</xref>: 43). At the same time, it depicted a state of deprivation or scarcity that makes progress the inevitable consequence of a life that is too precarious for humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276412455830">Marouby, 2007</xref>: 94). The movement from this savage state towards civilization occurred through growth of population, intensification of invention and the slow emergence of the division of labour. For Smith – as for the 18th century in general – population was one element of an evolving order that hinged on exchange, specialization of needs and property rights: bodies, exchange and division of labour were growing in tandem, one element pushing the others forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412455830">Pitts, 2005</xref>: 29). But the very ‘spatio-temporal’ narrative of a progressing economic order that had dominated Smith’s understanding of population changed with Malthus. The savage state is no longer characterized by a mere absence of the division of labour. It is no longer the unproblematic vantage point of a progressing order. The principle of population introduced a moment of rupture within this narrative of progression: it becomes a dominant and threatening element – the needy and reproducing body undoes the progressive mechanism. As Catherine Gallagher coined it, Malthus’ ‘bioeconomics’ valorized <italic>and</italic> problematized the body to a novel extent: ‘Malthus, thus, turns the body into an absolute social problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412455830">Gallagher, 1986</xref>: 86). Hence, to understand how the colonial body is tied to the conceptualization of liberal economy one has to elucidate how it presents an ‘absolute social problem’ in paradigmatic and novel ways, which restates at the same time what the economic problem is about. In other words, how is economy at stake in these scenes populated by vulnerable, suffering, but also disgusting and ‘monstrously sexual’ bodies?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it is not economy in the sense of scarcity that conditions this desolate state. Quite to the contrary, the condition of man in the state of nature is usually defined by a ‘gift of nature to man’, as Malthus explains. ‘If the earth had been so niggardly of her produce as to oblige all her inhabitants to labour for it, no manufactures or ideal persons could ever have existed. But her first intercourse with man was a voluntary present.’ Hence, not scarcity but abundance or even ‘extreme fertility’ of the soil is the original situation of man in the state of nature (Malthus, 1986: 392, 271; 1986b: 113). It is the very precondition for the history of progression to commence, allowing ‘a greater number of people to subsist together [and therefore] would give the fairest chance to the inventive powers of the human mind’ (Malthus, 1986: 44). But this ‘gift of nature’ is perpetually transformed into a state of misery, as we learn from Malthus’ tireless descriptions of how the principle of population works its course in all quarters of the world. ‘[I]n whatever abundance the productions of these islands may be found at certain periods … the average population … presses hard against the limits of the average food’. Thus, ‘savage life’ vibrates ‘between two extremes, and consequently the oscillations between want and plenty are strongly marked, as we should naturally expect among the less civilized nation’ (Malthus, 1986: 58, 154).</p>
<p>This account of the state of nature ties the lack of economy to a lack of history. History appears as frozen in its oscillation between ‘want and plenty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1994</xref>: 257). It is immobilized, but not because it has reached its end, as Foucault described it in his analysis of economic discourse in the 19th century, but because the temporal sequence of material progress has not even commenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1994</xref>: 259). The principle of population is a principle that locks the human species into its savage slot <italic>because it fails to unlock</italic> historical and material progression from the initial gift of nature. The temporal dimension of development becomes thus an ‘ultimate parameter of judgment’, as Prathama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276412455830">Banerjee (2000</xref>: 4) has pointed out for discourses on development in general. But what is the cause for this failure to unlock the temporal passage into civilization? What produces an endless circle of abundance and destruction?</p>
<p>A close reading of the <italic>Essay on Population</italic> reveals that the principle of population is nothing but the ‘law’ of savage life. The catastrophic rise of population results from the immediacy by which these reproducing bodies react to any increase of subsistence. Humans, animals and plants are equally governed by the laws of life itself, which reacts ‘like a spring’, ‘making a start forwards at every temporary and occasional increase of food by which means it is continually going beyond the average increase and is repressed by periodical returns of severe want’ (Malthus, 1986: 20, 171). But the apparent unity of the concept of life that unites the human and the animal species is marked by a fundamental caesura: it is only among ‘animals and the uncivilized states of man’ that abundance calls a ‘large proportion of the procreative power into action, the redundancy from which was checked by violent causes’. Hence it is only among the savages that population is much below what the soil could support (Malthus, 1986: 87, 153). The principle of population, which is introduced here as the procreative force of life itself, is in effect a designated savagery defined by the immediacy by which it reacts to resources. Hence, Malthus concludes that resources that are ‘not distributed to the lower classes consequently would give no stimulus to population’ (Malthus, 1986: 28). Only the improvident savages and ignorant Irishmen, just like the ‘labouring poor’ at home, ‘live from hand to mouth’, ‘enjoy themselves while they can’ and never think about tomorrow: ‘[T]he providence, foresight and postponement of present gratification for future benefit and profit, which are necessary for this purpose, have always been considered as rare qualities in the savage’ (Malthus, 1986a: 366; 1986b: 72). The Irishman, the improvident savages and the labouring poor at home embody this savage immediacy of life (Malthus, 1986: 28). The state of nature is at the same time always present and close to home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412455830">Agamben, 1998</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>To present the ‘savages’ as ‘presentist animals’ without any sense of history is a common colonial trope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412455830">Spurr, 1994</xref>). The principle of population is linked to this common narrative about savage life: it is because savage life reacts immediately with its procreative consumption to any resource offered to it that the population will exceed the resources available to it in the future. The mathematical expression of the law of population – famously depicted by the divergence of a geometric and arithmetic rate of growth in population and in foodstuff – needs to be related to this discursive articulation of savage life, to its blindness and lack of futurity, for being adequately understood (Malthus, 1986: 12). In other words, scarcity is less a simple natural condition than a cultural, historical and political concept as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0263276412455830">Xenos (1990)</xref> has explored in depth. How is this cultural history of scarcity related to the forms of liberal economic governmentality?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276412455830"><title>Scarcity as Epistemic Virtue and the Fears of ‘Savage’ Life</title>
<p>Scarcity is often thought to be at stake if the question of population is raised. The metaphors of a crowded ship or of bodies that fall off the spaceship earth visualize the ultimate limits of resources that the overabundant population presses against. Since Malthus’ <italic>Principles of Population</italic> appeared, the figure of population has been used to dramatize the issue of scarcity and the necessities of economy (Duden in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0263276412455830">Sachs, 1992</xref>: 142; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276412455830">Mitchell, 2002</xref>: 209ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412455830">Poovey, 2001</xref>: 157). But as the foregoing argument has tried to show, the link between the ‘many’ and ‘scarcity’ is not as self-evident as it might seem. Within this discourse scarcity is not simply a given of the human condition: the state of nature was characterized by abundance. This state of abundance was linked in turn to a particularly deceptive allure: it tends to signal a situation of plenty in the present that is not viable for the future. What is, one might therefore ask, the precise discursive function of scarcity in this discourse? This question is both of ‘archaeological’ and genealogical interest.</p>
<p>If considered in the light of an archaeological reading, the reality of scarcity becomes a much more complicated matter than the common-sense understanding of economic necessities makes us believe. On the one hand, Malthus asserts that there can be no doubt about the existence of the absolute boundaries to human and animal existence. But paradoxically these absolute limits are, on the other hand, declared to be <italic>inconsequential</italic> and irrelevant for the very problem of population. While on the one hand there is no doubt about the objective limits, on the other hand these limits do not matter: ‘[A]llowing produce of the earth to be absolutely unlimited, scarcely removes the weight of a hair from the argument’ (Malthus, 1986: 461). In fact, the limits that scarcity presents are defined as <italic>independent</italic> from the absolute limits of the earth:<disp-quote>
<p>In this supposition no limits whatever are placed to the produce of the earth. It may increase for ever and be greater than any assignable quantity; yet still the power of population being in every period so much superior, the increase of the human species can only be kept down to the level of the means of subsistence by the constant operation of the strong law of necessity. (Malthus, 1986: 13)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The absolute limits, which are objectively there, apparently do not matter, except for the fact that they paradoxically <italic>ought</italic> to be present within experience constantly. Scarcity, understood here as an experience of limitation and a condition of finitude, has an uncertain status. It wavers between what is given and what is not yet; between what is and what should be apprehended and averted. This wavering status of scarcity results, as I want to argue, from its status as a regulatory epistemological device. Scarcity is in this discourse tied to an ‘epistemic virtue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412455830">Daston and Galison, 2007</xref>) that views the given abundance in terms of finitude. Rather than being simply a present condition, scarcity asserts an epistemology of the ‘as if’, which ensures that the given abundance is transformed into a viable future, instead of being consummated. Rather than having a simple ‘objective correlate’, it is conceived of as an ‘instrument for finding our way about more easily in this world’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0263276412455830">Vaihinger puts it (1924: 15)</xref>. To act in the present ‘as if’ scarcity prevails in any moment hence undoes the deathly blindness of presentist ‘savage life’.</p>
<p>In this sense, the objectivity of scarcity can be understood in the sense that Daston and Galison have given this term: as a historically contingent articulation of a virtuous relation between subject and object. They describe objectivity as being about historically shifting ‘epistemic virtues’ that delineate moral ideals about how the knowledge-seeking subject should comport oneself vis-à-vis the given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412455830">Daston and Galison, 2007</xref>: 40). Analogously, the economic objectivity of scarcity can be seen as being about a proper relation to what is given: the resources and objects at hand. It is supposed to engender a certain comportment to objects on the side of the subject. As the foregoing has tried to show, the ‘evil twin’ to this ‘epistemic virtue’ is the abject figure of ‘savage life’ that ruins the possibility of a material civilization. ‘Savage life’ fails to relate objectively to its surroundings. The initial abundance it finds itself thrown into engenders blindness towards the viable and the possible. Given that savage life is considered as failing to engage ‘objectively’ with the given resources, the governmental question becomes how to undo this blindness of savage life and the use of resources attending this lack of concern for the future. In which way is the ‘epistemic virtue’ of seeing things as being scarce tied to governmental technique?</p>
<p>It is not far-fetched to look at Malthus’ <italic>Essay on Population</italic> as an elaboration of a governmental rationality that revolves around this question. His writings on population were an influential position in an intense and protracted debate about public relief and the right to subsistence that lasted from the last decades of the 18th century to the moment at which the Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1834. The old Poor Laws were an English institution dating from the end of the 16th century that granted support to the locally ‘settled’ poor; its reform abolished the right to relief for the ‘able-bodied’ poor and for single mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412455830">Cody, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412455830">Innes, 2002</xref>: 381ff.). This reform has so far lucidly been interpreted as belonging to a politics of ‘responsibilization’ that is typical for liberal rationalities of governing the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412455830">Procacci, 1991</xref>). It moulded the ‘eligible’ person as an economic responsible wage-earner and husband of a dependent wife. Making the poor laws ‘discriminate between the proper and improper objects of charitable benevolence’ was linked to ‘specifying a form of life for the poor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412455830">Dean, 1991</xref>: 83). As to be further elaborated below, the broadened genealogy of the principle of population complements these findings by drawing attention to the way in which this responsibilization is embedded within a differential politics of affect that revolved around hope and fear as the means for teaching savage life the virtues of scarcity.</p>
<p>The politics of affect is here introduced to loosely refer to how the affective dimension is part of political rationalities of governing. As Albert Hirschman’s seminal study on <italic>The Passions and the Interests</italic> has shown, the passions or affects are a very old theme of political thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412455830">Hirschman, 1997</xref>). Political discourses in the 17th and 18th centuries describe interests not as opposed to the passions but as a particular configuration of them. Malthus’ account of the principle of population can be read in this tradition. Very much in line with the political discourse that Hirschman has traced, Malthus’ text elaborates on the passions that are most conducive for producing order. Just like Thomas Hobbes before him, he singles out the two passions of hope and fear. For Hobbes, as for Malthus, fear more than hope seemed to guarantee the progress from the savage to the civilized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276412455830">Robin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412455830">Frost, 2010</xref>). To Malthus, fear becomes necessary because hope was not sufficient to lead the savages out of their state of nature. There is, according to Malthus, no natural love of the ‘elegancies and conveniences of life’ that would propel any subject forward in a desire to better his or her condition. In assuming that there is no natural inclination to ‘better one’s condition’, Malthus breaks with Adam Smith’ account of progress as a piecemeal and peaceful outcome of this most natural interest that accompanies a human being from ‘the cradle to the grave’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0263276412455830">Smith, 2008 [1776]</xref>: 203). In contrast, Malthus holds: ‘Few indeed and scanty would be the portion of conveniences and luxuries found in society, if those who are the main instruments of their production had no stronger motives for their exertion than the desire of enjoying them. It is the want of <italic>necessaries</italic> which mainly stimulates the labouring class’ (Malthus, 1986: 268; emphasis in original). Want rather than desire is necessary to produce a subject that is eager to exert himself for future benefit. More precisely, as Malthus qualifies, it is not want itself but the fear of want that truly makes economic man:<disp-quote>
<p>It is the hope of bettering our condition, and the <italic>fear of want, rather than want itself</italic>, that is the best stimulus to industry; and its most constant and best directed efforts will almost invariably be found among a class of people above the class of the wretchedly poor. (Malthus, 1986: 454, emphasis added)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Malthus maintains that poverty itself, ‘which appears to be the great spur to industry, when it has once passed certain limits, almost creases to operate’ (Malthus, 1986: 454). Fear, aside from hope, is much more conducive for economic calculation than the experience of poverty itself. Whereas for Adam Smith the liberal reward of labour would engender the comfortable hope of bettering his condition and thus ‘motivate him to exert that strength to the utmost’, for Malthus, the mechanisms of hope needed a more powerful companion: the fear of misery. If men lived within ‘plenty’ alone and without the fear of the provisions in the future, the next catastrophe would be pending:<disp-quote>
<p>Alas! What becomes of the picture, where men lived in the midst of plenty, where no man was obliged to provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants; … where the mind was delivered from the perpetual anxiety about corporal support, and free to expatiate in the field of thought which is congenial to her? This beautiful fabric of the imagination vanishes at the severe touch of truth. … The rosy flush of health gives place to the pallid cheek and hollow eye of misery. (Malthus, 1986: 334)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This fear of a world in which there is no ‘perpetual anxiety’ is animated by a particular understanding of the immediacy and blindness of ‘savage life’ that Malthus had described in so many words in his account of the colonial world. Malthus’ contemporary Marquis de Condorcet had observed ‘one is more sure of subjugating people’s minds by frightening them than by speaking to them of reason, for fear is an imperious passion’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276412455830">Rothschild, 2001</xref>: 14). But it is exactly the imperious nature of this passion which made it most susceptible to counter the dangerous presentism of the savage mind. In this context, fear assumed a major role for embedding the aim of self-preservation within a proper long-term calculation. It is fear that teaches the subject to start seeing the pleasures of today in light of the pleasures of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Malthus took fear or anxiety to be a crucial and constitutive passion for making economic man. But he did not assume that such fearful gaze at the future is sufficient. It had to be accompanied by a hopeful outlook as well. ‘Hopeless indolence’, no less than fearlessness, is thus a condition that undermines the making of civilized, economic man (Malthus, 1986: 520). He retained an equally crucial role for hope in the politics of passions. Especially luxury goods from the colonies were assumed to engender passionate attachment and enjoyment – powerful enough to render the economic subject more forward looking in his desires and exertions (Malthus, 1986b: 267).</p>
<p>The relevance of hope for constituting and modulating the economic subject has recently caught the attention of social theorists after it had been for a long time only an irregular object of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412455830">Swedberg, 2007</xref>). Different scholars have commenced addressing the role of hope for the economy and the economic subject. Hope’s role seems to lie in how it enfolds a cognitive understanding of future possibility or expectation with a desire. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412455830">Miyazaki (2006</xref>: 149) puts it, ‘hope lies in the reorientation of knowledge’. One might say that Malthus was less certain about the extent to which hope would necessarily awaken both an orientation towards the future and the activity to make it come true. Especially in respect to the savage subject, these effects of hope were depicted as less effective. Malthus finds that ‘the civilized man hopes to enjoy, the savage expects only to suffer’ (Malthus, 1986: 59). While both fear and hope were thus the levers to turn this non-economic subject into a civilized and economic subject, these passions had to be calibrated depending on the state of civilization. A colonial ladder of hierarchization between the savage and the civilized determines if the subject is to be frightened or lured. The figure of economic man has thus a shadow: the pauper or the savage at home who is ‘anti-social’ and non-economic at once, ‘stubbornly indifferent to the lures of well-being’. As Giovanna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412455830">Procacci (1991: 155)</xref> puts it, this figure is the ‘internal limit’ of economy. One could say that such an internal limit functions as the very threshold at which the calibration of liberal governmentality takes place, combining, juxtaposing and knotting threats or lures, working them into the individual body and trying to effect or, one could say, affect economic futurity depending on where the subject is placed on the hierarchy of civilization.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0263276412455830"><title>Conclusion: Biopolitics, Population and Liberal Economy Revisited</title>
<p>At the end of <italic>The Birth of Biopolitics</italic>, Foucault suggests he has not even properly begun to answer the question of how liberal governmentality and biopolitics are related.<disp-quote>
<p>What should now be studied, therefore, is the way in which specific problems of life and population have been posed within a technology of government which, although far from always having been liberal, since the end of the eighteenth century has been constantly haunted by the question of liberalism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 323–4)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>At the beginning of the lecture course on <italic>Territory, Population and Governmentality</italic>, Foucault had been sure that liberal governmentality is two things at once: economic and biopolitical. In contrast, Foucault’s closing remarks in <italic>The Birth of Biopolitics</italic> seem to indicate that he did not assume a necessary link between these poles. Their relation appeared as a puzzle, as something to be ‘studied now’. This article corroborates the injunction to study these links in further depth. Instead of assuming that Foucault’s lectures have already elucidated the meaning of economic governmentality in full, one needs to be even more attentive than Foucault himself to the different ways in which the meaning of liberal economy is linked to a particular notion of species-life. For clarifying how such an analysis modifies or complements Foucault’s account, it is helpful to contrast it to how Foucault initially had come to define the interrelation between the biopolitics of population and the genealogy of liberal economy.</p>
<p>In his lecture on <italic>Territoriality, Population, Security</italic>, Foucault had argued that the object of population is especially amenable to an economic logic because it introduces a reference to the naturality of processes. As Foucault describes, both the biopolitics of population and the science of political economy look at individuals not primarily in terms of legal subjects capable of voluntary actions but as a ‘multiplicity of organism, of bodies capable of performance’ in view of the collective figure of population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 21). Political economy appeared thus as a kind of knowledge that elaborated the types of governing appropriated for population. It eschews ‘regulatory system of injunctions, imperatives, and interdictions on these principles [of circulation]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 352). Instead it works by enticing, channelling and modulating the calculations of the interested subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 45). Governing a population thus always implies governing economically, in the sense of working with the interplay of subjective interests that are considered to belong to the ‘thick naturality’ of population.</p>
<p>For fully understanding the intimate link that Foucault had drawn between the biopolitics of population and the logic of liberal economy, one also needs to take into account the statistical understanding of norms belonging to both. According to Foucault, both the population and the economy become visible in the statistical regularities that they produce. In the case of the population, these regularities pertain to the dimensions of the life process: health, procreation, death, employment, migration, accidents, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 104). Distinct from juridical or disciplinary norms, these statistical norms stay ‘immanent to the distributions of the given’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 63). They merely record the given regularities as statistical means, variation and deviances: ‘The norm is an interplay of differential normalities.’ Both, the naturality of economy and of population do not shed the normal from the abnormal in the same way that the disciplinary regime does. It draws them together in a co-efficient of probabilities and risk exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 62–3).</p>
<p>The focus on Malthus modifies both of these links and thus can stand in for a broadened and critical genealogy of liberal economy. The first modification is the most general, but worth stating. Routing Foucault’s narrative through Malthus demonstrates that the opposition between legal voluntarism and ‘thick naturality’ is not sufficient to describe the specificity of liberal governmentality. One has to closely investigate what kind of ‘naturality’ of species-life we are dealing with, when population is at stake. The Malthusian concept of population that is determined by the internal hierarchies of species-life gives a specific rendering to this ‘thick naturality’ that Foucault remained oblivious too. Putting it boldly, one might say that Foucault’s way of accounting for liberal economy and population remains unwittingly tied to the horizon of the 18th-century form of liberalism, which has not yet been beset by the Malthusian fear that savage life would literally eat up the future for all. Hence, for tracing the genealogy of liberalism one needs not only to look at the switch from liberalism to neoliberalism or the important changes in the conceptions of species-life in the 20th century, one also needs to be attentive to the novel rendering of species-life and ‘bioeconomic necessity’ that occurred when the ‘threshold of modernity’ was reached.</p>
<p>Secondly, as this article has argued, considering Malthus’ work very much challenges the contention that the biopolitical norms tied to population in the context of liberal governmentality are only about statistical variability and regularity. This analysis recalls instead Foucault’s earlier definition of biopolitics as a logic of power that ‘qualif[ies], measures, appraises, and hierarchizes’ life in light of a larger collectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412455830">Foucault, 1990</xref>: 144). The figure of population is constitutively determined by an inner ‘ladder of hierarchizations’ that differentiates between more animal, more savage and more catastrophic forms of life on the one hand and more human, more civilized and more economic forms of life on the other. These ranks of civilization have been ubiquitous to 18th- and 19th-century discourses on alterity in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0263276412455830">Young, 1995</xref>: 180). While these hierarchizations have received ample consideration in discussions of political or cultural alterity, it should be noted that the economic articulation of the figure of population is also tied to these ‘imaginary boundaries of the human “species”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412455830">Balibar, 1994</xref>: 197). These cultural hierarchizations are not something added to the conception of liberal economy but are part of the very frame which defines how the problem of economy is posed. The <italic>homo oeconomicus</italic> is in this sense not a self-same figure to which governmental rationalities indiscriminately apply but is forged out of ‘savage life’ by differentiated governmental means.</p>
<p>Thirdly, as the re-reading of Malthus’ catastrophic principle of population suggests, the governing of a population is an affair not just of interest but of a politics of affect as well. Foucault did emphasize in his lectures on liberal governmentality that desire constitutes the naturality of the population. This resonates with his analysis in <italic>The History of Sexuality</italic>, in which he had stated that at the heart of this economic, political and biological problem was sexual conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412455830">Foucault, 2007</xref>: 72; 1990: 26). But after having recognized the central role of affect and desire, he quickly turns towards the question of interest without exploring their link and he never goes back to his original intuition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0263276412455830">Thrift, 2007</xref>). Taking Malthus’ principle of population seriously in this context makes it harder to pass over the question of affect as quickly as Foucault did, simply for the reason that the fear of ‘savage life’ runs high in this discourse in the double meaning of the word: as the fear that ‘savage life’ ought to feel and as the fear that it inspires. The precise meaning and role of fear (and hope) for this discourse becomes especially pressing after the central role of futurity for liberal economic discourse has been laid bare.</p>
<p>In sum, taking population seriously makes liberalism look different – even more different than Foucault made it out to be. By taking up Malthus’ principle of population within the perspective of a genealogy of liberal economy, one is led to be more attentive to the dimensions of futurity and affect on the one hand and the fundamental cultural hierarchizations and biopolitical caesuras at work in this technology of economic governing on the other. As the issues of impending catastrophe, futurity, affect and scarcity determine the struggles about the meaning of liberalism today, Malthus belongs more than ever to the ‘history of our present’.</p>
