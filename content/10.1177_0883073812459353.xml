<abstract>
<p>Understanding the meaning and importance of what constitutes hope when counseling members of a family and their child in a medical setting is a vital skill for physicians. The hope that the physicians must foster is that they will offer comfort and care, honesty and availability, and genuine expertise. Although there is no obligation to sustain harmful treatments to maintain false hopes, there is also no obligation to extinguish hope in parents and patients for the outcome of a disorder.</p>

<p>Hope is a commonly used word. It is an important one that has been in use throughout recorded history. It has an important place in human experience and its existence is part of what constitutes being human. What hope means and its consequences have been discussed by philosophers throughout the ages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812459353">1</xref></sup> by theologians as an integral part of religion, and in the Christian faith it is a virtue accompanied by faith and charity. Hope is part of our ancient myths as seen when it was trapped in Pandora’s box, and it is found in our poetry, where Alexander Pope states that “hope springs eternal” and Emily Dickinson writes that “hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul.” That it is an important concept for bioethics is no surprise. For a physician to instill or maintain hope can be both beneficial and harmful. A virtue and a vice. It depends on the hope. Like other words and phrases such as futility, tolerability, best interests, and so on, that are bandied about in clinical practice, to rationalize an action believed to be ethical, but which stem from preconceived notions, the proper use of such words or phrases requires definition, qualification, and context.</p>
<p>When defined and used in the context of what parents and patients ought to expect of a good doctor, hope can be seen as an important medical virtue, and accompanied, in a similar fashion to the theological virtues, by trust and altruism. But first, before placing it in a virtuous context, a general definition. We declare hope when an outcome is uncertain. This hope provides a motivational force that, as Martin writes, is different in kind from that of desire and is of direct benefit to the holder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812459353">2</xref></sup> It is a combination of a desire for that outcome and a belief that it is possible but not certain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812459353">2</xref></sup> Hopes can be qualified in many different ways. They can be misguided, false, unrealistic, exaggerated, high, vital, trivial, shared, conflicting, and so on. The understanding and use of these qualifications is subjective or believed to be objective depending on your perspective. In the clinical context hopes can be held by parents and patients for themselves; for patients by parents, physicians, and others; and for physicians by parents and patients. All these hopes can be very different, inconsistent, and possess variable degrees of possibility.</p>
<p>Clearly, to feel comforted without despair is a good. However the belief in the medical value of hope may impose on the physician contradictory obligations to maintain hope while at the same time to be honest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812459353">3</xref></sup> Bioethicists criticize physicians for sustaining false or unrealistic hopes in parents and patients and suggest that they violate autonomy with deception.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812459353">4</xref></sup> Sustaining harmful treatments to maintain false hopes should not be a goal. The art and virtue that I propose is that physicians satisfy the hope of those for whom they care by honesty that is not brutal, kindness, compassion, tact, and understanding. It is these behaviors that are hoped for. Hope in this context is the lynchpin of the medical virtues of trust, hope, and altruism. Thomas Percival wrote in the 19th century that the physician is a “minister of hope and comfort to the sick” and this is still apt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812459353">5</xref></sup> The fiduciary relationship between physicians and their patients demand that it is.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812459353">6</xref></sup> There is no obligation to extinguish hope in parents or patients. They maintain their hopes in relation to a disorder on their own terms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812459353">5</xref></sup> and this can be influenced by their values and beliefs, religious or otherwise, as well as an understanding of the information delivered to them by their physician. Interpretation of facts and their sensitive disclosure are important roles played by physicians. They should be tactful and honest and promise comfort and care. Physicians ought to address unrealistic hopes, never with disdain but with an open effort to protect and comfort that springs from respect.</p>
