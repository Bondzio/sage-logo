<p>The purpose of this editorial is 2-fold. First it pays tribute to our long-time publisher Kevin Kjellberg and our Managing Editor Catherine Demeter. Second, it announces the ECNS Board decision to move the production of the Journal to Sage Publications. This issue of the Journal begins the 43rd year of continuous publication. For almost all those years, Kevin has been our publisher and Catherine our Managing Editor. The photographs are of Catherine holding the very first issue, and Kevin the last. They have provided excellent service, support, and advice, which have been invaluable, especially on the appointment of new chief editors. I thank them for their supportive friendship and their professional work ethic. Authors have, without exception, appreciated the warm, personal, family environment they have created. They have kindly provided us with some memories of the early days of the Journal.</p>

<p>Catherine said, “I first met, and began working with, Dr. Frederic Gibbs and his wife Erna at the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute in Chicago. We read, and put on punch cards, EEG and clinical information for over 100,000 EEGs in order to cover a wide range of clinical cases for their Atlas of Electroencephalography, Vol. III, Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders. Dr. Gibbs founded the American Medical Electroencephalographic Association and the Journal; his primary interest was always clinical EEG. The first volume of Clinical EEG, published in 1970, included a round table discussion and editorial to convince our readers that clinical electroencephalographers are intensely human and should remain so. At first, I was Editorial Assistant, and later Managing Editor. Being an international journal, I had the pleasure of meeting many of the original associate editors from USSR, Italy, Uruguay, West Germany, Greece, France, England, Norway, Japan, India, Minnesota, Virginia, Texas, and California. It has been a great pleasure and inspiration to work and correspond for many years with Kevin and his staff, especially Karen and Cheryl.”<sup>

</sup> Kevin said, “Dr. Frederic Gibbs founded the Journal in 1970, and our firm began publishing it 1971, when I was still in school working part-time. Since 1973 I have worked full-time on the Journal; this long-term relationship is matched by only one other publication. My initial contact was Karen Leonhardt-Ruhmann, who was the niece of Erna Gibbs (the wife of Frederic Gibbs). Karen designed the Society logo, still in use today. I worked closely with Karen for several years until Catherine Demeter took over her role. My first meeting with Dr. Frederic Gibbs, and his wife Erna, was at a dinner for the journal staff. I was nervous meeting Dr. Gibbs, but found him at once completely charming and disarming, despite his vast knowledge and history. It was a completely enjoyable time. I have rarely met a kinder, more personable, gentleman in my entire career. Catherine Demeter and I have shared and enjoyed many years together on the journal. She is an able colleague, and quickly became a great friend as well. On many occasions she has single-handedly pulled things together to keep Clinical EEG functioning. Few could have solved problems as Catherine has done.”</p>

<p>Kevin and Catherine have done a splendid job for 42 years, and it was with great regret that the Board made the difficult financial decision to change publisher. The Journal will now have online submission, review, and immediate publication, which are considered essential for a modern medical journal. We believe we have a good journal, and want the world to know about it. Sage will provide worldwide promotion of the Journal and our Society. This will include Sage attending medical conferences and adding the Journal to medical journal packages already being offered to libraries and institutions. Sage will provide online discoverability, cross-promotion with other Sage journals and books, conference attendance, social media, newsletters, and free trials. The Journal is currently ranked by Thomson Reuters with an impact factor of 1.325 and is listed in MEDLINE. We are confident that the partnership with Sage will increase the Journal’s circulation, impact factor, and profile.</p>
