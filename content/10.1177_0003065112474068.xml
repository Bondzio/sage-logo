<body>
<p>Toward the end of his life, after more than fifty years of psychoanalytic practice, André Green turned his attention to what he termed his “least fortunate experiences” (p. xxvii): that is, patients he had attempted to treat or whose treatments he had consulted on and who did not fare well. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112474068">Freud (1937)</xref> in “Analysis Terminable and Interminable,” Green was looking back across a lifetime of clinical experience, and while he was mindful of the many patients he had helped and had come to understand, he asked himself what if anything he could in retrospect learn from considering his <italic>least</italic> successful cases.</p>
<p>But where Freud proposed that innate, constitutional factors—“resistances from the Id”—determined the limits of what was therapeutically possible, Green hypothesized that what might look like constitutional factors because they develop so early, and are so long-lasting and resistant to change, are more probably a set of disturbances resulting from very early, preverbal traumata.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065112474068">1</xref></sup> For Green, this last term included not only the <italic>initial</italic> event—e.g., a needed object who is hurtful or seriously neglectful, or who fails to soothe or relieve the infant’s distress; the sudden loss of emotional availability of a once loving mother as in the Dead Mother Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112474068">Green 1980</xref>)—but also the unfortunate ways in which that trauma and its consequences were reacted to by the external environment, especially the ongoing failures of the external world to mitigate and relieve those consequences. In Green’s view, this combination of factors produces ego deformations that disrupt the creation of a psychic framing structure, an internal space in which emerging experience can be psychically represented. In the absence of that structure, the trajectory of subsequent psychic development shifts away from “the sovereignty of the pleasure principle” (p. 45) toward a blind pressure to replicate the traumatic situation and, in response, the need to marshal primitive defenses (splitting, disavowal, etc.) against its repetition. Under such circumstances, “the mind escapes the models of behavior dictated by positive experiences” (p. 174).</p>
<p>Although the terminology in which Green casts his argument may be unfamiliar to readers not conversant with his work, the general tenor of what he is trying to describe will have resonance. What is at stake in Green’s thinking, developmentally in creating these disturbances, and therapeutically in attempting to address them, is the degree to which the parent or analyst can help the patient create and maintain a psychic space in which to represent experience (especially of frustrating events), use language to bind feelings and communicate them to an object, and maintain psychic integrity and self-cohesion in the absence of a needed object. In this book, Green’s theory, which is introduced in a very informative preface by Christian Delourmel and reflected upon in an equally valuable postscript by Fernando Urribarri, is supported by extensive clinical descriptions of cases that Green has either treated himself or consulted on over the course of his long and distinguished career.</p>
<p>Central to Green’s concerns is the closely entwined duality of primary object relationship and language (particularly its binding role). As he notes, as early as 1909 “Freud maintained that words have the function of making the relations between internal [psychic] processes and ideas perceptible” (p. 13). This view is one with which Green very much concurs and is a central tenet of what I read as Green’s lifelong attempt to differentiate his thinking from that of Lacan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003065112474068">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the perspective of the analytic setting, the question Green poses hinges on the crucial issue of whether and to what extent analytic patients can tolerate the fundamental rule and allow themselves to operate according to its dictates. For Green, the rule is far more than an injunction to “say whatever comes to mind.” Structurally and dynamically, it is the fundamental rule in combination with the analytic setting that opens up the possibility and puts into play the conditions for the <italic>metaphorization of speech</italic> and the creation of <italic>the analytic object</italic> or <italic>the third</italic>. These terms refer to the “poetic potential” inherent in all speech and to the unique intersubjective, polysemic dimension of shared psychic reality that can emerge in the minds of analyst and analysand in the course of a well-functioning analysis.</p>
<p>Thus, for Green, the setting, with its demand for speech rather than action, is designed to promote the emergence of this <italic>third reality</italic> with its transitional (unsaturated) dimension that, if not unique to analysis, is a powerfully sought-after potential in which the objects of and in the patient’s discourse become what Green calls <italic>language objects</italic> (p. 19) created by the <italic>transference onto language.</italic> (The latter is contrasted to the <italic>transference onto the object</italic>, which is less “virtual,” more concrete, and bound to peremptory discharge and action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112474068">Green 2005</xref>]).</p>
<p>In a well-functioning analysis, Green asserts that these “language objects” gradually replace or supersede all other objects of psychic and material reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003065112474068">3</xref></sup> As they do so, the patient discovers a playful and creative dimension of words, symbols, and meanings—becomes what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112474068">Green (1983</xref>, p. 119) calls “un <italic>sujet joueur</italic>” (“a subject who plays” or “a playful subject”)—and the analytic discourse transcends ordinary social communication to become something akin to a verbal Squiggle Game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065112474068">Winnicott 1971</xref>), in which a mutually reinforcing transference of the psychic onto speech and speech onto the object can take place. As this happens, “Analytic speech takes the mourning out of language. It gives back to the other the representation of objects of desire which have been relegated to the shadows through renunciation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112474068">Green 1983</xref>, p. 136; translation mine).</p>
<p>To put the matter in simpler, more experience-near terms, “it is a fact that in certain, if not in many, sessions, what is exchanged [between patient and analyst] undergoes a transformation that sometimes confers it with a mysterious quality. But it is precisely this transformation that allows us to suppose that <italic>analytic</italic> communication cannot be reduced to the prosaic exchange with which it might be compared. Furthermore, when language is no longer infused with this aura, there is reason to think that one has lost the thread of the analysis” (p. 29).</p>
<p>The alternation between achieving, losing, and then reacquiring this elusive dimension to the patient’s discourse and the analyst’s listening capacity is characteristic of the “respiration” of the analytic process as it moves toward and away from what is hidden and obscured. These movements in the patient’s discourse are paralleled by the feeling in the analyst of experiencing a movement toward and away from lively and creative transference meaning (three-dimensional) and flat and empty speech (two-dimensional).</p>
<p>But this description applies best to developments in a well-functioning analysis, and that is not the principal subject of this book. For nonneurotic patients, those who suffer from the early traumas and ego distortions alluded to above, there is a massive failure of development of the processes of representation, symbolization, and metaphorization that precludes a robust development of transference onto speech, the substitution of psychic play for concrete action, and the creation of the third. Without the support of these vital ego functions, the combination of the analytic setting and the invitation to free associate, rather than providing gratification and an opportunity for growth, can constitute a threat of catastrophic annihilation through traumatic abandonment and/or intolerable fusion. Speech remains empty and words tend to serve discharge, remaining more closely tied to discharge and action than to the communication of meaning. When combined with massive reliance on splitting and disavowal rather than repression, these developments lead to situations in which “the clinical material is often incoherent, insensitive to interpretations, and marked by insurmountable contradictions” (p. 61).</p>
<p>The results are the hard-to-reach and difficult-to-treat patients who challenge and vex psychoanalysts and whom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112474068">Green (2002)</xref> gathers together under the rubric of <italic>the syndrome of psychic desertification.</italic> In these cases, “when one tries to establish the analytic setting, . . . one finds that . . . [the patient] is, in fact, unable to tolerate it. One witnesses functional psychical paralyses caused by the traumatic effect exerted on the mind when it is required to abandon itself to free association. In such cases, patients experience a state of psychic emptiness, a libidinal desert, with the feeling that what is required of them simply faces them with their vacuity, with intense feelings of anxiety linked to profound distress, entailing a serious danger of disorganization. The sense of the ego’s unity is jeopardized and the psychic desertification brings with it the risk of psychic annihilation” (p. 69).</p>
<p>Faced with such circumstances, the analyst may have little choice but to alter the attempt at promoting a traditional analytic experience that “has all the signs of an impending catastrophe” (pp. 69–70) in favor of fewer sessions, face-to-face meetings, more supportive interventions, and other technical modifications—in short, anything that will assist in “reinforcing relations with reality and avoiding the danger of mental breakdown” (p. 70).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003065112474068">4</xref></sup> Even with these changes in place, the patient may continue to express feelings of psychic emptiness, futility, or even nonexistence; absences may not be tolerated, and loss of the object may threaten to unravel the competence and coherence of the patient’s ego; a narcissistic fragility may be omnipresent and connected to loss of the hope of ever refinding or regaining the desperately needed lost or absent object. In Green’s terms, these cases reflect the <italic>subjectal unbinding of the ego</italic>, “a defensive operation whereby the ego disconnects itself from its own subjectivity” (p. 70) in a desperate attempt to survive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003065112474068">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this part of his theory, Green, who is more usually thought of as influenced by Winnicott, seems even closer to Bion. (In fact, both are named in his acknowledgments, along with Freud and “Lacan in the early years” [p. xi], as the authors who have been most important to his thinking.) Like Bion, Green recognizes that the emergence of the infant’s psyche is dependent on the receptivity and attunement of the mother’s mind; that the infantile psyche emerges in an intersubjective context, “from the mother’s dreaming activity, which unites the alpha functions of both partners” (p. 82). Where this process has severely miscarried in the course of development, it must be remediated by analogous processes set in motion within the analytic pair.</p>
<p>While these can be conceptually described, they cannot be definitively specified or predicted ahead of time. Each analytic couple who seek to enter and work on this difficult terrain must struggle in their own unique ways with their own limits and must use their unique capacities to foster and maintain a sense of aliveness, vitality, and creative discovery. It is for this reason that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112474068">Green (2005)</xref> has said that with nonneurotic patients an enlivening countertransference error may at times prove more useful in the long run than a sterile but “correct” technique and that the question of a patient’s analyzability cannot be answered until that patient has attempted analysis with every analyst available (Green, personal communication, 1978).</p>
<p>To further conceptualize these “cases marked by more or less incapacitating psychic events,” Green introduces the concept of <italic>internalization of the negative</italic> (pp. 174–175). By this he means internalization of a set of defensive primary reactions resorted to of necessity in the face of overwhelming early trauma that threatens the self with annihilation. Such internalizations stand in contrast to more usual primary identifications, indicate a “failure of the subject to come to terms with the loss of the primordial object, and [are] also a sign of the failure of the work of the negative in its structuring function” (Delourmel, p. xxiv). From the patient’s perspective, these internalizations are a compromise that attempts to ensure psychic—and even physical—survival in the face of the annihilating threat posed by the potential impact of the analysis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112474068">Green [2000]</xref> has written about this under the rubric of the Central Phobic Position.) Under such circumstances, with survival itself felt to be at stake, stasis and psychic desertification might seem a small price to pay.</p>
<p>Green winds up cautiously optimistic, mindful of the loss of possibilities involved when patient-analyst dyads prove unable to use a full analytic situation. If, for example, it turns out that the patient must be seen face-to-face or at a lower frequency, Green notes that it may be at the cost of a “loss of the metaphorizing power of the analytic setting,” because “the thirdness, which is so indispensible to the constitution of an authentic analytic relationship, has made way for a dialogue that only accepts with difficulty the existence of a virtual, potential, third dimension” (p. 92).</p>
<p>At the same time, he is clearly appreciative of what can be offered through a modified analytic therapy and recognizes the need to be flexible in treating these difficult patients. In cases of acute somatic decompensation, for example, he thinks that “while the patient is receiving medical care, the analyst should stay in contact with the medical team, perhaps even visit the patient and above all, recommend the resumption of analytic sessions as soon as possible . . . with the [medical] doctors’ agreement” (p. 73). And in regard to the ravages of the primitive superego often seen in these difficult cases, his aim is “that these patients will be able to organize their defences better in order to cope more satisfactorily with their difficulties, even if we are unable to get rid of their symptoms. . . . An attenuation of their suffering is the best that one can hope for” (p. 59).</p>
<p>In the end, what buoys Green’s hopes for future development in our field, and what should assist readers in their own struggles, is his belief (1) that it is the <italic>receptivity of the mind of the analyst</italic>, and by implication the analyst’s capacity to keep alive within him- or herself the vision of an <italic>analytic</italic> process and dialogue, that is the ultimate determinant of the limits of analyzability and therapeutic progress, no matter how much alteration of the classical setting and conditions must be offered; and (2) that “it is <italic>meaning</italic> that provides the real holding, and not the object. . . . A person enters analysis because the meaning of his or her life has been altered” (p. 190; emphasis added). Consequently, it is the analyst’s task—and true possibility—to help our patients discover what once again or for the first time will help them make their lives truly <italic>feel</italic> meaningful</p>
<p>In this summation, Green not only leaves us a direction for future research and discovery, but indicates the degree to which meaning and meaningfulness have always been, and must continue to be, central to the human condition and therefore to psychoanalysis. For this, and for all of his many contributions, we will remain deeply grateful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003065112474068">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>At such times, and in the absence of a <italic>psychoanalytic</italic> theory such as Green’s that can conceptualize such circumstances, analysts may be tempted to eschew psychoanalytic means of addressing these problems in favor of nonanalytic and even antianalytic (e.g., boundary-violating) interventions.</p>
