<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As traditional certification and professional development programs for school principals have endured recent criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143213485467">Elmore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143213485467">Hess, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485467">Hess and Kelly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143213485467">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143213485467">Tucker and Codding, 2002</xref>), researchers and policymakers alike have explored new strategies to train new and existing administrators. These reforms have ranged from changes in traditional programs, to establishing new organizations (for example, New Leaders for New Schools), to pursuing new approaches altogether. Foremost among new strategies are coaching programs previously used in fields outside of education to improve management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143213485467">Goldsmith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143213485467">Judge and Cowell, 1997</xref>). Despite this recent interest in coaching as a strategy for leadership development for school principals, little research has examined these coaching strategies and their impacts. With coaching’s growing popularity comes the need to develop models to evaluate coaching programs and identify those components or strategies that are most effective in changing principals’ leadership practices.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we first present a multi-phase coaching model that was implemented to help principals improve their instructional leadership practices. We then discuss a rubric based on this coaching model that we used to evaluate coaches’ implementation of key model phases and to identify principals’ responses to the coaching. The specific research questions we ask in this chapter are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>How do coaches implement leadership coaching?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What is the relationship between coaches’ implementation of the coaching model and principals’ responses to coaching?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>After presenting the leadership coaching model, we introduce the implementation rubrics, and then we present contrasting cases from our analyses that illustrate two principals’ varying responses to coaching. We discuss how their coaches differed in two key dimensions of implementation: dose and the quality of program delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143213485467">Dane and Schneider, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143213485467">Dusenbury et al., 2003</xref>). We use these differences in coaches’ implementation of the model and principals’ responses to coaching to examine why principals did or did not change their understanding and practices as they worked with their respective coaches. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings can inform development of future educational leadership coaching programs and guide additional research to evaluate the impact of coaching.</p>
<sec id="section2-1741143213485467">
<title>The Growing Use of Coaching and Feedback to Develop Leaders</title>
<p>Coaching has become one of the fastest-growing executive development strategies used by multinational companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143213485467">Goldsmith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143213485467">Judge and Cowell, 1997</xref>) despite little if any evidence of their impact and no regulation of who provides such services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143213485467">Grant, 2007</xref>). ‘How-to’ lists and practitioner literature they primarily target individuals such as managers, organizational leaders, and athletic coaches with strategies for becoming a coach, setting up a coaching program, or developing a coaching culture. However, they contain few scholarly references and focus little on evaluating these programs’ effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485467">Palmer and Whybrow, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers across fields have only recently begun to study coaching to identify those components and strategies that best explain a successful coaching process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485467">Clark Mavrogordato and Cannon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143213485467">Grant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485467">Palmer and Whybrow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143213485467">Thach, 2002</xref>). Some studies have used more rigorous methodologies of coaching effects such as randomized field trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143213485467">Gattellari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143213485467">Grant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143213485467">Miller et al., 2004</xref>) and quasi-experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143213485467">Thach, 2002</xref>), but these results range across a variety of fields and provide limited insights into the influence coaching can have on individual leaders or their organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485467">Grant (2006</xref>: 369) provided a compelling summary of the state of the research in coaching across fields: ‘far more empirical research needs to be conducted … on the impact of coaching at both individual and organizational levels, as well as the establishment of validated, evidenced-based coaching methodologies’.</p>
<p>While coaching has also drawn increased attention in the field of educational leadership, recent examples of the literature for coaching school principals illustrate the need to evaluate more closely its potential for supporting them in their work. A number of coaching publications for principals use models that closely follow strategies from the business sector and consist of ‘how to’ manuals and guides (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143213485467">Reiss, 2007</xref>, as an example). Others propose models that have been drawn more directly from education research. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143213485467">Ellison and Hayes’ (2006)</xref> model of cognitive coaching for principals derives from previous coaching of teachers to improve their instruction, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485467">Bloom et al. (2005</xref>) present a model that is more clearly and explicitly tied to the unique conditions that school leaders face. However, few if any of these guides offer rigorous empirical evidence of their strategies’ actual impacts on principals’ practices or school conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485467">Clark Mavrogordato and Cannon, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Common across many coaching processes to develop new and existing leaders is the provision of feedback that serves as the basis for individual coaching. Coaching programs often provide feedback from subordinates to their leaders in an effort to (1) give employees more voice regarding their working conditions and (2) inform supervisors more closely of their performance as perceived by subordinates. This feedback process has continued to grow in popularity with an estimated 25 percent of companies using some type of upward or 360-degree feedback process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143213485467">Antonioni, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143213485467">Luthans and Peterson, 2004</xref>) and is almost universally used among Fortune 500 companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143213485467">Ghorpade, 2000</xref>). However, little evidence exists as to how coaches use the feedback in their sessions with their coaching recipients.</p>

<title>Developing School Leaders through Coaching and Feedback</title>
<p>Despite recent attention to the use of feedback in schools (see Author et al., 2010, for example), principals still rarely receive systematic, specific, constructive feedback that enables them to know whether their actions are consistent with their intentions or expectations. In a study by the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) in 1998, 13 percent of principals reported being evaluated only every 2 or 3 years, and 10 percent reported being evaluated rarely or never (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143213485467">Doud and Keller, 1998</xref>). If done at all, feedback to principals has not been provided consistently or well; and it is often conducted in a ritualistic and perfunctory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143213485467">Doud and Keller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485467">Lashaway, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>By and large, principals’ source of feedback remains the superintendent (Author et al., 2009). This is paradoxical given the fact that it is the teachers’ perceptions of the principal’s leadership that relates to effective teaching practices and student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143213485467">Anderson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143213485467">Heck and Hallinger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143213485467">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>). Considering that teachers are influenced by the principal’s leadership and have the most regular interaction with the principal, teachers’ feedback should provide highly valuable information to a principal. Similarly, evaluation and feedback for principals are rarely focused on matters of teaching and learning. In a recent review of evaluation practices of principals in large cities across the USA, Author et al. (2009) found very limited coverage on leadership behaviors related to curriculum or instruction and teaching, factors linked to school-wide improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741143213485467">
<title>The Need for Feedback Combined with Coaching</title>
<p>Various findings suggest that feedback may comprise a necessary but not sufficient condition for learning and improved performance. A meta-analysis examining 607 effect sizes from a variety of feedback interventions found that most of the effects were positive; however, in 38 percent of the cases, performance actually deteriorated somewhat following feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485467">Kluger and DeNisi, 1996</xref>). A second meta-analysis on the impact of multi-source feedback found a positive impact, but the effect size was small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143213485467">Smither et al., 2005</xref>) and the authors recommended coaching as a means of helping employees benefit from multi-source feedback.</p>
<p>Employees may fail to benefit from feedback alone for several reasons. First, employees are often self-enhancing and self-protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143213485467">Alicke and Sedikides, 2009</xref>) and tend to ‘accept feedback from others that is consistent with the way we see ourselves and to reject feedback that is inconsistent with the way we see ourselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143213485467">Goldsmith, 2004</xref>: 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143213485467">Mone and London (2010</xref>) observed that even prior to implementing 360-degree feedback, managers ‘invariably’ provided rationalizations for why they would be unable to produce valid feedback, given their particular circumstances. By denying the validity of the feedback, employees relieve themselves of the responsibility for responding to the feedback.</p>
<p>Second, employees often struggle with interpreting feedback and drawing valid conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485467">Cannon and Witherspoon, 2005</xref>). While multi-source feedback reports may indicate to feedback receivers that they are not evaluated positively, the reports are often sufficiently abstract that receivers are left with little or no clarity about what they would need to do differently (Kaplan and Craig, 2005).</p>
<p>Finally, even employees who figure out what raters want them to do differently may not know how to design effective goals, action plans or a process that would enable them to succeed in changing their behavior. Researchers have documented different businesses’ hiring of coaches to help managers work through the natural barriers of using feedback productively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143213485467">Jarvis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143213485467">McDowall, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this evidence, our conceptual model of leadership development for principals includes both feedback and coaching, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143213485467">Figure 1</xref>. As shown in the figure, while feedback can directly inform or influence leaders’ expertise, coaching can also mediate principals’ understanding of the feedback, and this in turn can influence changes in their expertise.</p>

<title>Model for Coaching School Principals</title>
<p>The broader literature distinguishes between two different types of coaching: performance-based coaching that focuses on specific practices and/or attainment of benchmarks, and in-depth coaching that focuses on a client’s deeper cognitive or psychoanalytical issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143213485467">Koonce, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485467">Thach and Heinselman, 2000</xref>). In this article we focus on performance-based coaching. We define coaching in general as a helping relationship between (1) a client with managerial authority in an organization and (2) a consultant who uses a wide variety of behavioral techniques and methods to help the client achieve a mutually identified set of goals, within a formally defined cooperative agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143213485467">Flaherty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485467">Hargrove, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485467">Kilburg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143213485467">Koonce, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485467">Thach and Heinselman, 2000</xref>). In this relationship a coach facilitates a client’s active engagement, learning and commitment to a course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143213485467">Bacon and Spear, 2003</xref>). Using studies and coaching models in and outside of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485467">Bloom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485467">Finnerty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143213485467">Flaherty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485467">Hunt and Weintraub, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143213485467">McDowall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143213485467">Whitmore, 2004</xref>), we developed a five-phase model of coaching to capture the key paths that principals follow with their coaches to understand feedback and make meaningful changes in their leadership practices (Clark Mavrogotdato and Cannon, 2009). The basic phases in this model are: (1) groundwork; (2) assessment and feedback; (3) goal-setting; (4) action planning and (5) ongoing assessment and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143213485467">Whitmore, 2004</xref>). We summarize the key features of each of these phases and their specific relation to principals’ work below. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1741143213485467">Appendix A</xref> contains more specific definitions from the rubrics we used in our analyses.</p>
<p>
<italic>1. Groundwork</italic> involves building an effective working relationship between the principal and coach to review the feedback. In this phase coaches use skills such as active listening and asking questions rather than prescribing specific actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485467">Hunt and Weintraub, 2002</xref>). They focus on learning the principals’ impressions of the school, faculty and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485467">Bloom et al., 2005</xref>). In this model the coaching relationship is collaborative rather than evaluative, and these listening and questioning skills help establish a relationship to address the following phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143213485467">Flaherty, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>2. Assessment and feedback</italic> help the principals to obtain clear pictures of themselves as educational leaders, especially as coaches review teachers’ feedback with principals. Coaches ask questions to insure that they correctly understand the content of the feedback, assess what the principals have learned from it, and explore its meaning and implications. Previous research emphasizes that recipients of feedback are often motivated to act by differences between a desired state and actual conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143213485467">Sapypta et al., 2005</xref>), and coaches can be integral in emphasizing to principals such contrasts between their faculty’s perceptions and what they want to achieve. In this phase coaches may also challenge or reframe a principal’s perceptions about conditions in the school, point out blind spots in his/her views, or discuss contradictions between the principal’s goals and practices. Such discussions better inform principals to understand their work environment and respond to the feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143213485467">McDowall, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>3. Goal-setting</italic> is the process of moving from an informed perspective (such as seeing the differences between others’ versus one’s own perspective on a situation) to establishing a specific, measurable objective to achieve. The coach’s key responsibility is to assist the principal in selecting a meaningful target for change and in designing and committing to a goal or set of goals that are (a) specific, (b) measurable, (c) agreed upon/committed to by the principal, (d) challenging enough to be motivational and to stretch the principal but also realistic enough to be achievable and (e) time-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143213485467">Whitmore, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>4. Action planning</italic> involves designing a specific path or set of concrete steps that, if followed, will lead to achievement of the goal. The coach’s responsibility is to facilitate the design and specificity of the various steps that will lead to accomplishing the goal. This also means designing a clear system through which the principal is held accountable and is supported with any challenges or struggles that emerge. Specifics include establishing immediate action steps that will be undertaken within specified time frames, determining how progress will be measured, how accountability will be established, and how the ongoing communication between coaching sessions will unfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485467">Finnerty, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>5. Ongoing assessment and support</italic> involves measuring progress over time (such as through the completion of particular steps), addressing any challenges that emerge, providing encouragement and support to build motivation, and keeping the principal on track. This also means anticipating how the principal can maintain the changes and, hopefully, build on them over time. A key aspect of this phase is monitoring how progress is being made and maintained, sustaining change, and building on positive changes over time such that a process of continual improvement emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485467">Clark Mavrogordato and Cannon, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we use this coaching model to examine its implementation and principals' engagement and response to coaching.</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>Principals in elementary and middle schools in an urban school district in the southeastern USA (<italic>N</italic> = 48) were randomly assigned to an intervention that provided systematic feedback and coaching to one group of principals (see Author et al., 2009). In this paper we focus only on those principals who participated in the coaching intervention. Specifically, the twenty-four principals in the treatment group received:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(1) three rounds of feedback (in fall, winter and spring) that reported their teachers’ and their own perceptions of their instructional leadership practices, teachers’ trust in their principals, teachers’ trust of each other; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(2) coaching throughout the school year to support principals’ analysis and responses to the feedback.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Seven coaches met with the 24 principals over the course of an academic school year, starting in August and ending in May or June. The coaches (all previous principals) went through a rigorous selection that required them to submit a series of written responses to questions as well as participate in an interview that included their role-playing as a coach reviewing feedback with two hypothetical principals. Applicants were assessed on their ability to understand and interpret the feedback, ask thought-provoking questions, reduce principal defensiveness and facilitate motivation. Coaches’ preparation included training two days a month from April to July (for a total of eight days) and it involved discussion of the coaching phases summarized above, review of strategies to address each of these phases, and an explanation of the feedback forms that principals would receive three times each year. In addition, on three separate occasions, professional coaches were invited in to demonstrate coaching with participant volunteers and answer questions about how they learned to coach and their coaching practice. Between meetings, the principals were asked to practice coaching each other in a trio format in which each individual was given an opportunity to coach, be coached, and to observe coaching and give formative feedback to the coach.</p>
<p>Coaches met with their principals ranging from 4 to 13 times over the course of the school year, and their sessions lasted on average approximately 55 minutes, ranging in length from 25 minutes to 1 hour and 55 minutes. All conversations between principals and coaches in the formal coaching sessions were audio-taped and then transcribed. In this paper we used a purposeful sample to identify high and low responding principals for our analyses. We first selected a group of high principal responders whose coaches reported that they made strong progress in both understanding the teacher feedback and implementing changes in response to it, and who met most frequently with their coaches during a single school year. We then selected a group of low principal responders whose coaches reported that they had made limited progress in understanding and reporting to the feedback. This sampling strategy enabled us to select principals based on their contrasting ‘high and low’ responses to the coaching and then identify possible differences in program delivery and coaching strategies that relate to their differing reactions.</p>
<p>We used Dane and Schneider’s (1998) and Dusenbury et al.’s (2003) concepts of ‘dose’ and ‘quality of program delivery’ to examine coaches’ fidelity of implementation of our model. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143213485467">Dusenbury et al. (2003</xref>: 241) define ‘dose’ as ‘the amount of program content received by participants’. We discuss dose below in terms of the number of sessions that coaches held with their principals. Second, ‘quality of program delivery’ refers to ‘the extent to which a provider approaches a theoretical ideal in terms of delivering program content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143213485467">Dusenbury et al., 2003</xref>: 244). We examined this concept by analysing the transcripts to ascertain the coaches’ use of the five phases in the coaching model. Our analyses ‘quantitized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143213485467">Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998</xref>) the coaching session transcripts; we developed and implemented a scoring rubric that assigned numeric scores to excerpts of the session transcripts in which coach-principal pairs covered the five coaching phases. With these rubrics we (1) identified excerpts in which participants discussed concepts and practices relevant to specific coaching phases and (2) assigned scores to those excerpts based on their depth of discussion of the coaching phase (we elaborate on these rubrics below).</p>
<p>Our scoring rubrics to capture ‘quality of program delivery’ of the coaching phases assigned scores to specific excerpts in the transcripts ranging from 0 to 3. For each phase, a ‘0’ indicated that a coach and principal did not cover the phase at all during the course of a session. A score of ‘1’ indicated superficial coverage of the phase, where a coach did little to guide the conversation beyond asking simple questions or agreeing with what the principal shared. Here, a coach did little more than listen to a principal talk, without seeking to develop a fuller understanding of an issue. A score of ‘2’ indicated that a coach used multiple clarifying questions to engage in conversation with a principal about a topic, but these questions remained at a superficial level. Finally, what distinguished a score of ‘2’ from a score of ‘3’ were a coach’s efforts to reframe a principal’s thinking or change a principal’s perceptions and assumptions about a situation. These attempts consisted of questions a coach asked to clarify an issue, scenarios a coach posited and asked a principal to address, alternative interpretations of a situation that a coach offered, or a coach’s direct challenge to a principal’s assumptions. Excerpts that scored a ‘3’ often included principal comments where s/he described how her/his perceptions or practices change as a result of the discussion with the coach. (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1741143213485467">Appendix A</xref> contains the full text of the scoring rubrics along with examples of content the coach and principal may cover in each phase.)</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate (1) how the rubrics were implemented to assign values or codes to specific transcript excerpts and (2) how coaches’ levels of discussion differed in their sessions. One coach used a series of superficial questions in the first session to find out about the principal and lay some of the initial ‘groundwork’ (phase 1) with him:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Okay. I just want to learn today more about you and your school … Have you been in different places?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Okay.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>And I know you’re busy, so I don’t want to take up too much of your time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Okay.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>But if we can just get, you know, a place to start, and it will help me a whole lot to understand more about the system, because I’m from another county …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>How long have you been here as principal?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>This’ll be my fourth year.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Your fourth, so you—</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Here. Here, at Sutton.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>At Sutton.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>But I’ve been a principal for 22 years.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Ooh, okay. I was principal for 17 … Have you been in different places?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>I have. Different places, yeah. My first, I took over as an interim principal for—my background is Special Ed and elementary.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Okay.</p>
</speech>
<p>This coach received a code of ‘groundwork 1’ for the session because the coach asked two basic questions about the principal’s background and did not follow up with specific probing questions to ascertain more information. Upon hearing the principal’s brief answers the coach moved on to other topics. This contrasted with another coach’s first session discussions, in which she asked the principal about his initial perceptions of the teacher feedback and then used multiple follow-up questions to elicit greater explanation.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Okay. Okay. Going back to something else that you mentioned, regarding your feedback … we know that the data is tied to … the core components and the key processing parts to it. You mentioned something you felt that it was a lot of personality involved. Can you tell me a little more about that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>For example, and of course it depends. Everybody’s view of what I do is different, where I think one person made a comment about feeling as though they weren’t given enough recognition for things that they do. And in conversations where I’ve had with individual teachers where I’m just kind of probing folks, okay, how do you feel about, you know, do you feel like I recognize you enough, or, am I not doing enough? You know, that kind of thing, and, I try not to go too much on the deep end of what I think I’m doing …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Okay. Do you think that, when you mention a lot of the feedback is regarding personality, do you think it’s because of, and it looks like to me the evidence that was used was more personal? … (principal responds to the question)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Do you feel that teachers, some of this might be, and I don’t know; do you feel that teachers are basing a lot of the feedback on maybe personal issues because they really don’t know what you’re doing some of the time …? (principal responds to the question)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>What kinds of things do you think you could bring forth as far as helping them to really see your role as a principal? (principal responds to the question) …</p>
</speech>
<p>In this second excerpt the coach used multiple questions to press the principal for further discussion of his reflections on the feedback; the discussion focused closely on the principal’s perceptions and how he might respond to the contents in the feedback report. The principal offered more specific details about his thoughts as a result of these questions, as compared to the first coach who quickly moved on to other topics before asking for elaboration. This second excerpt received a code of ‘groundwork 3’ indicating more significant coverage of the groundwork phase during this session.</p>
<p>Two independent researchers coded the data; we first practiced by coding a small number of session transcripts to achieve a satisfactory level of agreement in their coding before we analysed full sets of the coaching sessions. We targeted agreement on (1) highlighting specific excerpts in the transcripts that related to each coaching phases and (2) the numeric scores we assigned to the excerpts to indicate the depth of coverage of a phase. During the analyses we focused on one principal at a time; we first individually coded the transcripts from all of his/her sessions and then arbitrated differences in the coding to establish a final set of scores. This coding strategy provided us with numeric scores to chart coaches’ movement through the coaching phases in each of the sessions, and it enabled us to capture and highlight text that illustrated coaches’ breadth and depth of coverage of the phases with their principals in each session.</p>
<p>We recognize that coaches’ progress in their sessions with principals will not always follow the order we have described. Principals and coaches may (and certainly do) move back and forth between coaching phases based on what they discuss, the coaching strategies they employ, and their coverage of new waves of feedback and/or new topics that arise over the course of the year. They may not always move directly from ‘groundwork’ to ‘assessment and feedback’ to ‘goal-setting,’ and so on.</p>
<p>In the next section we provide examples from these analyses that illustrate both ranges in coaches’ implementation of the coaching model as well as principals’ differing responses to it.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In an effort to identify the connections between coaches’ implementations of the model and principals’ responses, we profile two cases of coach-principal pairs who differed in their implementation of and responses to the feedback and coaching. In these cases we analyse both the coaches’ strategies along with the principals’ varied changes as a result, and we discuss how coaching strategies contributed to principals’ responses. We focus specifically on principals’ descriptions of changes in (1) their outlooks on school events or conditions or (2) their implementation of specific action plans or goals that they had set in the sessions. For these principals we offer evidence of their different responses, and we profile their respective coaches’ implementation strategies across the sessions to identify those factors that facilitated their reactions or changes. We then focus on excerpts highlighted under the ‘goal-setting’ and ‘action planning’ phases to identify changes that principals planned and implemented in response to the feedback and coaching. Finally, in our conclusion we discuss how variations in these cases illustrate broader distinctions between the high- and low-responding principals we analysed in our sample.</p>

<title>Principal Rolls:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143213485467">1</xref>
</sup> low response to feedback and coaching</title>
<p>Mr Rolls had worked as principal at Sutton Elementary School (grades K–4) for a total of 4 years, and before that he had been an administrator for 18 years in the district. Coach Johnson, a retired principal from a neighboring school district, first met with him on 8 August before the start of the school year. They spent much of the first session reviewing the school’s general conditions, student body characteristics, parent involvement and recent faculty initiatives such as efforts to share student data in team meetings. In an effort to lay the groundwork for working with Mr Rolls, Coach Johnson also shared a number of her own experiences as a former principal, such as her efforts to get funding for an assistant administrator to help her. In this first session, before the two had reviewed any teacher feedback reports, Rolls stated his two primary goals for the school year: improving his positive feedback to teachers and improving students’ engagement in instruction. He first summarized his need to improve feedback to his teachers, though he offered little explanation for selecting this goal.
<disp-quote>
<p>‘One of my areas that I need to work on is increasing positive feedback. And being more verbal, doing little notes, and things like that … Thank you, that encouragement, and I try to do that. But I need to do it in a more systematic way, and a more conscious way because that is a weakness. It is a weakness of mine.’</p>
</disp-quote> Reflecting briefly on the previous year’s standardized test scores, he offered his second goal and rationale.
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I think this year because we did not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), one of the things … I think the thing that I need to help the teachers learn to do is how to engage every child in the room. And really kind of take a no excuse; you have to take a no excuses stance … That no child has the option of sitting out, zoning out on any lesson at any time. And that’s hard work, really hard work, when you got kids that aren’t focused and aren’t attending, and you know, you’ve got those, you have kids that, what I call the “parroting kids” … The kid that’s not involved in the room, and I think that’s the key to getting that extra 8% bump that I need for all my kids to be scoring proficient at 90%. That, that every teacher has every child involved in instruction all the time …’</p>
</disp-quote> In response to these, Coach Johnson suggested the need to have a more detailed plan, but she did not push for more specifics for intermediate action steps or goals. Any discussion of ‘goal-setting’ remained at a superficial level.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>You’ve got some good goals.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>That’s my plan [laughing].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>But, we have to have a plan.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>That’s my action plan …</p>
</speech>
<p>After this exchange the two moved on to discuss the principal’s recent involvement in a reading conference before the coach returned to summarize his goals: ‘That’s great. What – I mean, you said that you would like to work on communicating, so that could be something that we could work on together, hopefully. And we can, you know, I know that you already thought about it. So you already have some ideas. So that could be something that we could say as our goal.’ Both of these discussions received codes of ‘goal-setting 1’ because neither one focused on specific details about the goals Rolls described.</p>
<p>Over the next session on 21 September Coach Johnson spent much of her time in the ‘groundwork’ phase, asking more about programs in place in the school and how the school year had started. She also provided an article that supplied more information on improving feedback, Principal Roll’s first goal. In an effort to provide ‘ongoing assessment and support’ she also inquired about any progress he had made with the two goals, but he provided limited updates, and she did not press for details. Rolls reported a number of small steps and ideas to provide more positive feedback, and she simply offered encouragement.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>I’ve already got some – I’ve purchased a bunch of birthday cards. Going to make sure and send out birthday cards. But I’m going to have it really come from every – we’re all going to sign it in the office; it’s not just from me, but it’s from the office …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>I was going to say, that’s what – might even take care of it for me … just a little encouragement goes a long way.</p>
</speech>
<p>When Coach Johnson asked about his efforts to challenge his teachers to engage all their students in instruction, Rolls offered only a brief summary before describing how he had used a story from a high school reunion to illustrate to his teachers how important it was to encourage each student and find each one’s talents.
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s more of a challenge to meet goals for every kid, and I had a really good discussion with them about – of sharing a lot of my life experiences with them … But the [reunion] I went to did something quite unique and different in terms of it wasn’t just the kids that were your big academic scholars or your, you know, famous whoever, but they recognized quite a few different students that excelled in another way that typically is not acknowledged as the successful person … the point that I made to the teachers is we never know what somebody’s talent is, and it’s up to us to help discover – help them to discover their talent if not to encourage it, no matter what their talent is, no matter what it is they do, because who’s to say they’re not successful? … we need to be real careful about how we judge our kids and prejudge them, and that we need to be encouraging to all kids. And so I think some of those were really good discussions. I think they all got the message that we need to be encouraging all kids.</p>
</disp-quote> Rolls offered no details about plans or steps to engage his teachers in specific strategies that improved student engagement, and Johnson did not press for details or question his summary of the discussion with his teachers. These discussions received a code of ‘ongoing assessment and support 2’, which highlighted the superficial depth to which Johnson assessed Rolls’ progress – while she used multiple questions to inquire about his progress, none of her questions pushed him for further elaboration or challenge his perceptions of conditions.</p>
<p>Comments like these continued through the next three coaching sessions on 14 December, 2 February and 14 April. In the December meeting the two reviewed the fall teacher feedback report, and while they discussed briefly teachers’ comments regarding their trust in the principal, Coach Johnson only briefly mentioned the feedback results in connection with the two goals. In February she only briefly inquired about any progress toward the goals, and Rolls again offered little information in response.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>In the past we set goals and your goal is, you know to, you wanted to focus on encouraging teachers, and from the data to me, it looks like you're doing that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, but I still need to do some more and part of it is, I've got to, when I am in the building, I've got to and it shows it, I've got to be more visible … Yeah, I've got to get into the classrooms and be observant and do the pats on the backs …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>And then you wanted to make sure that every child was working at their level, which I can hear, you're still working on that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, I feel like we're really on target with that, really on target with that, well with pushing the teachers to achieve that level of meeting the needs, meeting the kids and let's move 'em forward …</p>
</speech>
<p>Coach Johnson moved on in the discussion without pressing for elaboration on Mr. Rolls’ being ‘on target with that’. This short exchange regarding Rolls’ plans received a code of ‘action planning 1’.</p>
<p>Across these three sessions a number of other issues also occupied their discussions. In February, Mr Rolls described his efforts to require teachers to identify their ‘bubble’ students and prepare them for the upcoming standardized tests in April. During the 14 April coaching session Rolls elaborated on his preparation for ‘instructional rounds’ that the district organized in his school, in which administrator groups observed in classrooms and reflected together on what they had seen. In this session the two failed to discuss in much detail any progress toward Rolls’ two primary goals, and by the last coaching session on 2 June there was little evidence in their discussions that the coaching had focused him more closely on specific action plans or steps to improve his communication and feedback with teachers or support his teachers in engaging their students more successfully in instruction.</p>
<p>During the last meeting Coach Johnson inquired about the overall value of the feedback, and Rolls offered yet another superficial summary of continuing with his goal to improve communication in the coming year.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. Why does, overall, what does the feedback say to you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Continue doing what I was working on. I think they were seeing results. I think I, next year, at the beginning of the year, really kinda continue doing that, continue being a, making myself more visible in the building … Making sure that I’m equitable in that visibility. I think we all have a tendency to stop in and see our favorite teachers, and we have some teachers we avoid because we’re afraid of what we’re afraid of what we’re gonna walk into, and I’ve gotta make sure</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, get that checklist back out and check and make sure that you’ve got everybody.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, and create a new checklist, and just kinda keep track of that, and, you know, just try to, I think keep doing that, keep being in touch with the teachers … Continue with the teacher trust and building those relationships within the grade levels and within other teachers. That area, I’m really pleased about that. So, I think, you know, the thing is working on that, you know, them trusting me, and …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>And that’s something you’re gonna have to work on all the time.</p>
</speech>
<p>This exchange, which received a code of ‘goal-setting 1’, mirrored those in previous sessions in which Mr Rolls offered limited details about goals he chose to pursue, and Coach Johnson did little to push him for specific plans, focus him on practical steps he might take toward those goals, or redirect his efforts. As we summarized when introducing the two cases, over the course of these sessions there was little evidence that the principal made specific or significant changes in his perceptions or practices in response to the feedback and coaching. We next summarize a principal who made significant changes throughout the coaching sessions, and we follow that summary with a discussion of how the contrasting cases inform our understanding of effective feedback and coaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1741143213485467">
<title>Principal Williams: high response to feedback and coaching</title>
<p>Originally trained as a reading specialist, Principal Williams had been head principal at Tyler Elementary School (also K–4) for a total of 2 years after serving as a principal elsewhere in the district for 12 years. Unlike Coach Johnson, Coach Smith was a retired principal from within the school district, and he knew Ms Williams from previous work together. Their existing rapport was evident in the informal yet focused nature of their conversation in the first session on 6 August. Coach Smith spent time on ‘groundwork’ issues such as different school programs and policies that were in place, but he also moved quickly to discuss the feedback and its value to Ms. Williams. She responded that the feedback had triggered her thinking about the school’s ‘academic focus’, in which teachers were asked to ‘rate the degree to which high academic expectations are held in the school’. Williams commented that after seeing her teachers’ low academic focus ratings and discussing them with her grade levels, this issue had taken on a high priority because of differences between their perceptions and her own: ‘the first thing that I thought was … maybe they don’t think that the school is really centered enough on academics, which to me, I’m supposed to be an instructional leader, it was like, that’s a glaring point for me, because what other thing should a school be, besides focused on academics and making the kids ready?’ Smith soon after pushed her to consider how her actions prioritized ‘academic focus’ in the school.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>When you think about your leadership, in reference to creating academic focus in the building, could you identify actionable things that you do that really speak to making academic focus, to enhancing academic focus?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Yes, modeling lessons, drop-in observations, conversations during the grade-level meetings. Master schedule has some things in there that I blocked out; we do not interrupt those.</p>
</speech>
<p>Smith asked multiple follow-up questions about teachers’ use of common reading times each morning and Williams’ use of demonstration reading lessons with teachers. This broader conversation received a code of ‘groundwork 3’. Eventually he asked about how grade-level teams and leadership team used their time to discuss instructional issues, and this conversation led him to propose that Williams more strategically use these teams to focus her teachers more closely on high academic expectations that were an issue in the teachers’ feedback (this received a code of ‘assessment and feedback 3’).</p>
<p>Well, I guess what I’m asking you to think about, and maybe this will be kind of the beginning goal here, would be what structures do you have in place that you sort of can review how you’re using them, to see if they can be altered, changed, modified:any word you want to use here, or just use as a facilitation tool to get to your bigger goal, which is to really enhance the learning conversations in these grade-level meetings, because enhancing the learning conversations in grade-level meetings is a start toward creating greater academic focus.</p>
<p>When Williams reported the leadership team consisted of all the chairs to the grade-level meetings, Smith gave her a specific assignment for the next session to reconsider the composition of her leadership team.</p>
<p>You might come back with some thoughts about the leadership team: what [you] want that to look like, and how you might want that to be a microcosm of what happens in grade-level meetings. You think about if my leadership team is made up of grade-level chairs, and you say to them, ‘I’d really like your grade-level meetings to run like this meeting.’</p>
<p>Unlike the superficial exchanges in the previous case, these initial conversations drove a number of detailed discussions in later sessions that urged Williams to begin reconstituting her leadership team in the following year. In the following excerpts we trace the changes in her perceptions and policies for the leadership team.</p>
<p>Over the next three sessions the two covered a number of issues similar to Rolls and Johnson’s discussions, ranging from discussion of teachers’ feedback reports (in the 24 November, 8 December and 12 February sessions) and a review of the school’s strategies to use formative test data to prepare for the April standardized tests (during the 8 December and 12 February sessions). Unlike Rolls and Johnson, however, Williams and Smith discussed the feedback far more in detail, with Smith frequently pushing for more detail or encouraging her to look at an issue differently, as in this case when they discussed Williams’ review of ‘academic focus’ from the feedback with her staff.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Talked with them in faculty meeting about academic focus because that was the first thing that I was going to work on and talk with them and jotted down some notes about how they felt. We could focus a little bit more. More discussion at the – we do discuss data at the data meetings, but they want to include more where the kids are. They want to include the running records and their teacher tests that they’re doing as part of that discussion instead of the big data … they feel that as a grade level they need to take a little bit more ownership and not just have it when I’m there.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Okay, what did they tell you – I heard what you said about their teacher-designed assessments and those kind of things. What else did they say they wanted to talk about?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>They want to – 3rd and 4th grade, they’re the only ones that have them right now – want to talk about the mastery cards, and they know where they are individually as a classroom, but they want to look at it more grade level-wise …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Do you ever look at where people end up? Like at the end of a semester, I know they have a pacing guide, but do they ever look to see whether or not everybody has gotten through to cover all the first semester skills? …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>No, we haven’t done that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Do you understand why that would be valuable?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>Because the school gets judged on overall averages. You look at it in terms of teacher data, that they’re sharing instructional strategies with each other about what gets a skill across better than another, which children – what I mean by ‘which children,’ are there any groups of children that are missing certain skills more than other children?</p>
</speech>
<p>In this excerpt, which received a code of ‘ongoing assessment and support 3’, Coach Smith asked additional questions beyond Williams’ summary to prompt her thinking of additional strategies to address the feedback dimensions. He also consistently returned to the leadership team issue across these discussions to suggest additional responsibilities it could take on, such as guiding the grade level meetings in backward-mapping strategies to prepare for April standardized testing and creating a sense of urgency in the staff to prepare for the testing.</p>
<p>Williams’ comments during the sessions offered evidence that she engaged in specific actions in response to these discussions. In the 8 December session, she summarized specific steps she would take to help the leadership team backward-map strategies in preparation for standardized testing. Maybe more importantly, Williams’ comments in the 12 February session marked a shift in her thinking about the constitution of the leadership team and her plans to reconstitute it in the coming year.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Okay, what does that say about a leadership piece for you that we could work on?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Well, for me what I’m seeing is that I’m going to have to be, number one, a little bit more deliberate with choosing my grade level team people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Possibility of reconstituting?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Reconstituting, which in talking with some other principals and how they’ve had to change theirs mid-year, actually that is something that – and I’m not changing now, but I will change or have to change or be really deliberate about it for next year when we meet. And my leadership team starts meeting in July. We come back with a stipend and start. So being deliberate about choosing …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Coach:</speaker>
<p>Grade level chairs basically.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Principal:</speaker>
<p>Uh-huh. And then Title I person and literacy reading specialist. Those people are on there too.</p>
</speech>
<p>Later comments indicated that their ongoing discussion of new roles and responsibilities for the leadership team had moved her to consider new individuals more capable of these tasks.</p>
<p>In the 10 March session (their second to last meeting) Williams described her decision to select a new team in the coming year instead of strictly allowing teachers to elect them: ‘Okay, my leadership team, I’ve talked, and I’ve thought, and I’ve struggled. It’s going to have to change for next year, and this is my struggle: I’ve always had the grade levels elect their chair, and they automatically became part of the leadership team by default … It’s not always the best people. So, I know I need to appoint.’ Ms. Williams also laid out specific plans to transition from the current group, and she summarized her plans to create time in the next school year’s schedule for the leadership team to meet more regularly during the school day.</p>

<title>Comparing the Two</title>
<p>While their ‘doses’ were relatively similar over the year (Rolls met six times with his coach, Williams met eight times with hers), Williams’ comments over the course of her sessions demonstrated far deeper changes in her perceptions and practices in response to the feedback and coaching. As the excerpts from the cases indicate, at a basic level, Coach Smith provided a higher ‘quality of program delivery’ through consistently deeper and more detailed discussions of the feedback reports, the different goals that Williams had set, and steps she took toward those goals.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741143213485467">Table 1</xref>, we see that Rolls and Johnson never reached deeper coverage of the different phases; their conversations remained at superficial levels with scores of ‘1’ or ‘2’ at the highest. In the phases ‘goal-setting’ and ‘action-planning’ that we used to examine Rolls’ responses to the coaching, we rarely saw the discussions move beyond brief, superficial reviews of his plans. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143213485467">Table 2</xref>, Williams and Smith on the other hand reviewed the feedback and Williams’ goals more closely, and Smith provided more significant assessment and support for her progress with those goals. These differences are clearly evident not just in the qualitative excerpts we have presented but also in the rubric scores for all of five phases. Higher scores for Williams’ and Smith’s discussions in ‘goal-setting,’ ‘action planning,’ and ‘ongoing assessment and support’ help mark this coaching pair’s more specific setting of action plans to respond to the feedback.</p>

<sec id="section11-1741143213485467">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analyses utilized a scoring rubric that assigned quantitative values to qualitative text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143213485467">Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998</xref>), to examine the implementation of a coaching model. Despite the uniform and extensive training that all the coaches received at the same time, we still found a wide range in the practical strategies that they used during the sessions. Instruction in the specific phases of coaching did not ensure that coaches addressed the phases to sufficient depth during the sessions. These differences raise questions about the quality and content of the training and its success in equipping coaches with the concepts and skills to implement the coaching model with more fidelity. At the same time, these ranges in implementation nonetheless proved useful, in that we were able to compare variations in implementation to identify multiple strategies or phases that were key to supporting principals’ changes in their practices.</p>
<p>From our two case studies, we see that while both principals received similar doses of coaching, Coach Smith consistently scored higher on our ‘quality of program delivery’ rubric at each stage of coaching. Throughout the sessions, Smith much more frequently reviewed the feedback reports in detail with Williams, referring to specific aspects of the reports and questioning how they compared to Williams’ own views or assumptions of her faculty. Such conversations not only required Williams to explain her interpretations of the reports and her faculty, but they also generated more opportunities for the coaching pair to re-examine her assumptions. Such re-examinations frequently preceded her decisions to pursue new goals or action plans (such as the reconstitution of her leadership team). These results contrast with Johnson’s far more superficial investigation of the reports with Rolls; their limited coverage of the feedback often preceded Rolls’ setting of much more general goals or plans. A key difference that thus emerges regarding the ‘quality of program delivery’ lies in Smith’s ability to use the feedback discussions to require Williams to verbalize, examine closely, and in some cases revise her assumptions about her faculty. By analysing both coaches’ adherence to the model as well as principals’ responses, we can begin to identify key aspects of the program delivery such as this that best support principals’ responses to the coaching and changes in their practices.</p>
<p>These results concerning both coaching implementation and principal response illustrate a number of key differences that we found in these coaching pairs and in the others. Coaches who provided higher quality program delivery used detailed discussions of the feedback to lead principals to critical reflections on their work that challenged their perceptions of conditions in their schools. As in the case of Coach Smith, coaches used a number of strategies to accomplish this:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>targeted questions about the feedback that required principals to review specific conditions in their schools;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>role plays and scenarios in which principals were required to explain how they would respond to particular situations; cycles of discussion across multiple sessions in which coaches returned to previous discussions to check principals’ changes in understanding or progress with goals action plans;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>routines during the sessions in which coaches set time for reviews of ongoing efforts as well as new or upcoming concerns the principal had.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Strategies such as these enabled coaches to use the feedback reports as guides for principals’ re-examination of their faculty and leadership. They also helped coaches promote principals’ continued commitment to specific short-term changes or longer-term reorganizations (as with Principal Williams).</p>
<p>As researchers continue to study coaching for principals, this paper demonstrates how analyses of implementation such as these can be used to evaluate and to identify the specific strategies that are useful for guiding principals and other school leaders to improve their practices. While we have used two contrasting cases here to demonstrate the content and usefulness of our methods, in future work we will look across more coaching pairs to identify evidence of how different strategies support principals’ changes in practice.</p>
<sec id="section12-1741143213485467">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that future work can address. First and foremost, we have focused on coach and principal discussions in this study – our analyses thus depended solely on the transcripts of principals and coaches as captured in the coaching sessions. Without additional observations within the school, interviews with the teachers or other faculty members, it is not possible to corroborate principals’ descriptions of what they did as a result of the coaching. Future analysis could certainly collect data from additional viewpoints (such as teachers) to verify whether the principal did what s/he described during the coaching sessions.</p>
<p>My lack of additional data also means that we cannot speak to the permanence or sustainability of the changes that principals made during the coaching. While some (such as Ms. Williams) discussed plans to take up additional steps in the coming school year, we have no data to analyse principals’ ongoing practices after the coaching sessions ended. Again, future research could certainly address these limitations by interviewing principals and/or teachers in the following year to examine just how much principals continued with strategies or practices they had developed during the coaching sessions.</p>
<p>Finally, additional analyses are needed to understand how the school and district contexts influenced the effects of the feedback and coaching. Because of my focus on transcripts from the coaching sessions, we do not know what other school conditions drove principals’ actions. Rolls in particular may have been dealing with other issues in the school that prevented him from focusing on the feedback and coaching. In regard to the district context, for this particular study no principal supervisors or central office personnel saw the feedback reports or discussed them with the principals. In the scope of this paper, we cannot speak to how well district incentives and requirements for the principals aligned with the issues they covered with their coaches. Future research is needed to identify those school and district policies that best support principals’ use of the feedback and coaching.</p>

<title>Appendix A</title>
<p>Author’s note: Each of the scoring guides for the different phases contained (1) definitions of the phase and (2) descriptions of possible scores of 0 to 3. Here we summarize definitions for all five of the phases, and we include the scoring criteria for the first phase (‘groundwork’) as an example for the others (criteria for the others were quite similar).</p>
<p>1. Groundwork</p>
<p>In this initial phase, coaches focus on building relationships with their principals to establish trust and begin dialogues to understand their work situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485467">Bloom et al., 2005</xref>). Coaches may share their personal and professional details to establish connections and encourage further sharing by the principal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485467">Bloom et al., 2005</xref>). Key to this phase are asking non-evaluative questions and active listening about a principal’s impressions about the school, faculty and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485467">Bloom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485467">Hunt and Weintraub, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Aspects of coaches’ groundwork include but are NOT limited to coaches’</p>
<p>discussions of their own experiences or background with principals:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>open-ended, general questions about principal’s school, faculty, students, and other working conditions;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>inquiries about what the principal wants to accomplish through the coaching sessions;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>initial, general discussions about the feedback that principals have been receiving. (note: Discussions in which coaches and principals review specific results from the feedback fall under ‘assessment and feedback’.)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>conversations about the coaches’ and principals’ theories of leadership or management;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts to empathize with the principal about different conditions the principal faces;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>reflective listening, in which he or she summarizes back what the principal has shared in order to verify what the coach is hearing.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Scoring rubric</p>
<p>0. No coverage of phase<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741143213485467">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the session the coach and principal do not cover topics or issues related to the phase.</p>
<p>1. Minimal coverage of phase</p>
<p>In this session the coach superficially covers one or two issues related to the phase. This may include questions or comments about relevant conditions, <italic>but </italic>the coach provides few or no follow-up on questions to probe for deeper understanding. At this level, the coach does not push for deeper insights or answers to understand an issue.</p>
<p>The coach listens and offers general agreement or indicates simple understanding (‘yes,’ ‘mm-hmmm’) before moving to another topic.</p>
<p>The coach provides input (for example, his/her own stories, or theories of leadership) with no/little elaboration or explanation of relevance to situation.</p>
<p>2. Limited coverage of phase</p>
<p>In this session the coach superficially covers 3 or more related issues, but s/he uses few/no follow-up questions to obtain more specific information or probe for understanding.</p>
<p>The coach offers brief responses or reflections on principal comments but does not press for deeper understanding or obtain more specific details.</p>
<p>The coach offers input but provides no larger explanation to connect the question/comments to the feedback or leadership issues.</p>
<p>3. Significant coverage of phase</p>
<p>In this session the coach covers one or more related issues, and s/he uses follow-up questions to probe for deeper understanding or obtain more specific details about the issues.</p>
<p>The coach connects the conversation with the principal to the content of the feedback or broader issues of leadership.</p>
<p>2. Assessment and feedback</p>
<p>In this phase, coaches help principals gain a clear picture of their own leadership and their workplaces. They also begin to offer feedback in regard to different policies or principals’ actions. This begins with coaches’ discussing and reviewing their principals’ feedback to insure that they understand the different components. Coaches ask questions about principals’ understanding of the feedback, their reactions to it, and their use of it in their work (Mavrogordato and Cannon, 2009). This also includes any efforts (beyond initial groundwork questions) that coaches make to gather additional information about a principal and his or her school that is related to the feedback.</p>
<p>Aspects of ‘assessment and feedback’ include but are NOT limited to:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>specific questions that coaches pose to determine if principals understand and value feedback;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>discussions about additional data a coach may request to see about conditions in schools (for example, school policies or student test scores);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>discussions about data that a coach reviews with the principal. This may range from specific results in the feedback to reviews of school policies to comments after observations of teachers or the principal (this does NOT include feedback to a principal about progress toward goals he or she sets with the coach);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts by a coach to focus attention on a particular condition in the school;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a narrowing of focus to certain topics the coach and principal discuss – his may include efforts by the coach to return to certain issues over multiple sessions, or an effort to obtain more data or information about particular topics for greater understanding;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>comments by the coach to challenge or reframe a principal’s perceptions or assumptions.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>3. Goal-setting</p>
<p>This phase represents a shift from obtaining information and/or giving feedback to establishing specific targets or benchmarks. This phase is marked foremost by the coach and principal identifying goals that the principal will aim to reach with his actions or school policies.</p>
<p>Aspects of ‘goal-setting’ include but are NOT limited to:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>efforts by the coach and principal to set specific goals;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts by the coach and principal to identify measurable goals;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts by the coach and principal to reach agreement on particular goals;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts by the coach and principal to verify that the goals are realistic;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>discussions to set specific time tables or timelines for principals’ achievement of the goals.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>4. Action planning</p>
<p>Once principals have set their goals, coaches help them develop plans to achieve these. This process involves ‘designing a specific path or set of concrete steps that, if followed, will lead to achievement of the goal. During this phase, the key responsibility of the coach is to facilitate the design and clarity of the specific steps that will lead to the accomplishment of the goal’ (Mavrogordato and Cannon, 2009: 12). This phase may also include a plan to hold a principal accountable for particular actions or steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485467">Finnerty, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Aspects of ‘action-planning’ include but are NOT limited to discussions of:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>specific steps a principal will take to accomplish his/her goals;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>discussion of how the coach and principal will know the principal has made progress or is ‘on track’ according to the schedule;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>decisions regarding how progress will be measured/determined;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>decisions regarding how a principal will be held accountable for progress on the steps and goals.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>5. Ongoing assessment and support</p>
<p>In this final phase, coaches and their principals focus on making progress toward the goals they have agreed upon and addressing different needs and challenges that arise. Coaches provide the support that principals need in the form of evaluating progress according to pre-set goals, providing ongoing encouragement, assistance or feedback in addressing challenges, and keeping the principal focused on his/her goals (Mavrogordato and Cannon, 2009).</p>
<p>Aspects of ‘ongoing assessment and support’ include but are NOT limited to:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>reviews of principals’ progress according to their goals;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts by the coach to make principals’ learning explicit (for example, to help principals describe what they have learned or how they have progressed);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>discussion of principals’ completion of specific steps;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>review of different data that are part of the principals’ accountability plan;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>discussions of problems or barriers that the principal has encountered in pursuing his/her goal;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>revisions/modifications of the goals or specific steps;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>efforts to provide the principal with supporting materials such as books, related literature, additional contacts, and so on.</p>
