<p>There was a grim joke in the Channel 4 newsroom during the Bosnian conflict about the viewer who went to the cinema one night, missed the background packages on what the war was about and spent the next five years totally baffled by the daily coverage of mayhem and cruelty. Journalists reporting conflict have always had to grapple with this dilemma—just telling the story is difficult and dangerous; making sense of it often needs other reporters, equally professional, whose motivation is to explain.</p>
<p>The 2011 Libyan revolution —murderously violent to report and fiendishly complex to understand —was in many ways the ultimate challenge to the reporters and crews assigned to it. These two fine books by two of the outstanding correspondents of their generation should be compulsory reading for anyone who cares about modern journalism. They represent the two strands of UK journalism — narrative and analytical — at their very best.</p>
<p><italic>Colonel Gaddafi's Hat</italic>, by Alex Crawford, Special Correspondent for Sky News, is a day-by-day account of three astonishing assignments — in Zawiya as Gaddafi's tanks crush an early uprising; in Misrata as the outcome of the war seems to hang in the balance and civilian casualties mounted, including two respected journalists, Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros; and her world exclusive live coverage of the victorious rebels making their way into Tripoli's Green Square.</p>
<p>This is as close to frontline war reporting with all its thrills and horrors as most readers will want to get. There is, rightly, no sanitising of what modern weapons do to soldiers and civilians alike; and although her sympathies are clearly with the rebel fighters, she also reports their killing of captured Gaddafi troops. At one point, she thinks of lobbying William Hague to get the West to intervene on behalf of the rebels but, fortunately for Sky News's reputation for impartiality, thinks better of it.</p>
<p>She shows real courage in describing her own brief encounter with post-traumatic stress disorder, after she and her team believe they are going to die under tank fire in Zawiya. There is still something of a taboo among frontline teams about talking about PTSD — and if this bravest of correspondents can be open about it, anyone can — and should.</p>
<p>She is also brutally honest about the ferociously competitive streak which drives her on — she says one of her biggest rivals is her close colleague at Sky, Stuart Ramsay. While Ramsay and Bill Neely, of ITN, try to rescue her team from Zawiya and Neely offers his satellite dish to get her pictures out, she is later tempted to leave two ITN teams who are expecting to share transport with her at the Tunisian border, because she is afraid of losing her advantage over the competition. She describes her motivation not as winning awards but “finding and telling the truth” — but the awards are won and deservedly so.</p>
<p>There is not much time to talk to Libyans in any depth — apart from the engaging Hisham Alwindi, who liberated Gaddafi's hat from the ruins of his compound in Tripoli and whose encounter with ‘Crawfie’ became a YouTube hit after an Israeli musician turned it into a rap. In <italic>Sandstorm</italic>, Lindsey Hilsum, International Editor of Channel 4 News, takes a very different approach. She adds to her own courageous frontline reporting, a fascinating range of Libyan voices —rebel fighters and Gaddafi loyalists, Islamists and secularists and some of the many victims of Gaddafi's repression. She uses their stories to produce a brilliant account of a ghastly regime and its eventual overthrow.</p>
<p>She chronicles Gaddafi's journey from the handsome young colonel offering an end to corruption to his final years as a botox-distorted tyrant looking “like a sinister Middle Eastern Michael Jackson”. She quotes the judgement of his early ally, President Nimeiry of Sudan: Gaddafi, he said, had “a split personality — both of them evil”.</p>
<p>The story of that evil — the mass murder of 1,270 political prisoners in Abu Salim jail; the seemingly endless hangings of dissidents, often broadcast on state television; the assassinations of exiles across Europe — has never been better or more vividly told. By 2011, Gaddafi had created a situation where outside of his own closest supporters, almost everyone in Libya had lost a member of their family or tribe, or a friend. His people had every reason to hate him as well as fear him.</p>
<p>But they would not have succeeded in overthrowing him without the support of the West in the form of NATO air power. Lindsey Hilsum is too good a journalist to let British or American politicians take too much credit for this belated intervention. The UK's embrace of Gaddafi post-9/11 is a pretty unheroic episode in British diplomacy. MI6 helped return Libyan dissidents to Tripoli where they were tortured; BP got a big oil and gas deal; the Libyan intelligence officer convicted of the Lockerbie bombing was released from a Scottish prison.</p>
<p>Nor is Hilsum impressed by what she sees as the implicit trade-off between the West and their Arab allies. In return for their support of NATO intervention against Gaddafi, the Gulf States got a free hand to repress the uprising that really worried them — in Bahrain.</p>
<p>What she is impressed by is the courage and determination of the different individuals and groups who came together to overthrow Gaddafi. There is Ahmed, the Seattle University drop-out, sending intelligence reports to NATO; the yuppies of the Free Generation Movement, organising civil disobedience in Tripoli; the Berbers, with Qatari weapons, fighting their way down from the Nafousa Mountains into the capital.</p>
<p>No-one who reads this excellent piece of instant history will doubt that Libya faces a fraught future, as religious, political and tribal differences re-emerge. But equally, you would have to be pretty soulless not to hope that the Libyan people, so endlessly unlucky in their rulers, get some reward for their bravery in ridding themselves of the Colonel.</p>
