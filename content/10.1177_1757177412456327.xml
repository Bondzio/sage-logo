<abstract>
<p>Infection prevention is a cornerstone of good neonatal care. There are, however, few research data to support infection control approaches in this population. Through a structured telephone interview we surveyed all neonatal units in the United Kingdom to identify infection control issues, practices and policies. Eighty seven percent of the 198 neonatal units participated. Twenty one units (12.2%) had closed with infection control issues in the last year; 14.1% had current infection control concerns; 81.5% of units decolonised MRSA positive infants, but over 15 regimens were used. Wide variations in hygiene measures were identified; 22.1% of units used theatre scrubs for all staff, 7.6% used aprons and 5.8% required gloves to be worn when entering clinical areas. Only 54% required hand washing and alcohol gel before entry to a patient care area; 11.6% required only the use of alcohol gel.</p>
<p>Although infection control issues are resulting in neonatal unit closures and risks to patients, there are considerable variations in hygiene and screening practices. There is little data to support the safety or efficacy of decolonisation in neonatal populations, but this is widely practised. Research needs to be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of screening practices and decolonisation in order that a consistent evidence-based approach can be applied.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infection control is one of the cornerstones of modern neonatal practice. This involves prevention of infection to individual newborn infants, and also includes measures to reduce the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria within individual units and the community. Among the organisms causing concern, meticillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is particularly pertinent in the United Kingdom as it has been used as a surrogate marker for the effectiveness of a hospital’s hygiene practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412456327">Boyce et al, 2009</xref>). MRSA can be a significant cause of disease although asymptomatic carriage is more common. Colonisation and cross-infection are important factors in the healthcare environment and are important in the context of the increased prevalence of this bacterium in the community over the last two decades. Colonisation is a risk factor for later infection in adults and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412456327">Davis et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412456327">Huang et al, 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the emphasis on reduction of MRSA infections by utilising good hand hygiene and general hospital cleanliness, along with other measures such as changes in antibiotic prescribing policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177412456327">Liebowitz 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412456327">Thurman et al, 2010</xref>), has resulted in a reduction of MRSA bacteraemia from the 6381 reported cases in 2006/7 to 1185 reported cases in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412456327">Health Protection Agency (HPA), 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412456327">2012</xref>). Although the rate of MRSA bacteraemia is decreasing, the rate in children under 14 has risen slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412456327">HPA, 2010</xref>). Neonates are at high risk for infections in general and MRSA infection in neonates comprises up to 35% of all MRSA bacteraemias in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412456327">Johnson et al, 2010</xref>). Risk factors for MRSA infection in neonates include extreme prematurity, extremely low birth weight, invasive procedures and length of stay. Perinatal acquisition is also important, with Johnson et al demonstrating that 8% of children with MRSA infection were less than two days old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412456327">Johnson et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous studies in the adult healthcare environment have shown a reduction in MRSA transmission and disease with infection control measures (screening for colonisation, cohorting and isolating colonised and infected patients, decolonisation regimes and stringent hand hygiene procedures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177412456327">Rubinovitch and Pittet, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412456327">Kotilainen et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412456327">Huang et al, 2006a</xref>), but this has not been replicated in large studies of children. One study has shown evidence that hand washing with soap containing triclosan eliminated new episodes of MRSA on a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177412456327">Webster et al, 1994</xref>); other studies reporting success with more stringent infection control practices are often reports of management of outbreaks, hence it is difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412456327">Regev-Yochay et al, 2005</xref>). Successful decolonisation rates following nasal ointment and body washes have been shown to be greater than 50% at 14 days post treatment in adult studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177412456327">Scully et al, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412456327">Parras et al, 1995</xref>). There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of decolonisation in newborns. There are, however, reports of well tolerated regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412456327">Darmstadt et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412456327">Bührer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412456327">Regev-Yochay et al, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There has also been increasing concern amongst neonatologists about the emergence of multi-resistant Gram negative organisms, but there are little data to support this concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412456327">Millar et al (2008)</xref> reported that up to 56% of infants had carriage of multi-resistant Enterobacter at discharge from NICU.</p>
<p>Our experience has been that there is wide variation in the practice of infection control measures, screening for transmissible organisms and management of MRSA colonisation among neonatal units in the United Kingdom. However, there are no data available on which to base this impression. Indeed, the recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412456327">Department of Health Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection Report (2010)</xref> has prioritised the need for a neonatal healthcare associated infection surveillance programme in England and data on the impact of infection control problems. As well as the effect on individual patients, healthcare associated infections lead to significant challenges in running effective clinical networks with unit closures and/or reduction in cot capacity. We therefore decided to undertake a survey of all neonatal units in the United Kingdom to ascertain what infection control practices are used and to identify measures taken to manage MRSA colonisation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757177412456327" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a national survey of neonatal units in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to evaluate infection control practices and policies. All units were contacted between July 2009 and February 2010. The need for ethical approval was discussed with our local Ethics committee. Ethical approval was not required for a survey of this nature.</p>
<p>Two hundred and three neonatal units were identified using the Standardised Electronic Neonatal Database (SEND; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nww.neonatal.nhs.uk">https://nww.neonatal.nhs.uk</ext-link>). The units were contacted and a telephone survey completed by the sister-in-charge, the neonatal registrar or the consultant in each department. The survey sought to identify current infection control practices and policies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177412456327">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred and ninety eight neonatal units were contacted by telephone; 172 (87%) agreed to take part. Of these, 46 (26.7%) were Network Intensive Care Units (Level 3), 76 (48.3%) were Local Neonatal Units (Level 2) and 25% were Local Special Care Units (Level 1). Twenty units (11.6%) were units where surgery was performed. One surgical unit was designated as 2A, the rest were Level 3 units.</p>
<p>The structured telephone survey was answered by the ‘Sister in Charge’ for 89.5% of participating units and the ‘Attending Consultant or Registrar’ for 10.5% of units.</p>
<sec id="section4-1757177412456327">
<title>Screening procedures</title>
<p>Of the units, 81.5% screened all infants for MRSA on admission, with 20.8% screening for multi-resistant Gram negative organisms. Twenty nine units (22.3%) screened for other organisms, including non-specific swab culture and sensitivities, and three units screened admissions for <italic>Group B streptococcus</italic>. One unit did not screen any admissions; 31.7% of units screened for MRSA on ex-utero transfers into their own units only. The questionnaire demonstrated 69 units (40.4%) had a screening policy of screening all infants weekly, 63 units (36.8%) declared no ongoing screening policy, with 29 (17%) screening infants in outbreaks only. There was no significant difference in the admission screening policy between units that had a current problem and those that did not. Units that had a current problem reported using routine weekly (or more frequent) screening more often than units that did not have a current problem (56% vs 41%).</p>
<p>There were sinks in all clinical areas in 98.8% of units, and 86.5% of units were able to isolate colonised infants. The wide variety of hygiene measures used on entering a clinical area is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177412456327">Figure 1</xref>, and specific hand hygiene measures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757177412456327">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>A small proportion of units (6%) required the use of aprons and gloves on entering a unit even when no patient contact was planned. Of the 13 units that required the use of aprons on entering a room, one (7.7%) had H1N1 influenza and the others reported no current problems. This contrasts with 15% in units not routinely using aprons. These units also reported fewer unit closures in the last year for infection control issues (7.7% had closed within the preceding 12 months, compared with 12.5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177412456327">
<title>Contact precautions</title>
<p>One hundred and twenty (69.7%) units required both soap and water and alcohol gel to be used by staff prior to contact with babies, with 34 (19.8%) requiring only the use of soap and water, and 17 (9.9%) requiring only alcohol gel to be used. The majority of units (77.9%) used gloves and aprons for colonised infants or those where the screening result was not known. Fifty four units (31.4%) used gloves for all patient contact and 25.6% of units used aprons for all patient contact; 14.1% of units used gloves and aprons to write in and explore the notes of colonised infants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757177412456327">
<title>Management of colonised infants and parents</title>
<p>There was an isolation room in 90.1% of the units and of these 88% used it to nurse the majority of colonised patients. Three units said that use of the isolation room was difficult because of the extra staffing demands or unit capacity. For two units the decision to use the isolation room was dependent upon advice from their infection control team, and one unit isolated MRSA only. When an infant was identified as colonised with MRSA 30% of units had a policy to test the parents, 52% (89 units) had answered that they do not test the parents. Eighteen per cent had an approach that was patient-specific with parental screening if infants were positive on their first swab, if they were persistently positive during outbreaks, and if the parents requested it.</p>
<p>When an infant was identified as being colonised with MRSA, 73.8% of units routinely de-colonised the infant, with 31 units (18.5%) not using decolonisation at all; 7.7% of units had a ‘conditional’ approach and decided on a case-by-case basis. The variation in practice according to level of unit is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1757177412456327">Figure 3</xref>. Fifty per cent of surgical units consistently used MRSA decolonisation, 30% had a conditional approach. Therefore 20% of surgical units did not use decolonisation for MRSA. We did not ascertain if the aim of decolonisation was to eradicate or supress colonisation. Success rates for successful decolonisation were not asked for as this information was unlikely to be readily available to our respondents.</p>

<p>Once an affected infant had been identified as colonised with MRSA, 8.6% of units routinely decolonised both parents, with 21.6% decolonising parents only if they tested positive. The decolonisation regimens used for the infants varied considerably. There were more than 15 different decolonisation regimens using body washes with Octenidine, Chlorhexidine, Triclosan, either in isolation or with intranasal Mupirocin or Naseptin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1757177412456327">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the wide variation in decolonisation regimens used. Following decolonisation 11.7% of units continued isolation until discharge, with 14.1% continuing barrier nursing until discharge. Sixty six per cent of units did not isolate or barrier nurse after successful decolonisation and treated the infants as if they were not colonised.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first large survey of infection control practices in United Kingdom neonatal units. The majority of neonatal units contacted agreed to take part and most responses were obtained from the charge nurse or another senior sister.</p>
<p>While the majority of units (81.5%) had a screening policy for MRSA on admission, 31.7% of units performed this only if the baby was transferred from another unit. Thus only 50% had universal screening for MRSA on admission. This is interesting considering that MRSA accounted for over a third of active infection control problems at the time of this survey, and 45% of unit closures. Identification and cohorting of positive babies has been demonstrated to reduce MRSA colonisation and infection rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412456327">Haley et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412456327">Huang et al, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412456327">Gregory et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412456327">Lepelletier et al, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, units that had closed were less likely to screen for MRSA than other units. The case with Gram negative organisms is more complex, with only 20.8% of all units screening for Gram negative organisms, yet it represented a quarter of active infection control problems. Fifty per cent of units that declared an active problem with Gram negative organisms screened for these on admission. While this may be due to a lack of treatment options for identified children, it may still be appropriate to reduce the risk of transmission and target antibiotic treatment. Nevertheless, this highlights the large variations in practice among neonatal units even when faced with similar challenges.</p>
<p>We found the reported hand hygiene practice and barrier protection measures to be variable. The finding that units that used aprons on entering a clinical area reported fewer current and past infection control problems is interesting and raises hypotheses for future studies, but our study is limited by small (self-reported) numbers.</p>
<p>When an infant is colonised with MRSA, 52% of units do not test parents at all, while 30.4% routinely test all parents. The remainder (17.5%) have variable criteria on testing parents. This finding may relate to the fact that vertical transmission of MRSA is considered uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412456327">Huang et al, 2006b</xref>) making it difficult to justify routine testing of parents. There are obvious emotional consequences to parents testing positive, especially if the child becomes seriously unwell or dies due to infection. This can also significantly complicate visiting on the unit, bonding with the child, back transfers to the ‘home’ neonatal unit and can stretch existing isolation facilities.</p>
<p>MRSA decolonisation is now routinely practised in 72% of UK units. The decolonisation regimen used, however, is one of the areas of greatest variability in this survey. We were able to ascertain at least 15 decolonisation regimens in use for an organism with a fairly predictable resistance pattern. There are small studies with newer agents demonstrating tolerance in the neonatal population and in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412456327">Bührer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412456327">Tietz et al, 2005</xref>). However, these are of small numbers and there are concerns arising from some reports of poor tolerance and injury following specific decolonisation regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177412456327">Sloot et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412456327">Darmstadt et al, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the evidence from adult studies shows varying levels of success especially in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177412456327">Scully et al, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412456327">Parras et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412456327">Tietz et al, 2005</xref>). We believe this lack of evidence is directly responsible for the wide variation in practice and are likely modifications of local adult policies.</p>
<p>There are, to our knowledge, no large randomised studies evaluating the success of decolonisation in reducing short and long term colonisation or bloodstream infections. We have previously reported on our experience with a universal screening regime for neonatal admissions, coupled with a decolonisation regime based on Octenidine body wash and Mupirocin nasal ointment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412456327">Francis et al, 2010</xref>). This showed a reduction in MRSA bacteraemia on the unit but, like other similar reports, cannot directly establish effectiveness as screening and decolonisation were implemented along with other measures including increased education and awareness of good hygiene practices. Furthermore, the number of children who had decolonisation treatment was too small to establish long term effectiveness.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Neonatal units in the UK are faced with significant infection control issues that result in unit closures and can lead to investigation from external agencies. Despite the fairly uniform nature of the threat, there is considerable variation in how it is tackled by different units, with little or no evidence to back one practice over the other. Even for organisms such as MRSA, where there exist some national guidance for adult patients, there is variation in practice especially with regards to screening and decolonisation. There is a clear need formally to evaluate effectiveness of screening practices and decolonisation in newborn infants to enable a more evidence-based approach to this serious problem.</p>
