<p>Stephen B. Shepard was once my boss. In 1993 to 1994, I worked as a correspondent for <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> magazine, where Shepard was editor in chief, and I can remember him telling me that I needed to write with conflict in mind while telling a story at the same time.</p>
<p>Shepard’s autobiography, <italic>Deadlines and Disruption: My Turbulent Path from Print to Digital</italic>, has plenty of conflict, and it’s a great story because he has accomplished so much. But it’s more than just an autobiography. For the past seven years, Shepard has been dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, which was started from scratch and is trying to be at the forefront of dramatic changes in journalism education. Shepard walks us through how the school was created and gives us a behind-the-scenes view of the major decisions. Any journalism and mass communication program administrator who has been struggling to add more multimedia and Internet training to his or her program would benefit from reading Shepard’s recount.</p>
<p>There’s more to this book, however. Shepard neatly separates the book into three distinct sections: his boyhood and early journalism career, his successful twenty-year run at the helm of <italic>BusinessWeek</italic>, and then his tenure in academia. All are interesting, and all provide lessons to any journalism student coping with the industry’s dramatic changes.</p>
<p>Born in New York in 1939, Shepard recounts his childhood and the struggles brought on by his family. His mother told him not to be too ambitious, and his father was content to stay in the same accounting job for decades. Although he was attracted to journalism in high school, Shepard earned a bachelor’s and master’s degree in engineering and thought that would be his career path. But after working for a short time at an engineering firm in New Jersey, he applied for a job at McGraw-Hill’s <italic>Product Engineering</italic> and worked there until he got a job at <italic>BusinessWeek.</italic> His forte was in covering technical stories, such as automobile safety, where he could use his engineering training.</p>
<p>Shepard later moved to an editing position at <italic>Newsweek</italic>, where he oversaw business coverage and some general news and was hired in a failed attempt to resuscitate <italic>Saturday Review.</italic> In 1984, he returned to <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> as the heir apparent to retiring editor Lewis Young. The next twenty years would be the best in the weekly magazine’s history, as Shepard led it to five general excellence wins in the National Magazine Awards category and numerous other awards. But he also exposes and discusses the warts at the magazine during his time at the helm, expressing misgivings about stories he wishes it had been more aggressive in covering or flat out missed. Although he mentions that <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> did run several cover stories about problems in corporate America, it overall missed the problems at companies such as Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom that would become household names for their transgressions.</p>
<p><italic>BusinessWeek</italic> post-Shepard fell upon hard times. In 2000, it earned more than $100 million in profits, but by 2008 it was losing $44 million, and Shepard was called in by McGraw-Hill CEO Terry McGraw to assess the situation. It’s disclosed for the first time in Shepard’s book that the company was considering closing the magazine, which started in 1929 shortly before the recession. Bloomberg LP has since bought it for $5 million and has attempted to return it to profitability. Shepard discusses the turnaround, as he also played a role in advising Bloomberg.</p>
<p>The guts of the book, however, focus on his time at CUNY. Shepard had flirted with becoming dean at the Columbia University School of Journalism, but was attracted to the CUNY position because it was his alma mater. He also relished the chance to start a program from scratch that would compete with the national powers in journalism education, including those already in New York, and attract a diverse student body. As a member of an advisory board at Columbia, he had seen its journalism program attempt to change its curriculum.</p>
<p>Shepard had twenty months from when he was hired to get the CUNY journalism program up and running. As an administrator myself, I was mesmerized by how Shepard was able to produce a curriculum in six months to be approved by the board of trustees—a necessary step before any students could be recruited. He received clearance to hire some professors without going through the normal processes, and he oversaw its state-of-the-art building in Times Square. While doing all of these tasks, he also started raising money for the program, including a $4 million gift from the Sulzberger family, stewards of the <italic>New York Times.</italic> I’m envious of what he has produced.</p>
<p>Shepard and the CUNY school are trying some new strategies that bear watching, such as a three-semester program, a paid internship for every student, and a heavy emphasis on teaching the business of media entrepreneurship. His transformation from print traditionalist to the leader of one of the country’s most avant-garde journalism programs is well worth the read.</p>
