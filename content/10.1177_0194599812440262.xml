<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective study was performed for patients undergoing tracheotomy from 2005 to 2010.

<p>Of the 592 patients included in the analysis, 128 received tracheotomy early and 464 late. Differences between age, sex, and overall survival were not statistically significant.

<body>
<p>Tracheotomy is most commonly performed for intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring prolonged intubation and ventilatory support. Advantages of tracheotomy over continued translaryngeal intubation have been well described, such as facilitation of pulmonary toilet and the reduction of laryngeal and upper airway damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812440262">1</xref></sup> Additional benefits include easier ventilator wean, increased patient mobility, decreased need for sedation, enhanced nutrition and communication, improved oral hygiene, and subjective improvement in patient satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440262">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812440262">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies involving mostly trauma patients demonstrate an association between early tracheotomy (ET) and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and ICU stay, with a possible reduced risk for developing nosocomial infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440262">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440262"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812440262"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440262">7</xref></sup> Despite these established benefits, physician and patient preference as well as the risks inherent to the surgical procedure have significantly affected the timing of tracheotomy in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Studies on trauma patients demonstrate the importance of early tracheotomy, and a consensus by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma recognized that early tracheotomy decreases days of MV and ICU length of stay in head trauma patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440262">8</xref></sup> The only consensus statement regarding tracheotomy timing in nontrauma patients was released in 1989 by the American College of Chest Physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812440262">9</xref></sup> These clinical guidelines recommended tracheotomy for patients with anticipated need for translaryngeal intubation for more than 21 days; however, the authors did not describe the predictive factors associated with prolonged intubation. Furthermore, the recommendation for continued observation for patients requiring less than 10 days of endotracheal intubation should be reviewed as studies have demonstrated signs of laryngeal injury as early as day 7 of translaryngeal intubation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812440262">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although current literature supports the practice of performing ET in trauma patients admitted to the ICU, optimal tracheotomy timing in nontrauma patients remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812440262">11</xref></sup> Existing studies are limited by small sample sizes, and meta-analyses demonstrate a great deal of heterogeneity in the definition of ET, ranging from 0 to 14 days of translaryngeal intubation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812440262">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812440262">12</xref></sup> With this in mind, we hypothesized that ET, defined as taking place between days 0 to 7 of translaryngeal intubation, is associated with decreased duration of MV, ICU stay, and overall hospital stay as compared with late tracheotomy (LT) in the critically ill, nontrauma population. There is also considerable interest in the prospect that ET may decrease timing and the development of VAP in these patients, which will similarly be examined in the present study. Severity of illness and risk of mortality, as defined by the All Patient Defined Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG), will also be explored to identify differences between groups. Finally, the ever-increasing burden of health care costs encouraged us to investigate the hospitalization cost impact of ET on ICU patients with respect to resource utilization in the context of a tertiary care medical center.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0194599812440262">
<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) institutional review board, which was conducted in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812440262">
<title>Study Design and Eligibility</title>
<p>Retrospective chart review was performed for 1092 patients who underwent tracheotomy performed by the Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck service at MSSM from 2005 to 2010. Data sources included an online institutional database with access to patient medical records and a departmental tracheotomy list. All tracheotomies were performed by traditional open surgical technique either at the bedside in the ICU or in the operating room; a Shiley size 6 or 8 cuffed tracheostomy tube was placed for females and males, respectively, unless anatomy dictated otherwise. Relative indications for performing tracheotomy in the operating room rather than bedside included perceived anatomic difficulty, history of previous tracheotomy, hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, the need for a concomitant surgical procedure, and attending preference. All patients had been in an adult ICU (older than 18 years) at the Mount Sinai Medical Center at the time of tracheotomy, including the medical intensive care unit (MICU), neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU), cardiac care unit (CCU), and surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Neonatal or pediatric patients who underwent tracheotomy (neonatal ICU and pediatric ICU) were excluded. In addition, patients who were not admitted to the ICU at the time of tracheotomy and patients with incomplete medical records were ineligible for the study. Patients who underwent upfront tracheotomy as part of a planned otolaryngologic procedure (eg, head and neck cancer resection) were also excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812440262">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected on demographics, survival, admission and discharge diagnosis of illness, patient’s past medical history, date of translaryngeal intubation, date of tracheotomy, date of ICU transfer, and date of hospital admission and discharge. We documented whether an extubation trial was attempted before tracheotomy and its outcome. The number of days of MV, ICU, and overall hospital stay were calculated as the number of calendar days, with the day of admission being considered the first day. For a subset of patients (MICU), we also recorded tracheotomy indication, short-term complications, location of procedure, and time from consult to performance of the tracheotomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812440262">
<title>Primary End Points and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Patients were stratified into 2 groups: the ET group, with tracheotomy performed from day 1 up to and including day 7 of MV, and the LT group, with tracheotomy performed after day 7 of MV. The primary end points were duration of MV, measured as the time from translaryngeal intubation to weaning day/night to tracheotomy collar, discharge to ventilatory facility, or death; duration of ICU stay, measured as time from admission/transfer to ICU to discharge from ICU or death; and length of overall hospital stay (LOS), measured as time from admission to hospital to discharge from hospital or death. Incidence of VAP was recorded as a secondary outcome. The duration from tracheotomy to ICU transfer and hospital discharge was derived from the primary end points. Univariate analyses of patient and tracheotomy factors include age, sex, admission and discharge diagnoses, and comorbidities.</p>
<p>PASW Statistics, version 18 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, New York) and Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) were used for statistical analyses. Univariate analyses of patient and disease factors include age, sex, mortality, diagnosis at admission and discharge, and comorbidities. Continuous variables in descriptive statistics are expressed in absolute frequencies and percentages. Nonparametric tests were used to compare the 2 groups, with results expressed as mean ± standard error. All tests were 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values were only reported for significant differences at the 5% level. For time-dependent end points and survival, the corresponding rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival curves were calculated by using the log-rank test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812440262">
<title>Severity of Illness and Risk of Mortality</title>
<p>Aspects of patient medical conditions that may influence decisions for ET vs LT were also of concern. The ideal measure would be for daily ICU severity scores, as determined by a system such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812440262">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812440262"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812440262"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812440262">16</xref></sup> Standard DRG is not meaningful for this population, as all 3 codes involving tracheotomy have close relative weight as a measure for patient acuity. However, our hospital’s coding software (3M, Minneapolis, Minnesota) includes medical comorbidities in determining the severity of illness (SOI) and risk of mortality (ROM) as part of the updated APR-DRG. We therefore calculated aggregate average SOI and ROM through individual records for each of the ET and LT groups for this study.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>From June 2005 to August 2010, 1092 tracheotomies were performed by the Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, with 592 patients eligible for the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812440262"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The patient characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812440262"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. The median age was 68 years (range, 18-100 years). One hundred twenty-eight patients (22%) had tracheotomies performed by day 7 of MV, and the remaining 464 patients (78%) underwent tracheotomies after 7 days. Comparison of demographic data between the 2 groups revealed no significant differences in age and sex. Respiratory failure (45% and 39%) and neurologic pathologies (22% and 31%) were the most common primary diagnoses for both ET and LT groups. Preexisting comorbidities varied, with the 2 most common being hypertension and diabetes; however, the presence of multiple medical comorbidities was observed in the majority of patients. Most tracheotomies were performed in patients admitted to the NSICU (44%) or MICU (35%), with around 66% taking place at the bedside in the ICU and the remainder in the operating room. The NSICU had the highest percentage of patients receiving ET (28%), whereas the MICU demonstrated the lowest proportion out of all ICUs studied (14%). Average time from consult to performance of tracheotomy was slightly shorter for the ET as compared with the LT group (0.96 vs 1.67 days, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Mortality and Tracheotomy-Related Complications</title>
<p>Overall mortality for our study population was approximately 30%, with no significant difference between ET and LT groups (24% vs 32%, <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). A subgroup comprising the total data from all MICU patients demonstrated a slightly higher mortality of almost 40% in this population. Of note, 29% and 33% of those who died did so before being transferred from the ICU and within 2 weeks of tracheotomy, respectively; however, no mortalities in this group were directly attributable to the surgical procedure. The overall incidence of short-term tracheotomy-related complications defined as occurring within 1 month of the surgical procedure was 20%, with a relatively higher proportion occurring in the LT as compared with the ET group (22% vs 6.7%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812440262"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). These included stomal bleeding (9.1%), tracheitis (6.7%), self-decannulation (2.9%), stomal wound (1.0%), and mucous plug (0.5%). Thirty-nine percent of patients with stomal bleeding requiring packing with nonabsorbable gauze, antibiotic-impregnated packing strips, or dissolvable hemostatic agents also later developed tracheitis despite prophylaxis with systemic antibiotic therapy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our large retrospective study, we found that ET in critically ill patients was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the duration of MV, ICU stay, and overall hospital stay. This difference is preserved across major and extreme SOI patients. Furthermore, although there was a greater portion of patients with extreme SOI in the LT group, both groups had comparable ROM. Patients’ age, sex, primary diagnosis at the time of admission, and survival were similar in both groups. Of note, patients in both groups did not differ in the time following tracheotomy to ICU discharge, suggesting that early intervention plays a critical role in facilitating de-escalation of care and faster movement through the hospital.</p>
<p>We expect that there are 3 likely reasons a patient may receive LT vs ET: (1) a patient is expected to improve but he or she does not, (2) a patient is believed to be unstable for the tracheotomy procedure early, and (3) there are social aspects to the relationship between the physician and family regarding anticipated prognosis. We do not believe that the majority of patients who received LT were medically unstable, as those patients would likely have required their procedure in the operating room with closer monitoring, yet we documented no such difference (39% for ET in the operating room vs 34% for LT). It is not clear why there was a greater preponderance of extreme SOI in the LT group, but the comparable ROM and other comorbidities as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812440262"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> raise the question of whether the social impediments to ET are more dominant, resulting in prolonged medical decision making.</p>
<p>The increased time between transfer from the ICU and hospital discharge for the LT versus ET groups is not explained by our data. It may be that these were truly sicker patients from the beginning of their hospitalization not accounted by their APR-DRG ROM. Another explanation is that their greater SOI is reflective of secondary complications of a more prolonged hospitalization (as suggested by our likely underrepresented VAP data).</p>
<p>A key finding of our study is the reduction in both ICU and overall inpatient hospital stay and the potential impact on overall health care expenditures. The ICU cost burden is significant with such patients representing less than 10% of all inpatients yet accounting for almost one-third of total hospital costs. As demonstrated by a recent study by Dasta et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812440262">17</xref></sup> this is due in large part to the expenses related to providing MV, with patients requiring greater than 3 weeks of MV representing more than half of total ICU costs. In brief, Dasta et al quantified daily hospital costs by evaluating more than 250 US hospitals and 51,000 patients who were admitted to an ICU in 2002 and found that the average ICU patient requiring MV costs $3968 per day. Based on our study’s average reduction of 8 days in the ICU in the early compared with the late tracheotomy group, the savings could be estimated to be $32,000 per patient eligible for ET.</p>
<p>To confirm this estimate, we performed a financial analysis of patients in our series and found a cost per case of $79,796 for the ET group compared with $114,300 for the LT group (a difference of $34,504). This represents a significant direct cost-differential of more than $3.2 million if LT could have been performed as ET at our institution for the 6-year period of our study, and the relevance to the institution would be far greater depending on indirect costs, additional medical professional services, and reimbursement. When extrapolated nationally, these data indicate the potential to save millions of dollars in health care costs by shortening the duration of ICU stay, expediting the movement of critically ill patients through the health care system, decreasing the rate of nosocomial infections, and more efficiently distributing and using limited hospital resources.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, because of its retrospective design, the study is limited to existing documentation in the medical record. This is best illustrated by the incidence of VAP, which was likely underreported. However, we attempted to mitigate potential bias by evaluating comorbidities and SOI. A prospective trial with specific aims and data points would have more thorough reporting and more meaningful control for confounders of comorbidity and would suggest indicators for early intervention. Second, although the average time from consult request to tracheotomy was slightly longer for the LT group, this was only by about 12 hours. The heterogeneity of patients (MICU, NSICU, CCU, and SICU) and lack of a uniform weaning protocol also hinder some interpretation of our data, and this limits medical decision making as well.</p>
<p>There is no present validated and uniformly accepted practice guideline governing the management of critically ill patients requiring MV. Numerous studies have attempted to identify predictive factors for prolonged MV, and future directions should focus on parameters at admission and during MV to guide best hospital practices. Daily APACHE II scores for ICU patients on MV may also provide insight into their prognosis for extubation vs the need for tracheotomy. A prospective study is warranted to examine the utility of identifying set criteria in predicting the need for prolonged MV as well as the risk and benefits of performing ET in critically ill patients.</p>
