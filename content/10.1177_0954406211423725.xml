<abstract>
<p>Using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based numerical methods to simulate the flow field, efficiency and performance of high-pressure turbine components of multi-stage steam turbines result in substantial differences between the experimental and the numerical results pertaining to the individual flow quantities. These differences are integrally noticeable in terms of major discrepancies in aerodynamic losses, efficiency, and performance of the turbine. As a consequence, engine manufacturers are compelled to frequently calibrate their simulation package by performing a series of experiments before issuing efficiency and performance guaranty. The aim of this article is to investigate the cause of the aforementioned differences by utilizing a three-stage high-pressure research turbine with three-dimensional compound lean blades as the platform for experimental and numerical investigations. Experimental data were obtained using interstage aerodynamic measurements at three measurement stations, namely, downstream of the first rotor row, the second stator row, and the second rotor row. Detailed measurements were conducted using custom-designed five-hole probes traversed in both circumferential and radial directions. Aerodynamic measurements were carried out within a rotational speed range of 1800–2800 r/min. Numerical simulations were performed utilizing a commercially available computational fluid dynamics code. A detailed mesh of the three stages was created and used to simulate the corresponding operating conditions. The experimental and numerical results were compared following a critical discussion relative to differences mentioned above.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211423725" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>With the recent increase in worldwide energy demands, a more efficient and reliable turbine is required for power generation applications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has continued to play a greater role in the turbomachinery industry to aid in turbine design and performance evaluation. Although the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) based CFD-tools with the existing turbulence models are capable of predicting simple flow situations, they do not provide satisfactory results for predicting the complex flow situations through high-pressure (HP) turbines. HP-turbines have relatively small aspect ratios which develop major secondary flow regions at the hub and tip. For the shrouded HP-blades, close to the hub and casing, the fluid particles move from the pressure to the suction side and generate a system of vortices. These vortices induce drag forces, causing secondary flow losses. Focusing on the secondary flow loss mechanisms, the fluid particles within the endwall boundary layers are exposed to a pitchwise pressure gradient in the blade channel. In addition, their interaction with the main flow causes angle deviation inside and outside the blade channel, resulting in additional losses. The secondary flow loss is almost inversely proportional to the aspect ratio. Thus, in HP-turbines with small aspect ratios, the secondary flow loss of almost 40–50% is the major loss contributor. It can be reduced significantly by a three-dimensional (3D) compound lean as reported, among others, by Schobeiri <italic>et al</italic>. <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423725">[1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211423725">2]</xref></bold>, where an appropriate compound lean design has brought an efficiency improvement close to 2%. These studies reveal that the efficiency and performance of HP-turbines are determined by the extent of the secondary flow zones that form the secondary flow vortices, inducing drag forces, thus, reducing the turbine efficiency. In addition, the HP-turbine blades are subjected to wake interaction, unsteady boundary layer transition, separation, and re-attachment. Thus, an HP-turbine exhibits the most appropriate platform for assessing the predictive capability of any RANS-based computational tool.</p>
<p>Denton [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211423725">3</xref></bold>] was probably the first to present an Euler solver for two-dimensional and 3D turbomachinery-based applications. Since then, and with the rapid advance in computer computational capability in the past 30 years, several commercial finite-volume and finite-element solvers have been introduced in the market. Denton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211423725">[<bold>4</bold>]</xref> used a 3D viscous solver to model a multi-stage axial turbine. A steady-state analysis was performed using the explicit finite-volume solver, and a novel inter-row mixing model was introduced. Prior to the introduction of the mixing model, a simple averaging of upstream flow quantities was applied to the downstream plane and was shown to be deficient and provide unrealistic leading-edge blade loading. The model extrapolated the upstream circumferential variation of fluxes while maintaining the conservation of flow parameters. Dawes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211423725">[<bold>5</bold>]</xref> used a 3D Navier–Stokes solver to model various secondary flow effects and blade row interaction. The solver used is similar to the code developed by Denton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211423725">[<bold>4</bold>]</xref>, and was applied to a multi-stage transonic compressor case and a single-stage reaction turbine, showing better agreement with experimental data when compared to isolated or cascade studies of the blades modeled. Adamczyk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423725"><bold>6</bold>]</xref> was able to model a low-aspect ratio stage using a 3D average-passage and axisymmetric averaging technique; results obtained showed good prediction of blade loading at various span points and the locations of secondary vortices along the radial direction. Mulac and Adamczyk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211423725">[<bold>7</bold>]</xref> used a parallelized version of the code used in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423725">[<bold>6</bold>]</xref> to model a multi-stage compressor, obtaining good stage to stage pressure ratio predictions while overpredicting the stage efficiency values. The solver was shown to be deficient in predicting the total pressure at the endwall regions.</p>
<p>More recently, Gerolymos and Hanisch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211423725">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref> presented a steady-state model of a four-stage axial turbine at off-design and design conditions. An in-house code was used that utilized a Favre RANS scheme and a two-equation Launder Sharma <italic>k–ε</italic> turbulence model employed to the implicit upwind solver. The mixing planes between rows used a phantom node technique which creates an overlapping in between blade rows. The model was found to accurately predict the stage pressure ratios but overpredicted the machine efficiency when compared to corresponding experimental data. Moreover, the model was found to overpredict the circumferentially averaged radial total pressure at various axial positions. At the low mass flow condition, the discrepancy between numerical and experimental data increased. Gerolymos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211423725">[<bold>9</bold>]</xref> were able to improve their results by the use of an advanced Reynolds stress model, which uses seven equations to achieve turbulence closure, six equations for the six components of the symmetric Reynolds stress tensor, and a seventh equation to determine the scale. The authors showed improved prediction performance when compared to a two-equation baseline <italic>k–ε</italic> model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211423725">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>.</p>
<p>A steady-state analysis of turbomachinery is inherently deficient as it averages the time-dependent interactions that occur between blade rows. Barter et al. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211423725">10</xref></bold>] used a time-accurate multi-stage Navier–Stokes solver to model various stator–rotor interaction effects in a transonic turbine. The authors used two approaches. The first technique imposed a specified time-dependent distortion from the adjacent row, and the second technique used a fully coupled stage analysis. The imposed distortion failed to capture the waves that are reflected back and forth from the blade rows, whereas the second method managed to capture all the physical phenomena well when compared to corresponding experimental data. The same solver was used by Van Zante et al. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211423725">11</xref></bold>] to model a highly loaded axial compressor. The compressor was modeled using a single passage, multiple passages, and a half annulus. The authors compared a fully coupled stage analysis for the half annulus versus phase-lag boundary conditions for the single- and multiple-passage models. The added storage and computational cost of a transient analysis means, for most turbine design activities and some analysis purposes, a steady-state simulation is preferred.</p>
<p>The objective of the investigations reported in this article is to identify the source of the aforementioned discrepancies. This task requires: (a) a meticulous experimental investigation of all individual thermo-fluid quantities and their interactions, resulting in an integral behavior of the turbomachine in terms of efficiency and performance; (b) a detailed numerical investigation using appropriate grid densities based on simulation sensitivity; and (c) steady and unsteady simulations to quantify their impact on the final numerical results. To perform the above experimental and numerical tasks, a three-stage HP axial turbine rotor has been designed for generating benchmark data and to compare with the numerical results. Detailed interstage radial and circumferential traversing presents a complete flow picture of the second stage. Performance measurements were carried out for design and off-design rotational speeds. As mentioned earlier, for comparison with numerical simulation, the turbine was numerically modeled using the steady-state RANS solver by ANSYS-CFX code. An extensive mesh sensitivity study was performed to achieve a grid-independent accuracy of the numerical results. The boundary conditions were taken from the experiments. Additionally, a simplified time-unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation was performed to compare its results to the steady-state data. In discussing the results, a close look is taken at the physics behind the models, particularly at the dissipation equation and its major deviation from the exact equation. This helps to better understand the deficiency of the existing <italic>ε</italic>-equation and, thus, the associated <italic>ω</italic>-equation, and explains why these models are not capable of a priory predicting any arbitrary flow situation and require calibration for each single-flow case.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211423725"><title>2 HP-TURBINE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH FACILITY</title>
<p>The turbine research facility at the Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL) was developed and designed by Schobeiri et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423725"> [<bold>1</bold>]</xref>. It is a multi-purpose versatile test bed to measure the aerodynamics, heat transfer, film cooling, and performance of turbines with different rotor and stator configurations. The overall layout of the test facility is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423725">Figure 1</xref>. It consists of a 300-kW electric motor connected to a variable-frequency controller which drives the compressor component. A three-stage centrifugal compressor supplies air with a maximum pressure difference of 55 kPa and a volume flow rate of 4 m<sup>3</sup> /s. The compressor operates in suction mode and its pressure and volumetric flow rate can be varied by changing its operating frequency from 0 to 66 Hz. A pipe including a flow straightener followed by a stainless steel honey comb connects the compressor to a calibrated Venturi flow meter to measure the mass flow through the turbine component. The exit diffuser attached to the turbine serves as a smooth transition piece between the turbine component and the pipe, leading to the Venturi flow meter. The three-stage turbine with a fully automated data acquisition system has an integrated heater–inlet system. The purpose of the heater is: (a) to maintain a constant inlet temperature, and (b) to prevent condensation of water from humid air that expands through the turbine during the operation.

<p>The turbine shaft is connected through a flexible coupling with one end connected to a high-precision torque meter that has a maximum rotation speed of 8500 r/min and a maximum torque of 677.9 Nm. The accuracy of this meter is 0.02% of full scale. The other end of the torque meter is coupled via a second flexible coupling to an eddy current low-inertia dynamometer with the maximum power of 150 kW, a maximum torque of 500 Nm, a maximum rotational speed of 8000 r/min, a torque accuracy of 1.25 Nm (0.25% of full scale load), and a rotational speed accuracy of 1 r/min (0.0125% of full-scale revolutions per minute). The dynamometer is controlled by a Texcel V4-EC controller, including an RS-232 port interface for data acquisition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211423725">Table 1</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423725">Figure 2</xref> shows the TPFL turbine geometry and the location of interstage measurement stations 3–5. At the three interstage measurement stations, five-hole probes are placed in-line with the incoming absolute and relative flow velocity vectors. Traversing the flow field in radial and circumferential directions is accomplished by a seven-axis traversing system with step motor controller with encoder and decoder on each axis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423725">Figure 1</xref>, three of the stepper motors move the probes individually in radial direction, while the fourth motor sitting on top of the facility moves the system of three radial traverses in circumferential direction. Each of these traverses is equipped with a miniature stepper motor attached to a worm gear. These motors are activated when the flow angles relative to the probe are out of the calibration range. To insure the movement of the probes exactly to the prescribed position, a computer algorithm is written that creates a user-specified grid of radial and circumferential positions. The same algorithm also records the pressures from the PSI-9016 pressure scanner. The measurement window has a resolution of 31 radial and 71 circumferential measurement points. The pressure data from the three probes are used to generate the total and static pressure distributions, velocity components, flow angles and the spanwise distribution of total pressure loss coefficients, and the efficiency for each row.
<fig id="fig2-0954406211423725" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Meridional view of the TPFL research turbine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423725-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211423725"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Interstage measurements were conducted at stations 3–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423725">Figure 2</xref>. For this purpose, three L-shaped five-hole probes were used. The first and the third probes installed at stations 3 and 5 were calibrated at low subsonic Mach number (<italic>M</italic> = 0.1), whereas the second one installed at station 4 was calibrated at <italic>M</italic> = 0.3 taking into account the compressibility effect for slightly higher subsonic Mach number. A non-nulling calibration method was applied. The five-hole probes were independently calibrated in a fully automated calibration facility. Each one of the probes were placed in an angular indexing mechanism and then was pitched and yawed through the range of angles −20° to 20° in pitch and −30° to 30° in yaw in 1° increments covering a matrix of 2400 points. The calibration facility probe indexing mechanism uses two stepper motors that are computer-controlled to achieve a very fine angle resolution. The three probes were placed first in the mid-height of the blade. At this radial position, they are aligned with the main flow at specified angles. While the stator's exit flow angle changes only from hub to tip, the rotor's absolute exit flow angle changes from hub to tip and also changes its direction whenever the rotational speed changes. As a result, the probe downstream of the stator can be aligned with the stator absolute exit flow angle, while the probe downstream of the rotor must be adjusted to the rotor's absolute exit flow angle whenever the rotational speed of the machine changes. Once adjusted, the probes are successively lowered to the hub from which the flow traversing to the tip takes place. The absolute and relative flow angles and velocity components of the turbine rows are calculated by implementing the probe adjustment angle for each of the three probes at stations 3, 4, and 5, respectively.</p>
<p>For the performance instrumentation, combined total pressure and total temperature rakes are used upstream of the first stator row and downstream of the last rotor row. At the inlet, four rakes were located radially at 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°. Each rake consists of four total pressure and three total temperature probes that are equidistantly distributed in the radial direction. The total pressure probes are of the Pitot tube types, and the total temperature probes are calibrated J-type thermocouples. The calibration curves for the thermocouples are implemented into the performance data reduction program. To reduce the wake thickness originating from the trailing edge of the inlet rakes, the rakes are shaped aerodynamically with round leading and sharp trailing edges. The four exit rakes are located radially with the same spacing as the inlet rakes but offset to them in order to prevent the interference with the inlet rake wakes. Wall static pressure taps are arranged at the top and bottom half of the main casing and on the T-rings, as well as on the stator rings. The total pressure tubings from the rakes (from wall static pressure taps and also from the three five-hole probes) are connected to a set of 7 × 16 calibrated pressure PSI-scanners with an accuracy of 0.05% of full scale. A special PSI-scanner measures the barometric pressure.</p>
<p>During data acquisition, the compressor and heater are started, allowing the turbine to spool up to the designated shaft speed as set by the dynamometer controller (dynamometer is run in constant shaft speed mode). The heater controller set temperature is applied according to the required pressure ratio, which is in turn determined by the compressor operation frequency. The system is allowed to run for 1 h to achieve a steady-state condition after which the probe traverse is initiated. At each radial movement at a designated circumferential position, a wait time, data sampling rate, and number of samples to be acquired are applied. The time period to complete a full set of radial and circumferential traversing is ca. 16 h. Due to changes of ambient conditions over this period of time, all obtained data are converted to a standardized condition. The experimental data obtained are circumferentially averaged using a consistent arithmetic averaging technique similar to the methodology used by Schobeiri et al. <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423725">[1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211423725">2]</xref></bold>. The entire data acquisition process is repeated three times to insure that no erroneous data have been measured. Once the results of two successive data sets are fully identical, the data will be stored for further analysis; otherwise, the experiments are repeated until fully identical results have been obtained. The experimental uncertainty for each individual quantity is presented in Table 4.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211423725"><title>3 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS</title>
<p>A thorough evaluation of the predictive capability of any numerical procedure requires the calibration of the numerical solver through a comparison of experimentally determined flow parameters with their corresponding numerical predictions. This is the main premise of this research effort. The quality of obtained numerical results is dependent, among other things, on turbulence and transition models, grid discretization, and the boundary condition. In this article, the steady RANS simulation results for turbine frequency of 1800–2800 r/min using the commercial solver ANSYS-CFX are compared to the experimentally determined results for the corresponding operating points.</p>
<p>An annular geometry was created and imported into ICEM-CFD. Using a blocking technique for each blade row and the seal geometry, a structured hexahedral mesh was created. The mesh created is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211423725">Figure 3</xref>. The created stator mesh has around 800 000 hexahedral elements, whereas the rotor elements have about 1.8 million hexahedral elements. The hub and tip seal domains each are in the order of 200 000 elements. The total element number for the three stages is approximately 9.5 million elements. The wall boundary layer discretization used 15 points for the stator domains and 20 points for the rotor walls. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211423725">Figure 4</xref> shows the <italic>Y</italic><sup>+</sup> distribution for the blade wall at stator 1, rotor 1, and stator 2, with most values within a <italic>Y</italic><sup>+ </sup>= 1. The boundary conditions were obtained from inlet and outlet measurement rakes used in the facility and detailed in the previous section. Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423725">Fig. 2</xref>, numerical domain, inlet, and outlet points are measurement stations 1 and 7, respectively.

</p>
<p>Each blade row was defined as a domain within the code workspace, and specific interfaces are defined for the seals’ entrance and exit points for both the rotor and stator stages. Between the stator and rotor stages, a ‘Stage’ interface is used which, according to Ref. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211423725">12</xref></bold>], performs a circumferential averaging of the fluxes through bands on the interface between the stator and rotor. This is another name for the mixing-plane method introduced by Denton, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211423725">4</xref></bold>]. This model allows for steady-state predictions to be obtained for multi-stage machines. In addition, circumferential periodic boundary conditions are placed on the upper and lower surfaces of both the stator and rotor domains as well as the hub and tip seal domains. The boundary conditions applied to the model are designed to mimic the experimental conditions and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211423725">Table 2</xref> for the 1800 and 2600 r/min cases.

<p>The turbulence model used in this study was the shear stress transport (SST) model which uses a blending function at the wall location.

<sec id="sec6-0954406211423725"><title>4 COMPARISON OF RESULTS</title>
<p>Upon convergence, the numerical results were analyzed and compared to the previously obtained interstage experimental results. Convergence was deemed achieved when root mean square residual values for RANS equations and the two-turbulence model transport equations reached a magnitude below 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> . Moreover, several flow parameters were monitored at various locations in the model to insure that the individual solutions had reached the convergence. Data obtained from the CFD solver were compared to that obtained from experimental results at the measurement stations 3–5, which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423725">Figure 2</xref>. In what follows, the results are presented followed by a detailed discussion that is aimed at explaining the route cause of the differences between the experimental and numerical results. Since all quantities, measured or calculated, are strongly interrelated, discussing individual quantities without including the others is without merit. Therefore, the discussion that follows the results is of a conceptual nature that involves all quantities included in this investigation.</p>

These two distinctively different operation frequencies were chosen to expedite the predictive capability of the numerical method relative to the off-design and near-design operating points. There are significant differences between the experimentally measured and numerically calculated angles, particularly at the rotor exit stations 3 and 5. The discrepancy is large, at 1800 r/min, for all radial locations, but is significantly reduced as the machine speed is increased, as shown in the 2600 r/min case. The largest discrepancies between the calculated and the measured values are in the blade hub and tip regions, where secondary flow effects impart significant changes on the velocity flow field. For the stator exit condition, station 4, the values measured and predicted are within 5° and are predicted more accurately by the solver over the stator hub-to-tip span with the exception of the 1800 r/min case, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211423725">Figure 5</xref>. At the tip location, there is a large deviation between flow angles measured and calculated using CFD. In the case of the meridional angle <italic>γ</italic>, there is a similarity in patterns between both experimental and numerical values; however, the similarity is not observed in the near-wall regions at tip and hub.

The absolute Mach numbers are shown to be subsonic for all stations 3–5 and below the compressibility limit for all stations with the exception of the stator exit point, station 4. Similar to the pattern exhibited by the velocity flow angles, the hub and tip regions display greater differences when compared to the mid-span area. The solver does, however, manage to capture a slight velocity peak at points adjacent to the hub for stations 3 and 5. The discrepancy observed in both relative and absolute Mach numbers is quite significant, particularly at the hub and tip locations, where secondary flows are predominant. Differences are observed as high as 0.05 in Mach number or close to 20 m/s. Since the relative velocity is a vectorial subtraction of the circumferential velocity from the absolute velocity, the discrepancies observed in absolute velocity are similar to the values shown in the relative Mach numbers.

This difference is the lowest for stations 3 and 5 and increases at station 4. A comparison between the experimental static pressure values and numerical ones show that the numerical values are higher by about 1500 Pa for station 4 which amounts to a 2% to 3% of overprediction by the solver. The same pattern is observed in the absolute total pressure. Due to the relatively large differences in both total pressures predicted by the solver, contours, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211423725">Figs 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211423725">12</xref> for <italic>n</italic> = 1800 r/min and <italic>n</italic> = 2800 r/min, respectively, were normalized using maximum and minimum values in the contour <italic>Pt<sub>n</sub></italic> = (<italic>P</italic><sub>t</sub> − <italic>P</italic><sub>tmin</sub>)/(<italic>P</italic><sub>tmax</sub> − <italic>P</italic><sub>tmin</sub>).

<p>Turbomachinery stator–rotor blade interactions are highly time-dependent and the experimental results taken use a five-hole probe which inherently produces temporally averaged pressure data (due to their low-frequency response to pressure changes). A URANS simulation was performed at the 2600 r/min case as a means to show how much improvement in the numerical prediction of various flow parameters a time-dependent simulation can present.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0954406211423725"><title>Numerical mesh of URANS</title>
<p>A numerical mesh was created using ICEM-CFD's multi-block structure and was based on the steady-state (RANS) analysis mesh. Due to computational resource constraints, the initial mesh had to be significantly coarsened to create the mesh used for the URANS simulation. The new mesh maintained the same near-wall discretization used in the steady-state mesh but was coarsened at other regions in the mesh. Stator domains contained about 500,000 hexahedral elements, while the rotor domains used 900,000 hexahedral elements. Moreover, in order to facilitate a rapid convergence, the stator hub and rotor tip seal domains were removed. The total meshed regions contained approximately 3 million elements. The transient simulation parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211423725">Table 3</xref>.

<sec id="sec14-0954406211423725"><title>6 DISCUSSION ON CFD-DEFICIENCIES</title>
<p>Considering the experimental and numerical data presented above, in the following, an attempt is made to explain the cause of the CFD-deficiencies in accurately predicting the efficiency and performance of HP-turbines. As mentioned in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-0954406211423725">Section 1</xref>, the flow through the stages of a HP-turbine is extremely complex due to the existence of the secondary flow at the hub and tip regions, wake interaction between blade rows, strong negative pressure gradient, and the transitional nature of the flow, to name a few parameters. The existing turbulence and transition models are not capable of accurately predicting the flow behavior. At the outset, it should be emphasized that CFD with the existing models is capable of simulating flow situations that are not as complex as the HP-turbine flow is. To explain the cause of the deficiencies in context of HP-turbine aerodynamics, we resort to the coordinate invariant Navier–Stokes equation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211423725"> [<bold>18</bold>]</xref> It reads
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954406211423725"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423725-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The turbulent shear stress associated with the intermittency function <italic>γ</italic> plays a crucial role in affecting the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. This is particularly significant for calculating the wall friction under intermittently laminar–turbulent flow conditions. As is well known, two quantities have to be accurately modeled: one is the intermittency function and the other the Reynolds stress tensor with its nine components from which six are distinct. Inaccurate modeling of these two quantities leads to a multiplicative error of their product. This error particularly affects the accuracy of the total pressure losses (through wall friction) and efficiencies. A deficient intermittency modeling affects the boundary layer development, leading to under/overprediction of wall shear stress; thus, the velocity distribution, leading to inaccurate prediction of mass flow, total pressure and, thus, losses and the efficiency.</p>
<p>A deficient modeling of the Reynolds stress tensor has an equally negative impact on the flow simulation. In this context, an accurate modeling of the dissipation equation that appears in both <italic>k</italic>–<italic>ε</italic> and <italic>k</italic>–<italic>ω</italic> equations is of crucial importance. Implementing the exact equations for <italic>ε</italic> and <italic>ω</italic> that constitute the basis for <italic>k</italic>–<italic>ε</italic> and <italic>k</italic>–<italic>ω</italic> model, major modifications and simplifications had to be performed (for a comprehensive treatment of this subject, we refer to Schobeiri<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211423725"> [<bold>18</bold>]</xref>). Actually, in the case of <italic>γ</italic>-equation, the exact equation is surgically modified beyond recognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211423725"> [<bold>18</bold>]</xref>. Under this circumstance, none of the existing turbulence models can be regarded as universally applicable. Considering this situation, however, satisfactory results can be obtained if in a particular flow situation, the impact of the above parameters is not as adverse as is in HP-turbine case. Examples of satisfactory simulations are flow cases with moderate pressure gradients, no wake interactions, and simple geometries. Even in simple geometries where the sign of the pressure gradient changes abruptly, a flow separation and re-attachment may occur. In this case, an accurate prediction of boundary layer transition is crucial for an adequate numerical prediction. In more complicated cases where the frame of reference changes from stationary to rotating and vice versa with unsteady wake interaction present, caution must be exercised in interpreting the results. Despite the facts discussed above, cases have been observed, where even a RANS calculation delivers reasonable results [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211423725">18</xref></bold>]. In these cases, an over/underprediction of intermittency combined with under/overprediction of the Reynolds stress cancels each other's effects, leading to reasonable results.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-0954406211423725"><title>7 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>A combined experimental–numerical study dealing with a complex flow through a three-stage research HP-turbine was presented. Detailed experimental benchmark data, including the interstage flow measurements and performance experiments, were presented to compare with the numerical simulations. The simulations used a commercially available solver ANSYS-CFX and utilized the SST turbulence model. Starting with a steady/RANS calculation, quantitative and qualitative discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results were observed. In an attempt to abate the differences observed, an unsteady solver or URANS calculation was performed, averaged temporally, and compared to experimental and RANS data, showing no significant improvement. It is argued that the root cause of the discrepancies between numerical and experimental data can be attributed to the inability of the turbulence model and the lack of an experimentally substantiated transition model to adapt to the highly complex flow field observed in a HP-turbine. The numerical results provide an overall picture of the flows observed in the turbine. The majority of the flow trends are captured; however, their magnitudes do not align well with the experimentally measured data. Given the capability of the existing turbulence models, further development needs to focus on providing appropriate closure modeling and auxiliary relations that are geared toward turbomachinery flows and the development of an unsteady transition model that considers the unsteady wake interaction between blade rows.</p></sec>
