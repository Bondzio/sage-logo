<sec id="sec1-0040571X13475404i"><title>Kim Haines-Eitzen, <bold><italic>The Gendered Palimpsest: Women, Writing and Representation in Early Christianity</italic></bold>, Oxford University Press: New York and Oxford, 2012; 128 pp.: 9780195171297, £40.00/$65.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>In this scholarly and entertaining book, Kim Haines-Eitzen challenges some assumptions about women and the reading and writing of books, aiming to show that both books and (women’s) bodies in the early Church are ‘unstable and malleable’ (p. 134). She refuses a simplistic narrative that would suggest that ‘women were once involved in the writing process but have long since been forgotten’ or that ‘equality between men and women … gave way to subordination’ (p. 133). Instead, she shows how textual evidence reveals a story of debate and controversy about the status of women, texts and the bodies of both.</p>
<p>In Part I, Haines-Eitzen surveys the evidence for women’s association with books in Christian Late Antiquity: women as authors, readers and the recipients of texts. She treats women who composed texts (e.g. Perpetua, Proba and Egeria) and the less well-known evidence for female scribes (i.e. those who copied out the compositions of others) and women who owned, lent and commissioned books. Haines-Eitzen suggests that, although one should not exaggerate the evidence, female literacy was perhaps not so unusual as has often been assumed (p. 38). In contrast, she questions the idea that texts such as the <italic>Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles</italic> should be regarded as ‘popular’ and thus ‘women’s’ literature (ch. 3). Probing the specific <italic>qualities</italic> associated with female readers, Haines-Eitzen identifies a connection between female reading and the devotional life – especially the life of the virgin ascetic, who emerges as a kind of ideal reader. Books and women are found to be connected in that ‘reading has become yet another means by which the body can be disciplined’ (p. 51).</p>
<p>In Part II, Haines-Eitzen moves from female writers, owners and readers of texts, to the appearance in texts of women such as Eve, Mary, Mary Magdalene and Thecla. In a series of fascinating examples, she shows how women’s roles were either transformed or made more ambiguous by successive retellings of stories or recopyings of texts. She eschews the simplistic conclusion that women were written out of texts, but does show that variations in the textual traditions are important evidence for disputes about the theological significance and social roles of women. One can even point to evidence that scribes were editing texts to avoid over-eroticizing interpretations (see, e.g., ch. 6).</p>
<p>Haines-Eitzen presents her evidence with clarity and scholarly precision, never becoming bogged down in the detail nor assuming too much of the reader. Greek and Hebrew and a little theory is used in places, but a knowledge of it is not necessary for an appreciation of her argument. Haines-Eitzen’s work builds on and draws together a number of recent studies by herself and others, thus serving as a way into a body of less accessible scholarly research. This is fully referenced in the endnotes and bibliography, so that the reader can easily pursue a particular topic further. The book is written in a lively and witty style which engages the reader and draws her into the world which Haines-Eitzen describes.</p>
