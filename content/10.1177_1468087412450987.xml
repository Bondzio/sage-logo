<abstract>
<p>Diesel engine emissions of oxides of nitrogen and smoke can be reduced simultaneously through the use of high levels of exhaust gas recirculation to achieve low-temperature combustion. However, single fuel injection per cycle diesel low-temperature combustion is also characterized by high fuel consumption and high total unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. This work focuses on investigating the potential of a split (50/50) main fuel-injection strategy to reduce smoke, total unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions at exhaust gas recirculation levels lower than those required to achieve single-injection diesel low-temperature combustion at a medium-load, medium-speed operating condition. Experiments were performed on a 0.51 l single-cylinder high-speed direct-injection diesel engine running at 1500 r/min at an operating condition corresponding to a gross indicated mean effective pressure of 500 kPa. At this load, exhaust gas recirculation levels of 62% are needed to realize near-zero nitrogen oxide and smoke emissions, but this leads to an unacceptable reduction in thermal efficiency as well as high total unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. This work compares the effects of split fuel injections at an exhaust gas recirculation level of 52% by volume to those from single injections at exhaust gas recirculation levels of 52% and 62%. The results demonstrate that the combined effects of exhaust gas recirculation rate and split injections can achieve near-zero nitrogen oxide with good thermal efficiency and total unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions much lower than at 62% exhaust gas recirculation. Single injection at this point results in excessive smoke, which can be reduced by over 75% through the split-injection strategy. These results are particularly relevant as they demonstrate very low nitrogen oxide emissions from an engine operation with acceptable thermal efficiency and at practical exhaust gas recirculation levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concerns of finite petroleum resources, energy security and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions are driving interest in more fuel-efficient light-duty passenger vehicles. The latest European legislation limits the fleet average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (which are directly related to fuel efficiency) to 130 g/km for passenger cars from 2012 onwards and aims at setting a target of 95 g/km as average emissions for a new car fleet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412450987">1</xref></sup> Thus, diesel engines are particularly appealing because of their lower fuel consumption compared to other common engine types, combined with recent improvements in diesel driveability. However, emissions of particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>X</sub>) from diesel engines are typically higher than those of comparable gasoline engines, and thus present a technical challenge to the diesel engine research and development community. Euro 6 emission legislation will limit NO<sub>X</sub> and PM emissions to 0.08 g/km and 0.005 g/km, respectively, for light-duty diesel vehicles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412450987">2</xref></sup> and other jurisdictions are implementing similarly stringent regulations. Although various existing exhaust after-treatment systems are capable of meeting current emission standards and are being developed to meet the future standards, they add complexity and cost to the power-train system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412450987">3</xref></sup> One method of meeting the stringent future emission legislation for NO<sub>X</sub> and PM that has received significant recent attention is alternative forms of diesel engine combustion such as low-temperature combustion (LTC).</p>
<p>In diesel LTC, the local combustion temperature and the equivalence ratio in the reaction zone are reduced, typically by charge dilution, thereby achieving simultaneous reductions in NO<sub>X</sub> and soot emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412450987">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412450987"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412450987">7</xref></sup> However, LTC has the major disadvantages of higher total unburned hydrocarbons (THCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions; at medium load, fuel economy is also inferior compared to conventional diesel combustion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412450987">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref></sup> Typical forms of LTC combine high levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR ~50–65%) with either advanced or retarded fuel-injection timing. This combination allows the combustion phasing to be controlled independently from the fuel’s auto-ignition kinetics. Increasing the amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber by increasing the engine intake air pressure at constant EGR rate has been shown to reduce THC emissions and improve fuel economy; however, emissions at medium load still remain excessive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref></sup> These emissions are thought to be a result of local pockets of rich mixture that do not oxidize fully with LTC due to late combustion phasing and low reaction-zone temperatures that lead to increased bulk quenching.</p>
<p>One way to improve fuel-charge mixing in diesel engines is to use multiple fuel-injection events. Combining multiple injections with high levels of EGR (&gt;50% depending on the engine and injection strategy) is thought to minimize the occurrences of rich mixture zones during LTC operation, thus helping to reduce THCs and CO emissions and improving fuel economy. A variety of multiple-injection strategies and their effects are described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412450987"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412450987">15</xref></sup> Koci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412450987">9</xref></sup> showed that at certain injection timings and fuel-split fractions, multiple injections were effective in further reduction of THCs and CO emissions from the single-injection optimal emissions at LTC with 67% EGR (by mass). Soot emissions, however, increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412450987">9</xref></sup> Multiple advanced fuel-injection strategies (with up to three pulses per cycle) with high levels of EGR also showed improvements in combustion phasing and thermal efficiency in LTC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412450987">10</xref></sup> Retarded close-spaced injection timings with different combustion chamber shapes and injectors at different split ratios have also been investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412450987">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412450987"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412450987">15</xref></sup> It is reported that by optimizing the injection conditions (i.e. start of injection (SOI) timing, dwell time and fuel mass ratio between the injections), THCs and CO emissions, along with engine noise, can be reduced under highly dilute (i.e. high EGR) LTC conditions with near-top dead centre timing two-stage injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412450987">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412450987">12</xref></sup> Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412450987">16</xref></sup> investigated various fuels with different cetane numbers with very high levels of EGR (60% by volume) with retarded close-spaced injection timings with a split ratio of 20/80 along with various dwell timings. They showed that with optimized dwell timing and injection ratio, two-stage injection can reduce THCs and CO emissions. The cited work suggested that improvements in fuel–air mixing at relatively high intake oxygen concentrations (12%) were necessary to reduce soot and NO<sub>X</sub> emissions simultaneously, while keeping THCs and CO emissions at acceptably low levels.</p>
<p>Although the potential benefits of diesel LTC are clear, a practical diesel LTC system has yet to be implemented in a production engine. One of the main barriers remains the requirement for EGR levels that can exceed 65% by volume (depending on operating condition). These EGR levels are much greater than the 40–50% by volume needed to achieve near-zero NO<sub>X</sub> emissions (the specific EGR levels and the associated NO<sub>X</sub> and smoke response depend strongly on the operating conditions of an engine). However, at 40–50% EGR levels, smoke emissions are substantially above conventional diesel engine-out levels. With a single fuel-injection event, higher levels of EGR (often &gt;65% by volume) are needed to reduce smoke emissions. However, fuel efficiency is impaired, partial combustion byproduct emissions increase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412450987">17</xref></sup> and the combustion event then becomes very sensitive to small changes in operating parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412450987">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, the ability of the engine to respond to transients is compromised. Any technique that reduces the EGR requirements for LTC operation would undoubtedly make it a more appealing technology. In the present work, we evaluate the potential to achieve low-emission diesel operation with levels of EGR lower than required for a single fuel injection LTC by using a split (50/50) main-injection strategy and advanced injection timings. This aims to control THCs and CO emissions, while achieving near-zero NO<sub>X</sub> at smoke emissions and fuel efficiency comparable to conventional diesel combustion.</p>

<title>Experimental apparatus</title>
<p>The research facility used in this work was based on an AVL 5402 single-cylinder high-speed diesel engine that is a single-cylinder version of a typical 2 l four-cylinder light-duty high-speed direct-injection diesel engine. It featured a central fuel injector and three valves (two inlets and one exhaust) with double overhead camshaft valve-train. It may be noted that this engine was a modified version of the original engine, where one of the two exhaust valves was deactivated and removed to have in-cylinder optical access through a borescope. For the work reported here, a dummy plug was inserted in the borescope access tube. The fuelling system was a Bosch common-rail CP3 injection system consisting of a production type high-pressure common-rail fuel pump supplying fuel to the injector up to a pressure of 135 MPa. A fuel-conditioning unit maintained a constant-temperature fuel supply to the injector. An automotive grade sulphur-free diesel fuel (sulphur content &lt;10 mg/kg) that meets the current British Standard BS EN 590 and complies with the current requirements of the UK ‘Motor Fuel (Composition and Content) Regulations’ was used. Detailed specification of the engine, the fuelling system and the fuel used in this work are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087412450987">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>A custom-built air exchange system consisting of proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controlled boost and EGR systems, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087412450987">Figure 1</xref>, was developed for the facility. The system was controlled independently from the engine, allowing investigation of wider ranges of intake pressures and EGR gas fractions. Both intake and exhaust systems included 25 l surge tanks to damp out pressure pulsations. The exhaust system was equipped with a controllable exhaust back-pressure valve; this generated the pressure differential needed to drive EGR into the intake stream and to provide an engine-out pressure similar to that encountered by a turbocharged diesel engine. The details of the boost and EGR systems have been reported in earlier publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087412450987">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>The research engine facility was fully instrumented with provision to measure air temperature and pressure, fuel flow and air flow rates and in-cylinder pressure. Fuel consumption was determined by an AVL 733 dynamic gravimetric fuel meter. The mass flow rate of air was measured with an EPI 8712MPNH thermal mass flow meter. The intake air temperature was measured with a resistance temperature detector. Temperatures at different locations were measured with standard K-type thermocouples. Pressures upstream of the intake and downstream of the exhaust surge tanks were measured with two Omega PXM219-006GI pressure transducers. All this low-speed data was acquired at a frequency of 1 Hz over a duration of at least 3 minutes.</p>
<p>In-cylinder and intake pressures were measured on a crank-angle (CA) resolved basis. The CA was measured with a resolution of 0.5° CA by an AVL 365 optical CA encoder mounted directly on the engine crank shaft. Intake pressure was measured at a 0.5° CA interval with a Kistler 4045A5 piezo-resistive pressure transducer, and the in-cylinder pressure was measured using a flush mounted water-cooled AVL QC34C quartz piezo-electric pressure transducer. In the work reported here, all these high-speed data were averaged using at least 200 consecutive engine cycles and the average in-cylinder pressure data was used to derive the combustion parameters reported here.</p>
<p>Emission measurements to determine the concentrations of CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, THCs, NO<sub>X</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust were conducted using a Horiba Mexa 7100HEGR emission analyzer bench. For this unit, undiluted raw exhaust gas samples were collected downstream of the exhaust surge tank. This system also measured the intake CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to determine the EGR level. The intake sample was drawn from downstream of the intake surge tank to ensure a homogeneous fresh air EGR mixture. The EGR mole fraction was determined as the ratio of the intake to the exhaust CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations minus the ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (fixed at 0.038% by volume). Raw exhaust gases, sampled after the exhaust back-pressure valve, were fed to an AVL 415 smoke meter to determine smoke emissions. The smoke emissions, reported here in terms of filter smoke number (FSN), were not used to estimate the PM mass emissions because of the uncertainties in the FSN–PM correlations at high EGR levels.</p>

<p>where θ is the CA and γ is the specific heat ratio (γ = 1.33, assumed constant). Integrating the net energy release up to a certain CA and normalizing it by the cumulative energy release provides the fraction of energy release up to that point. Typical points of interest in this work included the phasing of the 5%, 50% and 95% values of the cumulative energy release (designated CA5, CA50 and CA95, respectively). The start of combustion (SOC) was identified as being the start of the main energy release and did not include the ‘cool-flame’ pre-combustion reactions. Premixing time was defined as the difference in time (in ° CA) between the start of injection for the first injected fuel mass (SOI1) and the SOC.

<title>Operating conditions</title>
<p>The objective of this work was to investigate the potential of split injections on reducing the EGR requirements for achieving diesel LTC and on reducing THCs, CO emissions and GISFC. This work focused on EGR levels of ~52 ± 0.5% EGR by volume at a fixed intake pressure of 120 kPa (absolute). It should be noted that although the EGR rate was held constant, owing to the varying amount of oxygen in the exhaust, the intake oxygen mass fraction was variable (11–12%). To provide a baseline over the full sweep from conventional diesel combustion to LTC regime, a set of single-injection tests were conducted where the EGR was varied from 0 to 62% by volume at the fixed intake pressure.</p>
<p>In this work, advanced injection timing was used compared to standard diesel operation. The start of fuel-injection timing for the single-injection case was adjusted for the ‘maximum advance for best indicated torque’ (MBT SOI timing), while keeping the rate of pressure rise below 1 MPa/° CA. It was reported in an earlier publication that the MBT injection timing achieved lower THC emissions and improved GISFC compared to constant combustion phasing (CA50) injection timings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref></sup> A constant fuelling quantity of 15.6 ± 0.2 mg/cycle was used at a constant engine speed of 1500 r/min; for the single-injection case at these EGR levels, this generated a GIMEP of 500 kPa. For the split-injection cases, two injections per cycle with a 50/50 split were used. Although the injected fuel quantity was fixed, the power output varied for the split-injection cases. So as to achieve an even split of fuel between the two injection events in the 50/50 split-injection case, the commanded first fuel-injection pulse duration (PW1) was kept constant and the commanded second fuel-injection pulse duration (PW2) was adjusted to maintain the fuel flow rate at the desired level. Note that due to pulsations in the common-rail fuel system, it is not possible to guarantee that the fuel quantity in the first injection remained the same for all operating conditions. However, previous work on this engine has shown that the major influences of the pressure pulsations are on the quantity of fuel in the second injection; as a result, varying PW2 was considered to provide the best estimate for maintaining equal fuel masses in the two injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087412450987">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regard to fuel-injection timing for split-injection operation of the engine, SOI1 was adjusted between −30° and −51° CA after top dead centre (ATDC), while the start of injection timing for the second fuel mass (SOI2) was fixed at −15° CA ATDC (maintaining SOI2 at −15° CA ATDC kept the rate of pressure rise (<inline-formula id="inline-formula5-1468087412450987">

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412450987">Figure 4</xref> shows the smoke and NO<sub>X</sub> emissions of the single-cylinder engine running in split-injection mode (50/50 by mass) at an intake oxygen mass fraction of approximately 12% in comparison with the emissions from the engine in single-injection mode over a wide range of intake oxygen mass fractions (23–8%). The fuel-injection pressure was held constant at 90 MPa for both injection strategies, and the intake pressure was 120 kPa (absolute) in both cases. The split-injection results are shown by black crosses. Note that each of the crosses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412450987">Figure 4</xref> (and in subsequent figures) corresponds to a split-injection test at a discrete SOI1 timing.

</fig>
<p>The results for the single-injection strategy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412450987">Figure 4</xref> clearly show the transition from conventional diesel combustion to LTC and the potential benefits of operating in the LTC region. In the single-injection case, NO<sub>X</sub> emissions are decreased with increasing intake charge dilution, reaching a near-zero value at an intake oxygen mass fraction of approximately 12%. Smoke emissions, on the other hand, are increased, reaching a maximum value at an intake oxygen mass fraction of approximately 14%, which are in accordance with the well-known smoke–NO<sub>X</sub> trade-off for conventional diesel operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412450987">5</xref></sup> With a further increase in the intake charge dilution, however, smoke emissions decrease rapidly, yielding levels similar to the non-EGR case (&lt;1 FSN) for intake oxygen mass fractions of Y<sub>O2</sub>&lt;9%. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412450987">Figure 4</xref>, NO<sub>X</sub> emissions remain low; thus, LTC breaks the conventional diesel smoke–NO<sub>X</sub> trade-off and allows low smoke emission engine operation with simultaneously near-zero NO<sub>X</sub> emissions, albeit at very high EGR rates.</p>
<p>As shown by the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412450987">Figure 4</xref>, the 50/50 split-injection strategy offers the potential of LTC operation at reduced EGR levels. The results show that at 11–12% intake oxygen mass fraction, smoke emissions can be reduced significantly compared to the single-injection strategy (&lt;2 FSN compared with ~4 FSN), while near-zero NO<sub>X</sub> emissions are retained. It is to be expected, however, that injection timings, relative time between the two injection events (SOI2 − SOI1), premixing time (SOC − SOI1), flame temperature and oxygen concentration would affect the observed reduction in smoke emissions in the split-injection mode. The influences of these parameters are therefore assessed in this work.</p>
<p>With regard to injection timing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412450987">Figure 3</xref> and described previously, SOI1 was varied between −30° and −51° CA ATDC. It was found that for SOI1s earlier than −51° CA ATDC, THC emissions and GISFC increased significantly, most likely due to poor fuel evaporation in the early stages of injection (assuming a constant specific heat ratio, γ = 1.33 and an initial temperature at the beginning of the compression stroke of 67 °C, the average in-cylinder gas temperature at −60° CA ATDC during the compression stroke was estimated to be ~380 °C, which is below the final boiling point of a conventional diesel blend). It was also found that retarding SOI2 beyond −15° CA ATDC at Y<sub>O2</sub>~12%, resulted in high smoke emissions, a result that may be explained by considering the energy release plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figure 5</xref> at two SOI2 (−12° CA and −15° CA ATDC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">5(b)</xref>, respectively). Note that the energy release plot at Y<sub>O2</sub>~11% with SOI at −15° CA ATDC with a single main injection per cycle is also plotted for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figure 5(c)</xref>) and that the injector drive current signals (average of 200 consecutive cycles) indicating the start and the end of injection events are also shown in the figures. Injector needle lift timings closely followed the injector drive current timings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087412450987">22</xref></sup><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">5(b)</xref> show cool-flame reactions characteristic of LTC, starting approximately 17° CA after SOI1. These reactions cause the energy release rate to rise briefly (at approximately −23° CA ATDC) to a low peak (at approximately −19° CA ATDC) and then decline to a near-zero level as the cool-flame combustion reaches the region of negative temperature coefficient (NTC). The cool-flame reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">5(b)</xref> are then closely followed by the main high-temperature combustion energy release. As would be expected, no cool-flame reactions were observed for the second part of the injected fuel and the high-temperature reactions for all the injected fuel took place together. Unlike the split-injection cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">5(b)</xref>, no distinct cool-flame reaction was seen at this intake oxygen mass fraction (Y<sub>O2</sub> =11%) with single main injection per cycle at SOI −15° CA ATDC.</p>

<p>The key difference in the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">5(b)</xref> is the timing of the second injection event with respect to the cool-flame reactions. It is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figure 5(a)</xref> that the second injection event occurs after the cool-flame reaction period. Indeed, part of the fuel from the second injection (SOI2 at −12° CA ATDC) is injected into the main high-temperature combustion reaction. In this case, it is to be expected that soot formation would increase because of the localized high in-cylinder temperature and the reduced ignition delay of the fuel injected during the second injection event; this is demonstrated by smoke levels approaching 3 FSN. Other cases at this intake oxygen mass fraction with more retarded injection timings than −12° CA ATDC (not shown here) showed similar effects. On the other hand, with SOI2 at −15° CA ATDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412450987">Figure 5(b)</xref>), the second injection is timed such that fuel is injected into the NTC cool-flame reactions from the first injected fuel mass. In this case, smoke emissions were 75% lower than the earlier case. This result is consistent with the results reported by Lee and Lida<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087412450987">23</xref></sup> indicating that when diesel fuel was injected either prior to or during the low-temperature reactions, soot formation was more restrained than at any other reaction stage for a homogeneous propane–air mixture, despite having nearly the same ignition delay. It was assumed that the intermediate products, i.e. hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O) formed during the low-temperature oxidation reactions had a reducing effect on soot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087412450987">23</xref></sup> The results from the current work support the view that fuel injection before or during a cool-flame reaction is a technique that can be used to suppress soot formation from a subsequent injection event; however, our results do not elucidate this mechanism and further detailed investigation in this area is required. Similar phenomena were observed with all of the energy release plots with SOI1 variable between −30° and −51° CA ATDC for a fixed SOI2 at −15° CA ATDC.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating that the timing of the second injection event with respect to the cool-flame reactions of the first injected fuel mass can significantly influence soot emissions in diesel LTC with a split-injection strategy, the authors’ results also suggest that soot emissions are significantly influenced by the premixing time available to the first injected mass. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412450987">Figure 6(a)</xref>, smoke emissions were lower at higher EGR rates with the single main injection; this is attributed to the increased premixing time available to the fuel and is one of the key reasons for the reduction in smoke emissions in high-EGR LTC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412450987">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412450987"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412450987"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412450987">8</xref></sup> Similar behaviour is seen in the split main-injection results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412450987">Figure 6(a)</xref>; with SOI1 advanced earlier than −36° CA ATDC, the premixing time was longer than 25° CA, resulting in low smoke emissions (&lt;1 FSN) due to the increased degree of premixing prior to the SOC.</p>

<p>The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412450987">Figure 6</xref> suggests that a split main-injection strategy, with appropriate injection timings, can reduce smoke emissions substantially at a given intake oxygen mass fraction without increasing the NO<sub>X</sub> emissions compared to the single-injection strategy. The increased premixing time in the split-injection strategy had no discernible effects on NO<sub>X</sub> emissions at ~12% Y<sub>O2</sub>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412450987">Figure 6(b)</xref>. Most significantly, NO<sub>X</sub> emissions remained at a very low level. Therefore, considering the corresponding reduction in soot and NO<sub>X</sub> emissions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412450987">Figure 4</xref>, the overall effect of the split main-injection strategy might be regarded as that of enabling LTC at a higher intake oxygen mass fraction (i.e. at reduced EGR levels) than was possible with the single-injection strategy.</p>
<p>Implementing a split main-injection strategy at intake oxygen mass fractions between 11% and 12% increased THC emissions compared with the single-injection strategy at the same intake oxygen mass fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412450987">Figure 7(a)</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that, compared to the case of 8% intake oxygen mass fraction with single injection, where Y<sub>O2</sub>~8% is the intake oxygen mass fraction required to give acceptable NO<sub>X</sub> and smoke emissions in single-injection mode, the split main-injection strategy yields a greater than 50% reduction in THC emissions. The results show that THCs and CO emissions in the split-injection test vary significantly with the timing of SOI1 at Y<sub>O2</sub>~11–12% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412450987">Figure 8</xref>). It was generally observed that CO emissions decreased with advanced SOI1s. In most cases, reduced CO emissions coincided with increased THC emissions, suggesting reduced levels of fuel oxidation. However at SOI1 of −45° and −48° CA ATDC, both the THCs and CO emissions were simultaneously reduced (compared with their neighbouring test points), suggesting more complete oxidation of the fuel. This behaviour is, at present unexplained; the sources of THCs and CO in the Loughborough LTC engine are the subject of an on-going study.</p>

<p>As regards the significant reduction in THC emissions between the ~8% Y<sub>O2</sub> single-injection case and the 11–12% Y<sub>O2</sub> split main-injection cases observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412450987">Figure 7(a)</xref>, this is thought to be due to a reduction in rich mixture zones within the cylinder and a delay in the onset of bulk quenching of the end gases. Bulk quenching is characterized by incomplete fuel oxidation; in this case, caused by the low local gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations typical of high-EGR application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412450987">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087412450987">24</xref></sup> The delayed onset of bulk quenching in the present work is indicated by the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412450987">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412450987">10</xref>. Longer combustion durations are seen with the split main-injection strategy compared to those found with a single-injection event at the same intake oxygen mass fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412450987">Figure 9(a)</xref>). Longer combustion durations are also indicated at higher intake oxygen mass fractions. This split-injection strategy also results in an earlier combustion phasing, as demonstrated by the advanced CA50, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412450987">Figure 10</xref>. The net effects of the advanced combustion phasing and the longer combustion durations suggest that more of the fuel will be burned before bulk quenching occurs compared to the case of the 8% intake oxygen mass fraction with single injection. In turn, this is expected to result in lower THC emissions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412450987">Figure 9(b)</xref> shows that the combustion durations with different SOI1s at an intake oxygen mass fraction of 12% are essentially independent of the timing of SOI1.</p>

<p>Returning to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412450987">Figure 8</xref>, the results show THCs and CO emissions in split injections vary significantly with the timing of SOI1; advancing SOI1 tends to increase THCs and reduce CO. It is hypothesized that either over-mixing (leading to an over-lean mixture) or spray impingement on the combustion chamber walls might contribute to the higher THC emissions with advanced SOI1 with the split-injection strategy compared to the single-injection strategy at the corresponding intake oxygen mass fraction. Note that the mechanism by which these emissions are changed at constant Y<sub>O2</sub> in the engine has not been established during the present work. Future publications will consider this issue in more detail.</p>
<p>CO emissions are seen to be reduced significantly by the split main-injection strategy at Y<sub>O2</sub>~12% compared to the single-injection case at the same intake oxygen mass fraction (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412450987">Figure 7(b)</xref>). It is thought that this is primarily due to better premixing of the fuel–air charge before the SOC, thereby minimizing rich pockets of fuel–oxygen charge in the combustion chamber. Again, the advanced combustion phasing (CA50, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412450987">Figure 10</xref>) might increase the in-cylinder temperature, facilitating CO oxidation. The minimized or delayed onset of bulk quenching (indicated by the longer combustion duration compared to single injection) would also contribute to the reduction in CO emissions. With longer combustion duration, the fuel and partially oxidized fuel molecules would have greater probability of being oxidized, thus lowering the CO emissions. However, it should be recognized that the engine-out CO emissions are still higher than the current legislated limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412450987">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the fuelling quantity was maintained constant in the present work. As a result, the power generated, as indicated by the GIMEP, varies between 500 and 550 kPa, depending on the timing of SOI1 and Y<sub>O2</sub> with split injections. It should be noted that the COV of GIMEP was &lt;2% for all the split-injection cases investigated and reported here, and no misfiring cycles were observed. At constant fuelling quantity, GISFC is a good indicator of fuel conversion efficiency, since it is normalized with GIMEP and fuel flow rate. The data on GISFC with split main- and single-injection strategies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412450987">Figure 11</xref>. It can be seen from the figure that GISFC at Y<sub>O2</sub>~12% with split injections was typically increased compared to single-injection operation at the same intake oxygen mass fraction. The increased GISFC (depending on SOI1) at Y<sub>O2</sub>~12% may be attributed partly to the advanced combustion phasing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412450987">Figure 10</xref>), which is likely to increase heat-transfer losses and partly to lower combustion efficiency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087412450987">Figure 12</xref>), as indicated by the increased THC emissions. Nonetheless, it is again significant that the GISFC for all the split-injection cases at Y<sub>O2</sub>~12% is substantially lower than the GISFC at Y<sub>O2</sub>~8% with a single main injection.</p>

<p>Finally, a comparison has been made to illustrate the effects of a 50/50 split main injection with a single injection at the same intake oxygen mass fraction (Y<sub>O2</sub>~11%) and with LTC at a much lower intake oxygen mass fraction (Y<sub>O2</sub>~8%). For this comparison, the ‘best split injection’ SOI1 (−45° CA ATDC) has been selected, which corresponds to smoke emissions &lt;1 FSN with low THCs and CO emissions. Smoke, NO<sub>X</sub>, THC and CO emissions have been plotted, along with GIMEP and GISFC, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412450987">Figure 13</xref>. This graph shows the potential of the split-injection strategy in terms of reducing smoke and CO emissions, although NO<sub>X</sub> and THC emissions and GISFC increased marginally compared to single injection at the same intake oxygen mass fraction. However, as has been previously discussed, THC emissions and GISFC reduced significantly compared to single injection at 8% intake oxygen mass fraction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412450987">Figure 13</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This work has investigated the effects of a split (50/50) main-injection strategy under low-temperature diesel combustion conditions with high EGR levels at a fixed intake pressure, with the aim of achieving low-emission combustion with practical levels of EGR.</p>
<list id="list1-1468087412450987" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>With an optimized relative time between the two injection events of the split main injection, smoke emissions can be reduced to &lt;1 FSN at 12% intake oxygen mass fraction, similar to the levels with 8% intake oxygen mass fraction with single main injection, with little effect on NO<sub>X</sub> emissions, which remain well below legislated limits. The split main-injection strategy therefore effectively achieves one of the key benefits of LTC at reasonable thermal efficiency and achievable EGR levels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Smoke emissions were reduced significantly when the fuel from the second injection was injected into the cool-flame reactions of the fuel injected during the first injection, despite there being a lower ignition delay for the second injected fuel mass.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>THC emissions and GISFC with a split main injection were higher than for a single injection at 12% intake oxygen mass fraction. However, THC emissions and GISFC were reduced significantly with a split injection at 12% intake oxygen mass fraction compared to a single main injection at 8% intake oxygen mass fraction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CO emissions with a split injection at 12% intake oxygen mass fraction reduced significantly compared to 12% intake oxygen mass fractions with a single main injection. This was attributed primarily to the increased premixing time, which minimized the rich fuel–oxygen zones in the combustion chamber and to the increased in-cylinder temperature, thus facilitating CO oxidation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We conclude that the split main-injection strategy reduced the EGR requirements to achieve near-zero smoke and NO<sub>X</sub> emissions. We observe that this approach should then enable transitions through the minimum soot and NO<sub>X</sub> formation regions during transitions between LTC and conventional diesel operation. Further, the reduced EGR requirements and improved efficiency with low-emission combustion will also extend the load boundary for high-EGR combustion at a given engine intake pressure.</p>
