<abstract>
<p>Emergency department (ED) staff confront death more frequently than any other specialty except oncology. These deaths are often traumatic, sudden, unexpected and occur in a younger age group. As a consequence, bereaved survivors have a greater risk of an abnormal grief reaction. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1460408611420352">Walters DT, Tupin JP (1991)</xref> Family grief in the emergency department. <italic>Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America</italic> 9(1): 189–206.] Whilst the severity or timing of traumatic injuries may preclude medical attempts to influence patient survival, the approach of the same resuscitation team to the bereaved before death, during resuscitation and after death may have profound influences on subsequent grief in the bereaved. Despite this, it can be argued that Emergency Medicine within the UK has given little thought and time for reflection upon how we treat the bereaved. That the care of the dying and the bereaved within the ED matters is greatly reinforced by the Scottish Government’s 2010 Consultation document on bereavement that states: ‘There is … evidence that the way [the] bereaved experience events around the time of death will influence their grief. Where health services get it right … bereaved people are supported to accept the death … Conversely if the health services get it wrong, then bereaved people may experience additional distress, and that distress will interfere with their successful transition through the grieving process’.</p>

<p>It is also impossible to determine the numbers of bereaved for each traumatic death that occurs – some estimates suggest that there are at least four people for each death that could and should be considered as being ‘bereaved’. Traditionally, bereavement research has focussed upon the spouses or the parents of the deceased with little focus on the slightly less immediate family, friends and community who are all affected in some way by a particular traumatic death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611420352"><title>History</title>
<p>The psychology of bereavement has evolved over the past 100 years subsequent to the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408611420352">Freud’s (1917)</xref> <italic>Mourning and Melancholia</italic>. Astudy of bereaved survivors from a night club fire in 1944 was one of the first to examine the psychology of (traumatic) bereavement, establishing grief as a distinct syndrome recognised by particular symptoms and time course, amenable to both positive and negative influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1460408611420352">Lindemann, 1944</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1460408611420352">Ross (1969)</xref> built on this initial work by studying the psychology of dying people, which led directly on to the pioneering work of Dame Cicely Saunders and the establishment of the modern hospice movement. The subsequent recognition that sudden traumatic death was a risk factor for prolonged, complicated grief developed through the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1460408611420352">Parkes (1996)</xref> in the 1970s, leading to attempts by others to specifically define risk factors that allow the prediction of those at risk for abnormal grief reactions. Although a number of ‘models’ exist to explain bereavement and grief, it is now commonly accepted that there is no ‘right’ way of grieving and that each bereaved individual will express their grief in their own individual way within certain cultural constraints.</p>
<p>Parallel to the evolution of bereavement theory has been the development of the modern ED andthe specialty of Emergency Medicine within the UK, with the setting up of the Casualty Surgeons Association in 1967 and the appointment of the first Consultants in Accident and Emergency in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>The evolution of bereavement theory and the evolution of EDs started to come together in the late 1970s with the publication in America of a small number of articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1460408611420352">Willis, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1460408611420352">Soreff, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408611420352">Dubin and Sarnoff, 1986</xref>) concerning general recommendations for bereavement care in EDs. The publication of the experiences of a chaplain dedicated to the care of the bereaved in the Accident and Emergency Department at St. James University Hospital, Leeds in 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1460408611420352">Lapwood, 1982</xref>) led to other UK Departments recognising the importance of bereavement care within the ED and publishing their experience and recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1460408611420352">Yates et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408611420352">Cooke et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of the early articles on bereavement care in the ED were general in nature, frequently written by psychiatrists – it is difficult to tease out on what grounds their recommendations were based but it seems it was through a combination of their personal experiences combined with bereavement theory and common sense. There was a gradual shift to a more evidence-based approach to ED bereavement care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1460408611420352">Schultz, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408611420352">Jones and Buttery, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408611420352">Fanslow, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408611420352">Parrish et al., 1987</xref>) but it is important to note that due to the very nature of bereavement due to traumatic death, there is little robust evidence to guide management. Evidence comes predominantly from retrospective surveys, qualitative research and opinions, focussing particularly on the perceived needs and experiences of the bereaved in various acute settings.</p>
<p>Nationally, recognition for bereavement care, not specific to EDs, significantly developed within the UK as a consequence of recommendations produced by the Department of Health (DoH), following on from the enquiries into the health crises at the Bristol Royal Infirmary andthe Royal Liverpool Children’s Hospital in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408611420352">Department of Health, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611420352">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611420352">2002</xref>). Subsequently, the DoH carried out national surveys in 2001, 2005 and 2008 (the latter in conjunction with the bereavement charity, CRUSE) to determine the provision of bereavement services by acute Trusts. These surveys demonstrated a significant improvement over time in the consistent provision of bereavement services by hospitals but identified the need for further links to be developed between hospitals and the community.</p>
<p>The DoH have also recently commissioned and published a review of bereavement literature to inform further work for their National End of Life Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611420352">Department of Health, 2011</xref>) and in parallel to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1460408611420352">NHS Scotland published in October 2010</xref>, a consultation document entitled ‘Shaping Bereavement Care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1460408611420352">NHS Scotland, 2010</xref>). Both contain little specific focus andadvice for EDs.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important message for EDs within the UK is contained within the Scottish consultation document:
<disp-quote>
<p>little evidence exists to suggest that care of those who have been bereaved [has] developed to any great extent within healthcare, other than in the specific areas of specialist palliative care</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is supported by the current absence ofrecommendations from the College of Emergency Medicine and prominent Trauma organisations within the UK, and the failure to build on the 1995 report from the British Association for Accident and Emergency and the Royal College of Nursing entitled ‘Bereavement Care in A&amp;E Departments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611420352">British Association of Accident and Emergency Medicine, 1995</xref>).</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>Bereavement – the recent loss of a significant person through death</p>
<p>Grief – a mainly emotional reaction to bereavement incorporating diverse psychological and physical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408611420352">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Bereavement and grief are almost universal experiences, experiences that a large majority will eventually have to confront and endure. Grief is now recognised to consist of a range of emotions including feelings of numbness, pining, anxiety and despair combined with physical symptoms such as loss of appetite and inability to sleep. The intensity of such reactions varies over days, weeks, months and years and whilst there is no strict defined timescale to grieve, most authorities suggest normality starts to return within 6 months of the bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1460408611420352">Parkes, 1998a</xref>).</p>
<p>Grieving may be ‘modified’ by a number of pre-existing ‘risk ‘factors that include:
<list id="list1-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the nature of the relationship with the deceased;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the stage in life of both the bereaved and the deceased;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the presence or absence of societal support;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the culture within which the bereavement occurs; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the religious or secular background of the bereaved.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In addition, the circumstances surrounding the death of a loved one that impact adversely on grief include:
<list id="list2-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>traumatic sudden (possibly multiple) deaths;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a lack of ‘anticipatory’ grief, that period of adjustment and preparation for an expected death of a loved one;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>suicide;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>homicide.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Such ‘stressors’ may lead to both increased physical and psychiatric illnesses as well as a prolonged abnormal grief reaction known as complicated grief (see below). That bereavement leads to an increase in physical and mental illness has been demonstrated many times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1460408611420352">Parkes, 1964</xref>) a finding most recently confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611420352">Boyle et al. (2011)</xref>. The impact of bereavement on physical and psychological health has been reviewed in depth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408611420352">Stroebe et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Many studies, predominantly on spousal bereavement, have established that the bereaved die more frequently in the months following their bereavement, although the absolute increase in deaths is small, with one study finding 5% of widowers aged 55 or greater dying in the first 6 months following a bereavement compared to 3% of married men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408611420352">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>). Significant causes of death include accidental deaths, suicide, alcohol-related diseases and ischaemic heart disease. Bereavement also impacts negatively on physical morbidity with increased rates of disability, hospitalisation andmedication use. The underlying physiological mechanisms that increase mortality in the bereaved are unknown but it is interesting to note recent studies that demonstrate a significant sustained increase in heart rate of 5 beats per minute for up to 6 months following a bereavement as well as significant increases in heart rate variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611420352">Buckley et al., 2010</xref>). Some authors even claim that Takotsubu syndrome or apical ballooning syndrome may be triggered by intense emotional stress including bereavement, and has therefore been referred to as broken heart syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1460408611420352">Kapoor and Bybee, 2009</xref>). These studies build upon previously documented changes in the immune systems of the bereaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611420352">Bartrop et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1460408611420352">Schleiffer et al., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Bereavement may also cause the development of mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408611420352">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>). It can be difficult to distinguish early in bereavement normal and abnormal psychological responses, with the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM; 2000) 4th Edition excluding people bereaved for less than 2 months from being diagnosed with major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611420352">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Most psychological symptoms are more intense in the first few months following bereavement but for a small number of bereaved, symptoms persist and develop as a generalised anxiety disorder, or depression, with some studies suggesting a 10–20% incidence of clinical levels of depression subsequent to bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1460408611420352">Parkes, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408611420352">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>More specifically, traumatic deaths increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408611420352">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>) in those who have experienced the trauma that caused the death of a loved on or if the nature of the death was particularly horrific such as murder. PTSD is defined as a severe anxiety disorder consequent to any event that causes psychological trauma. It is characterised by flashbacks or nightmares and increased arousal manifest as difficulty falling asleep, anger and hypervigilance. Symptoms must persist more than 1 month and interfere with social functioning. The incidence of PTSD subsequent to traumatic death is unknown but appears to vary dependent upon the situation – one study of parents bereaved through the violent death of a child showed symptoms consistent with PTSD in over 25% of mothers up to 5 years after the death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1460408611420352">Stroebe et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Complicated grief is an evolving concept thought to be distinct from other psychiatric illness such as depression, anxiety and PTSD and is to be included in the 5th edition of the DSM to be published in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1460408611420352">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec4-1460408611420352"><title>Features of complicated grief</title>
<p>Persistent and disruptive yearning, pining and longing for the deceased with the presence of at least four out of eight of the following:
<list id="list3-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>trouble accepting the death;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>inability to trust others since the death;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>excessive bitterness;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>uneasiness about moving on with life;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>detachment from those who the bereaved were previously close to;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the feeling that life is now meaningless;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the future holds no prospect for fulfilment; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>agitation since the death.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It has to be emphasised that the vast majority (&gt;80–90%) of the bereaved grieve ‘normally’ with only a small minority (10–20%) developing persisting mental health complications.
<disp-quote>
<p>There is no evidence that all bereaved people will benefit from counselling and research has shown no benefit to arise from the routine referral of people to counselling for no other reason than that they have suffered a bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1460408611420352">Parkes, 1998a</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If bereavement, in particular, bereavement through sudden traumatic death, increase the incidence of mental health problems, can specific psychological interventions positively affect outcomes?</p>
<p>Psychological interventions for the bereaved may be split as follows:
<list id="list4-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>primary: psychological support is available to all bereaved persons;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>secondary: psychological support is available to the bereaved identified by the presence of specific risk factors; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>tertiary: psychological support is available for those who have developed complicated grief, depression or PTSD.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that primary intervention is ineffective, that secondary intervention is of extremely limited benefit with probably no significant sustained effects but that tertiary interventions are effective in alleviating psychological symptoms due to bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1460408611420352">Parkes, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408611420352">Forte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1460408611420352">Schut and Stroebe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611420352">Currier et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondary intervention relies upon the active identification of those at risk using screening tests made up of specific risk factors (see above) for abnormal grief reactions. This certainly does not take place within any UK ED – it is also doubtful whether undertaking such screening within the ED is appropriate but might be appropriate at a later stage within the community.</p>
<p>Similarly, whilst it would be reasonable to screen for those at risk of physical complications, e.g. screening for risk factors for ischaemic heart disease or excess alcohol consumption, it would seem more appropriate that such efforts are performed in the days or first weeks following bereavement rather than in the ED immediately following a death.</p>
<p>For tertiary intervention, it is also important to note that those with complicated grief can be less likely to seek help from medical services than those with other bereavement complications such as depression.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1460408611420352"><title>General recommendations for care of the bereaved within the ED</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Many ED staff are unaware of the tremendous impact they have on the bereaved and the unique position they are in to influence for better or worse the survivors grief reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1460408611420352">Walters and Tupin, 1991</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
<p>It has repeatedly been emphasised that sudden traumatic death increases the likelihood of an abnormal grief reaction. It is ironic therefore that the initial care of such a vulnerable group has to take place within an environment so ill-suited to the task of sensitively breaking the news of death and the provision of emotional and practical support in the immediate hours following a death. Little contemporary information is available to measure the provision of such care by UK EDs but the suspicion is that we give too little time to such an important task and that there are few examples of EDs providing consistent high levels of bereavement care. Complaints about bereavement care are not infrequent – a study of bereaved people who contacted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1460408611420352">Road Peace (2011)</xref>, a charity for those affected by road traffic accidents, found that only 61% rated the quality of bereavement support from EDs as good or excellent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1460408611420352">Tehrani, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>General recommendations for bereavement care within EDs date from the first articles addressing this subject in the late 1970s and early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1460408611420352">Soreff, 1979</xref>) and differ little from more recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1460408611420352">Kent and McDowell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408611420352">Frost et al., 2010a</xref>) and the current ‘standards’ as found within the 2005 DoH article entitled ‘When a Patient Dies: Advice on Developing Bereavement Care in the NHS’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611420352">Department of Health, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This states a number of principles that underpin bereavement care and include:
<list id="list5-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>clear communication;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>accurate information and knowledge appropriate to the cultural and religious needs of the bereaved;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a suitable undisturbed private environment away from the ED;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>training of staff in all aspects of bereavement care;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>support of staff; </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>review and audit of bereavement services.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Bereavement policies specific to the ED should be in place and supported by a wider Trust policy and this should address the following:
<list id="list6-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>provision of information over the telephone to relatives and friends about the dead or dying patient;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>nomination of a specific member of staff to receive relatives and friends and support them throughout their time in the ED and to co-ordinate the provision of information about and access to resuscitative efforts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>access to the body of the deceased (within the requirements of the law) both within the ED and in the mortuary in the hours following death for those relatives and friends who arrive later;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>organ and tissue donation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>practical information for the bereaved concerning post-mortems, the role of the Coroner and the registering of deaths; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>follow-up in the days and weeks following a death.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Although practically difficult, departments should also give some thought to the support of staff in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic resuscitation. The resuscitation team will likely have been made up of members of varying seniority and experience and immediately returning to the more mundane challenges of ED work inhibits reflection. Debrief of the resuscitation team in the days following such an event should be considered good practice to identify the needs of individual team members (that will include staff outside the immediate ED) and to allow reflection and learning. It is recognised that dealing with the bereaved is a difficult aspect of ED care.

<p>If the breaking of bad news is done badly, patients and their families may never forgive us; by contrast, if we get it right they will never forget us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408611420352">Iserson, 2000</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Although physicians frequently need to communicate bad news to relatives in the ED, there has been a consistent finding that specific training in how we communicate has been lacking or inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408611420352">Fallowfield and Jenkins, 2004</xref>). This deficit has only recently started to be addressed with the introduction of communication skills into medical curricula and the springing up of a large number of workshops and courses.</p>
<p>How we communicate impacts greatly upon the memories of the bereaved although studies on the breaking of bad news mainly involve asking relatives what their recollections of their experiences are or whether they feel positive/negative about how the breaking of bad news was done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408611420352">Jurkovich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1460408611420352">Ptacek and Ptacek, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1460408611420352">Lloyd-Williams et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408611420352">Gilbey, 2010</xref>). Most of the studies are fairly small, and not directly involving ED, but common themes tend to emerge that illustrate the importance of good communication.</p>
<p>The common themes that emerge are:
<list id="list7-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Content/knowledge – the notification of death should be by the use of simple, non-technical language without euphemisms, although clarity can be mis-interpreted as bluntness. Although some suggest briefly reviewing what the bereaved know before death notification, frequently such preludes are impossible due to their immediate requests of whether their loved one is alive or dead. Knowledge or information about the death is constantly identified as a need of the bereaved but frequently this is needed in the days and weeks following bereavement – the initial acute stages of grief frequently preclude the giving of such information. Who imparts the bad news appears less important than how – some suggest nursing staff, chaplaincy staff or social workers as alternatives to medical staff.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attitude – whilst age and cultural difficulties as well as the very nature of the sudden traumatic death may make it impossible to adequately empathise with the bereaved, appropriate behaviour and communication skills may be learnt. Medical staff need to rapidly switch from focussing upon the technical aspects of the ‘failed’ resuscitation and the recent needs of the dying to the very different psychological needs of the bereaved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Privacy – there is an absolute need for the breaking of bad news to be within a quiet, undisturbed environment away from the immediacy of the Resuscitation Department and whilst relatives rooms exist within the vast majority of departments, reports frequently cite their cramped, austere nature with inadequate facilities.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Whilst certain aspects of communication should be self-evident, e.g. the switching off of phones and pagers, the removal of blood stained clothing… others are less obvious, e.g. having the relatives room a significant distance away from the resuscitation room may necessitate an interminably long walk through busy parts of the Department.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1460408611420352"><title>Background</title>
<p>In 1982, staff within the ED of the Foote Hospital in Michigan established one of the first programmes for the planned participation of family members during the resuscitation of a loved one (Family Witnessed Resuscitation, FWR). The programme was set up in response to two resuscitations (one traumatic) during which family members refused to leave the resuscitation room. Shortly after the commencement of the programme, a survey by the Foote Hospital ED team of 18 relatives bereaved <italic>before</italic> the programme was commenced, indicating that nearly three quarters of them wished they had been present during the resuscitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408611420352">Doyle et al., 1985</xref>). A subsequent article in 1992 discussed the experiences of patients and staff during the first 9 years of their programme of supported FWR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408611420352">Hanson and Strawser, 1992</xref>). A survey of 47 family members demonstrated that three quarters of the bereaved felt that witnessed resuscitation had positively helped them to adjust to their bereavement and that almost two-thirds of the bereaved felt that their presence had been beneficial to the dying patient.</p>
<p>An article in the <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> from 1994 then reported the experience of a sister who witnessed the unsuccessful pre-hospital resuscitation of her brother who died from injuries sustained from falling from a horse. The article also reported the responses of a range of doctors, some of whom had been directly involved with the pre-hospital resuscitation of the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611420352">Adams et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Both these early articles published over 16 years ago, were supportive of FWR, including traumatic resuscitation, yet whilst the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1460408611420352">UK Resuscitation Council (2011)</xref> support witnessed medical resuscitation, there is surprisingly little or no documented support from the British organisations responsible for trauma.</p>
<p>It is unclear why FWR has become established for non-traumatic resuscitation but not for traumatic resuscitation. Whilst traumatic resuscitation has the potential to be more invasive, bloody and stressful, the principles and potential benefits of FWR should apply equally whether resuscitation is required for traumatic or non-traumatic reasons.</p>

</list></p>
<p>(The perceived disadvantages, in particular, breach of confidentiality and impairment of performance are used by those who argue that FWR is unethical.)</p>
<p>A major block to FWR may be the resuscitation team itself, in particular, the medical staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1460408611420352">Kirchhoff et al., 2007</xref>). A survey of 81 staff members of a UK ED demonstrated that 60% of staff thought FWR should be discouraged – this belief correlated inversely with medical seniority (60% of Consultants favoured FWR whereas less than 10% of junior staff favoured FWR) and background (more than 90% nursing staff were supportive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408611420352">Mitchell and Lynch, 1997</xref>). A similar theme was found in a survey of 368 members ofthe American Association for the Surgery of Trauma and 1261 members of the Emergency Nurses Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1460408611420352">Helmer et al., 2000</xref>). Medical staff were significantly less likely to support the concept of FWR compared to nurses although the differences varied according to what part of the resuscitation process was being considered. Nursing staff were also stronger advocates for FWR being a right of the patient or family. More recent evidence demonstrates persisting differences in attitudes between staff and persisting concerns about the benefits to families as well as the stresses placed upon resuscitation teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1460408611420352">Mortelmans et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies also highlight that whilst the concept of FWR has developed in certain emergency systems, countries in which Emergency Medicine is still a new specialty still face specific cultural challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1460408611420352">Howlett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1460408611420352">Kianmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1460408611420352">Wacht et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Resistance to FWR from medical staff is in contrast to that of relatives and the patients themselves, all of whom are broadly supportive of the concept of FWR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611420352">Boie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408611420352">Eichhorn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611420352">Boudreaux, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611420352">Berger et al., 2004</xref>). Evidence certainly demonstrates a constant but variable desire on the part of relatives and patients for FWR to be offered with decisions over FWR to be made by relatives and NOT by medical staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1460408611420352">Mazur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611420352">Albarran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1460408611420352">McMahon-Parkes et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There has only been one randomised quantitative study involving small numbers of bereaved families that directly address the impact of FWR on subsequent grief. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1460408611420352">Robinson et al. (1998)</xref> studied the psychological effects on eight bereaved relatives who had witnessed the resuscitation of a relative. Resuscitation included intubation, tube thoracocentesis and pericardiocentesis. Psychological assessment was by a range of tests – <italic>no</italic> detrimental effects of witnessed resuscitation were demonstrated by this small study with there being a non-significant trend towards a reduction in grief 9 months after the bereavement. The conclusions of this randomised study were that routine exclusion of relatives was no longer appropriate and that relatives should beoffered the choice of remaining in the Resuscitation room.</p>
<p>More recently two papers have studied family members who, whilst not bereaved, had recently witnessed the resuscitation of a traumatically injured relative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1460408611420352">Pasquale et al. (2010)</xref> studied 25 families who had witnessed the resuscitation of a close relative who had been injured, predominantly through blunt trauma and subsequently admitted to a Critical Care Facility. These families again completed a range of psychological tests (but only within 48 h of admission) and were compared to 25 controls. Similar to Robinson et al., no detrimental effects of witnessed resuscitation were found. Importantly, whilst not a primary aim of the study, there were no detrimental effects upon the resuscitation process as measured by time to computed tomography scan. This study was non-randomised and whilst all patients were severely injured (mean ISS 18.5), none died or sustained a cardio-respiratory arrest and the nature of any invasive procedures was not described.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1460408611420352">Leske et al. (2010)</xref> also studied the impact of witnessed pre-hospital resuscitation on family dynamics in the days <italic>immediately following</italic> admission to a critical care unit. They found that there was no worsening of family dynamics when compared non-randomly to a control group. Whilst there was a mixture of patients who had received either penetrating or blunt injuries, none died or sustained a cardio-respiratory arrest – again no information was available about the nature of the invasive procedures.</p>
<p>The paper by Leske serves as a reminder that, when debating FWR within the ED, relatives or next of kin may frequently have witnessed orbeen similarly injured in the traumatic pre-hospital episode and witnessed or participated in the initial giving of first aid by members of the public and subsequent resuscitative efforts of the paramedics at scene and on route to hospital. A policy of exclusion within the ED would appear to conflict with a default policy of inclusion in the pre-hospital setting. Pre-hospital resuscitation literature also highlights the lack of bereavement care when traumatic death is certified pre-hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1460408611420352">Reigel, 2002</xref>). Notification of death is likely to be by non-medical staff with little if any bereavement support immediately available although it is possible to overcome this lack of support through policies supported by hospital bereavement teams, the police and the Coroner.</p>
<p>Some authors are concerned that having family members within the resuscitation room may adversely impact on the resuscitation process. Certainly, FWR may make team members more uncomfortable but it could be argued that the needs of the resuscitation team are secondary tothose of the family. Equally whilst there is littleto support or refute the suggestion that FWR impairs performance, both attitudes and skills may and could be improved by simulation and experience. What is more certain is that there is no convincing evidence that supported FWR results in family members physically impairing resuscitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1460408611420352">Sacchetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611420352">Dudley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408611420352">Fernandez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1460408611420352">Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Little evidence exists to help decide whether viewing the dead body by the bereaved is of benefit or leads to long term harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408611420352">Jones and Buttery, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1460408611420352">Wright, 1996</xref>).

<p>The most recent and perhaps most useful study to address this question highlights the complexities surrounding this area as well as demonstrating that for the majority, viewing is perceived as being of benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611420352">Chapple and Ziebland, 2010</xref>). Perhaps the most important point to come from their study is that viewing should not be compulsory and that it is important to convey to the bereaved that viewing is a choice on their part. For those who perceived viewing as a choice, there was an increase likelihood of benefit, for those who felt ‘forced’ into viewing, regrets were more likely.</p>
<p>The study also highlighted the range of reasons for wanting and not wanting to view the body and how reactions changed over time, a finding found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408611420352">Hodgkinson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1460408611420352">Raphael, 1997</xref>):

</list></p>
<p>If the body is to be seen, attempts should be made to remove devices that have been placed during resuscitative efforts – whilst there may be conflict between the needs of the bereaved and the requirements of the police, devices that have been appropriately placed without complication, e.g. chest tubes or endotracheal tubes may be removed. In anticipation of potential conflict, documented local policies from the Coroner about removal of devices should be available.</p>
<p>Good practice also suggests that the bereaved be offered opportunities to observe or assist with the laying out of the body. (Appreciation of particular religious or cultural needs in relation to the body is important – there may be a need for specific rituals or customs performed by specific people.) – again there may be conflict between the needs of the bereaved and the needs of the police to preserve evidence by preventing the body being touched.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1460408611420352"><title>Organ and tissue donation</title>
<disp-quote>

<p>(Parents of a teenager who died following a road traffic accident)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Historically rates of organ and tissue donation within the UK have been poor. In 2008 therefore, the Organ Donation Taskforce recommended that donation should be embraced as a usual not unusual event and that donation became an integral part of the care of the dead and dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611420352">Department of Health, 2008</xref>). At this time, it was recognised that an opportunity existed to significantly increase donation rates from within EDs. In particular, it was felt that opportunities for donation from non-heart beating donors within the ED were being missed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611420352">Department of Health, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although donation is a complex and challenging area, it is also important to note that the courts have established that the best interests of the deceased are wider than simply treating a person’s medical condition and include a person’s social, cultural and religious interests. (None of the major religions object to tissue and organ donation and it may be that specific cultural values and norms are more of an obstacle to donation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408611420352">Frost et al., 2010b</xref>). Decisions about organ and tissue donation should therefore be guided by the dead person’s wishes and beliefs. These may be established either through knowledge of the individual’s wishes (e.g. registration on the NHS Organ Donor Register) or by discussion with the dead person’s family. If a person’s wishes were to be a donor, then certain actions which facilitate donation may be considered to be in their best interests if they do not cause the person harm or distress, e.g. commencement of medications after the diagnosis of brain stem death.</p>
<p>If it is then accepted that donation from within the ED should be actively pursued in the interests of the deceased and become the norm, how does this affect the bereaved? Most evidence comes from the Intensive Care environment and suggests that donation may result in some psychological benefit and have a beneficial effect on the bereavement process. Others argue that grieving itself is not lessened but that donation alters the emphasis of death, focussing more positively on the achievement of the donor. There appears to be no good evidence that donation worsens grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408611420352">Cleiren and Van Zoelen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1460408611420352">Merchant et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>What is more certain is that the bereaved attach great value to the previously expressed wishes of the deceased and that they are grateful when asked about donation, to be allowed to facilitate those wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1460408611420352">Sque and Payne, 2007</xref>). Conversely, the bereaved experience more distress when donation is NOT discussed with them. It should also be noted that as well as being at higher risk of an abnormal grief reaction, those bereaved through sudden death and who subsequently facilitate donation from the deceased may have additional ongoing specific needs in relation to the donation process and their psychological support should be ensured.</p>
<p>Medical staff have traditionally been reluctant to raise the issue of donation in fear of adding to the distress of the bereaved as well as being uncomfortable and unfamiliar with the donation process. Most hospitals now have a dedicated organ and tissue donation worker who should be able to approach and discuss with the bereaved the potential for donation but the above should reassure medical staff that they will not cause further distress to relatives and that there is an obligation for staff to discuss donation. Practically, facilitating donation in the context of traumatic death is more challenging due to the vast majority of these deaths needing referral to the Coroner and the subsequent need for a post-mortem. However, close liaison with the Coroner and forensic pathologists may allow some of these obstacles to be overcome and in particular tissue donation to proceed.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1460408611420352"><title>Follow-up for the bereaved</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>may cover a spectrum of services from informal and formal befriending approaches to care provided by health and social care practitioners … and to that provided by mental health practitioners for those who develop complicated grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1460408611420352">Stephen et al., 2006</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
<p>It appears that many follow-up services for the bereaved (distinct from formal professional psychological follow-up) have developed in a somewhat haphazard way and whilst it is thought that the provision of follow-up is a good thing, it is difficult to determine which elements of the service are good and which not so good. The majority of evidence is based again upon research from non-ED settings – the findings though are relevant as there is a constant message that the need for follow-up is the greatest for those bereaved by sudden traumatic death in a younger population. Support may be needed for a variety of reasons but it is important when discussing follow-up to distinguish between a need for factual information and a need for emotional or psychological support.</p>
<p>Provision of support following bereavement may be through:
<list id="list11-1460408611420352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>family and friends;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>those who had been bereaved through similar mechanisms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ED bereavement services; (This may be in the form of telephone calls, home visits, letters or visits by the bereaved to the ED, usually led by nursing staff.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>primary care (general practitioner (GP) and district nurses);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>social workers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>religious organisations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>voluntary organisations; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>professional counselling services.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p> (The availability of such support needs to be made explicit in information given to the bereaved by EDs.)</p>
<p>The need for bereavement follow-up has been found to be dependent upon two main factors, the availability of social support and the nature of the death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611420352">British Association of Accident and Emergency Medicine, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1460408611420352">NHS Scotland, 2010</xref>). There is evidence to suggest that traumatic sudden death is associated with a greater need for access to formal bereavement follow-up services (as defined by trained professionals or volunteers outside the bereaved’s family and friends). Normally, only a minority of the bereaved access such services The majority feel that they are able to cope – formal services may however not be accessed due to lack of realisation that services exist (hence the need for provision of information), a physical inability to access services or an under-estimation by the bereaved of their needs.</p>
<p>Two studies have assessed the needs of those bereaved by sudden death – one study included the views of 28 Swedish parents bereaved by the sudden cardiac death of a child. The other involved 74 Belgian relatives bereaved by a death predominantly in the pre-hospital setting. Both studies highlighted the continued need to gain specific factual information and explanations about the death and dissatisfaction was expressed when this opportunity was denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1460408611420352">Merlevede et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1460408611420352">Wisten and Zingmark, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408611420352">Ping et al. (2002)</xref> offer an interesting cultural perspective from Hong Kong on the nature of bereavement follow-up – in their survey of 76 bereaved people, over 70% of respondents were not aware of the existence of follow-up services – importantly however, they make the point that questionnaires were only sent at least 50 days after death due to the Chinese tradition of avoiding disturbing the bereaved within 49 days of the death of a family member.</p>
<p>Within the UK, it is unknown how many EDs offer routine follow-up by medical staff in the weeks following a bereavement. The nature of this follow-up and it’s effectiveness is also unknown. An audit from the North West of England 16 years ago (Emergency Medicine Specialty Group, 1995) found 53% of EDs claimed to follow up the bereaved but the exact nature of this seemed to vary and frequently offered no more than a telephone call to them or the provision of contact details of a specific person within the ED. Some non-ED studies suggest that palliative care offer bereavement follow-up in 74–84% of occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408611420352">Milberg et al., 2008</xref>) but the format of this varied greatly and there was a distinct lack of evaluation of any service that did exist. The relatively high prevalence of follow-up is in contrast to a 2008 survey of NHS hospitals by the bereavement charity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611420352">CRUSE (2008)</xref> demonstrating that only 38.5% of Trusts routinely follow up bereaved relatives by some combination of sending cards or letters or by telephone – importantly more than 90% of Trusts give information about bereavement services in the community. These figures could reflect a perception that routine follow-up is not necessary for the majority. It would also seem reasonable to suppose that EDs are less developed and more variable.</p>
<p>In 1999, an ED in London offered a routine telephone call to the bereaved in the first few days following a death within the ED made by a support worker who was involved in the care of the dead relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1460408611420352">Stone et al., 1999</xref>). The call tried to establish whether the bereaved were coping and if not, were put in contact with local support organisations. If the family wished to discuss further the cause of death, the suggestion was for them to contact their GP or the Coroner. A survey of 38 bereaved relatives demonstrated that 97% found the call to be helpful – this was in contrast to previous American work that suggested in one study that 67% of relatives found a call helpful and in another study, only 15% found it helpful. Similarly, in 2003, an Australian paper described the experiences of an ED in establishing a bereavement program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408611420352">LeBrocq et al., 2003</xref>). Initially, follow-up was in the form of a telephone call to the bereaved by social workers – this was found to be logistically difficult and unappreciated by families. Subsequently, follow-up was switched to letters of condolence with offers of support from the Social Work Department or Chaplaincy within 2 weeks and after 4 months of the death, periods thought to be of particular difficulty for the bereaved.</p>
<p>An ED that routinely writes to relatives offering a meeting with a Consultant to discuss factual issues concerning the death audited their service in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1460408611420352">Parris et al., 2007</xref>). They found that 14% of bereaved relatives replied to take up the offer and 27% replied declining the offer (the 14% acceptance rate is similar to the 11% acceptance rate found by the Australian study discussed above). Only 1 person out of the 1179 contacted found the letter intrusive. All those who had written but declined the offer expressed thanks for the offer of a meeting. The audit showed that there was a need for relatives to discuss post-mortem findings and have medical terms explained to them. Other questions concerned the circumstances of the death (and in particular whether the patient suffered) and the need for follow-up for relatives in cases of sudden cardiac death. This need for information is a constant theme identified by other research and one that the bereaved consider as an important aspect of bereavement care.</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>How people die remains in the memory of those who live on</p>
<p>(Dame Cecily Saunders)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Sudden traumatic death is a frequent occurrence that impacts greatly on the bereaved, placing them at risk of an abnormal, prolonged grief reaction. Despite recognition of this at risk group and despite more than 30 years passing since the publication of the first articles on ED bereavement care, significant gaps remain in our knowledge of how we should treat the bereaved and how this impacts upon their grief. What appears to be important from the evidence that does exist is that we need to allow the bereaved choice in how they interact with the dead and dying and not to inadvertently choose for them. EDs also need to overcome the barriers that exist within busy departments, to ensure that the importance of bereavement care is recognised. This will mean that time and resources need to be found for education, the establishment of a robust bereavement program and for follow-up. Until the importance of bereavement care is fully recognised, provision will continue to be haphazard with adverse consequences for the bereaved.</p>

<p>Sudden death within the ED is common yet it seems at times Emergency Medicine has devoted too little time for reflection upon how we care forthe bereaved. Often buried within the bereavement literature are personal accounts of the bereaved that profoundly convey the impact of sudden death upon relatives and friends and give a human voice to the complexities of bereavement care that is sometimes lost within more impersonal bereavement research. Reading some of these articles may stimulate us to reflect upon the importance of this aspect of ED work.</p>
