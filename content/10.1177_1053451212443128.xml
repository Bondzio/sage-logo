<p>This special issue of <italic>Intervention in School and Clinic</italic> addresses the transition planning needs of students with learning disabilities (LD) and emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). Transition planning for youth with disabilities plays a key role in students’ preparation for adult life. Unfortunately, transition planning for some students, especially those with LD and EBD, has lagged behind that of other students. This may be the result of several factors. For students with LD, there is a misperception that these disabilities are always mild in nature, and these students need little assistance as they transition from secondary school to adult life. The majority of students with LD spend much of their time in general education classes in which little attention is devoted to transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212443128">Sitlington, 2008</xref>). Students with EBD often present a more complex picture to educators, needing “multi-faceted and cohesive programming to effectively meet multiple needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212443128">Lehr &amp; McComas, 2005</xref>, p. 2), which can be challenging. As well, educators tend to focus on students’ immediate needs (e.g., staying out of trouble) often neglecting planning for the future.</p>
<p>The results of outcome studies suggest that students with LD and EBD need more focused, explicit, and individualized secondary programs to improve their postschool outcomes. These individuals frequently experience problems related to employment (i.e., low wages, underemployment, dissatisfaction, and frequent job changes), participation and success in postsecondary settings, participation in community and leisure activities, and dependency on parents and others in young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212443128">Benz, Lindstrom, &amp; Yovanoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212443128">Scanlon &amp; Mellard, 2002</xref>). For example, the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 (NLTS-2) measured employment for students with LD and EBD post–high school. Results indicate that, at the time of the interview for the study, approximately 64% of youth with LD who had left high school were employed for pay outside the home, and approximately 42% of youth with EBD were employed; this contrasts with figures for youth without disabilities, whose employment rate was 66% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212443128">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>). Although the employment rate for individuals with LD approximates that of the general youth population, NLTS-2 data reveal that youth with LD and EBD retain their jobs for a shorter period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212443128">Newman et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212443128">Newman et al. (2011)</xref> report that youth with disabilities are less likely to enroll in postsecondary education (60% vs. 67%) and live independently (45% vs. 59%). Only 11% of students with EBD had enrolled in 4-year colleges or universities after an 8-year period, as opposed to an overall 60% rate of students representing all disability categories.</p>
<p>These young adult outcomes suggest that although many youth with LD and EBD are now exiting secondary schools with the skills, supports, and linkages they need to achieve their postschool goals, a substantial number still exhibit significant difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212443128">Carter, Trainor, Sun, &amp; Owens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212443128">Osgood, Foster, Flanagan, &amp; Ruth, 2007</xref>). The purpose of this special issue is to provide information and strategies to assist youth with LD and EBD in making a successful transition to adult life. Various leaders in the field have contributed their knowledge and experience in working with secondary students with disabilities. Several themes for educating secondary youth with disabilities emerge from these articles. These themes represent key areas to consider in the design and implementation of secondary programs for students with disabilities. Throughout this issue, compelling information is included regarding the development of self-determination and social capital, the provision of individualized planning and supports through appropriate assessment and authentic experiences, the implementation of strategies for serving students with EBD, the awareness of meaningful career exploration, and the importance of maintaining high expectations for youth with disabilities, particularly in the areas of math and science.</p>
<p>Six articles compose this special issue. The first article, authored by Field and Hoffman, addresses how to assist youth in increasing their ability to establish and sustain positive relationships while at the same time developing self-determination skills. Field and Hoffman explain how teachers can help youth form and maintain positive relationships, including supporting students in increasing self-awareness while teachers act as positive role models. These critical elements are then connected to elements of self-determination instruction. Readers are challenged to create environments that simultaneously foster these positive relationships while developing the self-determination tools so needed for postschool life.</p>
<p>In the second article, Trainor, Smith, and Kim note that for youth with LD and EBD, career development often takes a backseat to more immediate concerns such as staying out of trouble and completing school. The authors argue, however, that transition planning for these youth must consider employment and education concurrently. They suggest infusing the broad elements of career development into both school-based and community-based experiences. They underscore the importance of career assessment and the development of self-determination. As well, they stress the importance of authentic experiences and personal networks and offer innovative strategies for career exploration and development, such as capitalizing on the benefits of extracurricular and work experiences and strengthening and diversifying social networks.</p>
<p>Youth with EBD have some of the least favorable outcomes of any group of individuals with disabilities. In the third article, Cheney provides a framework for developing effective programs for students with EBD. As well, he emphasizes the importance of assessment and self-determination and stresses assisting youth in understanding their strengths. He identifies personal futures planning as an important strategy for learning more about students’ interests and social support systems, which can provide critical information for the development of transition planning. Although naturally supported community placements for youth with EBD present one of the biggest challenges for youth with EBD, they are critical to students’ postschool success.</p>
<p>Transition assessment is consistently identified as a critical foundation in the development of individualized programming for youth with disabilities. The fourth article, authored by Lowenthal and Bassett, provides an innovative approach to collecting assessment data that can serve as the foundation to the individualized education program (IEP) process. This article is quite timely as educators struggle to adapt multitiered assessment at the secondary level. The authors illustrate how a multitiered system of supports can be used to create transition plans to improve student achievement. A major component of this process is a gap analysis, which focuses on determining the gap between a student’s postsecondary goals and his or her current academic knowledge. Using this information, IEP teams (with active student engagement) can determine how to adapt transition planning and instruction and/or whether a student’s postsecondary goals need to be modified.</p>
<p>In the fifth article, Mueller, Bassett, and Brewer address another key issue for many students in the transition process—behavior. They note that as a result of the problem behaviors they exhibit, many students with EBD struggle with completing school, staying out of trouble, and obtaining and maintaining employment. The authors underscore the importance of dialoguing with students about their present behavior and the impact these behaviors would have on their future goals. They provide a unique framework that develops transition-focused behavior intervention plans. The IEP team (which includes the student) assesses the student’s current behavior and determines interventions based on both the present <italic>and</italic> future goals. Throughout this process the student must practice self-determination skills, including self-awareness and self-regulation. It is this authentic means of determining both present and future behavioral goals that will assist students to see the value in appropriate behaviors and actions.</p>
<p>The final article addresses the participation of youth with disabilities in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Dunn, Rabren, Taylor, and Dotson note that although employment prospects in the STEM areas are strong, students with disabilities are underrepresented because of factors such as low expectations for youth with disabilities, lack of access to individualized supports, lack of STEM role models, and limited exposure to prerequisite courses. They suggest that students interested in STEM need individually designed learning experiences that include not only academics but also experiences outside the traditional classroom. These academic and extracurricular experiences should promote students’ (a) interest and motivation in STEM; (b) deep understanding of mathematics, science, and other content; and (c) understanding that persons with disabilities can indeed be successful in STEM careers.</p>
<p>This special issue shares with the readers information critical to students’ postschool success, providing concrete strategies that will help to develop effective, transition-focused programs for students with LD and EBD. Although the authors have addressed a range of topics from social relationships to STEM, there is a clear message across all of the articles. Educators must (a) assist students in learning more about their interests and needs and how these interests relate to future goals, (b) provide individualized planning and supports, and (c) utilize both in-school and out-of-school learning and experiences. These elements can be achieved by focusing on student participation, appropriate assessment, self-determination, authentic experiences, social supports, and high expectations. As guest editors for this special issue of <italic>ISC</italic>, we are pleased that you will take these elements to heart in your future endeavors.</p>
