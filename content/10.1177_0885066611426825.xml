<p>The practice of emergency medicine continues to evolve with patients utilizing the emergency department (ED) more frequently for both acute and chronic disease presentations. The volume of patients presenting to EDs for care in the United States has grown to over 123 million patients per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066611426825">1</xref></sup>. Patients are experiencing increased lengths of stay in the ED due to hospitals operating at maximum capacity and constraints on our health care system. In turn, this increases the extent and breadth of care provided in EDs. Additionally, as the acuity of the patients increases and access to primary care and outpatient specialists decreases, the ED is becoming the primary portal of entry for a broader spectrum of patients and their medical problems.</p>
<p>Dr Arvind Venkat has compiled a text that addresses this increased scope of practice faced by emergency physicians. <italic>Challenging and Emerging Conditions in Emergency Medicine</italic> acknowledges an educational need with patients having chronic or congenital diseases and focuses on 3 themes that highlight the challenges facing the specialty today. For many complicated patient populations, their increased longevity presents issues with novel complications and complex pathophysiology. Novel treatment modalities have created many benefits for patients previously without treatment options but have exposed the ED to complications and acute failures not formerly seen. The ED is also expected to acutely manage some patients with these new and evolving therapies, such as the resuscitated post-cardiac arrest patient. Failures of our medical system combined with complications of social pathologies and lack of medical resources have led to a growth in patients with conditions such as family violence, chronic pain, and obesity. This first edition successfully addresses a gap between the standard emergency medicine textbooks and subspecialty literature, while providing attention to critical issues in the ED and those who care for these challenging patients.</p>
<p>Dr Venkat has assembled an impressive collaboration of contributing authors, all notable experts in their own fields. <italic>Challenging and Emerging Conditions in Emergency Medicine</italic> brings together subspecialists with emergency physicians to produce an up-to-date resource that focuses on wide-ranging illnesses such as renal disease (end-stage and transplant), HIV, and sickle-cell disease. Illnesses previously confined to the pediatric population, such as congenital heart disease and cystic fibrosis are well covered. Specific patient populations such as the obese patients (including the bariatric surgery patients), the geriatric trauma patients and the intellectually disabled patients are very challenging in the clinical arena, and these topics are handled with clinical and professional excellence. Finally, critically important social issues, such as family violence and chronic pain conditions receive superb coverage as well.</p>
<p>The layout of the text divides the topics into individual chapters, each devoted to helping the reader understand the epidemiology, procedural interventions, and disease presentation and management of each disease process. The authors conclude each chapter with a proactive and insightful section entitled, “the next five years” which is intended to provide a prediction of where the fields may evolve and how they may impact future emergency medicine practice.</p>
<p>In addition to emergency physicians, this text also applies to practitioners who care for the critically ill. Although geared toward the ED, the topics selected all include patients with not only the possibility but often the preference to become critically ill. As the frequency of presentations to the ED increase, the admissions to an intensive care setting also increase. This text is comprehensive enough to serve as a general reference, yet concise to permit general reading. Trainees in emergency medicine, internal medicine and critical care will find this an excellent text and study guide, while practicing physicians will incorporate the information presented as an opportunity to update to their skill set. <italic>Challenging and Emerging Conditions in Emergency Medicine</italic> is well written, progressive, and highly relevant. Although directed toward emergency medicine, multiple specialties stand to gain from this excellent endeavor regarding challenging patient populations.</p>
