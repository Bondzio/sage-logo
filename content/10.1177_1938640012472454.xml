<p>“With any revolutionary change, however, one must always consider any proposed “advance” with appropriate caution.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps no other orthopaedic discipline has experienced an evolution in treatment similar to foot and ankle surgery within the past decade. Contributions from podiatric physicians, orthopaedists, scientists, and researchers as well as advances in medical technology have all played instrumental roles in this innovation.</p>
<p>With any revolutionary change, however, one must always consider any proposed “advance” with appropriate caution. Are practicing physicians adopting these new technologies with appropriate responsibility and motivations? Are these advances cost-effective and are resources appropriately used? Is the technological advancement outpacing our basic knowledge of the pathological entity?</p>
<p>The “Current Trends in Foot and Ankle Surgery” column will focus on surgical techniques; however, other treatments, including technological (ie, extracorporeal shock wave therapies or orthotic and prosthetics) or biological (ie, platelet rich plasma) advancements, will also be described. A detailed description of these techniques, with simplicity, will be provided to minimize the inherent learning curve for the clinician.</p>
<p>My personal goal</p>
<p>of our new column</p>
<p>will be to provide practical pearls for the treating physician in the context of addressing the difficult ethical questions posed above. An effort will be made to choose techniques for publication that will optimize the care for our patients while maintaining the ethical integrity of the foot and ankle field.</p>
