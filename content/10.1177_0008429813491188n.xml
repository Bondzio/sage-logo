<p>Mia Korpiola has edited an excellent collection concerning the local histories and broad themes of the legal aspects of marriage. This collection is a welcome addition to recent scholarship, which has focused not simply on discussions of matrimonial law in theory but also in practice. Korpiola has bridged the gap that exists in the accounts of medieval marriage between works examining Christendom as a whole and histories providing focused case studies of particular areas for the benefit of a local readership. The authors in this book consider regional scholarship and European-wide marriage theory to look at similarities and differences across the continent. The key theme that emerges from the scholarship is that canon law was never uniformly applied, and that there was always local variation in the interpretation and implementation of Rome’s legal system.</p>
<p>In their chapters concerning Europe-wide marriage law, James Brundage and Philip Reynolds provide a new look at the role of regional variety in the formation of canon law. Both argue for distinctive modes of application in areas with distinct marital customs, suggesting that because canon law had to be interpreted, there was room for diversity. This theme is carried throughout the book, including Trevor Dean’s chapter on forced and clandestine marriage in Italy, where he provides a local example of how canon law and various levels of secular law could conflict.</p>
<p>Although this volume aims to cover a broad range of regions, it is necessarily limited in its scope. The focus is predominantly on northern Europe, with three Italian chapters thrown into the mix. While a volume such as this cannot provide comprehensive coverage of Europe, it does bring research on marriage in the northern fringes of Europe to a wider audience. Chapters covering Lithuanian and Swedish marriage practices are included alongside those of England, France, and Italy, realms which have traditionally received greater coverage in the scholarship on medieval and early modern marriage customs.</p>
<p>There is an extensive range of sources used in this volume. While the book does not use interdisciplinary sources, it does offer multiple approaches to the history of canon law. Typical sources for legal history are well used here, including law codes and court proceedings. Mia Korpiola’s chapter is an in-depth look at evidence of the implementation of marriage law in Bishop Hans Brask’s court register over a period of five years. Other chapters, such as Anu Lahtinen’s examination of family correspondence, put the legal sources firmly in the context of social history.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter of this volume, Charles Donahue revisits arguments made in his book <italic>Law, Marriage, and Society</italic> concerning marriage law in five cities in England, France, and the Low Countries. He states that variation did exist partly because the types of cases people brought to court were based on local cultural values. This also resulted from the varying levels of official toleration of practices that broke canon law. He adds that legal sources are invaluable to the social historian who wants to provide a greater understanding of why marriage law was applied in a certain way, and that the assorted approaches were the result of variety in family structure across Europe.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence in this volume to support its premise that although the canon law of marriage was supposed to be based on religious principles, its implementation was a reflection of local social structures, secular law, and beliefs. The case studies and theoretical discussions in this collection explore many of the ways in which this disconnect played out on the local stage, and they provide an interesting picture of the differences in matrimonial laws in Italy and northern Europe.</p>
