<p><italic>Exploring the Spirituality of the World Religions: The Quest for Personal, Spiritual and Social Transformation</italic></p>
<p>Duncan S. Ferguson</p>
<p>New York: Continuum, 2010. 243 pp. $34.95</p>
<p>In his introduction to the 1993 edited volume, <italic>New Age Spirituality</italic>, (Westminster John Knox, 1993) Duncan S. Ferguson suggested that we live in a kairos era of longing for a new, life-giving spirituality. “God is speaking in this moment,” he wrote. “The divine language may not be the language of our traditions and assumptions, but a new language altogether. May we have the ears to hear.”</p>
<p>Ferguson expands on this theme in this new volume. He wants readers to gain respect for unfamiliar “spiritual pathways” and to adopt their life-giving characteristics, thus creating a better world (see, for instance, 41, 81–82). A former religious studies professor and director of the Center for Spiritual Life at Eckerd College in Florida, Ferguson self-identifies as “a Protestant Christian in the Presbyterian and Reformed tradition” who has chosen to remain loyal to it, which entails both retaining the best and rejecting the worst of that tradition. Ferguson has also adopted life-giving characteristics of other spiritual pathways through what he calls thoughtful and eclectic incorporation (210). Of the “many authors who describe a spiritual pathway that is thoughtfully eclectic,” Ferguson favors Eckhart Tolle, Gary Zukav, and Deepak Chopra (234 n. 3). He notes that Oprah Winfrey recommended one of Tolle’s books, but Zukav and Chopra are also on the favorites list.</p>
<p>This lineage intimates that the book will appeal to readers comfortable with a certain kind of popular spirituality, even though it often reads like an introduction to world religions. Although the author has used its contents in one of his college courses (v), the book seems more suited to eclectically inclined spiritual seekers and interfaith dialoguers interested in acquiring a modicum of academic insight into the world’s religions.</p>
<p>The book is arranged in five parts, the main three covering what the author categorizes as nature/culture religions (such as: Native American religions, ancient Greek religion, Wicca, and Shinto), transcendent monisms (Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism), and Abrahamic monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). The author is aware of the “risk of oversimplification and even distortion” in attempting to classify the world’s religions (xii) and admits that the book’s categories are “somewhat arbitrary” and overlapping (42; cf. 61, 221 n. 14). At times, this can lead to somewhat vacuous claims and typological tensions. For example, most of Hinduism’s positive characteristics apply to all religions (98), and its heritage includes personal theisms and monotheism despite being labeled a transcendent monism (92–94). The world’s religions are too complex to conform to any simple typology.</p>
<p>The book’s key term, “spiritual pathway,” seems functionally equivalent to “spirituality,” the latter defined as “the effort to fully utilize the relevant elements of our religious tradition and other religious traditions as our guidance in life, leading to our development as persons growing toward wholeness (holiness), insight, joy, and responsible living” (15; cf. 18). A spiritual pathway is described in similarly positive terms as providing “a center for our peace and stability,” “a life-giving and responsible way…[that] can lead to compassion, understanding, tolerance, and the pursuit of peace and justice—the appropriate response to our new world” (7; cf. 208). Given this constructive spin, it is surprising to hear the author contend that spiritual pathways also include life-denying characteristics and thus “can lead to hostility, intolerance, harsh and fierce orthodoxy—even militant terrorism, and a failure to engage in building a more just and humane world” (7). A key purpose of the book is to identify both sides of spiritual pathways so that readers can adopt the life-giving and avoid the life-denying characteristics. But one wonders how life-denying characteristics can be considered “spiritual” according to the book’s own conceptual framework. It would make more sense to say that religions contain both life-giving (spiritual) and life-denying (malevolent or some comparable term) pathways.</p>
<p>In one sense, <italic>Exploring the Spirituality of the World Religions</italic> echoes Huston Smith’s classic <italic>The Religions of Man</italic> (1958, subsequently <italic>The World’s Religions</italic>), which Ferguson cites several times. Smith chose to explore religions only “at their best” and confessed to being “enamored” by what he found. Duncan Ferguson is similarly captivated by the best that religions have to offer, but he also challenges naïve readers to take seriously the less-than-best aspects.</p>
