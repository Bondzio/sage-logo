<p>In the United States much of the public works infrastructure that makes modern existence possible is largely invisible or taken for granted. Most people hardly give a thought to where the water comes from that fills sinks, or where the water goes once those are drained or the toilets flushed. We flip switches and expect light. We touch buttons on thermostats and our homes are cooled or heated as needed. And when we get in our cars, we expect to be able to travel to where ever we wish on smooth, well-paved roads and to cross any rivers or other such obstacles on sturdy bridges. So crucial are these systems to daily existence that we often view them as natural and even inevitable. We tend only to notice shortcomings or other issues when something does not work—when we are asked to boil our water, when the power goes out, or more dramatically, when a bridge collapses. Examining the US transportation infrastructure, the authors of the books under review all seek to make the invisible more visible—from the process of road building and how it shaped modern intragovernmental relations, to the truly national phenomenon of auto-centered, road-dependent urban sprawl, to the shadowy workings of an extra-governmental entity behind an iconic bridge, to the subway system that contributes greatly to the daily working of the national capital. These works, which focus on pieces of the transportation infrastructure that Americans often take for granted, all show how careful histories of roads, bridges, and subways can illuminate the contested atmospheres in which such structures were created and evolved. And they also reflect larger issues in modern American life and politics, such as the US dependence on the automobile and the uphill battles waged to establish alternatives.</p>
<p>Not much more than a century ago, road building in the United States was a strictly local responsibility. The process of laying out, building and maintaining the nation’s roads, such as they were, had not changed much since the colonial period. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, however, a number of groups—led in many ways by bicycle enthusiasts—began to agitate for better, smoother, longer roads. In Paving the Way: New York Road Building and the American State, 1880-1956, Michael R. Fein demonstrates how, below the surface, that crusade set in motion a restructuring of the road-building process that not only revolutionized the roads themselves but also contributed to the transformation of the relationships between local, state, and national governments. New York State, according to Fein, in the first half of the twentieth century pioneered new administrative structures for dealing with road building that were soon imitated by other states.</p>
<p>Fein divides the history of road building in New York State into five policy regimes. Beginning with the late nineteenth century, he documents how all funding, decisions, and manpower came from the local communities through which the few, primitive roads of that time ran. By the turn of the twentieth century, however, certain largely urban interests began to turn to the state of New York in an effort to promote the construction of more and better roads. This resulted in the creation of a second policy regime in which local officials voluntarily cooperated with the state government in order to gain funding for better roads through their locales. Local interests, however, still exerted a great deal of influence and patronage opportunities often dictated when and where roads would be built. The system was rife with potential and actual corruption. Into the seeming quagmire stepped members of a newly evolving profession—highway engineers—determined to enact reforms. They used the progressive language of efficiency and technical expertise to gradually gain more control over the road-building process. This culminated in the creation of a State Highway Department led by engineers. Though not entirely free of political oversight, nonetheless the engineers in charge increasingly asserted the superiority of their supposedly nonpolitical approach. And state politicians saw the value in deflecting all criticism from the legislature to the highway department and its engineers. The New Deal initiated yet another stage in the development of the road-building process, bringing in greater federal money and control. In the end, Fein argues, the state and federal governments negotiated something of a power-sharing arrangement. At the same time, the state further insulated the road-building process from voters (and local protestors) with the creation of an independent public authority to plan, finance, and build the New York State Thruway.</p>
<p>The evolution of road building in New York both mirrored and can help further illuminate the movement of political power and control from the local to the state to the national level during the twentieth century. Fein argues that such movement was not a simple or linear process. Rather, it was highly contested at each stage. Local interests and control, especially, were attacked by those who viewed roads as a state, regional, or national concern. Local objections to road construction were seen as merely obstructionist—road-building projects were public goods and parochial interests should not be allowed to stand in the way. And although the local voice was largely muted, it was not silenced. It would emerge again in the highway revolts of the 1950s and 1960s. And the state government did not simply surrender its long-sought control over the road-building process with the advent of federal funding. Rather, road building became a cooperative venture between states and the federal government with substantial state influence over where and when roads, particularly, the interstate highway system, would be built.</p>
<p>Though bicyclists may have been the initial promoters of better roads, they were joined in the early twentieth century by—and largely eclipsed by—the operators of a newer technology, the automobile. Automobile enthusiasts partnered with construction interests, concrete and asphalt producers, tire manufacturers, and the automobile industry to lobby—rather relentlessly—for greater expenditures for roads at all levels of government beginning in the early twentieth century. Owen Gutfreund’s work, <italic>20th Century Sprawl: Highways and the Reshaping of the American Landscape</italic>, begins with an overview of the history of the financing of road building from a largely national perspective. He argues that the “Good Roads” lobby was extraordinarily successful in convincing politicians and the American public that good roads were indeed a “public good” and that construction of roads should be financed largely through general revenues, rather than requiring the owners and drivers of automobiles and trucks to bear the cost of building the infrastructure needed for their use of their favored technology. The use of general revenues to help finance road building became an often invisible subsidy to automobility—and generally at the expense of alternative forms of transportation. This subsidization of automobile travel over alternative forms of transportation had profound consequences for American cities.</p>
<p>While the impact of the automobile on cities is a familiar tale, the value of Gutfreund’s study lies in his choice of case studies. While the costly and often devastating effects of decentralization on America’s largest cities—from New York City to Los Angeles, Atlanta to San Francisco, as well as Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis—have been well documented, the effects on less prominent large cities as well as the nation’s smaller cities has not been examined or made visible in as great of depth. Rather than focus on the “usual suspects,” Gutfreund examines the consequences of auto-centered road-building policies in Denver, Colorado; Middlebury, Vermont; and Smyrna, Tennessee. By focusing on a number of the cities less studied, Gutfreund clearly demonstrates that dominance of public policies that favored the automobile had multiple and sometimes varied consequences across cities and regions. For example, while such policies contributed to the devastation of central city areas in Denver and Middlebury, they also aided the creation of the “boom town” of Smyrna.</p>
<p>While roads might well be the most visible of the invisible infrastructure of modern America in that they are used daily by a large segment of the American population, certain pieces of the transportation infrastructure have high visibility due to design and engineering. The Brooklyn Bridge, for example, stands as one of the great engineering projects of nineteenth-century America. And on the west coast, the Golden Gate Bridge has come to mean far more than simply a means to connect San Francisco to northern California. In Paying the Toll Louise Dyble argues that the Golden Gate Bridge’s iconic status helped keep the workings of the public authority created to build and maintain it largely in the shadows. Though repeated political and financial scandals and exposes of those scandals made public many of the less savory aspects of the workings of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway Division, the organization itself was able to operate largely invisibly, with little oversight and the ability to act with great impunity.</p>
<p>Michael Fein’s study of the evolution of road building in New York State demonstrates how over time state highway engineers were able to insulate their decision-making process not only from the voters but also from direct oversight of elected officials. This culminated in the creation of the New York State Thruway Authority. Though Fein points out many of the problems associated with such an organizational type, it is not his primary focus. Dyble’s case study, on the other hand, presents a cautionary tale of the uses and abuses of power made possible by the reliance upon nongovernmental, independent public authorities. Her “biography” of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District presents an almost unbroken series of examples of corruption, abuse of power, mismanagement, financial irregularities, racist hiring practices, and general disregard for the interests of anyone or anything other than the officers of the organization and the district itself. It was an example of a self-serving and self-perpetuating bureaucracy of the worst kind. And the actions of the officers not only ignored the interests of the people of the San Francisco Bay area but also placed the bridge itself in jeopardy with a history of poor maintenance and disregard of potential hazards.</p>
<p>Dyble’s is an important story not only on its own terms but because of the proliferation of such public authorities throughout the United States. In places, Dyble refers to the culture of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District as “distinct,” and its history, “unique.” And yet she suggests that it is not all that different from thousands of other public authorities and districts, many dating back to the late nineteenth century, engaged in similar activities. Without doubting that such corruption and abuse did mar the district’s history, it is less certain how typical is that extreme level of corruption and abuse of power. She does make a convincing argument, however, that the very nature of these public authorities—corporate and independent with minimal if any oversight—makes them ripe for such abuses. Her case study demonstrates that the worst case scenarios—such as the actions by district officials to deliberately block development of alternative forms of transportation between Marin County and San Francisco—were indeed possible. It certainly should alert Americans to the potential pitfalls inherent in an over reliance on such insulated public authorities to conduct and direct work so vital to the public welfare and to so many varied constituencies. She also demonstrates how the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District in particular and the proliferation of such agencies generally has contributed greatly to the fragmentation of urban government in the Bay area as well as nationally. The Bay area, for example, became a patchwork of multiple, largely independent special districts dealing with bridges, highways, and transit and the officials of those districts undermined the effort to create a single regional transportation authority in the early 1970s. Thus, both in the Bay area and nationally that fragmentation fed continued resistance to more regional forms of organization and problem solving.</p>
<p>The first three books under review all paint a rather bleak picture of the history of public works, emphasizing undemocratic decision making, potentially (and actually) corrupt bureaucratic structures, and the devastating effects of auto-centered policies on American cities. In contrast, Zachary M. Schrag’s study of Washington, DC’s subway system, The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro, depicts a more hopeful view. Of course, Schrag’s topic of the subway has a natural advantage in that it offered an alternative to automobile commuting and relentless decentralization through highway construction.</p>
<p>Schrag argues that Washington Metro was the product of both the highway revolt of the 1950s and 1960s and the optimistic liberalism of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. The Metro was created out of the progressive belief that there had to be an alternative to automobile commuting and an ever-expanding program of highway construction that destroyed much of the unique and special fabric of America’s central cities. It was also born of a political philosophy asserting that great urban public works should not only address needs but also enhance the urban environment. If Dyble’s work focuses primarily on the dark side of how we organize to build great public works, Schrag’s work emphasizes primarily the potential for positive outcomes—such as the potential for a city operating on a more human scale and less dependent upon the automobile.</p>
<p>Schrag’s approach to his subject is both topical and chronological. After an examination of the history of Washington, DC, Schrag looks at plans proposed as early as the mid-1950s to deal with the detrimental impact of the automobile on the nation’s capital. These plans, at least in part, called for the use of rail transit. He then explored in great detail the planning, design, building, and financing of what became the Metro. He also explores the intragovernmental negotiations and agreements necessary for the construction of a system that operated in two states as well as the District of Columbia. He tracks the role of governments and governmental agencies at many different levels in shaping and defining of where and how the system would be built. And he argues that though the system never met the high expectations in terms of passengers carried and revenues generated promised by its early promoters, it nonetheless became a crucial, even indispensible—if sometimes invisible—part of the fabric of the national capital region. This detailed examination also allowed Schrag to separate many of the myths surrounding the Metro—such as why it does not serve Georgetown or, as yet, extend out to Dulles Airport—from the realities of the financing, construction, and engineering challenges facing the system designers and builders.</p>
<p>Many of the planners and scholars promoting the virtues of public rail service hoped that the subway built for the nation’s capital could become an example for cities across the nation. Metro never became that example. Schrag argues that there were factors unique to Washington—including the General Accounting Office’s ability to direct government agencies to rent space in properties located near Metro stations, for example, and the Commission on Fine Arts that insistence on beauty as well as utility in the design and construction of Metro stations—that made it difficult for other cities to imitate. More importantly, perhaps, Schrag argues that the grace and utility of the Metro was the creation of particular moment in time—a moment when many Americans still believed in the power of government and its potential to do good and a moment when the revolt against the devastating effects of highways on the fabric of cities was at its height, particularly in DC.</p>
<p>All four books under review focus on transportation, particularly urban transportation—the roads, bridges, and subways that exist to allow us to move people and goods as well as the governmental structures and financial arrangements that make them possible. Like water, sewer and electrical systems, urban transportation systems are part of the generally invisible infrastructure that makes modern life in the United States possible. The studies by Fein, Gutfreund, Dyble, and Schrag all serve to make visible many of the direct and indirect consequences of the decisions and choices Americans have made over the last century in order to build a transportation system largely dependent upon the automobile. These have included the muting of the citizen voice in highway planning, the proliferation of insulated special districts, and wasteful urban sprawl. And while some projects and programs have sought to provide alternatives to the automobile, they have remained too few and, perhaps, too unique to as yet clearly point us toward a less auto-dependent future.</p>
