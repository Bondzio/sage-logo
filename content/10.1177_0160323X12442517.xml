<abstract>
<p>Local governments face a conundrum; a structural decline in revenues concurrent with a complex environment where service responsibility must be viewed as multijurisdictional, multigovernmental, and multisectorial. Issues faced by local government are increasingly beyond the financial or service capacity of individual governments. This article proposes that outcome success in the era of resource limitations necessitates that managers form new systems for regional collaboration. Successful adaption to twenty-first century realities requires that managers lead by identifying and forming new collaborative networks. Networks where several governments, nonprofit, and private organizations will integrate personnel and resources to accomplish a common mission.</p>

<title>Introduction—Today</title>
<p>With the onset of the great recession, local governments have served as the vanguard for new organizational theory by designing and implementing tools to reduce costs and make services and operations more cost efficient. Reducing the cost for personnel and operations, reducing capital investments, consolidating administrative services with other governments, reducing or eliminating investment in lower priority services, and increasing revenues through taxes and fees, local government have been very adept in making adjustments mandated by the economic malaise it has confronted in the first decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The majority of the tools used to fend off the effects of the recession have been from the toolbox managers acquired through traditional college and professional development curriculums. These include reducing employee benefits’, freezing salaries, making percentage reductions to budgets, cooperating with other governments to reduce administrative costs, and entering into innovative interlocal agreements that through limited joint operation facilitate economies of scale.</p>
<p>The thesis for this article is that managers have used these traditional tools to their maximum effect. Attempting to attain further efficiencies by making additional reductions in municipal budgets is not a realistic alternative. Managers are finding that local governments are now not able to meet established service performance standards because of reduced staffing and concomitant weakened operational capacity. Therefore, any additional use of these traditional tools to obtain further efficiencies will result in an unacceptable loss of service effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition, reduced local government support to nongovernment community-based service organizations services has frayed if not breached the social service safety net, and, many capital investments have been deferred into the future thus compounding future cost. The capability of local government to meet the basic needs of its citizens while simultaneously addressing the quality of life amenities expected by community residents has been adversely impacted. Many managers have drawn the conclusion that further reduction in service levels will not be tolerated by those living in our communities.</p>

<sec id="section2-0160323X12442517">
<title>The Future</title>
<p>Critically important questions being asked by city and county managers are ones oriented to the future. Is the worst of the economic crisis over? Is the economy and real estate market rebounding? Will revenues generated from what is identified as an economic recovery allow cites and counties to start the rebuilding process? Will local government in the next two to three years recover to the years experienced in the beginning of the twenty-first century when expansion of property tax and sales tax revenues facilitated large program and capital growth?</p>
<p>A reading of economic statistics may indicate the answer to these questions is yes, the worst is over, the economy has made a turn and local governments may see a durable upturn in revenues. Recent statistics seem to bear this out with revenues received by local government in the third quarter of 2011 being 4 percent higher than what was received in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12442517">Lambert 2011</xref>). Reinforcing this positive economic statistic initial jobless claims have fallen to the lowest level since April 20, 2008 thus indicating an increase in income and sales tax revenues to local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160323X12442517">Segall 2011</xref>). Complimenting this trend, the third quarter of 2011 saw consumer spending for durable goods as well as spending for services increasing over the level for 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X12442517">US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis 2011</xref>). These trends indicate that possibly in the very near future local government’s economic nightmare may be over. However, if this is true will the new normal mean what it did in 2005–07 when local government was at it apex with positive revenue growth? The answer is very likely no. The world local government operated in before the great recession will not return. The economy as well as the foundation for our government has undergone dramatic change.</p>
<p>The change we are experiencing is transformational and probably best summarized in a holiday message sent by the Executive Director of the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) to the members of ICMA. Referring to what he labeled as the next decade of local government Bob O’Neill said, “With state funding at an all-time low, the federal government unable to reach consensus on just about anything, and our country’s financial recovery progressing at a snail’s pace, many of us feel as if we’ll be on our own for at least the next 10 years—if not longer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X12442517">ONeill 2011</xref>). While Mr. O’Neill did not fill in the particulars for why local government would confront such a lost decade, it is possible to surmise his rationale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160323X12442517">
<title>Economic Restrictions</title>
<p>The financial foundation for local government is established through revenues received through the property tax, and to a lesser extent the sales and income tax. Property values and property tax revenues have been pummeled by the great recession with property values decreasing by as much as 30–40 percent. Some experts do not predict a reversal in the property value decline until as late as 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12442517">Dennis 2011</xref>). Therefore, the primary source of tax revenues supporting local government services may continue to decline through 2016 and then take years to recover to prerecession levels.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is elected President in 2012, the focus of the federal government for the foreseeable future will be to reduce the federal deficit and debt. Doing so will mean further reductions and with many programs, elimination of financial support the federal government has historically invested in local government. Areas where reduction or elimination of federal support will occur include public safety, transportation, social services, utilities, environment, and housing.</p>
<p>At the macroeconomic level, an important development is the transformational change that is occurring in the economic foundation through which Americans are employed. While the economy is enjoying a reduction in the unemployment rate, and manufacturing jobs are on the increase, there are indications that the jobs being created are not those that we have identified as historically supporting the middle class (Department of Labor, February 2012; Goodman and Healy 2009). A countervailing trend with the drop in unemployment is that the underemployment rate remains large. Currently, 18 percent of people in the workforce are identified as being underemployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12442517">Jacobe 2011</xref>). </p>
<p>Also troubling for local government finances, adjusting for inflation, the after-tax incomes of the vast majority of people who pay taxes to local government (the 21st to 80th percentiles of the population) have grown at approximately 1 percent per year since 1979 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12442517">Plummer 2011</xref>). It is very difficult for citizens to support equal, much less higher taxes if their adjusted for inflation income will not allow them to support a progressive life style. </p>
<p>Another important sociological–economic trend impacting the ability of the citizenry to support government services is the economic stratification of American’s and their relative inability to move upward in the economic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12442517">Deparle 2012</xref>). People who perceive they lack positive economic mobility through employment will be less willing to support the tax system required to meet the service demands of those very citizens.</p>

<sec id="section4-0160323X12442517">
<title>Infrastructure Demands</title>
<p>As local government is the government closest to the people, and as the federal government becomes a declining governmental partner, it will fall on state and local government to address the nation’s $2.2 trillion infrastructure deficiency that includes water, wastewater, roads, bridges, dams, aviation, and parks and recreation systems. According to a report by the American Association of Civil Engineers, unless a plan to aggressively address this $2 trillion infrastructure deficit is addressed, American society will see a decline in not only its basic quality of life but also its rudimentary safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12442517">Engineers 2009</xref>). An example of the deficit that must be filled by state and local governments is reversing the deterioration of our national highway system, which has resulted from the failure of the federal government to adjust transportation taxes to the new economy. According to a report in Governing magazine the deficit in federal gas tax monies to the year 2020 significantly exceeds $1 trillion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12442517">Buntin et al. 2012</xref>). The political paralysis in Washington will likely stop our national infrastructure decline from being addressed by the federal government. Therefore, if we as a people are not willing to accept a precipitous decline in our transportation infrastructure, addressing the infrastructure deficits will by default, fall to state and local governments.</p>

<title>Consolidation and Special Districts</title>
<p>To gain substantial service efficiencies, and thereby meaningfully reduce the cost of service, local governments have historically focused political efforts on dramatically changing organizational design and service delivery. Efficiencies have been realized by consolidating services and creating special districts. If as projected, the fiscal health of local government will not recover in tandem with the private economy, and therefore it becomes necessary for local government to go beyond traditional cutback methodologies, will further government consolidation and creation of special districts be the next answer? When evaluating these tools two questions must be addressed. Is consolidating local governments or creating special districts politically feasible, and two, will success with either make a substantial reduction in the cost of providing service? First, we will look at consolidation.</p>
<sec id="section6-0160323X12442517">
<title>Government and Functional Consolidation</title>
<p>Consolidation may take two forms. The first is government consolidation with the second being functional consolidation of services. Functional consolidation involves the assignment for service responsibility from one or several governments to another unit of government. Examples of services where functional consolidation occurs are fire safety, public safety dispatching, specialized police functions, building inspection, development plan review, and so on.</p>
<p>The consolidation of governments is the merging of governance and service delivery systems and is credited with several efficiency advantages that ultimately will reduce the cost of government. These include more effectively attracting region-wide economic development, improving bond ratings thus reducing interest costs, reducing service, governance, and administrative duplication, and, reducing costs by obtaining economies of scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12442517">Toledo Business Journal 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Consolidating smaller with larger governments is politically very difficult. From 1902 to 2010, there have been 105 referendums where voters were asked to approve the consolidation of governments. Only twenty-seven were approved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12442517">Linebough 2011</xref>). For those governments that were successfully consolidated some studies question the ability of consolidated governments to produce an outcome of gaining efficiencies by either creating economies of scale or through elimination of redundant costs. A study conducted for the Indiana Township Association evaluated governments that have been consolidated, and, concluded that no correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12442517">Wendell Cox Demographia 2009</xref>) exists between efficiency gains and consolidation and, in some consolidations, spending actually increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12442517">Wendell Cox Demographia 2009</xref>). Consolidation resulted in increased costs because service levels and the cost for personnel were elevated to the level of government with the highest service level, or the highest salaries and benefits for personnel. The study continues by claiming that in Pennsylvania and New York, research indicates that smaller units of government are actually associated with greater efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12442517">Wendell Cox Demographia 2009</xref>, 3). While this report was conducted for a group with a vested interest in negative results, the findings parallel other research which points out that the Nashville-Davidson County as well as Jacksonville-Duvall County consolidation resulted in increased long-term spending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12442517">Hawkins and Ward 1991</xref>). Supporting the analysis that consolidated governments by structural alignment do not guarantee budget solvency, in 2011 the County Manager for the unified government in Kansas City detailed that fiscal distress is causing severe reductions in budget expenditures thus forcing further reductions in personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X12442517">Kansas City Business Journal 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160323X12442517">
<title>Special Districts</title>
<p>Special districts are the fastest growing unit of government, now representing over 40 percent of all governments in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X12442517">Shafritz, Russell, and Borick 2011</xref>). Special districts whether dependent as a subunit of an existing city or county, or as an independent entity, do represent an excellent example of a collaborative system, and are formed to provide a discrete service typically fire, emergency rescue, parks, community development, water management, housing, or a very narrow function such as cemetery administration.</p>
<p>For the manager, special districts present comparable problems as seen in service consolidation. First, the formation and powers of special districts must be authorized by state government. If state authorization provides the framework for districts, the formation and delegation of powers will require the county to incorporate the new entity in conjunction with all participating jurisdictions, and may politically or legally require a referendum of the people affected by the new quasi-government. Such a political/legal process can take years to finalize, thereby not allowing the manager to make timely and effective response to declining resources.</p>
<p>There is also mixed opinion about the actual successes of special districts in obtaining significant efficiencies through economies of scale. Where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12442517">Farmer (2010</xref>) points out that regional agencies have produced economies of scale and lower unit costs, other studies point out that special districts are most useful as systems to capture new revenues, not to create economies of scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12442517">McCabe 2000</xref>). A recent study of special districts by Berman and West looks at the values which motivates managers of districts and finds that cutting costs or economy is not a dominant value with only 28.6 percent saying it is a very important value. Financial viability, equity, and service effectiveness are rated as more important than cutting costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12442517">Berman and West 2012</xref>). These studies and personal empirical conclusions show that special districts are typically formed for the purpose of raising new revenue as a counter to revenue restrictions. Especially to offset property tax limitations placed on local government through state legislative action.</p>
<p>Special districts confront some of the same cost pressures as consolidation. As an example, formation of districts is simplified when personnel from joining governments are brought to the level of the member who is providing the highest salary and benefit levels. As the cost of personnel is one of the largest costs for services, special districts can actually lead to higher costs when personnel costs are elevated to that of the member government who has the most lucrative salary and benefit package. Perpetuation of higher costs can be further exacerbated by the fact that special districts do not have the public transparency or accountability as found in local governments.</p>
<p>Consolidation and formation of special districts have been, and in the future will be used by local government as tools to lower the cost of government. However, as both are outside the immediate control of the manager, may not significantly reduce costs, and, take extensive time to formalize, they are not responsive to the manager’s need to find immediate cost reduction by creating deep service efficiencies.</p>

<title>Local Government as a Complex Adaptive System</title>
<p>Adapting to a future with diminished resources requires an understanding of the new complexities confronting local government in the twenty-first century. First, in contrast to what is identified as the traditional community, citizens in the twenty-first century increasingly see themselves connected regionally, nationally, and even globally. With our international information network, and with an economy where people work in employment patterns that are regional, national, and many cases international, the twentieth-century pressure for managers to insure citizens clearly identified their tax dollars with the unit of government providing service has meaningfully decreased in the twenty-first century. In other words, citizens’ expecting the name of the city or county to be on the fire truck and police car is no longer a dominate feature in the twenty-first century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12442517">Friedman 2005</xref>). The traditional hierarchical command system based on rational, planned changes with management controlling the components of the organizational system in order to attain the greatest financial efficiency and program effectiveness are rapidly changing. A focus on management responsibility for planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting as espoused by scientific management theorists such as Luther Gulick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12442517">Shafritz and Hyde 2012</xref>) is being supplanted with new responsibilities that include the development of collaborative networks, creating positive systems for citizens engagement, and focusing on strategic goals with decentralized program and service execution.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century, local governments’ face what Agranoff and McGuire label as “wicked” problems or problems with no discernible solution. Because of the complexities and the interconnectedness of agencies and their respective missions’, solutions to these “wicked” problems cannot be resolved by organizations through a unitary approach. As problems are fragmented, power, and authority to resolve these problems must be dispersed to many organizations; public as well as private organizations, all possessing overlapping responsibility for the mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12442517">Agranoff and McGuire 2001</xref>). Paralleling this problem or issue fragmentation, twenty-first century local governments operate in a system where unpredictable, overwhelming, and conflicting information enters the organization from many disparate sources, at a multitude of unpredictable points. Information affecting the accomplishment of the organizational mission enters into all constituent parts of the organization, with external actors often pitting one unit against another in order to obtain an organizational response that is favorable to their unique issue. In the new twenty-first century, environment players beseeching government for favor possess little concern for equity, or organizational standard operating procedures. Incremental adjustments to existing policies that do not result in meeting discrete demands are not acceptable to the external actors placing demands on local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X12442517">Paarlberg and Bielefeld 2009</xref>). Many people placing demands on local government do not hold a strong, or for that matter, any value on providing service to insure outcome equity for all stakeholders affected by local government service or regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12442517">Bourgon 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An ill-fated outcome of the reinventing government philosophy that advocates for citizens to be treated as customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12442517">Osburne and Plastrik 1992</xref>) has been the creation of the McGovernment society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X12442517">Ritzer 2008</xref>). Moving away from the public interest may not have been the conscious goal for the reinventing government movement, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12442517">Osborne and Plastrik 2000</xref>) however, because the reinventing government paradigm has placed so much emphasis on customers and competitive customer choice, we as public administrators have inculcated our citizens with a value system where they perceive that government services should be delivered to them very quickly, cheap, and custom made to the their individual customer needs. The McGovernment value is now a reality and deeply embedded in our political psyche. A value focused on individual desire that will not allow public organizations the luxury to channel, collect, and process information through a centralized hierarchal structure controlled by select members of the organizational hierarchy.</p>
<p>Another critically important factor is managers cannot effectively control the process through which information enters the organization. Attempting to channel information through a central receiving or processing point will result in unacceptable delays in addressing information requests, service demands, and will lead to citizen and stakeholder dissatisfaction due to lost information and unacceptable delays in response. The role for the manager in this environment is to train employees so they understand how to respond to information from the external environment, have the knowledge and resources to address unique situations presented by external stakeholders, and, are empowered to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12442517">Agranoff and McGuire 2001</xref>). What unavoidably will be lost through decentralization will be the equity of response that historically was a central management tenet for public administrators. In this new environment management, theorists pose the question whether local government or our public institutions should be concerned with either process or outcome equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12442517">Bourgon 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Unpredictable and rapid societal and economic changes are also dramatically affecting public expectations, with local government operating in an integrated environment with many independent (public, private, nonprofit) organizations possessing some responsibility for missions that also fall in the domain of local government. In the twenty-first century, managers see the mission of local government extending beyond the responsibility of one local government, with many missions spanning beyond government to nonprofit and in some cases private entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X12442517">Blomgren and O’Leary 2011</xref>). Local government operate in this complex environment with little historical understanding or management knowledge about how new systems should be designed to coordinate and make sense of this evolving environment. The historical system used by local government has not integrated the multitude of private and public organizations into a unified and coordinated service delivery system, all focused on a set of unified responsibilities and operating through an integrated chain of command.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century, attaining maximum efficiency and effectiveness mandates that managers design systems that facilitate organizational units and personnel within those units to be responsive to the information or citizen demands entering into each organization subunit. Management will operate without a realistic expectation that a centralized structure will evaluate that input or attempt to control a centralized response. While all organizational components will be oriented to the organizational mission and vision, decisions or reaction to information will not be controlled through unitary hierarchal command systems. Authority for decisions and actions appropriate to one organizational component will be decentralized to that component with top management focusing on coordinating cross-departmental or sectorial issues. Addressing the complex problems of the twenty-first century while concurrently attaining the operational efficiencies made possible through enlarging the service delivery system, managers will view their role as organizing and coordinating networked systems that are multidepartmental and include public, private, and nonprofits organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12442517">Bourgon 2009</xref>). In this new world, cities and counties must develop innovative and quickly adaptive systems that can timely and accurately read, and then respond to the political, technological changes, as well as increased social complexities that encompass local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X12442517">Paarlberg and Bielefeld 2009</xref>). In collaborative networks, managers will integrate personnel and critically important, financial resources into temporary systems focused on unified missions (Bennis and Slater 1998). Instead of directing, managers will concentrate on remolding bureaucratic systems, reshaping bureaucracies into team-based units, and creating networked systems that will cross-political jurisdictions and are cross-sectorial in form.</p>

<title>Local Government Experience with Collaboration</title>
<p>As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12442517">Agronoff (2007)</xref>, collaborative networks are not uncommon to local government. From Council of Governments to special districts, local governments have historically used a form of networks to address specific issues. With the exception of special districts organized around missions that involve public safety and emergency management, networks have been used primarily for the collection and distribution of information rather than service delivery. Even though the environmental system in which government functions has exponentially magnified in its complexity, local governments have not responded by replacing unitary hierarchies with new multisectoral, multiorganizational, and multigovernmental networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X12442517">Wachhaus 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12442517">Agronoff (2006)</xref> claims that most networks are formed as separate administrative units created for the purpose of knowledge management and education, with only a minority formed to unify service delivery. However, as local government managers evaluate their organizational capacity to meet citizen expectations under a mandate of decreased resources, coupled with the reality of dispersed responsibility and power, service networks will gain prominence as a primary vehicle for the delivery of cross-boundary local government services. These networks will be both unitary networks that involve one governmental entity as well as cross-jurisdictional and cross-sectorial networks that comprise several jurisdictionally related governments. Also included in multisectorial networks will be private and nonprofit organizations that hold an overlapping mission with local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12442517">Agranoff and McGuire 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0160323X12442517">
<title>Forms for Organizational Networks</title>
<p>Networked systems used by local government may take several forms. The historical form commonly used by government is one of shared governance. In a shared governance system, all stakeholders are involved, but no stakeholder is in charge. In shared governance, a new organization is created to manage and disseminate information, as well as to coordinate actions of the stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2007</xref>). Shared governance has also been used to coordinate interconnected services provided by several jurisdictions or agencies. However, as each agency maintains operational and command control, services provided are fragmented. Thus, optimum efficiencies are not attained and variations in service levels are the end outcome.</p>
<p>The second form commonly identified with special districts is the creation of an independent administrative and command entity with a mission to provide limited and discrete services to members of the network. Governments receiving a service through this network will interact with the independent organization, typically appointing members to its governing structure, but policy and management decisions are controlled through the independent entity. In a special district, the members relinquish the provision of service to the independent entity as well as direct control over the operations and financing of the service. Financing is usually a function of a special tax levied by the independent entity. In essence, while special districts help consolidate fragmented service delivery systems, they do not by definition change the organizational structure through which the service is delivered. Special districts such as fire districts are typically operated through a hierarchal command and control structure. The correlation of a special district with a collaborate system rests with special districts identified as an organization to which other organizations have, through legislative action and/or a popular referendum, delegated the responsibility and authority to provide a governmental service.</p>
<p>A variation of an independent authority is that a government can establish a dependent authority to deliver a service. A dependent authority may provide services in several political jurisdictions and are governed by a higher elected body such as a county. An example of a dependent authority is a fire district that provides service to unincorporated areas of the county, while also serving several cities within the county. As true with the independent district, the only correlation between a dependent district and a collaborative network is that services are provided to several jurisdictions by one organization. The same dependent service arrangement is found when counties franchise to one city the delivery of regional water and sewer services.</p>
<p>The third form of network, unitary governance, is one where government, nonprofit, or private organization has the command authority for providing services in two or more political jurisdictions with other governments, nonprofits, or private organizations allocating resources and contracting responsibility for service delivery to that organization. The delegation can be temporary with the delegation of authority and resources’ ending after a short-term mission is accomplished, or it can be long term with a multiyear delegation of authority. This network is created when one or more organizations, public, private, and nonprofit, delegate resources and authority to another organization, so that organization will assume the leadership role in addressing a particular mission that is common to the stakeholder organizations. With this delegation of authority, stakeholder organizations also allocate mission-specific financial, personnel, and operational resources to the control of the central organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12442517">Kenis and Provan 2009</xref>). A principle advantage such a lead agency has over consolidation or special districts is legislative authority is not required to create a lead agency although the financial allocation to the lead agency will be legislatively appropriated by those governments who are members of the collaborative team. A major advantage of organizing a lead agency for service delivery is that it can be organized by management for the respective stakeholder organizations. Should one or more of the legislative bodies not appropriate funds to the lead agency those governments can still participate by managers executing an interlocal agreement that allocates personnel and resources as stipulated within the interlocal agreement. In many cases, governments not able to directly appropriate funds will be able to contribute financial resources based on program budgets approved through the legislative process.</p>
<p>Lead teams can fulfill many functions and services of local government, to include public works activities involving road construction/reconstruction and drainage improvements. Collaborative lead teams may also generate substantial operational efficiencies by unifying the management and operations of recreational leagues as well as maintaining recreational facilities. Economic and community development, emergency management, and many public safety functions will also recognize efficiencies through collaborative teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X12442517">Kapucu and Garayev 2011</xref>). Administratively, establishing health clinics, human resource administration, information technology, engineering, code enforcement, animal control are ideally suited for collaborative teams.</p>
<p>Lead teams organized through unitary governance offers local government the optimum alternative for gaining maximum service efficiency. Cross-jurisdictional efficiencies as well as increased service effectiveness may be realized when a service has a direct or indirect impact on one or more adjoining governmental jurisdictions, or when services provided by local government are within the mission of a private or nonprofit organization. Providing social services to economically disadvantaged or homeless populations represents a perfect example of a mission that transcends governmental, private, and nongovernmental organizational (NGO) boundaries.</p>
<p>The fourth form is the unitary self-organized unit. Most commonly recognized by community oriented policing teams or code inspection teams, unitary teams are relatively organic as they are organized at the point where a specific issue is presented, such as the department or section within one organization. Short term and problem focused, these teams may be organized by managers or by line personnel who are experiencing a problem or issue that while it can be addressed solely by their organization, requires the assistance from other personnel outside their section or department. With certain issues, personnel from other governments possessing an overlapping responsibility for the issue may be asked to assist as a member of the team. These teams function either hierarchically or may operate more organically as matrix teams. If organized through a matrix format authority and responsibility will be delegated to all members of the team so they can take necessary unilateral action to accomplish the team mission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0160323X12442517">
<title>Lead Agency Collaborative Teams</title>
<p>Collaborative lead teams will be organized by that organization with the primary mission for the issue and/or that has the largest amount of resources to invest in accomplishing the mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12442517">Kenis and Provan 2009</xref>). It will not inevitably be the largest government or organization involved in the network. Some missions, for example, those dealing with social or economic problems, the agency with the primary mission may be a private NGO. When this is the case, government must delegate responsibility to the NGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12442517">Agranoff and McGuire 2003</xref>). In most cases, such a delegation of authority and appropriation of resources will require managers to obtain legislative budget authorization.</p>
<p>All organizations, governmental, nongovernmental agencies, and private organizations who share a common mission will assign personnel and allocate resources to the lead agency for the purpose of operationalizing the collaborative teams. The lead agency will manage the operation and authorize expenditure of resources. As participating members will allocate resources including personnel, financial, and operational; new forms of financial and program accountability must be created and formalized between all members within the network.</p>
<p>Forming lead agencies poses a major cultural change for managers. The theoretical basis for public organizational networks assumes that each public agency that is a member of the network will maintain day-to-day operational control over network operations that involve its programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2007</xref>). However, this is not the case in collaborative systems using the lead team concept. True today as it was in more historical writing of public administration, creating efficiency in operations is enhanced through economies of scale and when organizational work units make timely and clear responses to changing circumstances. A vital component for efficient operations is instituting unity of command for the network, which can only be attained when members formalize a governing charter that delegates full operational control to the lead agency.</p>
<p>In conjunction with operational control, the lead organization will be charged with insuring outcome accountability. Participating organizations will assist in the design of the outcome performance metrics, but the lead agency will be responsible for accomplishing the metrics established by network members.</p>
<p>The greatest weakness and possibility for failure for lead teams is the loss of legitimacy and parochial resentment by network members as control for operations, finances, and outcomes shifts to the lead agency. This weakness can be mitigated by the formation of a network advisory team, consisting of management representatives from all network members. Advisory teams will meet regularly and be charged with writing a unified mission for the team, agreeing to a formula for allocating personnel and other resources from each network member to the team, establishing metrics for financial and outcome accountability, identifying, and providing advice on perceived problems in team operations, and evaluating financial accountability and performance outcomes.</p>

<title>Principles for Formation and Operation of a Lead Agency</title>
<p>To establish collaborative networks, managers must view government operations from a multijurisdictional strategic perspective while concurrently organizing administrative and managerial systems into new operational collaborative systems. Through a global, strategic orientation, managers will identify all political jurisdictions and organizations that have overlapping responsibility for a service function within their political jurisdiction. With potential network players identified, managers must remove jurisdictional prerogatives, and, either accept responsibility for being the lead agency in service delivery or, to delegate lead agency authority to another political jurisdiction or organization.</p>
<sec id="section13-0160323X12442517">
<title>Strategic Orientation</title>
<p>To address the complexities of our communities in a world of reduced resources and increasing service expectations, cities and counties will continue to form special districts, consolidate governments, and organize shared service coordinating organizations. But shared governance systems will only marginally, if at all, provide an answer to the new dynamics facing cities and counties in the twenty-first century. While forming consolidated governments and special districts will potentially provide important answers to the resource limitations of local government, consolidation as well as the formation of special districts requires political collaboration that is extremely difficult to realize. As described, the historical success of consolidating governments is not encouraging.</p>
<p>Also difficult to create, special districts are typically focused on limited services such as public safety, water management, and so on. The formation of special districts also poses a major management problem because the manager cannot be assured that actual formation of the independent body will be politically feasible. And, formation of special districts is a political action outside the direct control of the manager. However, what is in the direct power of the manager and will allow the organization to attain significant organizational efficiencies is the organization and operationalization of collaborative lead teams for the purpose of providing multijurisdictional service delivery.</p>
<p>A fundamental organizational principle for collaborative networks is their characteristic of being decentralized, and swiftly adaptive to changes in the organizational environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12442517">Grobman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12442517">Bouaird 2008</xref>). To operationalize this concept at the micro or operational level, chief executive officers from all applicable public, NGO, and private organizations must dedicate leadership and resource support to the lead agency tasked with forming the collaborative team.</p>
<p>Formation of multigovernmental collaborative teams requires the proactive involvement of a city or county’s chief executive officer, working in tandem with the chief executive officers’ from other public and private network members. The formation of lead teams or for that matter shared governance coordinating teams, is not organic and will not automatically occur in response to new environmental realities. Design and formation will happen only through the intervention and progressive partnerships formed by the managers of the respective governments working with managers from private and NGO. The chief executive officers must eliminate parochial prejudices and establish the operational charter that will govern the operations of collaborative lead teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0160323X12442517">
<title>Operational Orientation</title>
<p>A common theme in the literature discussing collaborative networked systems is the concept of government service delivery evolving from one of unitary jurisdictional responsibility to one of network responsibility. It is conceptualized that networks will not operate using a traditional hierarchy but instead will modify the form of organization to one more closely identified with a matrix, where power and authority are dispersed throughout the organization. A basis for network administration is the new networked organization will be characterized by self-organizing, self-regulating units that do not require centralized control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12442517">Morcol and Wachhaus 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12442517">Grobman 2005</xref>). Unity of command is not a controlling management principle with dynamic matrix teams. In the matrix organization, team members are empowered to make decentralized decisions with all levels of the team coordinating and completing operational action planning as they learn from the environment they encounter. Consensus decision making will address the issues and problems faced by the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12442517">Senge 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12442517">Bennet and Bennet 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X12442517">Paarlberg and Bielefeld 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12442517">Morcol and Wachhaus 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With some missions, for example economic development, community development, as well as selected traditional areas of service delivery, a decentralized matrix form of organization may be the most effective organizational structure. Operating through a decentralized matrix may allow the system to respond quickly and with flexibility to new information and continually changing situations. However, several theorists such as Agranoff and Bennet who advocate for collaborative systems as the organizational structure best able to tackle the complexity of today’s world, also recognize that hierarchal systems will work in tandem with collaborative networks and, in fact may be the desired organizational form through which collaborative networks function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12442517">Bennet and Bennet 2004</xref>). Many missions completed by local government, while they require networked response because they involve multiple jurisdictions, do not have a mission that is significantly impacted by an unstable or unpredictable environment. Numerous ongoing missions of local government consist of routine procedures where constant standard operating procedures should be followed to insure efficiency as well as effectiveness of operations. With services such as public works projects to include drainage, road reconstruction, traffic management, and public safety services including emergency management, emergency rescue and fire suppression, efficiencies are derived through combining jurisdictional efforts and resources in a unified front, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X12442517">Kapucu 2009</xref>) and not necessarily by operations being organized through a postmodern collaborative network structure such as matrix teams. Because of their predictability and routine, many traditional services can most effectively operate by networking affected multijurisdictional organizations into a unified hierarchical operating structure.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0160323X12442517">
<title>Charter for Strategic Alignment</title>
<p>When outlining how collaborative organizations should be managed, Agranoff suggests the new form of organization, what he labels as a “collaborararchy” will typically be chartered by member organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2007</xref>, 83). Agranoff also suggests that mutual trust may be a substitute for mandated authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12442517">Agranoff 2007</xref>, 28). Klijn and Bennet support the more informal agreement among members by suggesting that cooperation will result because of an evolution to a common understanding of the complex nature of the issues and mutual interactions required to successfully operate in this environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X12442517">Klijn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12442517">Bennet and Bennet 2004</xref>). However, as buttressed by the historical principles of management, organizational success in the twenty-first century is fostered by clarity and well-understood procedures. Therefore, collaborative networks involving more than one formal entity, where the network uses resources distributed by these entities, and, has as its purpose the accomplishment of mission/missions that transcend several political jurisdictions, success is absolutely dependent upon the execution of a well-defined charter that clearly outlines functions, responsibilities, and standards for accountability. For local government, the charters governing collaborative lead teams should contain as a minimum five basic components. These are (1) formal statement of the mission/missions, (2) identification of the lead agency, (3) allocation of personnel from each network member to the lead agency, (4) financial appropriation from each network member to the lead agency for operations, capital, and equipment, and (5) establishment of program and financial accountability measures.</p>
<p>Writing the initial draft of the charter may be the responsibility of one entity, probably the lead agency, but must reflect the collective needs and values of all members who are part of the collaborative team. Charters may be for limited missions such as reconstructing a street or improving a drainage basin, or may be for more long-term missions, for example, providing low-income housing, street maintenance, or economic development.</p>
<p>Subsequent to formalization of the operational charter, the lead agency will need to form an advisory team made up of representatives from each network member. Advisory teams should meet periodically and will have the responsibility to evaluate mission progress and make operational or other adjustments as the environment and situation dictate.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Local government has entered a new era, an era marked by two transformative changes. First, local government is experiencing an ongoing restructuring of the system of public finance with political emasculation of the revenue base through which government services have historically been funded. The second change is the accelerating economic, technological, information, and social change occurring in the world, our nation, and our communities. This change is noted by the increasing complexity of the problems and issues which confront local government. Many of these issues cannot be solved by one unit of local government, and numerous services delivered by local government cross the boundaries of several governmental jurisdictions as well as rest within the mission of private and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>A favorite tool for local government to gain economies of scale and therefore attain efficiency has been to consolidate government or to form special districts. Both have significant limitations, but creating system efficiencies by enlarging the service area will continue to be a popular approach to reduce system cost. Managers cannot quickly or for that matter directly effect consolidation or create special districts. However, managers can attain large-scale system efficiencies from the economies of scale realized when services are integrated through collaborative multigovernmental, mutijurisdictional, multisectorial networks.</p>
<p>Adapting to this new environment, managers of local government must view their principle leadership responsibility as establishing regional collaborative networks, networks that include multiple governments, integrated with private and nonprofit organizations. Moving beyond the shared governance model used predominately in the twentieth century, twenty-first century managers will identify regional opportunities through an expansive vision that encompasses a wide breadth for networks, and when identified, will establish unitary governance charters for the networks to operate. This role will constitute a paradigm shift as managers relinquish direct control of personnel and resources to a unitary governance network of organizations charged with collaboratively addressing public issues. If their government is not the lead agency, managers will become coordinators, advisors, evaluators, and champions for the multiple operational networks which are charged with the mission to manage and deliver regionalized public services.</p>
