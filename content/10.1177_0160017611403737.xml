<abstract>
<p>This article aims to add a regional science perspective and a geographical dimension to our understanding of substantive questions regarding self-reported happiness and well-being through the specification and use of multilevel models. Multilevel models are used with data from the British Household Panel Survey and the Census of UK population to assess the nature and extent of variations in happiness and well-being to determine the relative importance of the area (district, region), household, and individual characteristics on these outcomes. Having taken into account the characteristics at these different levels, we are able to determine whether any areas are associated with especially positive or negative feelings of happiness and well-being. Whilst we find that most of the variation in happiness and well-being is attributable to the individual level, some variation in these measures is also found at the household and area levels, especially for the measure of well-being, before we control for the full set of individual, household, and area characteristics. However, once we control for these characteristics, the variation in happiness and well-being is not found to be statistically significant between areas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, there have been numerous attempts to define, measure, and analyze happiness in various contexts and pertaining to a wide range of disciplines, ranging from neuroscience and psychology to philosophy and economics. There are a number of theories and ways of measuring happiness and well-being. In particular, happiness questions are increasingly used in population surveys and it is suggested that a new <italic>science of happiness</italic> is emerging which aims to measure happiness, identify the main factors affecting it and quantify their relative importance. There is a rapidly growing body of interdisciplinary research on the determinants of happiness and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160017611403737">Dolan, Peasgood, and White 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160017611403737">Frey and Stutzer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160017611403737">Huppert, Baylis, and Keverne 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160017611403737">Layard 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The research presented here builds on this type of work from a regional science perspective by highlighting the geographical dimension and multilevel aspects of happiness and well-being. Most of the past quantitative research studies that attempted to measure happiness and well-being considered individual-level multiple regression models to produce happiness equations or formulas from an econometric perspective, where typically a subjective happiness or well-being variable is related to a set of explanatory variables (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160017611403737">Blanchflower and Oswald 2004</xref>):<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0160017611403737">

</disp-formula>where <italic>subjective well-being</italic> is typically measured via a survey question such as “taking all things together would you say you are <italic>very happy</italic>, <italic>quite happy</italic>, or <italic>not very happy</italic>,” <italic>w</italic> is the “true” well-being, <italic>h</italic>(.) is a continuous nondifferentiable function relating “actual” to “reported” (subjective) happiness, <italic>y</italic> is income, <italic>z</italic> is a set of demographic and personal characteristics, <italic>t</italic> is the time period, and <italic>e</italic> is an error-term.</p>
<p>Most of the statistical models of happiness that have been developed to date were built using individual-level microdata to make inferences about an individual-level relationship between happiness and a wide range of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. There are also several single-level studies comparing aggregate happiness levels between countries (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0160017611403737">Veenhoven 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that individuals live in households that reside within neighborhoods and communities, which in turn are nested within local authorities, regions, and countries, and it can be argued that the distribution of socioeconomic variables (e.g., regional unemployment rate, income and wealth inequality at the national level, or “social capital/social cohesion” related variables in the neighborhood) and happiness at different levels may be subject to the influences of grouping. For instance, it could be hypothesized that it is harder to be happy in a depressing than in an upbeat environment, irrespective of one’s personal attributes. Nevertheless, there have been very limited studies to date that attempt to take different levels (e.g., individual, household, socioeconomic grouping, neighborhood, district, nation) into account at the same time to test such a hypothesis. This article attempts to add a regional science perspective and a geographical dimension to existing happiness research by using multilevel modeling to determine the extent to which happy or unhappy people are found in similar places (compositional effects) or whether certain attributes of places cause its inhabitants to be happy or unhappy (contextual effects), and whether, having taken these factors into account, there is any remaining unobserved heterogeneity between places with respect to happiness.</p>
<p>The article is set out as follows. In the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? we briefly review the research that has been conducted so far on the determinants of happiness. We also briefly discuss relevant theoretical considerations and conceptual frameworks and we highlight the relative paucity of relevant empirical work in the field of regional science, critically reviewing some of the limited studies to date that attempted to explore the role of place and space. We then introduce multilevel models and discuss their key advantages as well as their suitability for adding a geographical dimension to happiness research. The section Data and Method presents the data, variables, and method that we used in order to build multilevel models of happiness and well-being in Britain, which are presented in the section Modeling Results. The section Discussion further discusses the results. The final section summarizes the findings, and offers some concluding comments.</p>

<title>Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem?</title>
<p>Over the past two decades there have been an increasing number of quantitative studies of happiness and well-being. In particular, there have been ongoing debates on whether happiness can be measured, whether it should be measured, how it should be measured and what are the factors affecting it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160017611403737">Diener 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160017611403737">Dolan, Peasgood, and White 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160017611403737">Easterlin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160017611403737">Frey and Stutzer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160017611403737">Layard 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160017611403737">Oswald 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0160017611403737">Sumner 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitative studies of happiness are typically based on some measurement of subjective well-being derived by survey questions such as: “Taking all things together would you say you are <italic>very happy</italic>, <italic>quite happy</italic>, or <italic>not very happy</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160017611403737">Dolan, Peasgood, and White 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160017611403737">Frey and Stutzer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160017611403737">Layard 2005</xref>). Although, there are critiques of the idea that happiness can be measured and compared between people, there is a growing amount of strong evidence in support of the validity of such measures (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160017611403737">Bray and Gunnell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160017611403737">Layard 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The proponents of the idea that happiness can and should be measured have provided over the years very useful statistical methodological frameworks, which are mainly based on multiple regression models. It can be argued that these frameworks have been very successful, as they typically address any limitations regarding the subjective nature of survey happiness data by introducing appropriate control variables and carrying out validity tests. There is a very large and rapidly growing social science and psychology literature based on such frameworks and reporting on the current understanding of what are the main demographic, socioeconomic, and contextual determinants of well-being. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160017611403737">Oswald (1997</xref>, 1823) summarizes: “Reported happiness is high among those who are married, on high income, women, whites, the well-educated, the self employed, the retired and those looking after the home.” There is a wide range of econometric studies investigating the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of happiness and well-being and there are numerous comprehensive reviews of this literature (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160017611403737">Argyle 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160017611403737">Dolan, Peasgood, and White 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160017611403737">Frey and Stutzer 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there have been very few empirical studies that are explicitly aimed at investigating the role of place and space with regards to happiness and well-being. Of particular importance and relevance are the early conceptual frameworks and empirical work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160017611403737">Cropper (1981)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160017611403737">Graves (1983)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0160017611403737">Roback (1982)</xref> that examined the relationship between wages, rents, and quality of life indicators as well as the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160017611403737">Hoehn, Berger, and Blomquist (1987)</xref> who demonstrate how amenity values can be estimated in an interregional context. These studies typically define individual well-being as a utility function of factors that can be measured (e.g., consumption, residential land, wages and rents, local amenities) and are assumed to be linked to the quality of life. Hoehn et al. (1987, 608) point out that, assuming constant-returns-to-scale technology and free mobility “an interregional equilibrium implies that firms cannot reduce their costs and individuals cannot improve their well-being by relocation.”</p>
<p>However, there has been very little research with a regional science or local area perspective that defines utility on the basis of subjective well-being and happiness data from social surveys, or in other words, by adding a regional dimension to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0160017611403737">Equation (1)</xref>. Amongst the notable exceptions are the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160017611403737">Luttmer (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611403737">Clark (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160017611403737">Powdthavee (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160017611403737">Morrison (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160017611403737">Brereton, Clinch, and Ferreira (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611403737">Oswald and Wu (2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160017611403737">2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160017611403737">Luttmer (2005)</xref> matched individual-level happiness data to information about average earnings in the US Public Use Microdata Areas to investigate whether individuals feel worse off when their neighbors earn more. He found that, on average, higher earnings of neighbors are associated with lower levels of self-reported well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611403737">Clark (2003)</xref> used data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to show that the well-being of unemployed people is strongly positively correlated with reference group unemployment at the regional and household level, suggesting that “unemployment hurts, but it hurts less when there are more unemployed people around” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611403737">Clark 2003</xref>, 346). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160017611403737">Powdthavee (2007)</xref> examined the role of social norms in the relationship between happiness and unemployment, using cross-sectional data in South Africa and also reported that unemployment appears to be less detrimental to happiness in regions where the rate of unemployment is high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160017611403737">Morrison (2007)</xref> used survey data for twelve locations in New Zealand and compared the subjective well-being of different areas and used single-level regression models to explore the extent to which “place” has an effect upon individual well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160017611403737">Brereton, Clinch, and Ferreira (2008)</xref> presented an even more geographically disaggregated analysis of well-being by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to explore the impact of location-specific factors upon life satisfaction and well-being in Ireland. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611403737">Oswald and Wu (2009)</xref> explored the geography of life satisfaction and mental health in the United States, drawing on a sample of over one million people collected under the auspices of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In particular, they fitted regression models to estimate levels of well-being across the states of America and they concluded that, after controlling for individual characteristics, the state of Louisiana and the District of Columbia have high levels of psychological well-being, whereas the states of California and West Virginia have low well-being. Like Hohen et al. (1987), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611403737">Oswald and Wu (2009)</xref> also point out that economic theory would predict that well-being should be the same in all regions. In particular, they suggest that, if we assume that there are sufficiently low mobility costs and accurate levels of information about what it would be like to live in another state, then individuals would be expected to keep moving into attractive places until these places become too congested and expensive to be desirable. This process would lead to equilibrium where utility would be the same in every location. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611403737">Oswald and Wu (2009)</xref> applied regression methods to BRFSS data to empirically test this theoretical proposition and they suggested that their results are consistent with a weak version of this theory, assuming subjective mental well-being can be seen as analogous to utility.</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, nearly all of the very few happiness and well-being studies that incorporated space in the analysis did so with the use of single-level econometric models that typically include a dummy variable for area (e.g., region, country, or state). It can be argued that although such modeling approaches have been very successful in adding a geographical dimension to happiness research, there are a number of conceptual and methodological issues pertaining to the role of space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160017611403737">Anselin and Griffith 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160017611403737">Haining 2009</xref>) as well as the nested structure of population survey microdata that need to be considered. More specifically, individuals are clustered within households, which in turn are clustered in houses, neighborhoods, cities, conurbations, and regions. Of particular relevance to the study of subjective happiness and well-being is that people living in the same household or neighborhood may be affected by the same local factors or that there may be a spatial and social interdependencies that are not addressed by conventional econometric models. For instance, it would be reasonable to assume that the happiness level of an individual is not independent from that of other members of the household or any other grouping to which the individual belongs (e.g., networks of friends and extended family, colleagues, geographical area, etc.). Such clustering of data means that the classical assumptions of independence that typically underpin single-level Ordinary Least Squares regression models may be violated. In addition, single-level regression models do not fully exploit the hierarchical nature of the secondary happiness data that are increasingly available and that can be utilized to provide more information about the role of geography at different spatial scales.</p>
<p>Methodological issues such as those described above can be addressed with the use of multilevel modeling techniques that have had a long successful history in analyzing data with inherent hierarchical structures and which are particularly suitable for the analysis of data with complex patterns of variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160017611403737">Goldstein 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160017611403737">Hox 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160017611403737">Rasbash and Browne 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160017611403737">Snijders and Bosker 1999</xref>). Multilevel models are also known as random coefficient models, random effects models, hierarchical linear models, and linear mixed models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160017611403737">Browne and Steele 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160017611403737">Raudesbush and Bryk 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160017611403737">Snijders and Bosker 1999</xref>). One of the key advantages of these models over the more conventional single-level models is that the estimated coefficients, and more importantly their standard errors, take into account clustering at various levels of the population structure. For example, and with regard to the subject matter of this article, the significance or otherwise of associations of explanatory variables with happiness and well-being outcomes can be properly tested for individuals in households in areas. In other words, the estimated coefficients are less likely to be biased due to population structure and grouping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160017611403737">Rasbash and Browne 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160017611403737">Snijders and Bosker 1999</xref>). A multilevel approach recognizes that people in the same household, district, or region are not independent of one another. Another key advantage of the approach is that it is possible to estimate different intercepts for different geographical (e.g., region, district, city) and group (e.g., household) levels and to also examine how these intercept estimates may be affected by the introduction of explanatory and control variables. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160017611403737">Rice and Jones (1997)</xref> point out, the primary focus is on the estimation of the magnitude of variances at different levels and how these variances relate to explanatory variables, in contrast to more conventional econometric approaches that view higher level effects as nuisance parameters that need to be conditioned or adjusted for to achieve desirable properties of fixed part parameters. By modeling higher level effects, endogeneity bias is avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160017611403737">Rice and Jones 1997</xref>). In addition, multilevel models can address potential issues of spatial heterogeneity by adopting a “random coefficients” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160017611403737">Snijders and Bosker 1999</xref>), assuming that the relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable(s) can be different in each level and/or geographical district. Therefore, and from a regional science perspective, it can be argued that multilevel models can address issues of spatial dependence and heterogeneity and therefore they can potentially complement existing more familiar spatial econometric techniques that have been successfully and extensively implemented to treat such geographical effects (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160017611403737">Anselin 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160017611403737">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160017611403737">Anselin and Rey 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160017611403737">Anselin et al. 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the above discussion, it is perhaps surprising that there has been limited engagement between the multilevel modeling and the spatial econometrics and regional science research communities. Multilevel modeling methods have had a long successful history of applications in the social sciences. Amongst the first applications were in the field of education and were aimed at assessing the extent to which variation in educational achievement is attributable to differences between schools (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160017611403737">Aitkin and Longford 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160017611403737">Nutall et al. 1989</xref>). Over the last couple of decades there has been widespread availability of specialist software packages and multilevel analysis has increasingly been applied in a wide range of fields. Of particular relevance to the research presented in this article are the arguments in favor of multilevel modeling approaches that have been articulated from a geographical perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160017611403737">Jones 1991</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160017611403737">Garner and Raudenbush (1991)</xref> applied multilevel modeling on survey microdata that were linked with area data from the 1981 Census of Population to test for neighborhood effects upon educational attainment. After controlling for a number of compositional factors such as pupil ability, family background, and school characteristics, they found that there was a significant negative relationship between deprivation in the home neighborhood and educational attainment. Another interesting and relevant application of multilevel modeling is in the area of housing economics and a good example of this type of work is a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160017611403737">Orford (2000)</xref> who explored spatial structures and interdependencies in local housing market dynamics, taking into account both the compositional nature of the housing stock as well as the contextual nature of urban space. In particular, using multilevel modeling, he convincingly demonstrated that the contextual nature of housing supply and demand needs to be explicitly addressed and he also highlights the implications and the importance of place desirability in determining house prices. Another major field of research into area-based effects is that of health. In a discussion of the potential of multilevel analysis in health economics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160017611403737">Rice and Jones (1997)</xref> argue that multilevel modeling is particularly suitable for the study of the role of geography and geographically based cultural influences in determining lifestyle behavior. Amongst the first multilevel studies that estimated area effects upon health are the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160017611403737">Congdon (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160017611403737">Carr-Hill et al. (1994)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160017611403737">Duncan, Jones, and Moon (1993)</xref>. Another pertinent study which is of particular relevance to the subject matter of this article is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160017611403737">Propper et al</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160017611403737"> (2005)</xref>, who examined the association between neighborhood-level variables and mental health disorders in Britain. Their multilevel modeling analysis suggested that individual and household-level characteristics and not place appear to be most important in terms of predicting mental health disorders.</p>
<p>In the light of the above discussion, it can be argued that there is considerable potential for further development of multilevel modeling applications in the field of regional science and the emergent field of happiness economics may be a particularly suitable application area given the arguments made above. The remainder of this article aims to make a contribution to that direction by combining datasets at the individual, regional, and geographical metropolitan district level with the use of a multilevel modeling framework that examines the variation in happiness and well-being at the individual, household, and area levels (district and region) simultaneously.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The aim of the research presented here is to specify a multilevel model that will help us understand the nature and extent of variations in happiness and well-being at different levels. As noted in the previous section, there is a need for more empirical work on the contextual influences upon happiness and the spatial scale at which such influences may operate. A number of separate scales can be identified and ideally, we would like to have information on all the variables that appear to have a relationship with happiness, as discussed in the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? for all possible levels, in order to test the extent to which variations in happiness can be explained by contextual and compositional factors. For instance, it could be argued that an ideal situation would be to have measurements of happiness (dependent variable) and socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental independent variables that would allow the analysis of the variation in happiness at a wide range of spatial scales at which statistical information is routinely collected, ranging from the individual to neighborhood, local labor market area, region, and nation.</p>
<p>Although there are ongoing considerable efforts to build comprehensive databases of happiness worldwide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0160017611403737">Veenhoven 2007</xref>), there are currently very few sources of happiness data at small geographical scales in most countries. For instance, in Britain, the finest geographical scale for which happiness survey data are available is the “metropolitan district” as defined for the release of the 1991 Census Samples of Anonymised Records (SARs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160017611403737">1</xref></sup> Thus, in the context of the research described in this article, we had at our disposal individual and household microdata from the BHPS and aggregate small area statistics data from the UK Census of Population for only four of the above levels: individual, household, SAR district, and region. We used data from the first wave of the BHPS data which were collected in 1991, to ensure a good correspondence with the small area data from the census (also taken in 1991). The BHPS is a national annual survey of the adult population of the United Kingdom, drawn from a representative sample of over 5,000 households. The latter is a multistage sample with a similar design and sample frame to that used by large government surveys in Britain, and collects information on a wide range of variables covering most aspects of life in Britain, including subjective well-being and happiness questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0160017611403737">Taylor et al. 2001</xref>). In the context of the research presented here, we used the first wave of the BHPS (1991) to analyze data on subjective happiness and its possible determinants at the individual and household levels. In addition, we made use of data on additional possible determinants at the SAR district and region levels from the 1991 UK Census of population. The latter provides the most authoritative social accounting of people and housing in Britain and is a unique source of data for the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160017611403737">Dale and Marsh 1993</xref>). All variables that we considered at different levels are listed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0160017611403737">Appendix</xref>. These include the subjective well-being questions (AHLGHWQ1, AHLGHWQ2) that were based on the responses to twelve questions that make up the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), which was originally developed as a screening instrument for psychiatric illness but are also commonly used as an indicator of subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160017611403737">Cox et al. 1987</xref>).

<p>Responses are made on a four-point frequency scale of feeling in relation to a person’s usual state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0160017611403737">Taylor et al. 2001</xref>). In the study presented here, we used the responses to the twelfth question (known as “GHQL: General Happiness”). We also used the HLGHQ1 measure of subjective well-being which amalgamates the answers to the above questions to a single scale by recoding so that the scale for individual variables runs from 0 to 3 instead of 1 to 4 and then summing, giving a scale running from 0 (the least distressed) to 36 (the most distressed). This measure has been used before in multilevel studies of mental health in the United Kingdom. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160017611403737">Propper et al</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160017611403737"> (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160017611403737">Hauck and Rice (2004)</xref> both used it as a continuous variable in their studies. In addition, the responses to the General Happiness Question (GHQL—Question 12 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160017611403737">Table 1</xref>) have been used in happiness studies (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160017611403737">Ballas and Dorling 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160017611403737">Clark and Oswald 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The datasets described above were all merged in a single microdata file, which was then analyzed in the specialized multilevel modeling software package MLwiN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0160017611403737">Rasbash et al. 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160017611403737">2</xref></sup> We fitted models of well-being and happiness, using the HLGHQ1 measure described above, as well as the GHQL general happiness measure (see Question 12 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160017611403737">Table 1</xref>). Both happiness measures were treated as continuous variables and were standardized along with all the continuous variables in the dataset. We also multiplied both dependent variables by –1, to reverse the direction of the responses so that we could have proxy measures of <italic>positive</italic> subjective well-being and happiness. In addition, some of the variables described in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0160017611403737">Appendix</xref> were used to derive interaction terms in order to capture better possible contextual influences. For instance, for each record in the dataset, district-level unemployment rates from the Census were multiplied by unemployment status (taking a value of 1 if the individual is unemployed and 0 in all other cases) at the individual level to create an unemployment interaction variable. So the value of such an interaction variable for an unemployed person living in the metropolitan SAR area of Bracknell Forest; Slough (district unemployment rate according to the 1991 Census: 8.17%) is 8.17 whereas the value for all individuals who are not unemployed is zero. Similar interaction terms were considered in our model for the following variables: employment status, tenure, social class status, age-groups, and number of cars. An additional derived variable was the coefficient of variation of unemployment rates between Enumeration Districts within each metropolitan district, to get a proxy measure of the stability, or otherwise, of unemployment rates at a more localized geographical scale within the district. In order to calculate this variable, we obtained unemployment data from the 1991 Census Small Area Statistics.</p>

<sec id="section5-0160017611403737">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The dataset that we created comprises four levels of observations. As noted in the previous section, multilevel modeling can account for the interdependence of happiness observations at different levels by partitioning the total variance into different components of variation due to various levels in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160017611403737">Goldstein 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160017611403737">Hox 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160017611403737">Snijders and Bosker 1999</xref>). In particular, this approach can be used to ask whether levels of happiness among individuals in Britain reflect different characteristics of residents in different districts, regions, and areas (compositional effects) or whether there are environmental or other factors (e.g., social capital and cohesion, socioeconomic inequality) of places that cause their inhabitants to be happy or unhappy (contextual effects). Multilevel modeling approaches have the additional advantage of statistical efficiency over more conventional fixed effects approaches that incorporate different levels and spatial units with the use of dummy variables, especially in the case of the data on over 5,000 households in 162 metropolitan districts that we had at our disposal.</p>
<p>As noted in the previous subsection, our dependent subjective well-being and happiness variables were treated as continuous variables and we employed linear models (instead of an ordered probit approach that was also considered) for simplicity, and in order to maintain comparability with some of the relevant studies reviewed above (e.g., the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160017611403737">Propper et al. 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611403737">Oswald and Wu 2009</xref> who also adopted a linear modeling approach treating the dependent variable as a continuous variable<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160017611403737">3</xref></sup>). The sample that we used comprised 9,602 individuals, nested in 5,363 households in 162 districts in eighteen regions. First, we fitted variance component models of happiness<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160017611403737">5</xref></sup> (the so called “null” or “empty” models) with no explanatory variables for four nested levels: region (indexed by <italic>l</italic>); district (indexed by <italic>k</italic>); household (indexed by <italic>j</italic>); individual (indexed by <italic>i</italic>):<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0160017611403737">

</inline-formula> measures happiness between individuals. We also fitted a three-level model (district, household, and individual) where we omitted the region level, for reasons we explain below.</p>
<p>A standard assumption in multilevel modeling is that of independence of the error terms for the different levels. Because we assume the random effects are uncorrelated, these four components sum to the total variation in happiness. In other words, the variance in happiness and well-being can then be partitioned into individual, household, and area levels. It can also be argued that this assumption is particularly reasonable with regards to happiness as it enables us to address questions such as: what are the factors that influence different types of individuals' happiness? Is the source of happiness or unhappiness purely personal or do contextual factors matter (and if they do, to what extent)? Is where one lives a predictor of happiness and to what extent and why? To what extent is happiness attributable to individual, household area characteristics? (or any other grouping). If the multilevel models reveal no significant variation at the district or regional level, this would imply that there are no geographical influences on happiness at these scales of geography, based on the data used in the analysis, and that any geographical variation is due to individual or household characteristics and behaviors. It is also possible to include cross-level interaction terms to explore links between individuals and areas in a meaningful way. In the context of the research presented here, we explored the impact of such interaction terms for unemployment, housing tenure, and socioeconomic grouping (see Model 4 below).</p>
<p>On the basis of our multilevel models, we were able to estimate the proportion of the overall variation in happiness and well-being that is attributable to households, districts, and regions, that is, the intraclass correlation. We then systematically introduced a number of explanatory variables at different levels (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0160017611403737">Appendix</xref>), the selection of which was based on theoretical considerations informed by past happiness research that was briefly reviewed in the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? We only considered random intercept models, assuming that the relationship between the explanatory variables and happiness is the same in all districts and all households, but that there is a different intercept for each level.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the second column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160017611403737">Table 2</xref>, the estimated variance of the well-being measure at the regional level is very small and its standard error is equal to its value. The intraregion correlation of the same measure is also very small (0.21 percent). In addition, the estimated intradistrict and intrahousehold correlations (×100) are 0.73 and 14.63, respectively and the remaining variation is at the individual level. Looking at the three-level model, we can see that the intradistrict variation (×100) is 0.94, which is actually the sum of the intraregion and intradistrict estimated variations in the four-level model. Turning to the estimated variance of the general happiness GHQL measure (columns 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Table 3</xref>
), we see that the intraregion and intradistrict correlation (×100) is zero and therefore all the variation is attributable to household (8.11) and individual (91.89) levels.</p>

<p>Given the very small variation at the regional level for both of the above measures when fitted as continuous responses, we decided to focus the remainder of the analysis in this article on the district, household, and individual level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160017611403737">5</xref></sup> The remainder of this section shows the impact of explanatory variables to the variations at the different levels, when continuous responses are assumed for both happiness and well-being. In particular, it presents and discusses a number of alternative models that explore the impact of individual-, household-, and district-level variables as well as of some interaction terms upon well-being and happiness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160017611403737">
<title>Model 2: Socioeconomic/Health Characteristics</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Table 3</xref> gives the results of two models of estimated fixed effects of a number of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related individual and household-level covariates of well-being and happiness.</p>
<p>As can be seen, the following variables have significant negative main effects on happiness and well-being: age, gender (females tend to be on average less happy than males), health status, unemployment, being a family carer, and being sick or disabled. Also, commuting times seem to have a negative but not significant effect on well-being and happiness in this model. On the other hand, being in a relationship without children seems to have a positive significant effect on both measures (when compared with being single).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that according to this model sample respondents who lived in their current address for more than five years reported higher than average well-being compared with individuals who lived in their current address for less than a year. In particular, this variable has a positive significant coefficient for the well-being measure and a positive but not significant value for general happiness. This result suggests that a person that may feel better about themselves when they have lived at their current address for a relatively long time and have perhaps developed good local social networks, and for some people will be associated with financial and employment stability. In addition, living in a “lone parent household with dependent children” has a significant negative main effect on the well-being measure but not on happiness. In contrast, being in any “other household type” has a significant positive effect on the happiness score but not on well-being. Individuals who live in households that rent their accommodation privately or from a local authority or housing association report lower well-being compared to owner occupiers. However, this variable does not have a significant impact on the general happiness measure.</p>
<p>The results described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Table 3</xref> are generally consistent with the findings of previous studies. It is also interesting at this stage to see what happens to the components of variation at the district, household, and individual levels, after the inclusion in the model of the explanatory variables listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Table 3</xref>. The last three rows of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Table 3</xref> report these variance component estimates. As can be seen by comparing these values with the respective values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160017611403737">Table 2</xref>, the intraclass correlation at the district level is reduced considerably for the well-being variable after the introduction of the Model 2 explanatory variables. In addition, the intraclass correlation at the household level is reduced for both the well-being and happiness measures and respectively increased at the individual level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0160017611403737">
<title>Model 3: Social Context—Interaction Variables</title>
<p>The next step in the analysis was to further investigate the importance of context in determining individual happiness by adding some interaction terms to Model 2. As noted in the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? there have been very few studies to date that have explicitly modeled the effect of contextual variables on happiness and well-being. We can investigate such effects by producing contextual and cross-level interaction variables. Amongst the key contextual variables that are thought to be very important are income and wealth and measures of inequality at different geographical levels. However, there are generally very few data sources on income and wealth at local levels, which makes the multilevel analysis of social comparisons difficult. Among the notable exceptions is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160017611403737">Luttmer’s (2005)</xref> work, briefly reviewed in the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? according to which individuals feel worse off when others around them earn more and that, on average, higher earnings of neighbors are associated with lower levels of self-reported well-being. Another variable that has been examined in terms of its contextual effects is unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611403737">Clark 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160017611403737">Powdthavee 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of the research presented here, we had information on income at the individual and household level but not at district level, as income is not measured by the UK Census of Population. Nevertheless, we did have information on unemployment at all levels. We also had other variables available at all levels that could be used as proxies for income and wealth, such as tenure, number of cars, and socioeconomic groupings. Hence, by combining data from the census and the BHPS (also see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0160017611403737">Appendix</xref>), we computed interaction terms that could be used in the models to give some insights into the importance of social comparisons at all levels.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0160017611403737">Table 4</xref>
gives the results of the models of estimated fixed effects of all the individual and household covariates that were included in Model 2, as well as cross-level interaction terms for the following variables: unemployment, tenure status, social class.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that most of the variables that had a significant positive or negative impact on well-being and happiness in Model 2, also have similar significant impacts in Model 3, with the exception of the employment status variables “family care” and being “sick/disabled” (with “employed/self employed” as the reference category) which do not have a significant impact on either measure in Model 3. In addition, the coefficient of the household-level variable “couple no children” has a significant positive value for the happiness measure (as it was also the case in Model 2) but not for well-being. Also, there are important changes to the coefficient values of the household-level variables pertaining to housing tenure (with “owner occupier” as the reference group): the value of the coefficient for “social housing” is not significant for either variable in Model 3 (it had a negative significant effect on well-being in Model 2), whereas the variable “private renting” has a positive significant impact on happiness in Model 3.</p>
<p>Turning to the interaction terms that were introduced in Model 3, the unemployment interaction term has a significant positive effect on both well-being and happiness. This finding is consistent with some of the studies reviewed in the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611403737">Clark 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160017611403737">Powdthavee 2007</xref>). However, the remainder of the interaction terms that were introduced in Model 3 do not seem to have a significant effect on well-being and happiness.</p>
<p>The introduction of the interaction terms led to a decrease of the percentage of variation in well-being that is attributable to district level and household level (see last three rows of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0160017611403737">Table 4</xref>). In particular, the intraclass correlation (×100) at the district level in Model 3 is 0.28 compared with 0.37 in Model 2. Likewise, the intraclass correlation (×100) at household level drops from 12.35 in Model 2 to 9.66 in Model 3, leading to an increase in the individual-level variation estimate. Turning to the variance component estimates for the happiness measure, we can see that the district-level intraclass correlation remains zero, whereas the household- and individual-level variance component estimate slightly decrease and increase, respectively, in comparison to Model 2.</p>

<sec id="section10-0160017611403737">
<title>Model 4: Proxies for Localized Scales</title>
<p>As district is the smallest geographical scale available on BHPS data, we tried to proxy for smaller geographical areas by including a coefficient of enumeration-district-level variation within each district for two key variables related to happiness: unemployment and housing tenure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0160017611403737">Table 5</xref>
reports the estimated fixed effects of all the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related individual- and household-level covariates of well-being and general happiness that were included in Model 2 as well as the fixed effects of the variation between enumeration districts for unemployment rate and tenure type. As can be seen by comparing <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0160017611403737">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">3</xref>, all individual-level variables that have a significant effect on happiness and well-being in Model 2 are also significant in Model 4. However, the variable “university degree” has a significant positive effect on the “general happiness” measure in Model 4, whereas it has no significant effect on either measure in Models 2 and 3. In addition, there are differences in the coefficients of the household-level variables. In particular, the household-type variable “couple no children” has a significant effect upon the “general happiness” measure in Model 4 but not on well-being (this variable has a significant positive effect on both measures in Model 2 and on the well-being measure but not the happiness measure in Model 3). In addition, the household-type variable “lone parent with non dependent child(ren)” has a significant negative effect on the happiness measure in Model 4, whereas it has no significant effect on either measure in Models 2 and 3.</p>

<p>The coefficients of the variables that we used as “proxies” for localized scale do not seem to have a significant effect upon well-being. Nevertheless, the unemployment proxy (individual-level unemployment status dummy variable × census enumeration district unemployment rate variation) has a positive significant impact upon happiness, which means that an unemployed individual is on average happier in districts that contain more Enumeration District (ED)–level variation in the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Looking at the variance component estimates (last three rows in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0160017611403737">Table 5</xref>), the intraclass correlation values are similar to those of Model 2. In particular, the intraclass correlation ×100 of the well-being measure at the district-, household-, and individual-level is 0.37, 12.22, and 87.41, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss the results presented above in more detail, highlighting some of the key findings. It can be argued that most of the analysis of individual- and household-level socioeconomic and demographic variables that was presented above is consistent with previous research on the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of happiness and well-being <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0160017611403737">Table 6</xref>
provides a list of all variables that had significant positive or negative effect upon the well-being or happiness. It can be argued that the most influential variables in terms of impact on subjective well-being and happiness are health status and unemployment at the individual level. These variables have a consistently high (in terms of the mean value of their coefficient across models) and significant negative impact upon both subjective happiness and well-being in all models with explanatory variables</p>

<p>It is also interesting to discuss in more detail the variables whose impact has not been examined in great detail by happiness studies to date, such as the “length of time in current address,” “household tenure status” and, because of our multilevel approach, the interactions between individual-, household-, and district-level variables. According to our models, the length of time at current address (variable “has lived more than five years in current address”) has a positive significant effect upon the well-being measure in all of our models. It can be argued that this is likely to be associated with the extent of individuals' social and support networks and is consistent with relevant research highlighting the importance of social capital, social well-being, and local community networks to our quality of life (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160017611403737">Keyes 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0160017611403737">Putnam 2000</xref>). It can also be argued that this finding highlights the need to better understand the geographical dimensions (and possibilities of measurement) of concepts such as “trust,” “social cohesion,” “social fragmentation,” “belonging,” and “social well-being” at the local level.</p>
<p>Looking at the household tenure variables, it is interesting to note that the variable “private renting” seems to have a positive effect on happiness in Model 3 but not in the other two models, whereas the variable “Local Authority/Housing Association renting” has a negative impact on well-being in Models 2 and 4.</p>
<p>Some of the interaction terms that we introduced in Models 3 and 4 that have also not been examined in detail by other studies seem to have a significant impact on happiness and well-being. In particular, the “individual unemployment status × district” level variable that was introduced in Model 3 has a significant positive impact upon both well-being and happiness and this corroborates the research findings of the limited number of studies that have looked so far at such interactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611403737">Clark 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160017611403737">Powdthavee 2007</xref>). In addition, the interaction term “individual unemployment status × Census enumeration district unemployment rate variation” that was introduced in Model 4 has a significant positive effect on the happiness measure but not on well-being.</p>
<p>The model results presented in the previous section suggest that there is variation in happiness and well-being at different levels which can be captured and quantified with the use of multilevel modeling techniques. Comparing <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160017611403737">Table 2</xref> with the last three rows of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Tables 3</xref>–5, there is some variation of the well-being measure (HLGHQ1) at the individual, household, and district levels, which can be quantified in the form of the variance component estimates reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160017611403737">Tables 2</xref>–5. These results can be used to answer the question posed in the title of this article, asking if we can talk about happy people, happy households, or happy places, or in other words, to what extent happiness and well-being may be attributable to the individual, household, or geographical district level. According to our analysis, most of the variation in the measures of well-being and general happiness is attributable to the individual level. However, some of the variation in both measures is attributable to the household level and a very small proportion of the variation of the well-being measure is attributable to the district level, whereas the variation in the happiness measure attributable to the district level is zero, according to the data and analysis presented here. Also, it should be noted that some of the variation at different levels cannot be explained by the variables that were included in the models.</p>
<p>As expected, the variation of well-being that is attributable to district and household levels is reduced with the introduction of explanatory and control variables. The 95 percent confidence intervals of the district-level residuals all include zero and therefore none of the district level subjective well-being values are significantly higher or lower than the national average. This suggests that the differences in well-being between districts can all be attributed to the explanatory variables included in Model 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611403737">Table 3</xref>). The same conclusion also applies with regards to Models 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Although the differences in subjective well-being between places are not statistically significant after the inclusion of explanatory variables, it can be argued that the above analysis demonstrates the extent to which average well-being in an area can be attributed to people or the place, or in other words to the characteristics of its inhabitants (compositional effects) or whether it is something about the place that has a positive or negative influence upon individual well-being (contextual effects). The analysis of the data that we had at our disposal suggests that well-being varies between people but not places. However, such analysis would be particularly interesting if repeated for more localized scale areas, or for the same scale areas but with larger sample sizes, which could result in the considerable narrowing of the confidence intervals. Nevertheless, there is generally a paucity of subjective well-being and happiness data at more localized scale, with a few exceptions (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160017611403737">Clark, Kristensen, and Westergård-Nielsen 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>From a regional science perspective, if we assume that our subjective happiness and well-being measures can be seen as a suitable substitute for utility then our modeling results are consistent with the predictions of economic theory that we discussed in the section Measuring Subjective Happiness and its Determinants: A Multilevel Problem? (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611403737">Oswald and Wu 2009</xref>). In particular, it could be argued that happiness and well-being should be expected to be the same in all regions and districts, because individuals would be expected to migrate to places that are deemed to be more desirable and attractive until enough people move so that they become congested and too expensive, leading to a state of equilibrium. Nevertheless, it should be reiterated that the lack of statistical significance with regards to the role of place at the district level may be due to issues of small sample size.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Further Work</title>
<p>The work presented in this article adds a geographical and multilevel dimension to the existing and rapidly growing body of interdisciplinary happiness research by adopting and implementing a multilevel approach to the modeling of the determinants of happiness and well-being. It is hoped that this article highlights the role that regional scientists can play in happiness research and that it will stimulate debate about the importance of taking space and place into account when modeling subjective happiness and well-being. Also, the research presented here demonstrates the relevance of multilevel models to regional science and it is hoped that it will lead to a more systematic discussion and engagement between the regional science and multilevel modeling community.</p>
<p>The methodological framework that we presented may be very useful for the analysis of local policy outcomes and it could also inform local debates on issues such as social cohesion and deprivation as well as the provision of green-spaces and the geographical allocation and extent of geographical features that may be affecting happiness and local well-being. Our analysis, that took into account of both personal characteristics and where people live in Britain, suggests that: happiness varies mostly by people and that once the characteristics of the people living in the areas are accounted for, area differences in happiness are not statistically significant, or in other words and in response to the question posed in the title of this article, it is “people” and not “place,” or at least certainly not place at the district scale. Having said that, it is interesting to note that the “length of time in current address” which was included in our models had a positive and significant effect on subjective well-being.</p>
<p>The article has demonstrated that multilevel modeling techniques are particularly suitable for the analysis of happiness and well-being on data from different sources. In particular, we combined geographical data from the UK Census of Population with BHPS data in order to build a dataset that contained information on happiness and well-being at the individual level as well as a wide range of socioeconomic and demographic variables at the individual, household, district, and regional level. These models were then used to examine the variation of happiness at all levels simultaneously as well as to determine the extent to which different explanatory variables may be affecting this variation. A lot of the analysis presented in this article corroborates the findings of past research on the determinants of happiness. In addition, there are some interesting findings regarding explanatory variables that have not been examined in detail by past studies, such as the “individual/household × district level” interaction variables introduced in two of our models as well as the “length of time in current address,” which is likely to be associated with the extent of individuals' social and support networks.</p>
<p>As is the case with most happiness research studies to date, the methodological framework and the findings presented in this article can be used to inform public policy. In particular, to identify the extent to which the quality of life and well-being in an area is attributed to the characteristics of its inhabitants or to some contextual aspect, such as the built environment, lack of green spaces, crime rates, as well as issues pertaining to the distribution of an individual attribute, such as social and spatial inequalities in income, wealth, and consumption patterns.</p>
<p>A possible interesting extension to the methodological framework presented here would be to fit “random slopes” models which assume that the relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable can be different in each level and to some extent could address issues of spatial heterogeneity. For instance, in the context of the research method and data, we could assume that the relationship between income and happiness and well-being can be different in each geographical district. However, given that the extent of district-level variation is relatively low, this may be a limited exercise.</p>
<p>The cause–effect relationship in happiness equations is not entirely clear (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160017611403737">Oswald 2007</xref>) and there is a possibility that the endogeneity of some of the regressors may have considerable effects on the measured variation at individual and household levels. This issue could be explored further, possibly by exploiting the longitudinal nature of data such as the BHPS, using appropriate multilevel models for change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0160017611403737">Singer and Willet 2003</xref>) in order to investigate cause–effect relationships as well as the within individual change as well as interindividual differences over time.</p>
