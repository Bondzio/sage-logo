<attrib>(Mark 7: 8)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>At the football match on Saturday one of the players made the sign of a cross as he ran onto the field, a momentary gesture but a universally recognised sign of religious reverence. Meanwhile the woman you see on your way to work every morning always wears a veil, another heavily bearded man has his hair tied up in a scarf and soon some of your office colleagues will choose not to eat or drink anything during the hours of daylight.</p>
<p>And one of the things these varied actions demonstrate is that even in 2012 the power of symbol, ritual and tradition remains including the signs and gestures of religious tradition and symbolism.</p>
<p>This is something for the church to welcome.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Baroness Warsi, the first Moslem woman to become a cabinet minister, led a government delegation to the Vatican. Her visit followed Pope Benedict’s visit to Britain in 2010 when during his address at Westminster Hall he spoke about the public role of Christian faith.</p>
<p>Baroness Varsi used her two day Vatican visit to express her conviction that religious belief has an important contribution to make in public life and policymaking and her concern that in Britain the religious voice was under threat from a form of militant secularism intent in pushing all religious belief to the sidelines.</p>
<p>Some weeks earlier it had been widely reported that a judge had banned prayers from the beginning of a town council meeting. In fact the judge, Justice Ouseley, did not ban prayers from the council meeting but ruled that it was unlawful for Bideford Council to include prayers as part of the agenda for their meetings.</p>
<p>The legal niceties of the ruling aside, Baroness Warsi’s concern is surely well founded and there is no doubt that the aggressive atheism promoted by such as the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and the National Secular Society seeks to reduce religious belief to the private sphere and deny it any public voice or contribution.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I am not calling for some kind of 21</italic><sup><italic>st</italic></sup> <italic>century theocracy, Warsi said. Religious faith and its followers do not have the only answer. There will be times when politicians and faith leaders will disagree. My concern is when secularization is pushed to the extreme, when it requites the complete removal of faith from the public sphere.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524612448039">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Paradoxically then if the continuing importance of religious ritual and symbolism is something for the church to welcome, St Mark reveals that one of the important points of conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees was over this very issue of symbol, ritual and tradition.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>So the Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked Jesus, Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with unclean hands?</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524612448039">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based around the ten commandments and the law given to Moses by God, what is described as the <italic>tradtion of the elders</italic> gave shape and substance to the public as well as the private life and faith of ancient Israel. Intended to nurture Israel’s spiritual health and wellbeing the tradition had been developed over several centuries and comprised a commentary on how the law should be interpreted and applied to all sorts of situations and circumstances.</p>
<p>It resulted in an oral tradition of thousands of little rules and regulations covering every possible situation including meal times and the ritual washing of hands. Although it had nothing to do with hygiene as people didn’t know about germs in these days, such hand washing had everything to do with cleanliness, that is, religious cleanliness.</p>
<p>Before every meal, and between each course of the meal, the hands had to be washed and washed in a certain way, fingers pointing up, fingers pointing down, each hand cleaned with the fist of the other. And the water for such ritual washing had to be kept in special large stone jars used only for the purpose.</p>
<p>(You will recall it was water from such stone jars that Jesus turned into wine at the wedding in Cana of Galilee.)</p>
<p>In failing to wash their hands in the prescribed way the Pharisees came to the conclusion that Jesus and his disciples were not just being disrespectful to their host, they were being disrespectful to the tradition of their elders and thus to God. Such uncleanliness was a serious matter since from their perspective observing the tradition of the elders provided the basis of what it meant to serve and please God.</p>
<p>So what did Jesus do?</p>
<p>In responding to their complaint Jesus did as he often did, he turned the table upon his accusers and citing the prophet Isaiah said that simple ritual was meaningless unless the action came from the heart.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>These people come near to me with their mouth and honour me with their lips but their hearts are far from me.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524612448039">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here is a gospel to keep you on the edge of your seat, its truth so close to home, because could you claim with confidence that your way of life, your actions and motivations would stand up to close scrutiny?</p>
<p>Whether at home with your family, in the company of your neighbours or friends, at work with your colleagues are you always as honest and reliable, as helpful, considerate, forgiving and compassionate as you should be................or better, as Christ would want you to be?</p>
<p>If the glory of Christian faith is our belief in one who, as the Americans might put it, not only talked the talk but walked the walk, and who reaches out to catch us when we fall, then the folly of faith is to identify Christianity with outward observance.</p>
<p>Of course attending church, reading your Bible, saying your prayers, caring for your neighbour and giving to charity are all the kind of activities any minister or congregation would encourage but Jesus says none of them is worth one iota unless it comes from the heart and is offered in love.</p>
<p>Although they are given a bad press in the gospels, the Pharisees were in fact intelligent and honourable people. Developed over several centuries, the tradition of the elders, the oral law to which they referred, sought to spell out as clearly as possible what obedience to the law and commandments entailed.</p>
<p>What the Pharisees were trying to do was to sanctify the whole of life and that is surely something we desire too, the very concern expressed by Baroness Warsi during her Rome visit, of seeking to be faithful to God’s presence and purpose in every part of life, private and personal as well as public and political.</p>
<p>One of the questions raised by this gospel is this; who speaks for God today modelling a way of life which honours the One who established a covenant with ancient Israel and whose Word was made flesh in Jesus of Nazareth?</p>
<p>In refusing to wash his hands in the prescribed way, Jesus wasn’t setting scripture against tradition, instead he was letting his ministry challenge the basis on which the Pharisees had established their ancient code.</p>
<p>If it was true that through his ministry of teaching, preaching, healing, eating with outcasts and sinners and forgiving sin that the kingdom of God was near, then it was not religious gesture, the ritual washing of hands that mattered, what mattered was his way of sacrificial service and generous love.</p>
<p>Of course religious symbolism and ritual continues to have its place but hearing this text today perhaps the deeper insight is the recognition that you don’t need to cross yourself to secure God’s blessing because in Christ you have been given it already.</p>
<p>If however you want to honour that blessing then feed the hungry, welcome the stranger, pray for your enemy and love your neighbour and you will discover to your joy that you have become a blessing to others and to God.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Now unto him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end, Amen.</italic></bold></p>
