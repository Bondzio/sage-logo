<p><italic>Background</italic>: Despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics, peristomal infection is the most common complication of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). A new glycerin hydrogel (GHG) wound dressing has been proposed to possess more effective antimicrobial properties but has not been tested in a larger trial. The aim of the study was therefore to assess the superiority of GHG regarding the incidence of peristomal wound infections during a 30-day postprocedure follow-up. <italic>Methods</italic>: Sixty-eight patients with cancer undergoing PEG were recruited from 1 university and 2 general hospitals between January 2007 and December 2008. Patients were randomized to group 1 (34 patients), which received GHG, or group 2 (34 patients), which received a traditional wound dressing. Dressing changes were done at day 1 and weeks 1, 2, and 4 (group 1) vs daily changes during week 1 and at weeks 2 and 4 (group 2). The PEG site was assessed by using 2 different infection scores. <italic>Results</italic>: At the end of the first and second weeks, a statistically significant reduction of the mean infection scores was seen in patients with GHG wound dressings (first week: 1.64 ± 1.6 vs 3.12 ± 2.69, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .008; second week: 1.37 ± 1.11 vs 2.53 ± 2.37, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .02). After 7 days, wound reactions occurred in 14.7% in the GHG group vs 47.05% in the traditional group (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.005). The GHG wound dressing required 5 times less frequent dressing changes. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: The GHG wound dressing significantly reduces peristomal wound infections and is a convenient, cost-effective alternative for wound management following PEG.</p>

<body>
<p>Peristomal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site infection is the most common postprocedural complication. Despite prophylactic antibiotics, the routinely performed pull-type endoscopic PEG placement technique has been associated with high rates of peristomal infectious complications (3%–30%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444536">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444536">2</xref></sup> A new glycerin hydrogel wound dressing (Sondofix; Medi-Globe GmbH, Schweinfurt, Germany) has been proposed to possess more effective antimicrobial properties than dry dressings. It can remain in place for up to 7 days, eliminating the need for a daily change of dressings of the PEG wound. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using glycerin hydrogel (GHG) dressings on the occurrence of peristomal infections (primary end point) and the frequency of changing wound dressing compared with traditional wound dressings (secondary end point).</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Sixty-eight patients with cancer undergoing PEG were prospectively evaluated from January 2007 to December 2008. At each participating center, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the GHG wound dressing (group 1) or a traditional wound dressing (dry gauze and adhesive breathable dressing, group 2) based on a central computer-generated randomization scheme. PEG placement was performed in the endoscopy room by 2 experienced gastroenterologists and 1 nurse. Patients were sedated and monitored during the procedure using pulse oximetry as well as blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes. One physician performed the endoscopy; the other performed the PEG placement under sterile conditions. After positive transillumination (diaphanoscopy), the insertion site was sterilized using disinfectant spray. PEG placement was performed in all cases using a 15-French gauge gastrostomy tube (Freka PEG Standard; Fresenius, Bad Homburg v.d.H., Germany) by the previously described sterile pull-through technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444536">3</xref></sup> The external bumper was fixed firmly, but not too tight, to prevent external tissue damage. No prophylactic antibiotic therapy was applied, in accordance with European treatment guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444536">2</xref></sup> The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Goethe University Hospital in Frankfurt (protocol number 157/06). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before entering the study. The study has been registered under DRK S00000770 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drks.de">www.drks.de</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>SondoFix (Medi-Globe GmbH) is a triangular glycogel wound dressing, equipped with a precut slit that facilitates its easy fixation around the PEG catheter. A hypoallergenic, transparent, and cushioned plaster is gelled, allowing easy application and wound inspection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612444536">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Patient Follow-Up</title>
<p>Enteral feeding was started within 4–6 hours of the procedure, and patients were followed up by the nutrition support team (NST). The dressing was changed after PEG placement weekly from weeks 1–4 in the GHG group (group 1) and renewed daily during week 1 and at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in the traditional dressing group (group 2) according to guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444536">2</xref></sup> In both groups, leakage or soiling prompted immediate dressing change. Wound assessment was independently made by 2 members of the NST, and the average of the score was used for analysis. The peristomal wound was inspected and assessed for wound reaction on the day after the procedure and subsequently 1, 2, and 4 weeks postprocedure using validated wound scoring systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444536">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444536">5</xref></sup> The peristomal infection score was calculated by summing up individual scores for local erythema, induration, and exsudation, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612444536">Table 1</xref>. In addition, another infection score (grades of peristomal wound reaction) for each patient was calculated (as per Gossner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444536">5</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612444536">Table 2</xref>) to stratify infections into 5 grades (I–V) of wound reaction. Culture swabs were collected from patients with grade III wound reaction or those with purulent secretions. For those patients who were released from the hospital within the first 7 days following the PEG procedure, the condition of the wounds was checked on an outpatient basis.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Patient characteristics were summarized by the mean (SD) presented or the median and interquartile range (IQR). The Fisher exact test was used to compare the basic characteristics and also the occurrence of peristomal infections. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for comparison of continuous data. For every patient, the maximum value of each of the 3 parameters of peristomal wound reaction was determined during the 7-day postprocedure period. Then, for each of these parameters, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test compared the mean of the maximum scores in the 2 groups to detect differences between groups. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were taken as significant. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Version 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA) and Sigma Plot (Systat Software, Inc, San Jose, CA).</p>

<p>One of the patients with traditional wound dressing developed a major peristomal infection. The wound dressing of 4 patients in the GHG group had to be removed ahead of time: in 3 cases due to excessive wound secretion and in 1 case due to a mild local allergic reaction that seemed to be caused by the gel. The patient with the local allergic reaction recovered without sequelae after removal of the GHG dressing. Three patients in the GHG group died due to their underlying disease.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Peristomal wound infection is the most common complication of PEG. The likelihood of wound infection is the result of bacterial load at the stomal site, virulence of the organisms, and patient susceptibility factors. Stomal infections mostly derive from the patient’s own skin and/or oropharyngeal flora. The high variation in infection rates indicated in several literature reports, from 3%–50%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444536">1</xref></sup> is caused by differences in PEG site infection scores, duration of the study period, postoperative wound care, study design, and underlying disease. Patients with malignancies are at greater risk for peristomal infections than those with nonmalignant diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444536">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612444536">7</xref></sup> Thus, prophylactic antibiotic treatment is standard practice to prevent peristomal wound infections in many countries outside of Europe. A recent meta-analysis indicated that antibiotics reduce the relative and absolute risk of infection by 64% and 15%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444536">1</xref></sup> However, routine prophylactic antibiotic treatment has contributed to the increased incidence of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> colonization in hospitalized patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444536">8</xref></sup> Most of the peristomal infections in our study occurred within 7 days of the procedure. The infection rate of 3.12% at the end of week 1 in the control group was lower than reported in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444536">1</xref></sup> The wound infection scores used in the present study were not used in former investigations, except in the study by Gossner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444536">5</xref></sup> In our study, the total number of peristomal wound reactions did not differ between the 2 groups. However, the severity of wound reaction was shifted toward more severe infections in the standard wound dressing group. More severe (degree II and III) peristomal wound infections occurred in only 14.3% of patients receiving GHG dressings, compared with 47.05% in the control group. Most patients from the study group tolerated the GHG material well, with only 1 patient having to be excluded because of an allergic reaction to the hydrogel.</p>
<p>In addition to its clinical benefit, the GHG wound dressing offers a clear economic benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444536">9</xref></sup> Although GHG dressings are more expensive than traditional dressings, total costs for the GHG dressings are predicted to be significantly lower, as indirect costs are reduced due to the lower number of dressing changes (4.6 vs 22.6). When total costs, including costs for dressing material, wound cleaning, and labor, are taken into account, cost-effectiveness analysis for the first month reveals a net cost saving of about 310/$425 per patient in favor of the GHG dressing.</p>
<p>The study’s open design may be considered as a limitation. Unfortunately, visually identical dressings with and without GHG were not available, and nurses had to be informed about the dressing change interval. A minor disadvantage of GHG dressing use may be excessive wound secretion and minor allergic reactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that the use of GHG dressings significantly decreases the number of peristomal infections and that the frequency of dressing changes can be safely extended to 7 days during the first week, making it a less labor-intensive and more cost-effective option for wound management following PEG.</p>
