I argue that the meanings of the term ‘victim’ over the last decade have undergone significant rhetorical and ideological developments that affect imprisoned women along gendered and racialized lines. Special attention will be given to the position of victim and victimhood in US culture following the terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. I argue that a renewed socio-cultural shift towards neo-conservatism initiated in the 1980s has retrenched the view that the US has been emasculated and its sovereignty rendered vulnerable to attack. In this discursive space, victimhood is no longer a political category aimed at the mobilization of policy and law reforms, such as the Violence Against Women Act 1994 and the Battered Immigrant Women’s Protection Act 2000. Rather, the socio-political space of neo-conservatism has pilloried claims to victimization as signs of moral weakness, personal failure and lifestyle choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269758012447214">Paglia, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758012447214">Roiphe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269758012447214">Sommers, 1994</xref>). In this context, I consider the obfuscation of sexual violence inside women’s prisons despite national efforts to address the prevalence of (male) prisoner rape. I suggest that the rape of women in prison is eclipsed by an anti-feminist backlash.</p> <p>In order to show the connection between our understandings of sexual victimization both inside and outside the prison context, I use qualitative textual analysis to focus on how dominant cultural meanings surrounding victimization are encoded into the language of both conservative popular writings and influential feminist discussions. The analysis of this secondary data is then juxtaposed with an ideological textual analysis of anti-prison rape projects and national studies published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and Human Rights Watch to reveal how widespread anti-victimist conceptions of oppression have become. This approach not only helps highlight the shifting meanings of ‘victim’ − a term that has been paradoxically discussed as a fixed ‘identity’ − but also works to extract the ideological messages inherent within representations of gender, race and class in anti-prison rape literature. This allows for a careful analysis of the cultural intersections and the rhetorical dynamics at play in both the academic and popular scenes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269758012447214">Hall (1980</xref>) has argued, cultural texts and representations produce meanings in society that are imprinted with the workings of the dominant culture. The qualitative textual analysis I am offering here uses a feminist and cultural studies perspective to show how cultural meanings surrounding victimization work to transmit ideologies of race, gender and class that normalize incarcerated women’s sexual violation.</p> <sec id="section1-0269758012447214"> <title>Devaluing of victimhood and ennobling of agency</title> <p>To fully understand the negative connotations associated with the racialized and gendered concept of victim in the US today, we need to look back at the ‘political correctness’ debates of the 1990s from which they derive. The last decade of the twentieth century witnessed indeed the emergence of a virulent anti-victimist discourse, notably with the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758012447214">Bernstein’s (1990)</xref> essay ‘Ideas and Trends: The Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct’ in the <italic>New York Times</italic>. The article marked the emergence of the term of ‘political correctness’ in public discourse and the beginning of a rampant devaluation and de-gendering of victimhood and minority claims in the mainstream. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758012447214">D’Souza’s attack on the ‘victim revolution’ (1992)</xref> on university campuses was probably one of the most popularized versions of this discourse, and both higher education and radical feminism soon became the prime target of such conservative criticisms. In ‘Tenured Radicals’, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758012447214">Kimball (1990</xref>) singled out radical feminism for promoting special interests that were antithetical to the acquisition of the kind of core and universal knowledge needed to shape the future citizens of a modern democracy. Similarly, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269758012447214">Klein (1998</xref>), academic feminism constituted a threat to rigorous scholarship, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269758012447214">Mooney (1988</xref>) echoed a large number of conservative commentators when she accused feminists of having abandoned rational thought in favor of their own political agenda. As Convery notes, <disp-quote> <p>Feminist ideas were positioned at the very foundations of the edifice labeled ‘political correctness.’ What has to be stressed here is that these critics created the very entity that they attributed to feminist and other politically progressive theorists. The ‘political correctness’ code emerged as a mechanism for undermining minority challenges to the status quo, firstly by discursively collapsing all claims of disadvantage as being about victimhood and victimization (whether or not such claims were couched in precisely these terms), and then by devaluing victimhood as a morally, and not just a practically, reduced state. (2011: 6)</p> </disp-quote> </p> <p>Convery highlights the enduring and homogenizing effect of the encoding strategies of politically correct discourses over the last two decades. Not only is invoking the term ‘victim’ enough to trigger negative and devaluing connotations about a person, but all self-proclaimed victims are now subjected to disapproval (at best), or to distrust and condemnation (at worst). The ‘innocent’ victim of yore can now only ever be the victim who denies being one. Drawing attention to or identifying victimization as a platform for solidarity and social change is immediately recast as a ruse of power rather than as a legitimate critique of power. In a detailed survey of eight influential Anglo-American feminist journals between 1987 and 2007, Convery reveals that the denigrated victim has become so paradigmatic today that, ironically, even feminist theorists partake in its devaluing. While most feminists see their sustained critique of the concept of victim as a means of theoretical contestation, Convery’s research shows instead that the de-legitimization of the concept is not only shared across national and cultural boundaries of the Anglo-American academy (Australia, Britain and the United States) but that it also bridges the gap between conservative cultural and political critics and some academic feminists. What is more, the undermining of the category of victim goes hand in hand with an uncritical ‘ennobling’ of agency and resistance as markers of the kind of self-reliance, sense of responsibility, and complexity that victims purportedly lack.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269758012447214">1</xref> </sup> </p> <p>Whereas victimization once referred to something tragic or criminal (outside the self) that affected one’s life experience, it is now increasingly used to denote a problem that is intrinsic to the self and that makes one partly if not wholly responsible for the regrettable experience to which one was subjected. The term now evokes the ‘perception of one who is weak and was overcome or manipulated by an external source possibly due to his/her own negligence or helplessness’; it is a sign of  ‘individual powerlessness over internal resources and a dependence on others to rectify the situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758012447214">Underwood and Edmunds, 2002</xref>: 5−6). Victims of sexual violence, for instance, now balk at being ‘victims’ and want to be called survivors instead.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269758012447214">2</xref> </sup> Self-help gurus repeatedly warn their listeners not to indulge in a ‘victim’ mentality. Perhaps it is the grueling tragedy of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 that triggered an anti-victimist discourse. As Cole explains, ‘[w]e might assume that the tragedy of 9/11, which brought forth in the US new groups of victims … would curb anti-victimism. On the contrary, efforts to embrace and commemorate those who perished during the attacks, to assess national and individual responsibility, and to validate warmongering abroad, all relied on anti-victim discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447214">Cole, 2008</xref>: 118).</p> <p>The combination of anti-victimist and anti-feminist backlash has led to the entrenchment of victimization as a feminized concept. Victimhood is irretrievably coded as feminine, no doubt because of its reframing as a sign of weakness and passivity, traits that have traditionally been ascribed to femininity in Western culture. This largely explains why even such an obvious site of victimization as the World Trade Center bombing paradoxically led not to the appropriation of a discourse of victimhood but to endlessly recycled anti-victimist statements by Republican and Democratic administrations. According to conservative pundits such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758012447214">Bennett (2001, 2003)</xref>, the terrorist attacks were indeed the price we paid for the feminization of America in the hands of ‘victimology mongers’ who left the country vulnerable and weak. The only hope out of this quagmire, they claim, was the re-masculinization of the country and the restoration of patriarchal power (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447214">Cole, 2008</xref>: 119).</p> <p>Considering the prevalence of anti-feminist conservative ideology in US culture at large, it is not surprising that gendered views of victimization that align with a binary conceptualization of passive (and feminized) victimhood and resistant agency (masculine self-sufficiency), should also define the governance of prison environments.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269758012447214">3</xref> </sup> To fully understand the ramifications of the dominant and regulating discourses of victimhood in carceral culture, it is thus all the more imperative to move to an analysis of ‘victim’ as a dynamic and rhetorical term that produces meaning rather than as a term that contains meaning (in a uniform and referential manner). We can thus be attentive to the contingent ways in which preconceived notions about who is or is not a ‘victim’ re-inscribes normative power relations based on race, gender, and class. Such a cultural analysis allows for a more complex and nuanced understanding of the gendered but also racial dimensions of victim subjectivities in the prison context.</p> </sec> <sec id="section2-0269758012447214"> <title>Once criminalized; never victimized</title> <p>Caught in the cross-hairs of this socio-cultural shift are feminist academics and activists who have made clear the links between victimization, criminalization, and incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269758012447214">Richie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269758012447214">Sudbury, 2005</xref>). The prison industrial complex has expanded as prisoner populations swell to unprecedented levels, and conditions of disorder and sexual violence plague under-resourced yet highly securitized prisons.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269758012447214">4</xref> </sup> Women’s rates of incarceration have increased at twice the rate of men’s imprisonment; as a result, the number of women imprisoned in the US has tripled between 1995 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269758012447214">NOW, 2010</xref>). According to research conducted by the Pew Public Safety Performance Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269758012447214">2008</xref>), 1 in every 279 black women is incarcerated compared with 1 in every 1,064 white women and one in every 658 Latinos. For ages 35 to 39, 1 in every 100 black women are in jail or prison −  the highest proportionally of any female group. Women prisoners are thus disproportionately women of color, with African American women comprising 46% of the population nationwide, white women comprising 36%, and Hispanic Women comprising 14%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758012447214">Johnson (2003</xref>) similarly points out that the incarceration rates of African American women have historically increased even when crimes are at an unusually low level. Statistical data thus reveal far higher incarceration rates by race among women in jail, with women of color constituting nearly two-thirds of the female population in state and federal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269758012447214">Kruttschnitt and Gartner, 2003</xref>: 8). This disparity is in large part a result of the strengthening of federal drug laws, which has had devastating consequences for minority women and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758012447214">Johnson, 2003</xref>: 6).</p> <p>The study of the growing phenomenon of incarcerated women has allowed a profile of the typical woman prisoner to emerge. Kurshan notes that the typical woman prisoner is ‘a young, single mother with few marketable job skills, a high school drop-out who lives below the poverty level’ (2006: 2) and that ‘[s]eventy-five percent are between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four, are mothers of dependent children, and were unemployed at the time of arrest. Many left home early and have experienced sexual and physical abuse. Ninety percent have a drug or alcohol-related history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269758012447214">Kurshan, 2006</xref>: 2). This profile indicates that what tends to drive a certain woman to engage in criminal behavior are the circumstances of poverty, interpersonal and familial violence, and dependency that often shape and determine her behavior. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269758012447214">Kurshan (2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758012447214">Mazza (2006)</xref> highlight, the imprisonment of women, as well as all the other aspects of their lives, thus takes place against a backdrop of patriarchal relationships that go undetected when the focus remains a decontextualized context of criminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269758012447214">Kurshan, 2006</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758012447214">Mazza,  2006</xref>: 80). Rather than benefiting from informed prevention and treatment, black women are labeled as ‘drug mothers’ or ‘crack mothers’ who need to be punished for victimizing their unborn child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758012447214">Mazza, 2006</xref>: 81). They are thus reframed as abusers themselves. Such racist portrayals also consistently evoke the stereotype of the ‘welfare queen’ who allegedly abuses the system for personal gain and has multiple pregnancies during which she unashamedly uses drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758012447214">Irving, 2007</xref>: 74; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758012447214">Mazza, 2006</xref>: 82). Again and again, these representations recast the victims of the root causes of drug offences (racialized poverty) as perpetrators who deserve disciplining and punishment (for victimizing their own unborn children and abusing social service and health care systems). The negative consequences of these socio-cultural shifts have been acutely experienced by women in prison; a group criminalized for drug related offences, welfare fraud, and prostitution, and thus are seen as crossing normative gendered boundaries of hetero-femininity’s expectations of mothering, family life, and moral character. Because of their criminal(ized) background women in prison are not to be considered victims despite ample empirical studies documenting the prevalence of sexual and physical victimization, impoverishment, drug addiction, and mental illness. Once someone is criminalized, conceiving of that person as a ‘worthy’ victim demands a deconstruction of binaries such as perpetrator/victim that have been naturalized in the culture at large. A more nuanced understanding of the concept of victimization has been obscured by today’s homogenizing representations of victimhood. What is more, victims are people whose status as victims is seen as preceding and extending beyond their victimization and whose agency is, if not altogether non-existent, then at least heavily suppressed. Victim and agency, in other words, are now ineluctably defined as exclusive categories of identification, with ‘victim’ appearing as the unambiguous term at one end of the spectrum and agency as its uncritically valorized and infinitely nuanced opposite at the other end.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269758012447214">5</xref> </sup> </p> <p>The conditions of confinement to which women are subjected in prison are typically assumed to be a disciplining outcome necessitated by their criminal histories or risk−need assessment. In other words, penal control of women prisoners functions as gendered violence whose ideological nature is obscured by appeals to notions of deterrence and justice.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0269758012447214">6</xref> </sup>Consequently, any claim of victimization on behalf of criminalized women is considered suspect, all the more so since women in prison do not ‘live up’ to the stereotype of the proper, feminized, white victim that has historically mobilized the sympathy of the American public,<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0269758012447214">7</xref> </sup> insofar as incarcerated women do not look, behave, talk, or live like the ideal of passive and proper (white) femininity that continues to haunt and determine our gendered social arrangements. Feminists have long asserted and contested the under-reporting of sexual violence that stems from the state’s treatment of rape victims by police and before the courts. A raped woman struggles against rape myths that attack her credibility and character, deem her to be sexually promiscuous, or a lying slut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269758012447214">Stewart et al., 1996</xref>). What then can we expect of the state’s treatment of women prisoners who are sexually assaulted by prison guards and staff? </p> </sec> <sec id="section3-0269758012447214"> <title>Sexual violence in the prison context</title> <p>According to a 2007 report released by the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, <italic>Sexual Victimization in State and Federal Prisons Reported by Inmates, 2007</italic>, 4.5 percent of the state and federal prisoners surveyed reported sexual victimization in the previous 12 months. This would mean that in one year alone, between 70,000 and 100,000 prisoners were sexually abused and nearly one in 20 inmates were raped or sexually abused in prison. For incarcerated women, in particular, sexual assault, particularly guard-on-prisoner sexual assault, is simply a fact of life. It can vary from institution to institution, but in the worst prison facilities, one in four female inmates are sexually abused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269758012447214">Naughton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269758012447214">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269758012447214">Summer, 2008</xref>).<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0269758012447214">8</xref> </sup> Victims of sexual violence behind bars sometimes contract HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and they always suffer severe psychological harm.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0269758012447214">9</xref> </sup> </p> <p>In 2001, the first national study of prisoner sexual assault published by Human Rights Watch,<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0269758012447214">10</xref> </sup> combined with a number of mainstream media reports about male sexual abuse in prisons, led to a national outcry and call for reform, followed by a historic piece of legislation in 2003, the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), which called for zero tolerance for sexual abuse in jail. Two years later, California enacted a similar law, the Sexual Abuse in Detention Elimination Act, which required the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to prevent and respond to sexual abuse in its prisons. Like the study itself, the nationwide call to end the ‘cruel and usual punishment’ of prison rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758012447214"> <italic>The Washington Post</italic>, 2001</xref>) was focused on the treatment of male prisoners in correctional institutions. We should consider the socio-cultural context of the introduction of these various legal regimes to combat (male) prisoner rape as being driven, in part, by the sexual abuse scandals inside the Catholic clergy. The public discourse of institutionalized male rape quickly overshadowed sexual violence against women, in part because men are victims of homosexual rape and are thus ‘non-deserving’ victims of sexual violence. In this way, rape of women prisoners subscribes to heteronormative understandings of women as promiscuous and manipulative.</p> <p>While the policy actions that followed the public outcry against prison rape were certainly important and salutary, its focus on men inadvertently served, then, to obscure the rates at which incarcerated women are statistically and proportionally more likely to be sexually assaulted by male prison staff. In one study, researchers found that although male prisoners were more likely to be victims of inmate-perpetrated rape than women (21% versus 19%), 41% of women prisoners reported being sexually assaulted by prison staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269758012447214">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson, 2006</xref>: 1601). In their study of strip-searching in women’s prisons in Australia and Northern Ireland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269758012447214">McCullough and George (2009</xref>: 108) assert sexual violence exists along a continuum of ‘forced nudity and sexual humiliation in the form of routine strip searches and constitute an official, deliberate and gendered strategy’. Thus, security and control in women’s prisons is always sexual(ized) violence; it affects women inmates in ways that often go unnoticed by virtue of the cultural normalization of femininity’s subordination to the masculine position. Expectations surrounding what constitutes a ‘proper’ victim in particular explain why female inmates’ experiences of sexual violence are often denied, naturalized as consensual, or recast as ‘deserved.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0269758012447214">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0269758012447214">12</xref> </sup> Indeed, the custodial violence to which inmates are subjected is frequently seen as a means of restoring control in what is otherwise an inherently violent environment and not as a regulating mechanism that aims at reinscribing normative boundaries of identity and a masculinist order at all costs, i.e. at the expense of human rights. What these studies expose is how, in the context of incarceration, sex and violence can no longer be strictly distinguished from one another, as both are used as tools for the imposition of masculinist and racial hierarchies. </p> <p>As stated earlier, women of color are disproportionately represented in prison<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0269758012447214">13</xref> </sup> and are the fastest growing incarcerated population in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758012447214">Glaze and Maruschak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0269758012447214">Young, 2011</xref>), and thus their experiences of sexual assault in prison must be viewed through the lens of critical race scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758012447214">Collins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758012447214">2000</xref>). As Irving points out, ‘national narratives of rape … have assumed a chaste white female victim and a brute black male that ultimately enabled the control of the former and suppression of the latter - even in this historical context, rape is largely about maintaining boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758012447214">Irving, 2007</xref>: 78−79). Because of this racist narrative, black women’s experiences of violence in particular are either completely subsumed or obscured as effects of their own stereotyped hypersexuality. Indeed, ever since slavery, the image of black women as promiscuous has not only deflected attention from the racialized and sexualized violence to which they have been subjected, but it has also made sure that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758012447214">Joy (1996</xref>) points out, black women’s sexual victimization remains utterly invisible. Not unlike the plantation world, sexual violence in prison works to perpetuate hierarchical relations of gender and race. In other words, women’s transgressions of the boundaries of ‘proper’ femininity mark them as not able to be raped, all the more so since the story of rape demands an ‘innocent’ victim, by which what is meant is not innocence in relation to the crime committed − itself an absurd proposition − but the enactment of an ‘innocence’ that can only be performed through highly gendered, racial, and class characteristics and behaviors.  </p> <p>According to Irving, ‘for black women, in particular, gender, race, and sexual relations collude in a dense matrix of social regulation that still condition the terms of their existence’ (2007: 69). Specifically, she argues that the construction of the normative white, propertied, and masculine citizen as the universal subject is made possible by the construction of the hypersexualized and particularized black female body. Scholars have written at length on the ways in which racial otherness functions as a marker of criminality in American society: whites may commit crimes, but blacks are criminals.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0269758012447214">14</xref> </sup> In fact, the racist apparatus that grounds such discursive sleight of hand is so pervasive that one concept now automatically implies the other: blackness evokes criminality, while criminality leads to the racialization of the person accused of a crime. Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269758012447214">Muhammed (2010</xref>) have shown that the idea of the black criminal was not only key to the making of modern urban America but that it continues to function as a form of social policy that sustains and justifies racial inequality. Today, black oppression is therefore consistently recast as an extension of black criminality rather than as a crime that requires intervention. The two terms are so intricately linked in the national imaginary that racial and gendered identities are often seen to fluctuate to reflect and reify that interdependence. As a result, the metaphorical, rhetorical, and ideological dimensions of the dynamic at play between race and crime make it all the more difficult to address the sexualized victimization that black men and women in particular endure in prison.  The racialized and sexualized system of mass incarceration and violence thus literally functions as a regulatory system that works to put non-normative individuals back ‘in their place.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0269758012447214">15</xref> </sup> I will conclude by showing how such a regulating function is all the more powerful for being obscured by the victim-blaming rhetoric that dominates both mainstream and penal culture.</p> </sec> <sec id="section4-0269758012447214"> <title>Victim-blaming and prison culture</title> <p>Victims of sexual violence in correctional facilities are subjected to the same assumptions about the diminished character of the victim as rape victims in the culture at large. They too are perceived as morally and psychologically weak and lack agency and power, wearing a ‘mask’ of victim that singles them out as different. They are inherent ‘victims’ rather than ‘normal’ individuals who happen to be victimized by prison assaults. What victimizes them, then, is inner failings that are reflected in their appearance and that trigger their victimization rather than deplorable or criminal outside forces that lead to their victimization. While victims’ social positioning and difficult circumstances may make them more vulnerable to victimization, it is ultimately their inner failings that are seen as determining the assault to which they are subjected. For instance, a report prepared for the National Institute of Justice (2003) shows that even though prison culture’s sexual worldview condemns prison rapists and prison rape, it also paradoxically tends to subscribe to a ‘blame the victim’ attitude toward sexual violence, reproducing mainstream assumptions about victimization as an inherent form of weakness on the part of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758012447214">Fleisher and Krienert, 2006</xref>: 144). The authors cite a woman inmate who maintained that ‘[i]t’s like [victims] wear a sign on their head that says “we’re a victim”. There’s something about them that’s different. Every pedophile will say they look for children who are vulnerable. Rapists too. They just know who to get. It’s like victims wear a mask rapists see’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758012447214">Fleisher and Krienert, 2006</xref>: 159). According to the report:<disp-quote> <p>Men’s and women’s prison culture share common perceptions of the consequences of sexual victimization. Inmate culture presumes that no one needs to be raped; rape can be prevented; and that if rape occurs, fault lies with the victim. Inmate culture condemns sexual victims as manipulators or liars and largely responsible for their own victimization. First, victims may have staged their own sexual victimization to garner attention from inmates or staff. Second, they may have staged assault to falsely blame an inmate or staff member. Third, they may have owed canteen or drug debts and thus set the stage for sexual assault. Fourth, they may have sexually enticed a woman by flirting and then failed to fulfill a silent promise of a sexual affair. The reasons for sexual victimization matter not: sexual victims are always social outcasts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758012447214">Fleisher and Krienert, 2006</xref>: 178)</p> </disp-quote> </p> <p>In other words, rape myths that blame victims operate within carceral cultures: prisoners often perceive a sexual assailant as entitled to commit sexual violence because of preconceived attitudes about sexual violence. As Fleisher and Krienert explain, ‘[e]ntitlement to commit sexual assault emerges in more than are fringe percentage of both men and women inmates. [S]exual assault as a form of entitlement is instigated by a victim’s physical or mental weakness or by a victim’s violation of inmate behavior protocols’ (2006: 172).</p> <p>This victim-blaming attitude is all the more remarkable since recent studies conducted by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics have shown that those responsible for the sexual abuse of female prisoners are usually correctional officers (Kraiser and Stannow, 2010b: 37). Furthermore, the United Nations Special Rapporteur reported only two states have inmate grievance procedures that rely on outside monitoring. Most grievances are addressed within the institution, with a great deal of discretion vested in the warden. Many grievances are dealt with through informal counseling by the officers within the institution, with the assistance of the warden (United <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269758012447214">Nations, 1999</xref>: 73):<disp-quote> <p>Most of the inmates said that they had no faith in internal grievance procedures. They were also afraid of retaliation. If someone brings a charge of sexual misconduct against an officer, she is usually removed to administrative segregation or solitary confinement, allegedly ‘for her own protection’. Such segregation is experienced as punitive. Additionally, many inmates reported that staff in the administrative segregation, out of loyalty to the accused officer, are often abusive to the inmate who has complained. It is for reasons such as this that outside review should be an essential part of the monitoring of inmates' complaints. (United <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269758012447214">Nations, 1999</xref>: 74)</p> </disp-quote> </p> <p>According to a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758012447214">2005</xref> study conducted by the Quaker United Nations Offices (QUNO) on violence against women and girls in prison, women in jail who are imprisoned in mixed sex detention facilities are at greatest risk of violence, with the hierarchical nature of the power relationship between guards and prisoners only exacerbating that risk.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0269758012447214">16</xref> </sup> Even though the International Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners stipulate that ‘women prisoners shall be attended and supervised only by women officers,’ according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, 70% of guards in federal women’s correctional facilities are still male, often holding ‘contact positions’ over female prisoners.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0269758012447214">17</xref> </sup> In housing units, sexual misconduct is more pervasive when women prisoners are guarded by male corrections staff. Records show that correctional officials subject female inmates to various forms of sexual assault, sexual extortion, and improper touching during body searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758012447214">Amnesty International, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758012447214">Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269758012447214">Smith, 1998</xref>). For instance, as a way of silencing their victims, correctional officers have been known to threaten visitation rights or to issue infraction tickets that extend the prison stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758012447214">Amnesty International USA, 2007</xref>). The imbalance of power between inmates and guards sometimes involves the use of direct physical force but most often depends on indirect force based on the prisoners' total reliance on officers for basic necessities. Some women are forced into sex in exchange for favors such as extra food or personal hygiene products, or to avoid the withholding of privileges (ibid.).</p> <p>What is disproportionate to the high evidence of sexual improprieties and violence against women and girls in prison is the level of impunity that is granted officers convicted or suspected of such crimes. Prison officials found guilty of sexual assault are often simply transferred (‘walked off the yard’) to another facility. Sometimes the inmate is transferred as well. In 1997, according to the US Justice Department only ten prison employees in the entire federal system were disciplined, and only seven were prosecuted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758012447214">Amnesty International USA, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758012447214">Kaiser and Stannow (2010</xref>) suggest, this trend continues today: even in confirmed cases of the sexual abuse of juveniles, fewer than half of the corrections officials are referred for prosecution, while almost none are punished. One-quarter of all known staff predators in state youth facilities are permitted to keep their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758012447214">Kaiser and Stannow, 2010</xref>). In women’s prisons, less overtly violent acts such as improper touching are simply tolerated in what the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women describes as ‘sanctioned sexual harassment.’<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0269758012447214">18</xref> </sup> What is more, this acceptance of sexualized violence is compounded by the fact that inmates themselves subscribe to an understanding of sexual victimization that tends to place the blame for sexual assault on the victim. Female inmates’ experiences of sexual violence are denied, naturalized as consensual, or recast as ‘deserved’, while the shifting meanings of victimization, masculinity, and femininity obfuscate the operations of power. In this climate, it is not surprising that few perpetrators of violence against inmates should be held accountable for their crimes.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0269758012447214">19</xref> </sup> </p> </sec> <sec id="section5-0269758012447214"> <title>Conclusion</title> <p>I have argued that the discursive and ideological processes involved in demarcating ‘good’ and ‘bad’ victims in American culture work in the prison environment to reinforce hierarchical relations based on race, gender, and class power. I have suggested that penal power operates at the intersection of race, class, and gender, obfuscating the rape of women prisoners from official policy responses, such as the implementation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act. The rape of women prisoners, most often by staff, is redefined by rape myths of the undeserving victim: black, poor, drug addicted, mentally ill, or prostituted women. In stark contrast, male prisoner rape is reported to be a serious problem that requires surveillance and denunciation. I have argued that perhaps the social and political condemnation of male rape in prisons is part of a broader socio-cultural, anti-feminist revulsion that has challenged the violence against women movement as political correctness. Moreover, I have suggested that the enactment of the PREA came into force at a time of retrenchment of US neo-conservativism in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The carceral complex is a space of sexualized violence in that black women’s bodies are watched and managed by men in positions of power. Despite the flow of documentary and critical evidence that has been exposing the high incidence and debilitating effects of sexualized violence in prison, this egregious abuse of power continues unabated. I have suggested that ‘commonsensical’ understandings of the term ‘victim’ may very well be at fault for the lack of intervention and public outcry concerning rape in prison. The gendered power-dynamics that underlie the meanings of victimization and criminalization are reinscribed and exacerbated in women’s prisons, where the masculinization of certain female inmates works to obscure their victimization, while the racialization of others marks them as inviolable. ‘Criminal,’ like ‘victim,’ is viewed as an inherent trait/flaw that defines incarcerated women and that they cannot escape during or post-sentence.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0269758012447214">20</xref> </sup> This development not only hampers an empathetic response to the fate of victimized inmates but also explains why abuse in the hands of correctional staff in prisons has gone largely unaddressed if not unrecognized in the contemporary US.
