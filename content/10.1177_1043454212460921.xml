<abstract>
<p>Children and adolescents with cancer who receive chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments are at risk for malnutrition due to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and mouth sores. Malnutrition during treatment for childhood cancer increases the risk of infection, decreases tolerance to treatment, and even affects overall survival. A retrospective analysis of 79 children, adolescents, and young adults was conducted to evaluate nutritional screening at baseline and for the first 6 months of treatment. Interventions were also documented. Forty-nine participants had a positive screen for risk of malnutrition. In the patients with a positive screen, 78% had intervention within 24 hours of the identified risk for malnutrition. Thirty-five patients had a nutritional referral, which resulted in a full nutritional assessment and plan. Key independent variables were analyzed to determine if they were associated with an increased risk of malnutrition. In addition, individual risk factors were analyzed to determine their association with malnutrition. Future studies should find whether early intervention is effective in reversing the risk of malnutrition during treatment for childhood cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past decade, cure rates for childhood cancer have dramatically improved to almost 80% overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212460921">Williams, Schmideskamp, Ridder, &amp; Arthur, 2006</xref>). To achieve this increased survival, chemotherapy and radiation treatments have intensified and toxicity has increased significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212460921">Hockenberry, 2004</xref>). Treatment for cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation is frequently associated with major problems that affect nutritional status including nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, anorexia, poor weight gain, and possibly malnutrition. Malnutrition during treatment for childhood cancer has been associated with poor tolerance to treatment, an increase in infections, and even a reduction in overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212460921">Sala, Pencharz, &amp; Barr, 2004</xref>). Although the cure rates are encouraging, cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children aged 0 to 14 years. A significant percentage of these deaths are not from the disease but from side effects related to treatment. Malnutrition is a major concern for children with cancer and may place children at risk for additional complications.</p>
<p>The prevalence of malnutrition in children with cancer has been reported to be between 8% and 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212460921">Ladas, Sacks, Brophy, &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>). Children and adolescents diagnosed with malignant solid tumors, brain tumors, and nonlymphocytic leukemia are at particular risk of malnutrition because of the intensity of their treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212460921">Han-Markey, 2000</xref>). Specific treatments such as irradiation to the gastrointestinal tract, intense frequent chemotherapy cycles, and major abdominal surgery place children at the highest risk for malnutrition. In addition, advanced disease, recurrent disease, and widely metastatic disease are significant risk factors for malnutrition.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents who receive intensive treatment are usually hospitalized at least once a month for the administration of high-dose chemotherapy and may have additional unplanned hospital stays for therapy-related complications. There is ample opportunity to screen children with cancer for nutritional issues; however, this continues to be an area of clinical practice that is widely neglected. It has been reported that only 46% of institutions that provide treatment to children and adolescents with cancer assess their nutritional status at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212460921">Ladas et al., 2005</xref>). Very few institutions provide continued nutritional screening during treatment. Nutritional screening for children with cancer is an area of research that has not been well studied. Descriptions of effective nutritional interventions are very limited in the published literature.</p>
<p>Nutritional screening and early intervention are areas where an interprofessional team can have a great impact on reducing the risk of malnutrition associated with treatment for childhood cancer. Published recommendations suggest children with cancer should be screened at diagnosis and throughout their course of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212460921">Children’s Oncology Group [COG], 2010</xref>). However, these guidelines have not been widely adopted despite evidence that malnutrition may delay treatment, lead to dose reductions of chemotherapy and even affect overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212460921">Ladas et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a definite need for research related to the identification of malnutrition risk in children with cancer and the development of planned interventions to reduce risk and improve outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212460921">Mosby et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Members of the national COG have challenged investigators to conduct well-designed clinical research studies focused on nutritional support for children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212460921">Rogers et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1043454212460921">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Malnutrition can be defined as a nutritional state in which deficiencies of protein and other nutrients cause an energy imbalance and measurable adverse outcomes on body tissue leading to impaired body functions and form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212460921">Joosten &amp; Hulst, 2008</xref>). The specific energy imbalance in patients with cancer is the result of multiple factors, including diminished intake, enhanced losses, and increased need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212460921">Sala et al., 2004</xref>). Children are at increased risk of malnutrition during illness because of their particular body composition, including higher water content and decreased fat. In addition, children have increased caloric requirements and decreased caloric reserves, which places them at risk for malnutrition much sooner than adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212460921">Han-Markey, 2000</xref>). Lastly, children are frequently in a dependent position and rely on caregivers to provide their nutritional needs. All these factors place children in a vulnerable position and increase their risk of malnutrition during cancer therapy when compared with adults with cancer.</p>
<p>The consequences of malnutrition are significant and include an increase in both mortality and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212460921">Joosten &amp; Hulst, 2008</xref>). Patients with cancer have increased nutritional needs for a sustained period of time related to the length of the treatment, which may last several years. The duration of risk for malnutrition can increase with multiple relapses of the disease and continued intensive treatments. The aim of nutritional support should be the prevention or reversal of malnutrition. Nutritional screening should begin within 48 hours of diagnosis and continue throughout the illness trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454212460921">VanBokhorst &amp; Schueren, 2005</xref>). Early recognition and treatment of malnutrition associated with cancer promotes recovery, improves prognosis, and is cost-effective as it reduces complication rates and hospital days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212460921">Davies, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Nutritional screening is the process of identifying risk factors known to be associated with potential malnutrition. The main purpose of screening is to identify those children or adolescents who are at risk of malnutrition related to their illness or treatment. Once a risk factor is identified, a comprehensive nutritional assessment should be provided by a licensed dietitian; medical and nursing personnel can add physical exam findings and documentation of treatment related toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454212460921">Mosby, Barr, &amp; Pencharz, 2009</xref>). The nutritional assessment includes medical information, medication history, review of the documented physical examination, anthropometric measurements, laboratory data, and a subjective report of symptoms and oral intake. A family profile including resources available should be included in the assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454212460921">McMahon &amp; Brown, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There are 3 main goals of nutritional screening: identification of risk factors, early development of planned interventions, and follow-up screening to track outcomes. Nutritional screening is complex; there is not an established gold standard for screening during pediatric cancer treatment. Nutritional assessment is multidimensional and includes clinical examination, dietary tools, objective data, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory evidence. The COG published findings indicating that ideal body weight and body mass index (BMI) are both adequate indicators of nutritional status in children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212460921">Rogers et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There are recent detailed published guidelines for dietary recommendations for children and adolescents from the American Academy of Pediatrics; however, these focus mainly on healthy children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212460921">Gidding et al., 2006</xref>). The use of dietary reference intakes (DRIs) is now recognized as a method to estimate the probability of dietary adequacy (or inadequacy) for an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212460921">Murphy, 2008</xref>) and is frequently calculated by dietitians as part of their overall assessment. The use of BMI is an indicator of nutritional status in healthy children, but it has not been validated as a single indicator in children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212460921">Nething, Ringwald-Smith, Williams, Hancock, &amp; Hale, 2007</xref>). However, triceps skin fold measurements and percentage of ideal body weight were good indicators of percentage of body fat in pediatric oncology nutrition assessment performed on 23 children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212460921">White, Davies, &amp; Murphy, 2008</xref>). This study also found that height and weight changes correlated well with percentage of body fat and were simple and reliable methods of nutritional screening. This is a preliminary study with a small number of patients thus it needs further validation.</p>
<p>Some studies have used risk scores to identify children at risk of malnutrition. One group of researchers used a simple risk score performed within 48 hours of admission to the hospital to identify potential malnutrition in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043454212460921">Sermet-Gaudelus et al., 2000</xref>). This study assessed nutritional risk in 296 children and screened for food intake, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, and ability to eat. Risk groups were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe. Weight loss occurred in 65% of the children in the moderate and severe groups. Children in the severe groups were at significant risk of malnutrition. This simple screening score was useful in identifying hospitalized children at risk for malnutrition. St Jude Children’s Research Hospital used a nutrition screening system that determined the risk of malnutrition in children with cancer by assigning points to the following risk factors: ideal body weight, weight loss in 1 month, serum albumin, impending treatment side effects, oral intake less than 50% of assessed needs for 3 or more days, change in growth percentile curve, and high-risk cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043454212460921">Ringwald-Smith, Cartwright, &amp; Mosby, 2006</xref>). The team then developed 3 categories of malnutrition based on this point system: low risk, moderate risk, and high risk.</p>
<p>In addition to objective data, the importance of subjective report of nutritional status is documented in the literature. Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is a questionnaire that was found to be a highly sensitive tool for assessing poor nutritional status in children admitted to the hospital (N = 140). The tool identified children at risk for malnutrition based on subjective questions completed by the patient or parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212460921">Mahdavi, Ostadrahimi, &amp; Safaiyan, 2010</xref>). The SGA tool is inexpensive and easy to use; however, it has not been validated specifically in children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454212460921">Mosby et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Subjective report by the patient or family cannot be underestimated as an important component of nutritional assessment. In a study completed by Gerhardt et al. (2005), parents of children with cancer reported more concern about weight loss than healthy children in the comparison group. In a qualitative study done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212460921">Green, Horn, and Erikson (2010)</xref>, all 8 children and adolescents with cancer experienced nausea and mucositis, which limited their oral intake. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212460921">Skolin et al. (2006)</xref> completed a study of 22 children with cancer and reported that both children and parents thought that taste alteration was the major reason for decreased appetite. In this same study, the perception of nurses was that nausea and aversion to hospital food were the primary reasons for decreased oral intake in children with cancer.</p>
<p>The effects of malnutrition can influence physical, emotional, and psychosocial well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212460921">Couluris et al., 2008</xref>). Children who experience malnutrition may lack energy and suffer from weakness and fatigue. In addition, the effects of malnutrition may alter the child, adolescents, or young adult’s physical appearance and affect their quality of life. Cancer treatment can affect the child’s activities of daily living including having the energy to play and interact with others. School attendance may also be affected because of the decreased energy reserve associated with excessive weight loss. Parents of children with cancer may also experience emotional distress related to their child’s malnourishment as eating normally is associated with overall well-being. There are limited data on nutritional interventions for children with cancer.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212460921">Bakish et al. (2003)</xref> demonstrated that, in a population of 103 children with malignant brain tumors and weight loss due to chemotherapy, the use of enteral feeds resulted in the most significant weight gain over a 3-month period. Oral supplements were not successful in this study and parenteral nutrition did not sustain weight gain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212460921">Houlston (2009)</xref> implemented a “cook to order” nutritional service for children with cancer and demonstrated an increase in satisfaction with food in the hospital setting for children undergoing active treatment.</p>
<p>The most recent Cochrane review completed in 2010 identified 8 trials that focused on nutritional interventions for children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212460921">Jones, Watling, Wilkins, &amp; Pizer, 2010</xref>). The majority of the studies were more than 15 years old. The evidence suggested that parenteral nutrition may be more effective than enteral nutrition in several outcome measures including weight gain, serum albumin, and calorie or protein intake. Most of the evidence was limited to single institutions and outcome measures were not consistent across studies. The COG has defined categories of nutritional status in their guidelines for clinical care, including underweight, normal, and overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212460921">Rogers et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, COG has developed a detailed algorithm for nutritional interventions specifically for children with cancer being treated on clinical trials. Screening measures recommended by the COG include weight compared to ideal body weight or body mass index for all children greater than 2 years of age (weight-for-length should be substituted in younger children instead of body mass index). In addition, weight loss and serum albumin are screening criteria recommended by the COG guideline (COG, 2010). Lastly, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) has published guidelines that suggest rapid screening of patients with cancer should include height, weight, weight change, primary diagnosis, disease stage, and the presence of any comorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212460921">Huhmann &amp; August, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the recommendations in the pediatric oncology literature and clinical published guidelines, this study evaluated nutritional screening in a population of children, adolescents, and young adults to assess the risk of malnutrition during active treatment for cancer. In addition, the study explored the types of interventions that occurred once the risk of malnutrition was identified.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1043454212460921">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This was an exploratory/descriptive study using retrospective data. The primary objectives of the study were (<italic>a</italic>) to document nutritional screening performed at baseline and the first 6 months of treatment for children with cancer who received treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation and (<italic>b</italic>) to determine if children with a positive screen for risk of malnutrition received timely intervention. The secondary objectives of the study were to describe key independent variables and individual risk factors associated with a positive screen and to explore the type and timeliness of interventions for those with a positive screen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043454212460921">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample was derived from a departmental list of all patients diagnosed with cancer in 2010 (n = 104) who were prescribed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy treatments. The inclusion criteria included children, adolescents, and young adults from 1 to 22 years (inclusive). Infants less than 1 year of age were excluded. In addition, patients who received less than 6 months of consecutive treatment were excluded. There were 79 patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043454212460921">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The setting was a major academic children’s hospital located in a large Midwestern city. The hospital has a 28-bed specialized hematology/oncology inpatient unit and an adjacent outpatient hematology/oncology facility that serves 30 to 40 children and adolescents each day. The hospital serves residents in both rural and urban areas in a 2-state region. The setting is fairly representative of other treatment facilities in major children’s hospitals that specialize in pediatric oncology. There is a large multidisciplinary hematology/oncology team: 16 MDs, 12 APNs, 9 clinical nurse coordinators, 50 RNs, and an extensive psychosocial team (child life specialists, social workers, a school liaison, art therapist, music therapist, psychologist, pediatric clinical pharmacist, and a clinical pediatric dietitian).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043454212460921">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data collection was initiated after approval from the Human Research Protection Office at the facility and the institutional review board at Saint Louis University. All data were collected retrospectively from the medical records. Using the departmental list of eligible subjects, the principal investigator (PI) recorded nutritional screening parameters documented in each medical record at baseline and monthly for 6 months plus location of each screening time point (inpatient or outpatient). The screening tool used to collect the data was developed by the PI based on current recommendations in the literature and included the objective data measurements of weight, height, percent of weight loss from baseline, and serum albumin at each time point. If the patient had a negative nutritional screen, no further data were collected at that time point. For those with a positive screen, additional data collected included current symptoms or risk factors present, the source and timeliness of any nutrition referral, and medical or nutritional interventions at the time of the identified risk for malnutrition. All nutritional referrals were reviewed for recommendations and nutritional plan.</p>
<p>Demographic information was also collected (age in years, gender, diagnosis, and type of treatment). Factors including disease location (eg: head/neck) and disease progression were noted. Data were collected anonymously using no unique patient identifiers. Therefore, there was no way to link the data collected to the original list of eligible participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043454212460921">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>On completion of data collection, the PI coded all data and entered the results into PASW version 18. Accuracy of data entry was verified by the first author by review of all entries and checked by one of the coauthors. The descriptive data analysis was completed by the PI utilizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212460921">PASW (2008)</xref> and a biostatistician completed the additional data analysis using PASW and SAS 9.2.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section10-1043454212460921">
<title>Sample Demographics</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 79 children, adolescents, and young adults and all had nutritional screening parameters recorded in the medical record at baseline and each month. The sample included 47 males (59%) and 32 females (41%). The mean age was 10 years. Age groups for data analysis were divided into children (1-10 years), adolescents (11-17 years), and young adults (18-22 years). The most common diagnosis was leukemia/ lymphoma (47%) followed by solid tumors (34%) and central nervous system tumors (19%). Most participants received only chemotherapy as their treatment (70%).</p>
<p>A positive nutritional screen was defined objectively as weight loss of greater than or equal to 5% from baseline and/or a serum albumin less than 3.2 g/dL. Of the 79 participants screened, 49 (62%) had a positive screen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043454212460921">Table 1</xref>). The PI developed 5 groups for further statistical analysis. The groups were based on type of screen, if timely intervention occurred, and if intervention was nutrition referral or medical care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043454212460921">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Positive Nutritional Screen and Associated Variables</title>
<p>There were 49 patients who had a positive screen for risk of malnutrition. The majority (60%) had a positive screen due to weight loss greater than or equal to 5% from their baseline. Thirteen patients had a positive screen due to both weight loss and a low serum albumin. Only 6 patients screened positive due to a low albumin of less than 3.2 g/dL (without weight loss).</p>
<p>The average weight loss from baseline in those with a positive screen ranged from 5% to 9%; however, the variation in weight loss documented each month was impressive. At every time point during the 6 months, 1 or more patients had weight loss that exceeded 15% and ranged as high as 30% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043454212460921">Table 3</xref>). Many patients in the study actually met the definition of malnutrition (weight loss &gt;10% from baseline) rather than just a potential risk of malnutrition (weight loss &gt;5% from baseline).</p>

<p>Data were analyzed to determine the association between patients with a positive or negative screen and key independent variables. The key independent variables included gender, age group, diagnosis, treatment type, head/neck location, and presence of progressive disease. The only independent variable that was statistically significant was progressive disease. Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> analysis showed that patients with progressive disease were more likely to have a positive nutritional screen (<italic>P</italic> = .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043454212460921">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>There were a number of comorbid risk factors present at the time of the positive screen. The most common risk factors were nausea/vomiting or decreased oral intake, and 90% of the group that screened positive had these 2 risk factors (44 of 49 patients). In addition, the other documented symptoms include pain (76%), mucositis (57%), infection (51%), and anorexia (43%).</p>

<title>Nutritional Referral Characteristics</title>
<p>There were a total of 35 patients who received nutrition referrals during the study time. The source of the referral was mostly through the routine nutritional screen performed by the dietitian (60%) followed by the hospital admission screening by the oncology staff RN (34%). Only 6% of nutrition referrals were ordered by the providers (MDs and APNs). Most of the nutritional referrals were timely (60%) at the visit that the risk was identified; however, some referrals were made at the next visit with continued risk factors for malnutrition present (40%). Some children had medical intervention prior to a nutritional referral (n = 17).</p>
<p>Key independent variables were examined to determine the association between the independent variables and a nutritional referral. The variables examined included gender, age group, diagnosis, treatment, head/neck location, and progressive disease. Again, only 1variable, progressive disease, was significant on a Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .03). The group with a positive nutritional screen (n = 49) was further analyzed to determine the association between individual risk factors and a nutritional referral. The individual risk factors analyzed included nausea/vomiting, mucositis, pain, infection, decreased oral intake &gt;3 days, and anorexia. Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> analyses showed that all risk factors except mucositis were significantly associated with a nutrition referral (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1043454212460921">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>The location of the screening was also an important factor in nutritional referrals. The hospital RNs perform a quick nutritional screen during every visit for patients admitted to the hospital regardless of the reason (chemotherapy vs sick visit). This is a computer-based screening survey that includes current diet, current nutritional concerns, current appetite, and history of nutritional issues. Patients with defined risk factors automatically trigger a nutrition referral (parenteral or enteral feedings, loss of appetite, or any impairment in ability to eat). In addition, the pediatric oncology dietitian routinely screens all inpatients for risk factors associated with malnutrition, but this service is not available during every outpatient visit. A Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> analysis showed that inpatients were much more likely to have a nutrition referral as compared with medical intervention. In the 38 patients who received timely intervention, 71% of inpatients received nutritional referrals as compared with 29% of outpatients (<italic>P</italic> = .03).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043454212460921">
<title>Interventions Associated With a Positive Nutritional Screen</title>
<p>The majority of patients had timely intervention at the time the risk for malnutrition was identified (78%). Medical intervention included intravenous hydration, pain medication, anti-emetics, and treatment for mucositis or infection. In those patients who had timely intervention (n = 38), further analysis was done to assess whether the presence of certain risk factors were associated with the type of intervention (medical care vs a nutrition referral). Fisher’s exact test showed that patients with anorexia, infection, or an order for nothing by mouth (NPO) were more likely to have a nutritional referral (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1043454212460921">Table 6</xref>). This result was expected as most children are hospitalized for infection or NPO status. In addition, Tukey’s Hinges analysis was completed to compare the median number of risk factors associated with a medical intervention (n = 17) versus a nutrition referral (n = 21) at the time of the positive screen (total N = 38). Children with a nutrition referral had a median of 6 risk factors (range 4.5-6) as compared with those who received medical intervention who had a median of 4 risk factors (range 3-5; <italic>P</italic> = .003).</p>

<p>All patients who had a nutritional referral received a full nutritional assessment. This assessment by the pediatric oncology dietitian included client medical history, anthropometric data, diet order, food allergies, medications, food- and nutrition-related history, observations, assessment, nutrition plan, and recommendations. In addition, nutritional counseling was provided. The interventions in the groups with a nutritional referral ranged from oral supplements (89%) to parenteral nutrition (23%) and enteral feedings (10%). Patients with continued nutritional issues had nutritional follow-up and recommendations documented in the medical record.</p>

<sec id="section14-1043454212460921">
<title>Delayed or No intervention With a Positive Screen</title>
<p>The number of children with a positive screen that had delayed (Group 5) or no intervention (Group 2) was very small (n = 11). In the group with no intervention, 3 of the 5 children had only 1 episode of low albumin and no weight loss. One additional child had a 5% weight loss once, and then continued to gain weight.</p>
<p>The group with delayed intervention contained 6 children and received a nutritional referral at a later visit with continued weight loss. Although the numbers were small, Fisher’s exact test demonstrated that children with the following risk factors were more likely to receive timely intervention as compared with delayed or no intervention: nausea/vomiting (<italic>P</italic> = .007), mucositis (<italic>P</italic> = .027), and decreased oral intake for more than 3 days (<italic>P</italic> = .001).</p>
<p>In addition, Tukey’s Hinges analysis was conducted to compare the median number of risk factors associated with any intervention (n = 38) versus no intervention (n = 11) at the time of the positive screen (total N = 49). Children who received an intervention at the time of risk had a median of 5 risk factors (range 4-6) as compared with those who no intervention who had a median of 3 risk factors (range 0-5; <italic>P</italic> = .009).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nutritional support is a major component of quality care for children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer who are receiving active treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation. This study demonstrated that a majority (62%) of children and adolescents with cancer screened positive for the risk of malnutrition during the first 6 months of their treatment regimen. The risk was in patients with all types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, solid tumors, and brain tumors. In addition, all age groups were equally at risk as well as both males and females. Importantly, 22 of 49 (45%) patients that screened positive actually lost more than 10% from their baseline weight during the study period and actually met the criteria for malnutrition.</p>
<p>Patients with progressive disease were especially at risk for malnutrition. There was a statistical difference in patients with progressive disease in both a higher risk of a positive screen and nutrition referral as an intervention. This is not unexpected because of multiple additional factors including previous treatment with other agents, the increased intensity of chemotherapy treatments for progressive disease, and the actual progressive disease process that may cause cancer cachexia.</p>
<p>In addition, assessing for comorbid risk factors is a crucial part of screening for malnutrition. This study demonstrated that children with comorbid risk factors were more likely to have a positive screen, more likely to need immediate intervention, and more likely to have nutritional referrals with a documented nutritional plan. In addition, the number of risk factors present correlated with the need for medical or nutritional intervention. This study demonstrated that medical intervention was used as an immediate action to address symptoms such as vomiting, dehydration, pain, and mouth sores. Medical interventions can treat and/or reverse the risk factors for malnutrition in some patients. In other patients, continued risk factors or weight loss required nutritional assessment and intervention.</p>
<p>The interprofessional team members (providers, dietitians, and nurses) are an important component of supportive care. Multiple team members assessed for nutritional risk and identification of factors that demonstrated a potential for malnutrition. The computer-based admission nutrition screen performed by oncology nurses was important in triggering nutritional referrals by reporting risk factors described by the patients and families including anorexia, decrease oral intake, mouth sores, and weight loss. In addition, the oncology dietitian performed routine nutritional screening and provided advanced assessments of patients that were identified to be at nutritional risk.</p>
<p>Although it is widely recognized that complications of chemotherapy include major gastrointestinal complications including nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, diarrhea, changes in taste buds, and anorexia, there is not a consistent approach to nutritional assessment and nutritional intervention at most pediatric cancer centers. A recent study from the United Kingdom from 21 centers that provide pediatric cancer care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212460921">Selwood, Ward, &amp; Gibson, 2010</xref>) showed inconsistency in nutritional assessment and nutritional support. This study demonstrated that the care providers at this center were obtaining both objective and subjective data related to nutritional status routinely at monthly visits. The presence of a dedicated pediatric oncology dietitian as well as computer-based nutritional screening had a significant impact in recognition of potential malnutrition for the patients in this study.</p>
<p>Every nurse, advanced practice nurse, and physician can contribute to the assessment of nutritional risk for children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer. Weight, height, and BMI should be obtained at every visit or at least once monthly. Even if a formal physical exam is not scheduled, interactions with patients and their families almost always includes a general overview of symptoms and how the child/young adult is doing overall. Most parents are eager to mention and discuss issues regarding their child’s appetite or weight loss. The provider or nurse interacting with the patient and family at each visit has a crucial role in identifying risk factors and/or early signs of malnutrition. The primary goal for children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing cancer treatment is to sustain and promote normal growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212460921">Baggott, Fochtman, Foley, &amp; Kelly, 2011</xref>). All members of the pediatric oncology team can play a key role in assuring that nutritional care is part of the holistic and comprehensive supportive care necessary to achieve superior outcomes for every child, adolescent, or young adult diagnosed with cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1043454212460921">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>The study limitations included obtaining data from only 1 institution, and as the sample size for patients with a positive screen was small (49) it may have affected the results. Confounding factors included other conditions that affect weight such as fluid overload and fluid retention. Three children in the study experienced septic shock and fluid resuscitation resulting in weight gain, and which was not truly indicative of their nutritional status at the time. In addition, 2 adolescents in the study had above the knee leg amputations during the first 6 months of treatment and this resulted in a 9% weight loss from the surgical intervention alone (not related to nutrition). Serum albumin can also be adversely affected (lowered) by other factors than nutrition including some chemotherapy agents administered to subjects. Lastly, the study had time limitations and did not continue for the entire treatment phase for most patients, which can last as long as 3 years for patients with leukemia. Thus, the patient’s risk of malnutrition may have occurred after the first 6 months of treatment.</p>
