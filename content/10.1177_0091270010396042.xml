<abstract>
<p>Myocardial ischemia results in a decrease in oxygen supply to the heart, leading to cardiac dysfunction. Present therapeutic strategies for treating myocardial ischemia or infarction focus on maintaining coronary artery patency by either fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous intervention. Although these approaches have dramatically improved the prognosis in patients with angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, the complication of myocardial ischemia remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. A novel approach that entails improving and optimizing cardiac energy metabolism of the ischemic myocardium by pharmacologically manipulating different metabolic pathways in the heart holds promise in limiting myocardial damage. Metabolic support of the ischemic myocardium is aimed at increasing glycolysis and residual oxidative phosphorylation of glucose along with decreasing fatty acid oxidation. This review discusses the various metabolic modulators, both conventional and new, along with documented evidence in both acute and chronic angina.</p>

<body>
<p>Ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains the leading cause of death in the Western and developing world, despite the recent decline in cardiovascular mortality. Patients with chronic stable angina have an average annual mortality of 2% to 3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010396042">1</xref></sup> Chronic stable angina is the initial manifestation of IHD in approximately half of the patients. With an increase in the longevity of patients, the number of patients presenting with recurrent angina is increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010396042">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Established therapy for treating IHD includes both medical and surgical interventions. Anti-anginal agents such as nitrates, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCB), and potassium channel openers are used for management of IHD. These interventions are primarily directed toward optimizing hemodynamic effects (ie, improving the oxygen supply in relation to cardiac work in the myocardium). Although these interventions improve symptoms and quality of life in many patients with angina pectoris, there is no evidence that these agents decrease cardiac events or increase patient survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010396042">2</xref></sup> More then 64% of patients with stable angina are taking more than 1 cardiovascular drug, yet angina is present in more than 90% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010396042">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCR) (ie, angioplasty or stenting) and surgical procedures like coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) are effective in reducing the frequency of angina. Surgical interventions increase angina free exercise duration, but in comparison to existing medical therapies, these procedures: (1) do not reduce mortality or lower the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with stable angina pectoris, (2) are associated with immediate increase in mortality and morbidity, and (3) do not prevent recurrence of angina symptoms. It is estimated that more than 50% of patients experience recurrence of angina after PCR, and invariably all patients experience recurrence of symptoms 10 to 15 years following CABG procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010396042">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010396042">3</xref></sup> The management of patients with recurrence of angina often requires add-on therapy with anti-anginal drugs or a repeat PCR or CABG. Many of these patients may not be suitable for a repeat revascularization procedure because of unsuitable anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010396042">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, there is a need for new therapies for the treatment of chronic stable and acute angina in patients not responding to the existing anti-anginal drugs and surgical interventions. Metabolic modulators are an original group of drugs that are designed to improve cardiac metabolism and cardiac energy availability, which may be beneficial in the treatment of myocardial ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010396042">5</xref></sup> This review discusses the role of metabolic modulators in myocardial ischemia and dysfunction against a backdrop of metabolism of heart in both normoxic and ischemic conditions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0091270010396042">
<title>Cardiac Metabolism</title>
<p>Metabolism in the heart differs from that in other tissues, where carbohydrates provide 40% to 60% of the total energy requirements and fats 30% to 40%. In the heart under normal, healthy conditions, 60% to 70% of energy produced is attributable to fatty acid oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref></sup> The heart also derives its energy from other sources like lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies. Glucose oxidation is responsible for the production of approximately 20% of the total energy by the heart. After a meal, when glucose and insulin are elevated, glucose utilization is dominant. In the fasting state, other substrates (fatty acids, lactate, ketones) are used and glycolysis is inhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref></sup> Energy yield per gram of substrate metabolized is more with fatty acids, 37 kJ/g versus only 16 kJ/g with carbohydrates. This is at the cost of a much greater amount of oxygen consumed, 2.016 L/g with fats versus 0.829 L/g with carbohydrates. Thus, although the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) yield per mole of substrate is more with fats, the amount of oxygen required is also more, leading to an ATP/oxygen ratio of 3.0 for glucose and 2.6 for palmitate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010396042">8</xref></sup> Thus, fatty acid oxidation leads to lesser ATP yield for the same amount of oxygen consumed compared with glucose oxidation. Hence, fatty acid oxidation increases ATP production but at the cost of more oxygen consumed. This is known as the “oxygen wasting” effect of fatty acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Fat metabolism</title>
<p>Mitochondria oxidize fatty acids to provide energy for electrochemical activity and other ATP-requiring processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref></sup> Fatty acids are converted by the enzyme acyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthatase present on the outer side of outer membrane of mitochondria into their acyl CoA esters. These acyl CoA esters are transported into mitochondria for oxidation by the carnitine-dependent shuttle mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>). Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, which is localized at the inner surface of outer membrane, is responsible for conversion of acyl CoA esters into acylcarnitine, which traverses across mitochondrial inner membrane in exchange of carnitine under the action of carnitine acyl translocase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010396042">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010396042">9</xref></sup> Inside the matrix, acyl carnitine is reconverted into acyl CoA by carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT-2) present on inner side of mitochondrial inner membrane. Fatty acyl CoA undergoes β oxidation, yielding acetyl CoA residues that enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>). The reducing products formed during β oxidation and TCA are transferred to the electron transport chain within the inner mitochondrial membrane, resulting in ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup></p>

<p>Under normoxic conditions, an increase in cardiac work enhances the uptake of fatty acids and their oxidation rate. As the increase in blood flow is proportional to the increase in workload, fatty acid uptake from the vascular compartment probably keeps pace with the enhanced intracellular need of oxidizable compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Carbohydrate metabolism</title>
<p>Uptake of glucose from the blood to the heart is by glucose transporters GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>). GLUT-4 is the major glucose transporter in all insulin-responsive tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref></sup> Glucose metabolism consists of anaerobic (glycolysis) and aerobic (glucose oxidation) processes. Glycolysis is the initial sequence of reactions involved in the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, whereas glucose oxidation involves the subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>). An aerobic heart metabolizes pyruvate to acetyl CoA, which enters the TCA cycle for complete oxidation and produces ATP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010396042">5</xref></sup> Pyruvate decarboxylation is the key irreversible step in carbohydrate oxidation, catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a multiple enzyme complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [PDC]) located on the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>). It is inactivated by phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and is activated by dephosphorylation by a specific PDH phosphatase. Although the ATP produced by glycolysis is only 5% of the total ATP, it is essential for maintaining ionic stability and cell integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010396042">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0091270010396042">
<title>Relationship between fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism</title>
<p>The sources of acetyl CoA production are (1) pyruvate, by the action of PDC and (2) β oxidation of fatty acids. If the supply of acetyl CoA from β oxidation of fatty acids is increased, then the PDC is inactivated, reducing the amount of ATP generated by carbohydrate metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010396042">9</xref></sup> Acetyl CoA derived from carbohydrate metabolism depends primarily on PDC activity, whereas acetyl CoA generation from fatty acid metabolism depends on the level of circulating fatty acids and the amount of fatty acids entering into mitochondrial matrix. An increase in the level of free fatty acids (FFAs) and rate of fatty acid oxidation inhibits glucose uptake, because high levels of citrate that are formed because of an increase in fatty acid oxidation inhibit phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>) and hence decrease glycolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010396042">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010396042">11</xref></sup> Glucose oxidation is also inhibited because an increase in the level of acetyl CoA, and NADH inhibits PDH activity by activating PDH kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010396042">12</xref></sup> This decrease in glycolytic flux because of inhibition of pyruvate oxidation stimulates myocardial glycogen storage as greater fractions of glucose and glucose-6 phosphates are directed toward glycogen synthesis.</p>

<title>Cardiac Metabolism in Ischemia and Reperfusion</title>
<p>During ischemia, the reduced oxygen supply to myocardium leads to profound alterations of cardiac metabolism. The changes depend upon the severity of ischemia. In mild to moderate ischemia (ie, 20%-30% reduction in blood flow), there is a rapid reduction in mechanical work along with a decrease in ATP concentration. This decrease in myocardial contractility due to a decrease in oxygen supply is termed <italic>myocardial hibernation</italic> and is responsible for preserving the viability of myocardium during moderate ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup> The major source of acetyl CoA is fatty acid β oxidation, but nonoxidative glycolysis and lactate production continue during mild to moderate ischemia. During the early phase of ischemia, there is greater metabolism of triacylglycerol fatty acids, resulting in wasteful energy consumption, although there may not be irreversible cell damage.</p>
<p>In severe ischemia, where more than 70% blood flow is decreased, there is high rate of lactate accumulation and glycogen breakdown. A reduced supply of molecular oxygen to mitochondria results in an increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, causing suppression of β oxidation of fatty acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup> There may be accumulation of intermediates of β oxidation pathway (ie, fatty acyl CoA, acylcarnitine, and β hydroxy fatty acids).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup> Since less oxygen is being delivered, anaerobic metabolism (ie, glycolysis utilizing glycogen) is enhanced, producing a greater proportion of the heart’s ATP supply, but glucose oxidation does not increase in parallel (because of lack of oxygen), resulting in uncoupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010396042">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010396042">14</xref></sup> The pyruvate is reduced to lactate and is no longer available for the TCA. Lactate accumulates, resulting in a decrease in intracellular pH and causing cellular acidosis. This inhibits PFK, reducing glycolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010396042">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>During ischemia, the levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, and glycogen decrease with an increase in lactate content and accumulation of fatty acids in subendocardium in comparison to the subepicardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup> Ischemic changes cause more damage in the subendocardium.</p>
<p>Lack of oxygen supply to the myocardium thus has several results:</p>

<list-item><p>Abolition of β oxidation in mitochondria</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Increase in lactate, decrease in pH, and calcium overloading of cells</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Ischemia leading to accumulation of fatty acids due to inhibition of β oxidation and suppression of glucose oxidation is detrimental to heart. Myocardial infarction augments the plasma FFA levels by increasing the sympathetic drive, which is responsible for release of fatty acids from adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010396042">15</xref></sup> Circulating FFAs increase during and following episodes of ischemia. During reperfusion, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation returns to pre-ischemic level but there is an overshoot of fatty acid metabolism, increase in glycolysis, and impaired pyruvate oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010396042">14</xref></sup> A high rate of FFA β oxidation inhibits pyruvate oxidation via inhibition of PDC, resulting in uncoupling of accelerated glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation, which is responsible for the net H<sup>+</sup> ion production during reperfusion. During reperfusion, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange increases resulting in increased intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, which in turn activates the sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>+</sup> transfer causing Ca<sup>+</sup> overload intracellularly, which may contribute to postischemic contractile dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010396042">16</xref></sup> This can lead to a decrease in cardiac efficiency and function. Myocardial contractility is transiently impaired during reperfusion (a process termed <italic>stunning</italic>), gradually returning to pre-ischemic level. There is an increase in oxygen consumption during stunning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The accumulation of fatty acids and fatty acyl esters occurring during ischemia, infarction, and reperfusion is potentially harmful to the heart for the following reasons. First, a high concentration of fatty acyl moieties leads to the formation of micelles and incorporation of a large number of fatty acyl groups as micelles into membrane phospholipids, which may interfere with the physiological formation of membrane, leading to membrane instability and disruption. Second, hydrolysis is increased and formation of phospholipids impaired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010396042">6</xref></sup> These changes in levels of myocardial fatty acids and their derivatives have major consequences for the heart (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010396042">Table I</xref>).</p>

<title>GIK infusion</title>
<p>The concept of GIK therapy in protecting ischemic cardiomyocyte was introduced by Sodi-Pallares in 1962.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091270010396042">27</xref></sup> After its appearance in the literature, many clinicians adopted GIK therapy empirically mainly based on its property of avoiding arrhythmias and accelerating the process of ST resolution. High glucose concentration and insulin produce an immediate shift in the source of metabolic substrate. Insulin increases uptake of glucose by increasing expression of GLUT-4 in cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased production of pyruvate, coupling of glucose oxidation with glycolytic process, and inhibition of FFA oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091270010396042">28</xref></sup> This inhibition of β oxidation of fatty acids leads to indirect stimulation of PDH, and hence pyruvate is transformed to acetyl CoA.</p>
<p>Thus, the potential benefits of high glucose insulin potassium therapy are these:</p>

<p>GIK therapy was abandoned during the late 1970s because of lack of evidence or trials showing positive results and also because of the absence of a commercial source. In 1997, a meta-analysis of GIK trials showed a 28% reduction (confidence interval [CI], 10-43) of in-hospital mortality, from 21% to 16.1% (<italic>P</italic> = .004).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091270010396042">29</xref></sup> This meta-analysis was based on studies done before the reperfusion era. In the reperfusion era, 3 large trials were undertaken:</p>
<list id="list5-0091270010396042" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>DIGAMI (Diabetes Insulin Glucose infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial. This trial enrolled diabetic patients with acute MI who received GIK infusion, followed by long-term administration of subcutaneous insulin. A trend toward a lower in hospital mortality and a statistically significant reduction in mortality at 1-year follow-up were observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091270010396042">30</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ECLA (Estudios Clinicos Latinoamerica Trial).

<list-item><p>GIPS (Glucose Insulin Potassium Study). This was the first trial of combination of GIK with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091270010396042">32</xref></sup> In the 91.1% of patients without heart failure (Killip class 1), the 30-day mortality was 1.2% in the GIK group versus 4.2% in the control group (relative risk [RR] 0.28; 95% CI, 0.1-0.75). In the 8.9% of patients with heart failure (Killip class ≥2), the 30-day mortality was 36% in the GIK group versus 26.5% in the control group (RR 1.44; 95% CI, 0.65-3.22). It was hypothesized that this finding was attributable to the large volume load that patients received in GIPS. GIK was infused at the rate of 3 mL/kg/h in 500 mL of 20% glucose with the addition of 80 mmol of potassium chloride over a period of 8 to 12 hours along with 50 U of insulin in 50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride administered with infusion pump.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the recently concluded CREATE–ECLA multinational randomized controlled trial, involving 20 201 patients with acute MI, high-dose GIK infusion (n = 10091) consisting of 25% glucose, 50 U/L of regular insulin, and 80 mEq/L of potassium was infused at the rate of 1.5 mL/kg for 24 hours. No impact on mortality, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock was seen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091270010396042">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Insulin has a cardioprotective effect during reperfusion. Initial experiments have shown that administration of insulin during reperfusion enhances cardiomyocyte viability and reduces apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091270010396042">34</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that signaling from P13 kinase is required for the cardioprotective action of insulin in the insulin-signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091270010396042">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010396042">Figure 2</xref>). When administered during reperfusion, insulin induces the activity of cell survival, promoting signaling intermediates (ie, protein kinase β [Akt] and S6K). Insulin is also responsible for maintaining the proapoptotic peptide BAD in an inactive phosphorylated form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091270010396042">35</xref></sup> Thus, manipulation of targets like S6k and Akt in insulin-signaling pathway may be beneficial in promoting cardiomyocyte salvage in ischemia. At present there is no consensus on the status of GIK infusion in myocardial ischemia.</p>

<title>Trimetazidine (TMZ)</title>
<p>This drug is being used worldwide as add-on therapy with other anti-anginal drugs in relieving angina frequency and increasing exercise capacity.

<p>Trimetazidine is absorbed orally, partly metabolized, and largely excreted unchanged in urine; its half-life is 6 hours. Trimetazidine has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of IHD in various studies. In a study with 141 patients of stable angina, aged 65 to 66 years, TMZ was administered for 12 weeks at 20 mg 3 times daily. It was observed that TMZ increased exercise duration (<italic>P</italic> = .001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091270010396042">36</xref></sup> In a large meta-analysis based on 12 studies done between 1985 and 2001, it was concluded that TMZ significantly reduced the number of weekly anginal attacks and improved time to 1-mm segment depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091270010396042">36</xref></sup> This meta-analysis confirms the efficacy of TMZ in the treatment of stable angina, compared with placebo or conventional anti-anginal agents, as well as in monotherapy or in combination with anti-anginal drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091270010396042">36</xref></sup> Recently, in a study to investigate long-term effects of TMZ in patients with dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, it was concluded that treatment with TMZ is associated with significant improvement in left ventricular (LV) function and the remodeling process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091270010396042">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>TMZ is administered at 20 mg orally 3 times daily. To improve patient compliance, a new twice-daily modified release formulation is available that is bioequivalent to the preparation taken 3 times daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091270010396042">38</xref></sup> Main adverse effects seen so far with TMZ are gastric irritation and dyspepsia.</p>
<p>In acute coronary syndrome, the role of TMZ is inconclusive although very few series of studies have been done. In one study, 60 patients with acute MI received TMZ 60 mg (loading dose) followed by 20 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks along with reperfusion therapy. Blinded ST-segment analysis showed that there was a more marked return toward baseline 1 hour after reperfusion therapy in the TMZ group than in the control group (change 7.14 ± 3.50 mm vs 3.79 ± 1.32 mm, <italic>P</italic> = .041). Blood samples for estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and endothelin (ET-1) were taken immediately and 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours as well as 7 days after reperfusion. Results showed significant lowering of MDA and ET-1 levels (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091270010396042">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In another study, 138 patients with acute MI with ST-segment elevation without ST-segment resolution after primary percutaneous coronary intervention were divided in 2 groups (TMZ = 70, control = 68). They were compared for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs, including death, reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization) at days 30 and 180 after discharge. The LVEFs of the TMZ group at days 30 and 180 were significantly superior to those of the control group (51% ± 8% vs 45% ± 7%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; 56% ± 7% vs 49% ± 8%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091270010396042">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>These and other new small studies suggest that TMZ might be effective in patients with acute coronary syndromes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Limitations of these studies are small sample size and the fact that TMZ is not studied for effect on cardiovascular events. However, TMZ has shown beneficial effects on surrogate end points. Further large randomized studies are needed before its effects on cardiovascular events can be evaluated.</p>

<title>Ranolazine</title>
<p>Ranolazine is believed to reduce angina by partially inhibiting fatty acid oxidation; it acts in a similar way as TMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010396042">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091270010396042">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091270010396042">42</xref></sup> Ranolazine has also been found to inhibit the electron transport chain in damaged, uncoupled mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091270010396042">43</xref></sup> Emerging preclinical research suggests that ranolazine is a potent and selective inhibitor of the late sodium current, which may lead to improved cardiac efficiency. Sustained-release ranolazine has a half-life of approximately 2 hours and reaches peak plasma concentration 4 to 6 hours after ingestion. Ranolazine undergoes significant hepatic metabolism to 11 metabolites, with 70% to 75% occurring via the CYP3A isoenzyme system and 10% to 15% via the CYP2D6 pathway. Studies in humans have confirmed that CYP3A4 is the primary metabolic pathway for ranolazine. Less than 5% of ranolazine is excreted unchanged via the kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091270010396042">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two phase 3 studies in patients with angina have been performed. In the Monotherapy Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina (MARISA) trial, a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial, patients received 3 doses (500, 1000, and 1500 mg twice daily) of ranolazine and matching placebo. Time of exercise, time to onset of ST-segment depression, and time to onset of symptomatic angina were all improved with ranolazine treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091270010396042">45</xref></sup> Another trial, Combination Assessment of Ranolazine in Stable Angina (CARISA), was a randomized, 3-parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, therapy with ranolazine was added to standard anti-anginal drugs. Patients (n = 823) were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with 1 of 2 doses (750 and 1000 mg) of sustained release ranolazine or placebo. Exercise time and time to onset of symptomatic angina were significantly improved when ranolazine was administered along with atenolol, diltiazem, or amlodipine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091270010396042">46</xref></sup> The only potentially serious side effect reported was syncope, seen in patients taking 1000 mg of ranolazine daily. None of the episodes appeared to be due to ventricular arrhythmia or torsades de points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091270010396042">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most common adverse events reported in clinical trials of sustained-release ranolazine were minor and included dizziness, nausea, asthenia, and constipation. Dose-dependent QTc-interval prolongation was seen in patients in the MARISA and CARISA trials who received any dose of ranolazine. The degree of QTc-interval prolongation with ranolazine was minimal, and no patients receiving ranolazine developed torsades de pointes.</p>
<p>In acute coronary conditions, ranolazine was not found to be effective in reducing major cardiovascular events. The MERLIN-TIMI 36 randomized trial studied the effect of ranolazine on recurrent cardiovascular events in patients of non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome; results showed that the primary end point (composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or recurrent ischemia through the end of study) occurred in 696 patients (21.8%) in the ranolazine group and 753 patients (23.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.02; <italic>P</italic> = .11).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091270010396042">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ranolazine appears to have anti-arrhythmic effects; this is because of its property of inhibiting the late phase of the inward sodium current (late I<sub>Na</sub>) during cardiac repolarization, leading to low intracellular sodium and calcium overload. In the MERLIN-TIMI 36 randomized trial, treatment with ranolazine resulted in significantly lower incidences of arrhythmias. Specifically, fewer patients had an episode of ventricular tachycardia (166 [5.3%] vs 265 [8.3%]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), supraventricular tachycardia (1413 [44.7%] vs 1752 [55.0%]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), or new-onset atrial fibrillation (55 [1.7%] vs 75 [2.4%]; <italic>P</italic> = .08).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091270010396042">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ranolazine has not shown efficacy in limited trials for acute coronary syndrome, but the fact that is it a selective inhibitor of the late I<sub>Na</sub> current and affects several other cardiac ion currents (eg, late I<sub>Ca</sub>, I<sub>Kr</sub>) at therapeutic plasma concentrations should be further exploited in several other cardiac disorders.</p>

<p>Based on findings in animals, a study was conducted with DCA in patients with coronary heart disease. Dichloroacetate was infused at various doses, the average dose being 35 mg/kg over 15 minutes. All patients were in normal sinus rhythm and tolerated DCA without noticeable side effects. It was observed that DCA administration stimulated myocardial lactate utilization, increased LV stroke volume, decreased peripheral resistance, and increased myocardial efficiency in patients with coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091270010396042">52</xref></sup> No significant changes in heart rate, mean aortic pressure, LV end-diastolic pressure, or myocardial oxygen consumption were observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091270010396042">52</xref></sup> This study had certain limitations, such as including a small number of patients (N = 9) and studying varying doses of DCA (1, 10, 20, 30, 50 mg/kg); more extensive studies of DCA with large numbers of patients with heart disease are required.</p>

<title>L-Carnitine</title>
<p>L-carnitine is known chemically as (R)-3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-N, N, N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium hydroxide. L-carnitine is a chiral molecule. Carnitine controls the rate of oxidation of long-chain fatty acids by acting as a specific cofactor to facilitate the translocation of fatty acyl groups across mitochondrial membrane to the sites of β oxidation within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010396042">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010396042">2</xref></sup> L-carnitine is the biologically active isomer of carnitine; its administration is believed to protect cardiac cells against oxidative stress, hypoxia, and ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup> Although the mechanism is not clear, it is speculated that carnitine or its derivatives indirectly activate PDC by reducing the acetyl CoA/CoA ratio in the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091270010396042">53</xref></sup> and upregulating carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010396042">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091270010396042">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Carnitine Ecocardiografia Digitalizzata Infarto Miocardico (CEDIM) trial evaluated the effects of L-carnitine administration on long-term LV dilation in 472 patients with acute MI. L-carnitine was administered in a dose of 9 g/d intravenously for the first 5 days and then 6 g/d orally for the next 12 months. The results of this trial demonstrated that early and long-term administration of carnitine in patients with acute MI was effective in attenuating progressive LV dilatation. Patients treated with L-carnitine fared significantly better (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in this respect than did the control group at 3 months (end-diastolic volume increase 18% ± 2.5% vs 11% ± 2.2%; end-systolic volume increase 22.5% ± 3.2% vs 12.6% ± 3.1%) and at 12 months (end-diastolic volume increase 28.5% ± 3.1% vs 19.1% ± 2.7%; end-systolic volume increase 39.9% ± 4.2% vs 28.9% ± 3.9%) after the emergent event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0091270010396042">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the ingested dose of L-carnitine is absorbed by the small intestine, apparently by facilitative diffusion and active transport. The bioavailability of oral L-carnitine is about 15%.

Main adverse effects seen with perhexiline are nausea, dizziness (usually transient), hypoglycemia in diabetic patients and torsades de pointes (very rare), peripheral neuropathy, hepatitis/cirrhosis, extrapyramidal dysfunction, muscle weakness, and ataxia (usually occurring after ≥3 months of continuous treatment). Perhexiline was a frequently prescribed anti-anginal agent in the 1970s. Perhexiline use declined dramatically in the early 1980s following reports of hepatotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0091270010396042">60</xref></sup> and peripheral neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0091270010396042">61</xref></sup> These effects were later demonstrated to occur most commonly in patients who are “slow hydroxylators,” bearers of a genetic variant of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0091270010396042">62</xref></sup> These patients are slow metabolizers of perhexiline because of saturation of hepatic metabolic pathways, which leads to accumulation of the drug and toxicity.</p>
<p>Another CPT-1 inhibitor, oxfenicine (S-2(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine, HPG), has shown efficacy in preclinical studies in reducing myocardial infarct size. A limitation of CPT-1 inhibitors is cardiac hypertrophy on long-term administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>D-Ribose</title>
<p>During ischemia, myocardial ATP levels are decreased, leading to depressed cardiac function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0091270010396042">63</xref></sup> The correlation between decreased ATP levels and depressed myocardial performance has spurred researchers to develop methods of metabolic intervention into adenosine nucleotide degradation and/or biosynthesis in order to restore myocardial ATP levels. The presence of ribose allows the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway, the G-6-PDH enzymatic reaction, to be bypassed, leading to the production of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). This increase in PRPP levels is accompanied by accelerated cardiac adenosine nucleotide synthesis and improved global heart function. Thus, ribose restores cardiac energy reserves and positively affects myocardial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010396042">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010396042">7</xref></sup> It has been observed that even after reperfusion, myocardial content of ATP remains low for more than 72 hours.</p>
<p>In a study with 20 patients of stable angina, 3 days of treatment with ribose or placebo at a dose of 60 mg daily in 4 divided doses was given. Patients in both groups underwent 2 symptom-limited treadmill exercise tests on 2 consecutive days. Exercise testing was repeated after treatment on day 5. At that time, mean treadmill walking time until 1-mm ST-segment depression was significantly greater in the ribose than in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .002). In the ribose-treated group, the changes from baseline to day 5 in both time to ST depression and time to moderate angina were significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0091270010396042">63</xref></sup> In another double-blind, prospective, randomized, crossover design study that assessed the effect of oral D-ribose supplementation on cardiac hemodynamics and quality of life in 15 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and CHF, improvement in diastolic functional parameters and enhancement in quality of life was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010396042">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>About 88% to 100% of an oral dose of D-ribose, up to 200 mg/kg/h, is absorbed from the small intestine, from where it is distributed to various tissues of the body, including cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle. Very little first-pass metabolism occurs in the liver. Following transport into cells, D-ribose is phosphorylated to D-ribose-5-phosphate. D-ribose-5-phosphate is metabolized via a number of pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolytic pathway. Its metabolism is complex. It is also metabolized to PRPP, which is the precursor to purine nucleotides, as well as L-histidine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Patients receiving very high doses of D-ribose excrete a small fraction of the administered dose unchanged in the urine. Reported untoward effects with ribose include diarrhea, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, headache, and hypoglycemia.</p>

<title>Sarpogrelate</title>
<p>Sarpogrelate is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype 2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) antagonist. Sarpogrelate inhibits responses to 5-HT mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors such as platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation. Sarpogrelate is efficacious in animal models of thrombosis, coronary artery spasm, atherosclerosis, restenosis, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, IHD, and MI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0091270010396042">64</xref></sup></p>

In another study in patients with angina, sarpogrelate was administered at a dose of 100 mg 3 times daily in 20 patients. A treadmill exercise test was repeated after a 2-week period with or without sarpogrelate in angiographically proven stable angina.

<p>Trimetazidine is being widely prescribed worldwide as add-on therapy with conventional anti-anginal drugs. It is administered at a dose of 20 mg 3 times daily orally. The efficacy of ranolazine in patients with coronary artery disease has been established in clinical trials, and it has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with chronic angina. Dichloroacetate has shown efficacy in a limited number of pilot studies with a small number of patients. Presently, it is being used as a research tool only and is not under patent protection. D-ribose and L-carnitine, available commercially as nutritional supplements, are potentially beneficial drugs and are being evaluated to confirm their efficacy in angina patients. L-carnitine is being studied in the prevention of anthracycline-induced heart damage (phase 3) in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0091270010396042">66</xref></sup> Perhexiline is being used as a prophylactic anti-anginal agent primarily in Australia and New Zealand. Its clinical use has been limited by its narrow therapeutic index and high inter- and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability. It was outlawed in many countries because of its adverse effects in poor metabolizers. The product has been reintroduced for patients who have contraindications or have not responded to other treatments for angina. Perhexiline is available in most European countries, usually as adjunctive treatment for refractory angina in patients not suitable for, or awaiting, coronary intervention, but its use must be accompanied by serum level monitoring. Etomoxir has been investigated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in 350 patients with congestive heart failure; results showed increase in exercise time but the increase was not statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0091270010396042">67</xref></sup> The number of patients who completed the study was too small to demonstrate significant effects on exercise time.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As metabolic modulators are directed toward optimizing energy production with oxygen consumption, a metabolic approach in the treatment of IHD might find a greater role in patients with recurrent angina despite use of existing anti-anginal therapies or those who have undergone invasive cardiac procedures. These modulators may also be useful in elderly and diabetic patients who are poor candidates for surgical revascularization procedures. The clinical status of metabolic modulators in IHD will be better defined with the further conduct of randomized controlled clinical trials.</p>
