<p>A facile method for synthesis of poly ethylene glycol (PEG)-armed hyperbranched polyoxetanes is presented along with characterization and use in drug delivery. A series of hyperbranched polyoxetanes with multiple PEG arms were synthesized via a one-pot cationic ring-opening polymerization of 3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyl oxetane (EHMO) and its PEGylated derivative (EPMO), in which the feed mass ratio of EHMO to EPMO was 98:2, 96:4, 74:26, or 17:83. Characterization methods included nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. Toxicity of the synthesized polymers to human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated using the MTT assay. Formulation into particles was carried out to encapsulate the anticancer drug camptothecin using the single oil-in-water solvent evaporation method. The resulting drug encapsulated particles were evaluated for antitumor activity using HN12 cells.</p>

<p>Hyperbranched polymers and dendrimers with defined structures have been the subject of extensive research over the past decade and have drawn attention for pharmaceutical applications owing to their unique architectures and high content of reactive end groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512461470">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512461470"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512461470">12</xref></sup> Hyperbranched polymers with a wide range of structural characteristics and properties have been synthesized by different polymerization techniques such as polycondensation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512461470">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512461470">2</xref></sup> proton-transfer polymerization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512461470">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512461470">14</xref></sup> and ring-opening polymerization (ROP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512461470">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512461470"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512461470">19</xref></sup> The structural regularity of hyperbranched polymers is not as high as dendrimers, but synthesis is less complicated and more cost-effective for scale-up, thus positioning hyperbranched polymers as a promising class of vehicles for drug delivery. In particular, hyperbranched polyether polyols have inherently desirable characteristics for drug delivery because hydrophobic drugs can be encapsulated in the hydrophobic core while hydroxyls at the periphery can be functionalized for conjugation with biological targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512461470">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512461470">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911512461470"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911512461470">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poly(3-ethyl-3-(hydroxymethyl) oxetane) (P(EHMO)) is an example of a hyperbranched polyether polyol synthesized by cationic ROP that contains multiple primary hydroxyl groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512461470">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512461470"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512461470"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512461470">19</xref></sup> PEGylation has been widely implemented to modify hyperbranched polymers, dendrimers, and nanoparticles to render them biocompatible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512461470">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911512461470"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512461470">25</xref></sup> In addition to the use of branched PEG,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512461470">26</xref></sup> a shell of PEG arms on the periphery of hyperbranched P(EHMO) can be generated through polymerization of ethylene oxide initiated by surface-accessible hydroxyl groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911512461470">27</xref></sup> However, this is usually done by postpolymerization chemical modification and requires peripheral functional groups as anchor points. Inadvertently, postpolymerization PEGylation results in a decrease in the number of functional groups available for drug conjugation or additional functionalization. A strategy to integrate PEG so as to make the carrier biocompatible while maintaining a high proportion of peripheral hydroxyl groups for covalent drug loading is desirable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512461470">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Herein, we report a facile method for synthesis of PEG-armed hyperbranched polyoxetanes via one-pot cationic ROP of EHMO monomer and its PEGylated derivative (EPMO macromonomer). The motivation for incorporating PEG into EHMO prior to polymerization was to reduce synthesis steps for making biocompatible branched polymers as well as to use PEGylated monomer to modulate the structure and properties of the resultant hyperbranched polymers. In this new method, the synthesis of the hyperbranched polyoxetane core by ROP of EHMO was followed by addition of EPMO to produce a hyperbranched macromolecular architecture with PEG arms forming the corona. The synthesis method and characterization of the resultant hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO) are reported. In addition, hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO) was processed into particles for encapsulation of the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) using the single oil-in-water (o/w) solvent evaporation method. The sustained release and antitumor activity of CPT-loaded P(EHMO-EPMO) particles were examined.</p>

With reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512461470">Scheme 2</xref> for carbon atom designations, in the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of P(EHMO-EPMO)98:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512461470">Figure 1</xref>), peak <italic>a</italic> corresponds to –<underline>C</underline>H<sub>3</sub> in ethyl group, peak <italic>b</italic> corresponds to –<underline>C</underline>H<sub>2</sub>– in ethyl group, peak <italic>c</italic> corresponds to –<underline>C</underline>H<sub>2</sub>OH group, peak <italic>d</italic> corresponds to –<underline>C</underline>H<sub>2</sub>–O–, peaks <italic>e</italic> and <italic>f</italic> correspond to the repeat unit of PEG (i.e. –(<underline>C</underline>H<sub>2</sub>–<underline>C</underline>H<sub>2</sub>–O)<sub>n</sub>–), and peak <italic>g</italic> corresponds to the PEG terminal methoxy group (–O–<underline>C</underline>H<sub>3</sub>).

<p>DB is a key parameter determining the properties of hyperbranched polymers. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911512461470">Table 1</xref>, DB of P(EHMO-EPMO) increases with increasing EPMO wt% in the reaction. As expected for P(EHMO-EPMO) polymers based on EPMO/mPEG 2000, increasing the amount of EPMO macromonomer results in an increase in molecular weight for copolymers. P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83 has a molecular weight of 7.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> g mol<sup>−1</sup>, which is the lowest among the synthesized polymers. The use of EPMO/mPEG 550 partly accounts for this observation.</p>
<p>FT-IR spectroscopy was used for qualitative characterization of functional groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911512461470">Figure 2</xref>, P(EHMO-EPMO) generally displays a strong peak at 2880 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to C–H stretching, a peak at 1110 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to C–O stretching, and a peak at 1740 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to C=O stretching. As the number of C–O bonds increases due to the incorporation of PEG chains, the absorption peak at 1110 cm<sup>−1</sup> becomes broader.</p>

<p>DSC was conducted to elucidate thermal behavior of branched P(EHMO-EPMO)s and controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911512461470">Tables 1</xref> and Table S1 (Supplementary file available online)). The core P(EHMO) shows an endotherm in the first cycle at 43°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461470">Figure 3</xref>). Considering the high density of peripheral hydroxyl groups, the transition is assigned to a <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> due to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded glass during solidification from solution.

<p>Substitution of hydroxyl groups in the P(EHMO) core with polymerized EPMO resulted in a decrease of <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> for EHMO/EPMO copolymers. Remarkably, only 2 wt% of EPMO (2000 Da) results in the disappearance of the core <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> and the appearance of a new <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> at −34°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911512461470">Figure 4</xref>). Increasing the wt% of EPMO (2000 Da) to 4% and 26% results in a small melting endotherm at 50°C–55°C during the first heating cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512461470">Figure 3</xref>). Given that linear mPEG2000-NH<sub>2</sub> (Figure S2 (Supplementary file available online)) has a <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> at 52°C, the small melting endotherms for the 4 and 26 wt% compositions may be due to <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> for a crystalline phase formed by the EPMO arms. These melting transitions were not observed in the second cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911512461470">Figure 4</xref>). Regardless of heating cycle, <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> values for 4 and 26 wt% EPMO compositions were −21°C and −25°C, respectively. P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83 has the highest EPMO composition, which was constructed on the basis of mPEG550-NH<sub>2</sub>. Unlike its linear control mPEG550-NH<sub>2</sub> (Figure S3 (Supplementary file available online)) that shows a <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> at 12°C, P(EHMO-EPMO) 17:83 only has a <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> at −55°C. Despite a high EPMO content, the EHMO core apparently inhibits crystallization. The lower <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> suggests a higher chain mobility for shorter P(EPMO) arms.</p>

<title>Characterization of drug-loaded P(EHMO-EPMO) particles</title>
<p>P(EHMO-EPMO) and CPT-loaded P(EHMO-EPMO) particles were prepared using the single o/w solvent evaporation method, and their morphology and size were characterized using SEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS), respectively. According to DLS measurements, the diameter of P(EHMO-EPMO) particles ranged from 361 to 1078 nm. SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512461470">Figure 5</xref>) show that the particles were mostly spherical before drug encapsulation and became oval after drug encapsulation. Furthermore, the size of the drug-loaded particles was much larger than that of the blank particles. The size increase and shape change are attributed to drug encapsulation as well as a change in event of aggregation of particles in the presence of drug. Drug LE and particle EE were generally high, ranging from 60% to 80% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883911512461470">Table 2</xref>). Drug loss during drug loading into particles was due to resuspension of drug-loaded particles in water and subsequent centrifugation, causing removal of released or unencapsulated CPT.</p>

<title>Cytotoxicity of hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO)s</title>
<p>The cytotoxicity of hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO) polymers to human dermal fibroblasts was examined. The MTT assay results clearly indicate that cytotoxicity is dependent on dose and EPMO composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0883911512461470">Figure 6</xref>). Among the range of the doses from 10 to 300 µg/mL, P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 and P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83 are more cytocompatible than P(EHMO-EPMO)98:2 and P(EHMO-EPMO)96:4. Only 26.7% cells remained viable after being treated with 10 µg/mL P(EHMO-EPMO)98:2 for 48 h, and the cell viability dropped to 4.4% when the concentration of P(EHMO-EPMO)98:2 increased to 300 µg/mL. A marginal increase in percentage of EPMO did not improve the cytocompatibility of the hyperbranched polymer. P(EHMO-EPMO)96:4 displays a similar level of dose-dependent toxicity as compared to P(EHMO-EPMO)98:2. However, the cytocompatibility of P(EHMO-EPMO) was significantly enhanced as the EPMO composition was increased to 26 or 83 wt%. The viability of HN12 cells was 55.1% in the presence of 300 µg/mL P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83. The cells remained viable as high as 86.6% as the concentration of P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83 was reduced to 10 µg/mL The cytocompatibility of P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 is similar to that of P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83, although it has a lower percentage of EPMO in the branched structure than P(EHMO-EPMO)17:83. Using P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 as an example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911512461470">Figure 7</xref>), the cell morphology observed was consistent with the cell viability assay. As the dose of P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 was increased, more cells were round and detached or lysed, indicating cell viability loss. In general, a cell viability of 80% or higher indicates good cytocompatibility of the tested polymers at dosage levels (10 µg/mL or lower), which could be used for in vivo testing.</p>

<title>Drug release and antitumor effect of CPT following release</title>
<p>CPT has poor aqueous solubility and antitumor activity can be impaired due to hydrolysis and conversion from a therapeutically active lactone form to an inactive carboxylate form. Encapsulating CPT into particles helps increase CPT stability and sustain its antitumor activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512461470">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911512461470">31</xref></sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0883911512461470">Figure 8</xref>, the release kinetics of CPT from P(EHMO-EPMO) particles follows a similar pattern regardless of P(EHMO-EPMO) composition. Almost 100% of the encapsulated drug was released over 9 days. An initial burst release of CPT from P(EHMO-EPMO) particles occurred in the first 5 h, followed by a sustained slower release. Since CPT is hydrophobic, a hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the hydrophobic core of P(EHMO-EPMO) is presumed responsible for the sustained drug release.</p>

<p>The antitumor effect on HN12 cells, derived from metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, was evaluated for P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 drug-loaded particles. HN12 cells were cultured in the presence of 10 µg/mL drug-loaded P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 particles for 12, 24, 48, or 72 h. The cellular enzymatic activity was quantified with the MTT assay. HN12 cells treated with blank P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 particles under the same condition were also assessed to study the effect of particles alone on the cells. A marked decrease in the cellular activity of HN12 cells was observed as the incubation with drug-loaded particles was extended from 12 to 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0883911512461470">Figure 9</xref>). Cell viability was reduced to 20% by 12 h incubation of drug-loaded particles and further reduced to 1% by 72 h incubation. This study suggests that longer incubation along with sustained release of CPT results in higher toxicity for HN12 cells. In vitro, 50% of the encapsulated CPT was released from P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 particles in 56 h and complete drug release took over 200 h. Taken together, it is expected that the sustained release beyond 72 h would result in complete cell death. Although the dose of drug-loaded particles remains to be optimized, the above-mentioned studies demonstrate high potency of the encapsulated drug due to sustained release.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the cellular activity of HN12 cells was reduced initially, as measured at 12 h post incubation with blank P(EHMO-EPMO)74:26 particles, but recovered following longer incubations. For example, 81% cell viability remained at 72 h post treatment, indicating the adjustment of the cells to the addition of particles and the relatively low toxicity of particles themselves to the cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Drug delivery carriers are commonly modified with PEG to gain favorable biological compatibility. PEGylation of drug carriers can be accomplished in two ways: directly grafting PEG to the carrier or forming PEG arms through polymerization of ethylene oxide. To efficiently couple PEG to the branched structures and keep the degree of PEGylation as low as possible, we explored a new route to synthesize PEGylated polyether polyols via a two-step cationic ring-opening copolymerization of EHMO and PEGylated EHMO (i.e. EPMO). In our reaction scheme, a hyperbranched polyether P(EHMO) core was formed by ROP of EHMO, driven by the nucleophilic attack of either the oxygen atom in the ring or the hydroxyl group of EHMO. Since the hydroxyl group of EPMO was substituted with PEG, the reaction was continued by the nucleophilic attack of the oxetane oxygen atom of EPMO. As a result, some new branches with one PEG chain on each branch were generated.</p>
<p>To understand how EPMO affects the resultant polymers, the mass ratio of EHMO to EPMO in polymerization was varied from 98:2 to 17:83. The resulting hyperbranched polyether polyols were found to have a range of properties and structural characteristics including molecular weight, DB, and glass transition temperature. The PEGylated carrier became more cytocompatible and water soluble as more EPMO was included. Our studies confirmed that incorporation of PEG into EHMO prior to polymerization limited PEGylation to a small portion of the branches, while at the same time enabling improvement of the cytocompatibility for the carrier. Mechanistic understanding of polymerization with the participation of PEGylated monomer will be sought in future studies for improved nanoscale and microscale control of such structures. In addition, the multiple hydroxyl end groups in P(EHMO-EPMO) could be utilized for covalently coupling drugs or other functional moieties of interest. Our future studies will include optimization and biofunctionalization of P(EHMO-EPMO) for efficient drug delivery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A series of core–shell amphiphilic hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO) polymers were prepared via a one-pot sequential cationic ring-opening copolymerization of EHMO and its PEGylated derivative. The structure characteristics and properties of the hyperbranched copolyoxetanes, such as DB, molecular weight, and glass transition temperature were varied by changing the mass ratio of EHMO to EPMO. P(EHMO-EPMO) polymers became more cytocompatible with the increase in the percentage of EPMO. Particles for delivery of CPT were formulated from core–shell, hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO) copolyoxetanes, and the anticancer drug CPT using the single o/w solvent evaporation method. Sustained in vitro release of CPT was achieved for nine days. The encapsulated CPT exerted antitumor activity upon release from P(EHMO-EPMO) particles. In summary, hyperbranched P(EHMO-EPMO) can be engineered to possess biologically favorable properties and formulated for delivery of water-insoluble anticancer drugs.</p>
