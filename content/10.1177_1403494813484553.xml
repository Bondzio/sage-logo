<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The structural reform in Denmark in 2007 led to fundamental changes in the organisation of tasks within health care. The previous 271 municipalities were amalgamated into 98 new municipalities that were given a stronger role in regards to prevention, health promotion, and rehabilitation outside of hospitals in addition to important roles in long-term care. Five new regions were created to replace the 13 counties. The regions assumed responsibility for hospital care and other specialised care. With the new and larger role for municipalities followed a municipal co-financing, which means that municipalities must pay a share of the costs each time an individual is admitted to a regional hospital. The idea behind the municipal co-financing is to create incentives for municipalities to increase preventive services in order to reduce hospitalisation. The underlying theoretical assumption is that municipalities are relatively rational entities that react to changes in economic incentives and seek to optimise their strategy for delivering health care services in a situation of budget constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484553">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to provide a preliminary answer to the question of whether the economic incentives introduced by the municipal co-financing of hospital services work as intended in the reform. There are essentially two issues: are the municipalities reacting to the incentives by increasing their efforts in public health after the reform? and is there a systematic relationship between municipal public health efforts and the frequency of admissions to regional hospitals? An indication of the answer to the first question can be found in a recent survey conducted by the Danish Institute for Governmental Research (AKF) in collaboration with researchers from University of Copenhagen and University of Southern Denmark among municipal health managers in all municipalities of the country. The survey shows that 48% of local authorities estimate that the local co-financing to some extent has had an impact on their health strategy, while 22% estimate that it has had a substantial impact on their health strategy. The survey also shows that the municipalities have upgraded both the patient-oriented and the citizen-oriented prevention. This is further supported by growing expenditures on public health among the municipalities, as shown by the national level data of municipal health expenditures excluding payments for regional hospitals (ECO ratios). All in all it appears that the municipalities are increasing their public health efforts after the reform.</p>
<p>The following analysis provides answers to the second question about the relationship between increased municipal efforts and the frequency of hospitalisation. The study is relevant both in the Danish policy setting and in Norway due to the introduction of a similar scheme of municipal co-payment from January 2012. In a more theoretical light, the study is interesting as an investigation of responses to changes in economic incentives to encourage prevention activities in a multilevel and multisector decision setting.</p>
<p>Research on the effects of municipal co-financing as an economic incentive is limited partly because it is a relatively recent phenomenon. The Danish municipalities were first exposed to the co-financing scheme in the structural reform in 2007, and the Norwegian reform was not implemented until 2012. In 2011 The Danish Institute for Health Services Research (DSI) studied municipal options for preventing hospital admissions in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484553">2</xref>]. The study describes the methods and models for preventing admissions on the basis of existing knowledge in the area with the purpose of providing an overview of the field. The conclusion was that there have only been relatively few systematic evaluations of the impact of different interventions on hospitalisation patterns. The report shows that preventing re-admissions through follow-up home visits is the concept whose effect is best documented, but that evaluations indicate that the potential of follow-up home visits is strongly influenced by the quality of local management and implementation.</p>
<p>Vrangbæk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484553">3</xref>] studied collaboration practices between regions and municipalities focusing on elderly patients with complex medical needs. Vrangbæk concludes that economic incentives (including municipal co-payment), mandatory health care agreements, and professional norms are all important for municipal conduct.</p>
<p>Pedersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484553">4</xref>] analysed whether there was a link between local efforts within public health and the consumption of health services based on data from 2002 and Pedersen concluded that it is not possible to detect a relationship and thus put into question whether municipalities have the opportunity to influence the number of admissions. It may be argued that Pedersen uses a design that makes it relatively unlikely to find a correlation between local efforts and consumption of health services. Firstly, the study includes all age groups, although the local efforts in the study design primarily are expected to affect older citizens’ care consumption. Secondly, the study is based on data from 2002 which is prior to the implementation of the structural reform. Finally, Pedersen’s study only includes data for a single year, which reduces the validity of the findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494813484553" sec-type="methods">
<title>Design and methods</title>
<p>The design for the present study is inspired by Pedersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484553">4</xref>], but differs in several important ways. First, the correlation is solely based on admissions among the elderly (age 67+), since this is the most relevant group for preventing (re)hospitalisation (see below). Second, in contrast to Pedersen this study measures both the number of primary admissions and the number of readmissions, which together increases the likelihood of identifying a possible effect of local efforts. Third, this study is based on data collected after the structural reform, where the municipalities face stronger incentives to invest in effective prevention and care efforts. Fourth, the present study also examines the relationship of three years, 2008, 2009, and 2010, which increases the likelihood of detecting a correlation. Finally the present study includes new indicators for care and prevention that have been developed after 2007.</p>
<p>The chosen design is therefore both more sensitive and more likely to provide an accurate estimate of the relationship between local public health efforts and the number of hospitalisations.</p>
<p>The study is based on 30 statistical cross-section linear regressions, OLS, where the data is obtained from Statistics Denmark (Statistikbanken) and the Municipal Financial Accounts. The analysis is limited to the elderly (age 67+). The main hypothesis is that: “<italic>An increased municipal effort within public health will lead to a relatively lower number of hospitalisations among elderly within the municipality</italic>”. The dependent variables are operationalised as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813484553">Table I</xref>, and based on the main hypothesis, the specific expectations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813484553">Table II</xref>.</p>

<p>The relationship between local activities and the number of admissions will be evaluated based on the number of primary admissions and the number of re-admissions among 67+ year olds. A re-admission is defined as an acute hospitalisation occurring within 30 days after discharge from a previous admission. A primary admission is an admission where the patient has not been hospitalised within a period of 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484553">5</xref>]. Including both types of admissions increases the likelihood of identifying a correlation. In addition, both types of admission are important for the municipalities, as they co-pay in both cases. We include four different diagnostic groups to investigate whether municipalities have greater success in preventing admissions for some groups than for others. The four diagnostic groups have been selected on the basis of the “Elderly Documentation Project”, a joint project from 2008 by the Ministry of Welfare, the Ministry of Finance, Statistics Denmark, and the Local Government Association. The diagnoses groups were identified as particularly relevant for interventions at the municipal level and therefore most likely to show a correlation with municipal intervention levels. The four selected diagnosis groups are: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dehydration, pneumonia, and fractures.</p>
<p>The number of nursing homes, recipients of home care, and number of scheduled contact hours of home help have previously been used to identify the local health action [4]. These variables are therefore also considered to be relevant to include in this study. Indicators of preventive home visits, number of recipients of rehabilitation and function sustaining care and the average waiting time for care homes are new indicators that were first published in 2009.</p>
<p>The study has been carried out as so-called “most likely” tests where the likelihood of capturing effects is maximised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484553">6</xref>]. This means that in relation to the delimitation of the problem and operationalisation of the independent and dependent variables, we have consistently selected solutions that maximise the likelihood of establishing a link between local action and the number of primary admissions and readmissions. If the result can be confirmed in relation to the analyses in our study, it can give rise to tougher tests to investigate their validity range. If the hypotheses however, are not supported by the analysis, it is a fairly convincing rejection (falsification) of the hypotheses.</p>
<p>Another option would have been to use a panel data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484553">7</xref>]. The reason for de-selecting panel data analysis is firstly that a descriptive review of the independent and dependent variables shows that there is no great variation in the independent and dependent variables in the three years. Secondly, the study looks at the changes since the structural reform in 2007, a relatively short period of time. A third reason for the de-selection of the panel data analysis is that several of the indicators in the health and care of the elderly do not exist for all 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484553">7</xref>].</p>
<p>A panel data analysis would also not make it possible to include all relevant control variables included in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484553">7</xref>]; the average number of days a patient is hospitalised, the number of divorced aged 65+, the number of unmarried aged 65+, the average age of 65+, the number aged 75+, the number aged 85+, income, the number of women aged 65+, death rate, population per 1 January, density (population/km<sup>2</sup>), and distance to nearest hospital. Further more we have used fixed effects for regions to control for variation at the supply side.</p>
<p>The study is limited to patient-oriented prevention, focusing on the elderly. This delineation is chosen because the elderly account for a large and growing number of hospitalisations. Furthermore, we observe that efforts targeting the elderly are mainly focused on tertiary prevention, where the effects will be observed relatively quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484553">4</xref>]. This means that the study will not be looking at the citizen-oriented prevention, particularly lifestyle changes, including diet, smoking, alcohol, and exercise, as it will be too early to examine the effects on the number of admissions.</p>
<p>Finally, the study is performed at the municipal level, and the purpose is therefore only to draw conclusions at the municipal level and not at the individual level.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813484553">Table III</xref> presents the results of the analysis where the dependent variable is the number of <italic>primary admissions</italic> for the four selected diagnostic groups and the index for the total number of primary admissions. The results show first that there is a correlation between the number of senior housing and the index of the total number of primary admissions and hospitalisations for COPD in 2008 and the number of senior housing and the index of the total number of primary admissions in 2009, but this correlation is in the reverse direction and there is no correlation between the number of senior housing and hospitalisations for either fractures, dehydration, or pneumonia, thus raising critical questions about the validity of the measure. Second, the results show a correlation between the average scheduled contact hours of home care per week and hospitalisation for dehydration, but again this is in the reverse direction and the correlation is not reflected in 2009 and 2010 which again poses critical questions to the strength of the relationship.</p>

<p>Second, it is seen that there is a correlation between the average scheduled contact hours of home care per week and hospitalisation for dehydration in both 2008 and 2009, but the correlation is in the reverse direction and the correlation is not found in 2010, which again poses critical question about the strength of the relationship.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The previously mentioned survey by the Danish Institute of Governmental Research (AKF) indicated that municipalities are reacting to the incentives introduced after the structural reform. However, the results from the analysis presented above show that there are no clear links between municipal public health efforts and the number of hospital admissions from the municipality. This presents a puzzle in regards to the interpretation of conduct among the municipalities. Are municipalities irrational in the sense that they are increasing their efforts without clear indications of benefits in terms of lower hospitalisation frequency? Several answers can be presented to this puzzle.</p>
<p>First, it may be too early to detect the results of the increased municipal efforts. Many prevention efforts are likely to take effect in the medium to long term. However, we consciously selected elderly citizens where interventions to prevent hospitalisation are most likely to be effective also in the short run.</p>
<p>Other explanations may be found if we turn to the discussion about underlying theoretical assumptions for municipal decision making. Using Public Choice Theory we may speculate on the motives of local politicians and administrators rather than considering municipalities as a unitary rational actor. Local politicians may have an interest in investing in public health if it increases their influence and voter support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484553">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484553">9</xref>]. Public managers may have an interest in investing in public health if it increases the size of the local budgets and provides more interesting jobs (typically development oriented and/or with higher professional status and career potential) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484553">10</xref>]. Local politicians and public managers can thus, on the basis of public choice theory, have an interest in investing in public health even if it does not immediately have an effect on the number of admissions.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation may be found in sociological new-institutionalism theory. This theory emphasises the normative basis for action (logic of appropriateness) in addition to rational considerations (logic of consequentiality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484553">11</xref>]. Using this line of thinking we can argue that municipal decision makers react to cultural/normative pressures to step up public health efforts even if the immediate benefits are somewhat uncertain. According to DiMaggio and Powel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484553">12</xref>] such pressures can come from the professional community (normative isomorphism); as a result of top down pressure from national level regulators and actors such as the association of municipalities (coercive isomorphism) or by reacting to uncertainty by imitating other organisations that appear to be on the forefront (mimetic isomorphism). It is plausible that all three mechanisms play a role in the present situation of uncertainty about the most appropriate means to reach the aim.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite the favourable conditions presented by the design of our analysis, it is not possible to demonstrate a clear link between local efforts and number of admissions from the municipalities. It has therefore not been possible to empirically support one of the fundamental theoretical assumptions behind the municipal co-financing introduced in the 2007 structural reform in Denmark. This is consistent with Pedersen’s study of 2005, which also failed to identify a link between local efforts within public health and the number of admissions.</p>
<p>While the study failed to establish systematic links between municipal public health efforts and hospitalisation levels, it appears from other studies that municipalities are in fact increasing their activities in public health. This presents a theoretical puzzle, as we would have expected limited activity due to the uncertainty about economic benefits of prevention efforts.</p>
<p>We suggested several possible explanations for this puzzle, but are unable to test the explanations within the scope of this paper. The implementation of the Norwegian “Samhandlingsreform” from 2012, and the experience from previous Swedish reforms provide interesting opportunities to further investigate such issues empirically and in a comparative light.</p>
