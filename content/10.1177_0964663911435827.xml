<p>Even as transitional justice struggles to deliver on its original promises of truth, justice and reconciliation, more demands are being placed on it. Over the past several years, the transitional justice ‘industry’ has embraced holistic approaches that have it doing ever more. This article critically examines transitional justice’s recent attention towards historically constructed socio-economic inequalities. It begins by looking at the shift in transitional justice discourse and practice with respect to economic and social rights. Next, it discusses the arguments made for transitional justice’s engagement with those rights and looks at efforts by truth commissions and administrative reparations programmes to address them. Finally, it argues that transitional justice should avoid directly addressing past socio-economic wrongs and explores some alternate paths.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Writing in 2002, one scholar bemoaned the fact that transitional justice was ‘not concerned with measuring and overcoming the persistent effects of unjust advantage from the past on social and economic relations under the successor regime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663911435827">Meister, 2002</xref>: 97). That is no longer the case. In an influential public lecture in 2006, Louise Arbour, then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called on transitional justice to ‘make the gigantic leap’ that would enable justice to be fully realized in post-authoritarian and post-conflict societies:<disp-quote>
<p>Transitional justice must have the ambition of assisting the transformation of oppressed societies into free ones by addressing the injustices of the past through measures that will procure an equitable future. It must reach to, but also beyond the crises and abuses committed during the conflict which led to the transition, into the human rights violations that pre-existed the conflict and caused, or contributed to it. When making that search, it is likely that one would expose a great number of violations of economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights and discriminatory practices. (2006: 3–4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several scholars and practitioners have heeded that call.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0964663911435827">1</xref>
</sup> The <italic>International Journal of Transitional Justice</italic> devoted a special issue to transitional justice and development in 2008, and the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) published an edited collection on the same topic in 2009 (in the aptly named series ‘Advancing Transitional Justice’). In the past several years, Morocco (with funding from the European Union) has provided community reparations to 11 regions that were economically marginalized (i.e. excluded from development programmes) during the period from 1956 to 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663911435827">ICTJ, 2009</xref>: 24–28, 42).</p>
<p>Even as transitional justice struggles to deliver on its original promises of truth, justice and reconciliation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663911435827">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0964663911435827">Thoms et al., 2010</xref>), more and more demands are being placed on it. Rama Mani, for example, insists that transitional justice ‘will lose credibility in the predominantly impoverished and devastated societies where it operates’ if it does not tackle social injustice, corruption, resource exploitation and criminal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663911435827">2008</xref>: 253–254). Mani is in good company (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663911435827">Carranza, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663911435827">Cavallaro and Albuja, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663911435827">Duthie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663911435827">Gready, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663911435827">Laplante, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663911435827">Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0964663911435827">Muvingi, 2009</xref>). Over the past several years, the transitional justice ‘industry’ has embraced holistic approaches that have it doing ever more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663911435827">Gready, 2010</xref>: 7; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663911435827">Fletcher and Weinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0964663911435827">UN, 2004</xref>: para. 26). This is exemplified by the ICTJ’s recent efforts to link transitional justice to the development and peace-building enterprises (which also happen to be better funded).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0964663911435827">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>I am wary of efforts to have transitional justice tackle historically constructed socio-economic inequalities. For, as Mani herself acknowledges, ‘existing TJ mechanisms are already overcharged, their responsibilities too heavy, public expectations too unrealistic and finances already too lean’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663911435827">2008</xref>: 255). In this article, I examine transitional justice’s turn towards economic and social wrongs. I start by looking at the recent shift in transitional justice discourse and practice with respect to economic and social (ESC)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0964663911435827">3</xref>
</sup> rights. Here, I explain why transitional justice initially ignored ESC rights and why it is now considering them. Next, I critically discuss transitional justice’s engagement with ESC rights, with an emphasis on the two mechanisms that have gone the furthest in addressing violations of ESC rights: truth commissions and administrative reparations programmes. Finally, I raise several concerns about well-meaning efforts to have transitional justice address past socio-economic wrongs and then consider alternate approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0964663911435827">
<title>Neglecting Economic and Social Rights</title>
<p>There are several reasons why transitional justice has historically tended to neglect economic and social wrongs. First, transitional justice has been heavily influenced by human rights and, as such, has replicated that discipline’s longstanding legalistic bias towards civil and political rights, which are seen as more amenable to both ‘naming and shaming’ (in the court of public opinion) and more justiciable (in a court of law) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663911435827">Arbour, 2006</xref>: 6–7, 10–13).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0964663911435827">4</xref>
</sup> In Ken Roth’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0964663911435827">2004</xref>) classic (and heavily contested) formulation, it is easier to identify violations, violators, and remedies when it comes to civil and political rights. Furthermore, a violations approach does not easily lend itself to remedying structural inequalities and exclusions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663911435827">Hayner, 2010</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>Second, the rise of transitional justice has been profoundly shaped by criminal justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663911435827">Arbour, 2006</xref>: 3), particularly the concomitant development of international criminal law, which mostly treats those civil and political rights linked to bodily integrity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0964663911435827">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998</xref>: articles 6–8). International criminal law emphasizes individual criminal responsibility rather than structural causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663911435827">Miller, 2008</xref>: 275). Not surprisingly then, there have been very few prosecutions under international criminal law for massive violations of ESC rights (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663911435827">Arbour, 2006</xref>: 16–17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0964663911435827">UN OHCHR, 2008</xref>: 1–2, n. 5). Overall, international criminal law conceptualizes justice in narrow terms as accountability and procedural fairness (due process). In her speech, Arbour criticized United Nation Secretary General Kofi Annan for adopting this narrow formulation of justice in his important 2004 report on transitional justice (2006: 4–5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0964663911435827">UN, 2004</xref>: para. 7).</p>
<p>Third, transitional justice has often played the role of handmaiden to ‘liberal peacebuilding’, which applies the liberal peace thesis – that market democracies are less likely to go to war – from inter-state to intra-state conflicts. The notion is that political and economic liberalization promotes sustainable and ‘positive’ peace. Consequently, liberal peacebuilding efforts are directed at building the rule of law, instituting electoral democracy, and carrying out neoliberal economic reforms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0964663911435827">Newman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0964663911435827">Paris, 2004</xref>). Gready (2010a: 233) faults transitional justice for having been partly co-opted by the globalized neoliberal agenda, which largely ignores ESC rights.</p>
<p>Finally, the initial absence of ESC rights is explicable in terms of transitional justice’s intellectual history. Transitional justice emerges out of the late 20th-century political transitions from authoritarian to democratizing regimes in Eastern Europe and the Southern Cone. At the time, those transitions were conceptualized as relatively short-term affairs. As such, economic change was something for successor regimes to tackle <italic>after </italic>the transition period had produced new (and presumably more democratic) constitutions, laws, and institutions. In addition, scholar-activists working on transitions focused on ‘legal-institutional reform, rather than transformation at the socio-economic level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663911435827">Arthur, 2009</xref>: 347). Furthermore, communism’s collapse and the Left’s decline had discredited redistributive politics. As John Torpey points out, ‘reparations politics’ (which includes transitional justice)<disp-quote>
<p>is a product of particular historical circumstances – in particular, it is a response to a post-utopian context that differs sharply from the period that preceded it – and seeks to achieve some of the aims of the progressive agenda through a focus on righting the past rather than on the basis of the kind of idealized vision of the human future that drove much that went before it. (2006: 7; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663911435827">Galanter, 2002</xref>: 121)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This historical and intellectual context helps explain why ‘prosecutions, truth-telling, restitution, and reform of abusive state institutions – not some other measures of justice, such as those associated with claims for distributive justice – were recognized as the legitimate justice initiatives’ in political transitions (Arthur, 2009: 326, emphasis in the original).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0964663911435827">
<title>Engaging Economic and Social Rights</title>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been increasing criticism of transitional justice for its neglect of socio-economic wrongs and a related push to have it deal with those wrongs. As noted above, Arbour’s call for transitional justice to engage with such wrongs has resonated with influential transnational advocacy networks (including the International Center for Transitional Justice and the <italic>International Journal of Transitional Justice</italic>). So, how do we explain this shift? First, the international human rights movement has increasingly championed socio-economic rights and their justiciability, which has enhanced its appeal and relevance in the Global South.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0964663911435827">5</xref>
</sup> Second, recent years have seen the ‘end of the transition paradigm’ as many post-authoritarian and post-conflict regimes have stalled in a political ‘grey zone’ that is neither authoritarian nor democratic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663911435827">Carothers, 2002</xref>). As a result, the emphasis on legal-institutional reforms (typified by rule of law programmes) is being supplemented by more socio-economic interventions (such as legal empowerment) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663911435827">Carothers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663911435827">Golub, 2010</xref>). Third, the global economic crisis has taken the shine off neoliberal economics, which forms a pillar of liberal peacebuilding. Fourth, post-conflict programming (including transitional justice) increasingly emphasizes the need for holistic, complementary approaches (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663911435827">Boraine, 2006</xref>). The United Nations has championed ‘integrated’ strategies that bring together peace, justice, development, and security considerations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0964663911435827">UN, 2011</xref>). For transitional justice scholars and practitioners, holism appears to offer a way out of hard dilemmas (truth versus justice, peace versus justice). It also promises to replace competition over donor funding (transitional justice <italic>versus</italic> development) with complementary linkages (transitional justice <italic>and</italic> development).</p>
<p>Arbour makes both a normative and an instrumental case for including gross violations of ESC rights in transitional justice. First, she argues for the indivisibility of human rights. While states have repeatedly affirmed that principle (most fatuously at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights in 1993), it has yet to become anything approaching customary international law. Even if we assume rights are indivisible, that offers no guidance on which rights to prioritize in the context of fragile transitions and limited resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0964663911435827">6</xref>
</sup> A recent empirical study found that a successor regime’s choice of transitional justice mechanism is positively correlated with its economic health: poorer countries were more likely to select cheaper transitional justice mechanisms (amnesties and truth commissions) over more expensive ones (trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663911435827">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>: 77).</p>
<p>Second, Arbour argues from an instrumental perspective that transitional justice will not have a sustainable impact if it ignores ESC rights:<disp-quote>
<p>Given transitional justice’s additional objective of bringing about social transformation that will prevent a resurgence of conflict, it is not only important to build dispute resolution institutions, but perhaps even more effective to attack the sources of the legitimate grievances that, if unaddressed, are likely to fuel the next conflagration. (2006: 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This argument is problematic on two grounds. For one thing, the extent to which poverty, inequality, and ESC wrongs drive armed conflict is highly debated among social scientists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663911435827">Berdal and Malone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0964663911435827">Stewart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0964663911435827">Thoms and Ron, 2007</xref>). For another thing, Arbour assumes what she needs to demonstrate: that transitional justice actually has the aim and ability to ‘[bring] about social transformation’.</p>
<p>What is conspicuously absent from Arbour’s speech is any mention of what the victims supposedly served by transitional justice actually want (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0964663911435827">Shaw and Waldorf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0964663911435827">Nee and Uvin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0964663911435827">Weinstein et al., 2010</xref>). When asked, victims often prioritize present economic needs. For example, an attitudinal survey of Nepalese victims found that they listed their ‘immediate needs’ as compensation (24%), education (17%), housing and clothing (12%), employment (8%), locating the disappeared (7%), and punishing perpetrators (3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663911435827">ICTJ, 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663911435827">Robins, 2009</xref>). In other words, victims wanted reparative and distributive justice more than retributive justice. Surveys in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0964663911435827">Robins 2011b</xref>), northern Uganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663911435827">Pham et al., 2007</xref>) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0964663911435827">Vinck and Pham, 2008</xref>) have produced similar results. As the authors of the Congo study wrote: ‘As long as basic survival needs are not met and safety is not guaranteed, social reconstruction programs, including transitional justice mechanisms, will not be perceived as a priority and will lack the level of support needed for their success’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0964663911435827">Vinck and Pham, 2008</xref>: 404; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 31). These findings suggest that everyday injustices rooted in historical inequalities may be as important, if not more important, for many survivors than the extraordinary injustices of gross human rights abuses. Or as one young Rwandan genocide survivor put it, ‘We’ve got used to the genocide; it’s daily life that’s the problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0964663911435827">Pells, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0964663911435827">
<title>Using Transitional Justice Mechanisms to Address Socio-Economic Wrongs</title>
<p>The strongest rationale then for transitional justice addressing socio-economic wrongs is where that reflects the needs and priorities of victims and survivors (in specific contexts). However, the question remains whether transitional justice mechanisms are practically suited for correcting such wrongs. To date, the two mechanisms that have gone furthest in handling economic and social wrongs are truth commissions and reparations.</p>
<sec id="section5-0964663911435827">
<title>Truth commissions</title>
<p>In general, truth commissions have been hesitant to remedy economic and social wrongs. The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) focused narrowly on ‘bodily integrity rights’ rather than on apartheid (a crime against humanity) and its violations of ESC rights. In so doing, the TRC acknowledged its own limitations:<disp-quote>
<p>The consequences of human rights violations [due to apartheid] … cannot be measured only in the human lives lost through deaths, detentions, dirty tricks and disappearances, but in the human lives withered away through enforced poverty and other kinds of deprivation. (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0964663911435827">2003</xref>: vol. 1, ch. 4, p. 65)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mahmood Mamdani famously criticized the TRC for not treating the 3.5 million individuals who underwent forced removals as victims:<disp-quote>
<p>The Latin [American] analogy obscured what was distinctive about apartheid. For the violence of apartheid was aimed less at individuals than at entire communities, and entire population groups … The point of torture, terror, death, was even more far-reaching: its aim was to dispossess people of means of livelihood. (2000: 179)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The TRC’s narrow focus on perpetrators of extra-judicial killings, disappearances, and torture let apartheid’s many beneficiaries off the hook all too easily. As Mamdani further commented: ‘Whereas the focus on perpetrators fuels the demand for justice as criminal justice, that on beneficiaries shifts the focus to a notion of justice as social justice’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0964663911435827">Torpey, 2006</xref>: 55).</p>
<p>At times, truth commissions have addressed the economic and structural underpinnings of gross human rights abuses in three inter-related ways: through their hearings, reports and recommendations. The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission did hold specialized hearings on the business sector’s role in human rights violations, even if the resulting testimony was not sufficiently incorporated into the final report or its recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663911435827">Gready, 2010</xref>: 213). More ambitiously, the Timor-Leste truth commission held hearings on famine and forced displacement, and then linked ‘the right of people to food’ with the denial of other rights, such as freedom of movement (Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663911435827">2005</xref>: chap. 7(3), p. 3).</p>
<p>Other truth commission reports (e.g. Guatemala, Peru and Sierra Leone) addressed the socio-economic factors behind the conflicts, including dispossession, inequality, exclusion, and even the colonial legacy. Yet, socio-economic factors were mostly relegated to the sections on historical background, where they could be more easily ignored. As Lisa Laplante observes, ‘presenting socioeconomic root causes of conflict as historical context leaves policy change to the discretion of political leaders, while presenting them as rights violations makes redress and reform a political imperative’ (2008: 341).</p>
<p>Finally, truth commission recommendations are often a long laundry list that extends from human rights protections to good governance to micro-credit financing. Mani contends that ‘truth commissions should go further than analysis of causes and should propose workable solutions for these [social] injustices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663911435827">2008</xref>: 256). Gready is rightly sceptical, stating that while truth commissions could do more to name and analyse ESC violations, it is unrealistic to expect them to offer ‘informed strategic recommendations on everything from torture to education’ – they simply lack the expertise for such policy formulation (2010: 215). More fundamentally, though, truth commission recommendations are often ignored, not because they are unworkable, but because those commissions are inherently weak institutions with short life-spans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0964663911435827">UN OHCHR, 2008</xref>: 11–12).</p>
<p>Some argue that truth commissions can, and should, do more to remedy socio-economic wrongs. In particular, several scholars propose that truth commissions should investigate corruption and economic crimes as a way of delegitimizing past regimes and consolidating successor regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663911435827">Carranza, 2008</xref>: 315–316, 320–321; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663911435827">Cavallaro and Albuja, 2008</xref>: 140). However, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights counsels a fairly cautious approach:<disp-quote>
<p>Those drafting the mandate should be conscious of the dangers and difficulties of including economic crimes within a truth commission’s scope. The methodology and timing required for investigating corruption and economic crimes are quite different from those required for investigating individual or systematic practices of torture or killings, for example. Furthermore, a broad focus on ‘violations of economic and social rights’ might suggest the need to look into poverty, homelessness, education policy failures and other social ills. Although these are critically important subjects, this could risk expanding the mandate of the commission so broadly that it may be impossible to reasonably complete its task. (2006: 9)</p>

<p>In addition, the inclusion of economic crimes could provoke wider opposition to transitional justice – not just from the political and economic elites who benefitted from those crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 41), but also from complicit beneficiary groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663911435827">Mamdani, 2000</xref>: 179). Like the UN OHCHR, the International Center for Transitional Justice has recommended that successor regimes deal with economic crimes outside truth commissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663911435827">Hayner and Bosire, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Reparations</title>
<p>Reparations are the most victim-centred transitional justice mechanism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0964663911435827">UN, 2005</xref>). As such, they have the potential to respond more directly to victims’ needs and priorities. Indeed, when victims’ attitudes are surveyed, a majority often ranked compensation as more important than trials (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663911435827">Robins, 2009</xref>: 324). Yet, the very fact that ‘reparations are explicitly and primarily carried out <italic>on behalf of victims</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0964663911435827">UN OHCHR, 2008</xref>: 2–3) goes some way to explaining why there is so little political will among successor regimes and donors to provide reparations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663911435827">Segovia, 2006</xref>) – for victims usually have little political clout. Successor regimes frequently ignore, evade and delay implementing the reparations programmes recommended by truth commissions or other bodies. Tellingly, only 14 of the 84 transitions between 1970 and 2004 implemented reparations programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663911435827">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>: 53).</p>
<p>Instead of spending scarce resources on reparations to individuals, successor regimes (even those nominally controlled by victims and survivors) prefer to promote future-oriented development that will benefit larger social groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663911435827">Colvin, 2008</xref>: 418–419). According to the UN OHCHR: ‘Governments in developing countries facing demands for reparations are strongly inclined to argue that development <italic>is</italic> reparation … Beneficiaries perceive them, correctly, as programmes that distribute goods to which they have rights as citizens, and not necessarily as victims’ (2008: 26; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2006</xref>: 470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0964663911435827">Roht-Arriaza, 2004</xref>: 130). Development-as-reparations also undermines the ability of reparations to function as state acknowledgement of wrongdoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0964663911435827">Roht-Arriaza and Orlovsky, 2009</xref>: 172–173).</p>
<p>Debate over reparations can also preclude or obscure the larger political debates to be had over redistribution. As Miller observes, reparations ‘allow the state to redistribute wealth only in a strikingly narrow manner, frequently compensating only those named by the transitional justice mechanism’ (2008: 284–285; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663911435827">Gready, 2010</xref>: 216; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0964663911435827">Muvingi, 2009</xref>: 180). Reparations programmes are inherently divisive, pitting individuals and groups against one another over who gets compensated and by how much. Such conflict can inhibit collective political action against the successor regime over economic policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663911435827">Miller, 2008</xref>: 284–285).</p>
<p>Peru offers an illuminating example of the difficulties in using reparations to address socio-economic wrongs. Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that most victims ‘requested redress for their current needs, which arose from inequitable social and economic conditions and not necessarily the war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0964663911435827">Laplante, 2008</xref>: 351–352). That many victims prioritized needs over damages suggested they were not satisfied with a reparations model that returned them to the status quo ante – an inequitable status quo that had contributed to the conflict (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663911435827">Laplante, 2009</xref>: 90).</p>
<p>In a fascinating account, Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663911435827">Magarrell (2003</xref>) described the Commission’s internal debates over whether reparations should address civil and political rights or ESC rights; past violations or present consequences; direct or indirect harms; and individual or collective reparations. Some Commission staff initially proposed remedying consequences (rather than the initial violations) through ‘collective reparations measures in the form of social services, infrastructure and economic development for the affected population’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663911435827">Magarrell, 2003</xref>: 93). This ambitious proposal quickly proved impracticable. As Magarrell recounts:<disp-quote>
<p>First, the universe of harm it intended to redress was enormous and the victim population particularly difficult to define … At the same time, the categories of harm became very generalized … Causation issues became mixed with other underlying social problems that exacerbated or coincided with harms caused directly by the abuses experienced … Thus, in one fell swoop, one can lose the specific recognition of human rights victims as such, and frustrate those who suffer the same problems but are not included in the [reparations] program. (2003: 93)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These concerns, among others, pushed the Commission to eventually adopt a programme that limited itself to remedying victims for past violations of civil and political rights through a mix of individual and collective benefits. The Commission’s final report stated that its reparations programme ‘does not seek to resolve problems of poverty, exclusion and inequality’, noting that these were better left to the state’s social development policies (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663911435827">Magarrell, 2003</xref>: 95). When it came time to implement a reparations programme, however, the state started off with community reparations – ‘taking the approach the TRC had first considered and decided against’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663911435827">Hayner, 2010</xref>: 174) – until pressured to provide individualized reparations. From 2007 to 2009, the community reparations programme identified nearly 1000 communities affected by violence that were to receive investment projects worth up to $33,000 per community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663911435827">ICTJ, 2009</xref>: 31).</p>

<title>Practical Difficulties</title>
<p>As the discussion above demonstrates, there are enormous practical difficulties with having transitional justice mechanisms tackle historically constructed socio-economic inequalities. First, those mechanisms are already over-stretched and under-funded. Reparations programmes, for example, do not have the funds to cover victims of massive economic and social wrongs and are unlikely to acquire such funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 40). Second, there is a danger of raising already inflated expectations of what transitional justice mechanisms can accomplish. Truth commissions have already suffered self-inflicted wounds by over-promising reconciliation. Third, transitional justice mechanisms have a relatively short life-span during periods of political transition. By contrast, the remedying of socio-economic injustices is a long-term political project. As Williams notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Short-term, provisional reparations programs conceived in response to specific waves of human rights violations are probably not the best tool for addressing long-term patterns of inequality. The latter involve human rights issues, but are essentially political questions … they merit deliberation, sensitivity to local political factors, and democratic accountability. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0964663911435827">2007</xref>: 49)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other words, the reduction of longstanding inequality is necessarily ‘post-transitional’ – something to be accomplished as part of creating a new and hopefully more democratic order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0964663911435827">7</xref>
</sup> Finally, transitional justice scholars and practitioners have no expertise in designing and implementing programmes to reduce socio-economic inequalities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0964663911435827">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In my view, transitional justice is inherently short-term, legalistic and corrective. As such, it should focus on accountability for gross violations of civil and political rights. This is not to deny the importance of addressing past and present socio-economic inequalities as a matter of both justice and potential conflict prevention. But that should be done through democratic politics and distributive justice – not through elite bargains and transitional justice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663911435827">Howard-Hassmann, 2008</xref>: 184). Well-meaning efforts to have transitional justice tackle socio-economic wrongs will simply freight it with yet more unrealizable expectations.</p>
<p>If, as I have argued, transitional justice in its current form is ill-suited to addressing socio-economic wrongs, then where does that leave us? One option is to re-conceptualize transitional justice. For example, Wendy Lambourne has called for ‘a transformative justice model of transitional justice’ that brings together economic justice along with legal, psychosocial, and political justice in an effort to transform both structures and relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663911435827">2009</xref>: 46). In a footnote, Lambourne acknowledges that her ‘model risks trying to include too much … thus becoming analytically overstretched and impractical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663911435827">2009</xref>: 46, n. 61). That is indeed the case. Lambourne’s model ends up conflating (rather than linking) transitional justice with Rami Mani’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663911435827">2002</xref>: 3–22) conception of peacebuilding (which combines legal, rectificatory and distributive justice). By contrast, Paul Gready et al. propose a narrower concept of transformative justice that is analytically distinct from transitional justice. In their formulation, transformative justice supplements transitional justice by ‘seek[ing] to change pre-conflict structures in ways that are more inclusive, less unequal and more fair’ (2010). Still, what this would look like in practice and how it differs from rights-based, conflict-sensitive development remains unclear.</p>
<p>A second option would involve linking transitional justice and development while respecting their differences and distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 29, 63; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663911435827">Lenzen, 2009</xref>: 84). After all, there is a fundamental difference between transitional justice and development: the former mostly emphasizes corrective justice, while the latter mostly focuses on distributive justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 63). Rather than having transitional justice directly tackle socio-economic inequality, it might benefit development indirectly by promoting inclusive and participatory citizenship (or social integration), especially for victims and survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 62). What this actually means in terms of developing ‘programmatic links’ between transitional justice and development has yet to be seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663911435827">de Greiff, 2009</xref>: 61; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663911435827">DFID/ICTJ, 2007</xref>). There is a risk, however, that such links may make transitional justice even more state-centric than it is already (especially given the current trend in development towards providing budget or sector support).</p>
<p>A third option is to reorient transitional justice so it becomes more responsive to the immediate priorities of victims themselves (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0964663911435827">Robins, 2011a</xref>). A recent survey of 376 victims of Kenya’s 2007–2008 post-election violence found ‘The basic economic needs that drive the reparative demands of victims can be summarized in terms of homes and livelihoods; without these, particularly the latter, victims perceive the impact of the violation as continuing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0964663911435827">Robins, 2011b</xref>: 28). Once these needs are met, then victims can be consulted about other transitional justice mechanisms (such as trials and truth commissions). This would be a capabilities approach to transitional justice.</p>
<p>One innovative proposal for addressing the economic needs of victims is to provide them with reparations in the form of shares in microfinance institutions (MFIs). Hans Dieter Seibel and Andrea Armstrong favour a scenario in which<disp-quote>
<p>governments could issue smaller collective grants to villages or subdistricts as the start-up capital for local MFIs, but also individual cash payments, with which beneficiaries may choose to buy shares or open accounts in the newly created microfinance institution … This option does recognize individual suffering, but also provides a neutral space where, finances permitting, other members of the community may also participate. Low-level perpetrators would indeed be allowed to participate, but their cash contribution to an organization that at least initially would be owned by victims could contribute to restoring the inequalities of power within the community. Particularly for victims that have suffered abuse which led to their subsequent ostracism… these types of institutions can promote social inclusion and participation by facilitating interpersonal contact. (2006: 687)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are several other advantages to such a reparations scheme. First, it increases the likelihood that reparations payments will contribute to sustainable income-generating activities. Second, it provides ‘safe savings for the poor, enhancement of agency, expansion of services, and civic repair through the building of financial institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663911435827">Bernstein, 2009</xref>: 310). Third, it is more likely to be financed by international donors than other reparations programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663911435827">Bernstein, 2009</xref>: 310; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0964663911435827">Seibel and Armstrong, 2006</xref>: 694; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663911435827">Segovia, 2006</xref>). Finally, such microfinance institutions often give women greater access to credit. In this way, transitional justice can make a limited contribution to the process of chipping away at historically entrenched gender inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663911435827">Bernstein, 2009</xref>: 315).</p>

<p>Cath Collins has proposed ‘post-transitional justice’ as a new analytical category that is distinct from transitional justice in the following ways (among others):<disp-quote>
<p>First, where transitional justice is centrally concerned with attaining and preserving the minimum institutional requirements of formal democracy, post-transitional justice focuses on subsequent questions of the quality, reach, and perfectibility of that democracy. Second, post-transitional justice accordingly questions the comprehensiveness and sufficiency of initial transitional justice compromises … Third … post-transitional justice has been largely non-state, driven by private actors operating both ‘above’ and ‘below’ the state.
