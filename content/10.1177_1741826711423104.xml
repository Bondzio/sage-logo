<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Functional and morphological arterial wall impairment progresses with ageing. Angiotensin II in the arterial wall is involved in this process. Appropriate early intervention might theoretically slow the progress of age-related changes. Herein, we investigated a new approach to this issue: whether arterial wall changes present in middle-aged males could be reduced by low-dose valsartan intervention.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty apparently healthy, middle-aged males (42.9 ± 0.9 years) were recruited for a double-blind randomized study and received either placebo or valsartan (20 mg daily) for 30 days. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and β-stiffness of the common carotid artery were measured using an Aloka alfa-10 Prosound with an integrated eTracking system at inclusion, after 30 days, and after 3 and 8 months.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Intervention resulted in FMD increase (154.2 ± 20.1 %; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and PWV and β-stiffness decrease compared to initial values (−6.9 ± 1.0 % and −13.2 ± 1.4 %; both <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) whereas values in the untreated group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for all parameters) remained unchanged throughout the study. The advantageous effects decreased over the months following valsartan discontinuation, but were still significant after 3 months (largely in FMD and less in PWV and β-stiffness), and negligible after 8 months. The beneficial effects were ascribed to valsartan's pleiotropic effects, as no blood pressure changes were recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We showed that age-related arterial wall changes in middle-aged males are reversible and could be reduced by a low-dose, short-term valsartan intervention. The new approach merits detailed investigation in future studies.</p>

<p>Vascular ageing progressively leads to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711423104">1</xref></sup> Functional changes, such as endothelial dysfunction, are gradually followed by morphological ones, characterized predominantly by increased arterial wall stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711423104">2</xref></sup> Since vascular ageing represents a chronic, progressive process, it is of outmost importance, at least in theory, to try to prevent early minor changes and consequently avoid the late major, hardly reversible, consequences affecting the arterial wall. Previous studies have been mostly focused on non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment or on prevention of arterial wall changes in subjects with established risk factors or developed cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711423104">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711423104">6</xref></sup> Since the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is still rising despite all current strategies, new, especially preventive, approaches are highly desirable and of great interest.</p>
<p>The renin–angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of vascular ageing and cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711423104">7</xref></sup> Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that RAAS is more expressed with advancing age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711423104">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711423104">8</xref></sup> RAAS, particularly its major effector, angiotensin II, is highly expressed in the vascular wall, leading to misbalance of vasoactive substances and growth factors, causing endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, and progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711423104">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Drug groups blocking the RAAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers – sartans) consequently diminish RAAS activation and act preventively in cardiovascular diseases and could act preventively towards vascular ageing as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711423104">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711423104">11</xref></sup> Beyond their original primary and basic effect on blood pressure lowering, both drug groups also have additional beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, named pleiotropic effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711423104">11</xref></sup> They were shown to reverse endothelial dysfunction, inhibit collagen production, reduce inflammation, and inhibit platelet aggregation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711423104">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711423104">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711423104">14</xref></sup> They also improve insulin sensitivity and inhibit pathogenic changes in the kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711423104">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711423104">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether treatment with low-dose valsartan (20 mg daily) could, through its pleiotropic effects, improve the functional and morphological characteristics of the arterial wall in apparently healthy middle-aged males during the course of 30 days of therapy. Being a completely new and innovative approach to early arterial ageing change prevention, it has never been tested before. The reversibility of early vascular wall changes has already been proven in our parallel study on low-dose fluvastatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423104">17</xref></sup> Taking into consideration that RAAS has an important role in the progression of these changes, this approach seemed to be worth testing.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711423104" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The present study was designed as a double-blind randomized one, recruiting 40 apparently healthy males equally divided into the control and valsartan groups. The control group received placebo while the test group received low-dose valsartan (20 mg daily) over the 30-day period of intervention. Inclusion criteria were: 30–50-year-old males, non-smokers, normotensive (&lt;140/90 mmHg), without any clinical cardiovascular disease, no history of diabetes, insulin resistance, or any other chronic disease, and without any medication therapy. The National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia approved the study and the participants gave their informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711423104"><title>Experimental design</title>
<p>A complete medical examination of participants was performed at inclusion in the study. Ultrasound measurements were performed at the beginning (day 0) and at the end (day 30) of the study period. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and measurements of common carotid artery stiffness parameters [pulse wave velocity (PWV) and β-stiffness] were performed. Blood glucose values were also obtained at both time points from fasting venous blood samples (VITROS 5,1FS Chemistry system; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). Three and eight months after therapy discontinuation, the ultrasound measurements were repeated in all participants of the valsartan group (follow-up ultrasound measurements).</p>
<p>Ultrasound measurements were performed at the same time of the day under standardized conditions in a quiet, temperature-controlled environment (24°C), after at least 8 hours of fasting and at least 12 hours of caffeine or alcohol abstinence. Participants were asked not to perform strenuous physical activity for at least 24 hours prior to the measurements. All ultrasound measurements were made by a single examiner, using an Aloka alfa-10 Prosound ultrasound machine with a high-resolution eTracking system. An electrocardiogram was continuously recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711423104"><title>Ultrasound measurements</title>
<p>Endothelial function was assessed by means of brachial artery FMD in accordance with the guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711423104">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711423104">20</xref></sup> Visualizing the right brachial artery 5–10 cm above the antecubital fossa, its diameter was continuously recorded. After monitoring the baseline brachial artery diameter (1 min), the right forearm blood pressure cuff was inflated to 50 mmHg above the systolic pressure for 4 min, producing arterial occlusion. The cuff was rapidly deflated and the brachial artery diameter was then recorded for 3 min. The machine automatically provided values of FMD (the percentage of change from the baseline diameter of the brachial artery during reactive hyperaemia) at the end. Blood pressure was measured with an automated sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn Speidel and Keller OSZ).</p>
<p>Arterial stiffness parameters were measured on the right common carotid artery. The Aloka ultrasound device automatically determined the pulse wave velocity (PWV) and β-stiffness of the common carotid artery. The echo-tracker's cursor-pair placement was set on the anterior and posterior walls of the common carotid artery, 1.5–2 cm proximal to the bifurcation. Pressure waveforms were noninvasively obtained; automatic calculation of β-stiffness and local PWV was provided as a mean of 12 beats.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711423104"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All values were expressed as mean ± SEM and normally distributed. Differences between values were assessed by the one-way ANOVA test. When a significant interaction was present, the Bonferroni post-test was performed. In the analysis of prolonged effects (after valsartan discontinuation), the values obtained at 3 or 8 months were compared with the initial values obtained at inclusion in the study using the paired t-test. A <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism 5.0.</p>

<p>Impaired endothelial function (defined as FMD below 4 %) was observed in 82.5 % of the participants. Treatment with low-dose valsartan increased FMD in every individual participant, reaching normal values at the end of the study.</p>
<p>We performed an analysis between treatment groups (treated vs. non-treated) and treatment arms (before and after treatment), using either absolute values or relative change of parameters. In the treated group, absolute values of FMD increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711423104">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas PWV and β-stiffness decreased after 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711423104">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711423104">1C</xref>).

<sec id="sec11-1741826711423104" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was pursued in order to test the hypothesis that early arterial wall changes resulting from the vascular ageing process could be reduced by short-term (30 days) low-dose valsartan (20 mg daily) intervention. We found that short-term treatment of apparently healthy middle-aged individuals with valsartan resulted in a substantial increase in FMD and a significant decrease of PWV and β-stiffness. At inclusion in the study impaired endothelial function was present in the majority of subjects. After 30 days of low-dose valsartan intervention, FMD reached normal values in all participants and in addition a decrease of PWV and β-stiffness was also obtained in every single participant. Importantly, valsartan's beneficial effects were observed even after intervention discontinuation; a significant improvement of measured parameters still persisted even after 3 months, but disappeared after 8 months.</p>
<p>Endothelial function was assessed using the FMD method, where the brachial artery dilation after reactive hyperaemia was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711423104">19</xref></sup> At inclusion in the study, most participants already had impaired FMD, characterized by values below 4 %. Normal FMD values were set based on previous studies, where apparently healthy, middle-aged males were recruited. Values of FMD vary greatly throughout the literature, between 2.8 and 8.6 %.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711423104">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711423104">23</xref></sup> Importantly, after 30 days of low-dose valsartan therapy, every single individual achieved a significant FMD increase in comparison to the placebo group, totally 2.2-fold. Diminished endothelial function, detected at inclusion in the study, actually represents one of the earliest changes in the vascular ageing process. The increase of endothelial function after low-dose valsartan therapy proves that functional arterial changes are reversible.</p>
<p>Arterial stiffness parameters measured decreased after 30 days of low-dose valsartan treatment, but to a lesser degree in comparison to FMD. A possible explanation could lie in both morphological arterial wall changes (PWV and β-stiffness) being less reversible compared to the functional arterial wall changes – endothelial dysfunction. The relative values of PWV and β-stiffness decreased significantly after 30 days of low-dose valsartan treatment, whereas the absolute values did not reach the level of significance. The reason for the decrease in absolute values being insignificant lies probably in the great diversity of measured parameters among the subjects. It is known that PWV and β-stiffness increase with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711423104">24</xref></sup> As FMD increased and PWV and β-stiffness decreased in every single individual, the following can be concluded: first, that these morphological arterial wall changes are reversible; and second, that low-dose valsartan could effectively reduce age-related morphological arterial wall changes.</p>
<p>In a parallel study, we already proved that low-dose fluvastatin acts similarly in improving functional and morphological arterial wall characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711423104">17</xref></sup> The same target group of subjects was studied – middle-aged, apparently healthy volunteers. The mechanisms underlying both beneficial results are not completely understood, but the search to cast light on them is well underway.</p>
<p>The decision to choose low-dose and short-term treatment was governed by the selection of middle aged, apparently healthy males as the target group – a group considered to have still reversible arterial wall changes. The analogy was between early minor arterial wall changes and low-dose, short-term intervention on the one hand; and late major arterial wall changes, developed cardiovascular disease, and a therapeutic dose and lifelong treatment on the other. Therapeutic doses in apparently healthy subjects would probably lead to activation of compensatory mechanisms diminishing the drug's beneficial effects. Administration of therapeutic doses to healthy participants would also not be ethical and their compliance would be harder to achieve. Safe, efficient, and side-effect-free treatment was achieved with this low-dose regimen. Besides, according to other studies, the beneficial pleiotropic effects of valsartan were observed in low-dose treatment that was insufficient to lower the blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711423104">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>RAAS blockers are known to have additional beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, known as pleiotropic effects. It seems that valsartan in low doses has beneficial pleiotropic effects, but no basic blood-pressure-lowering effect. In the study by Saisho and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711423104">25</xref></sup> it was shown that low-dose valsartan (40 mg daily) decreased the serum level of advanced glycosylated products, urine isoprostane-8 levels, and microalbumin excretion in type 2 diabetic subjects, whereas blood pressure levels remained unchanged. The effects of valsartan described were therefore ascribed to blood pressure-independent pleiotropic effects. A similarity was observed in the present study: low-dose valsartan improved the functional and morphological characteristics of the arterial wall, but did not influence blood pressure values.</p>
<p>Valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, was shown to have several protective actions on the cardiovascular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711423104">26</xref></sup> and renal system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711423104">27</xref></sup> In addition to a blood-pressure-lowering effect, it also has numerous other pleiotropic effects, for example anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet-aggregatory ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711423104">26</xref></sup> In the study of Karalliedde and colleagues, 160 mg valsartan/day in combination with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide/day was shown to improve arterial stiffness parameters in type 2 diabetic patients, but did not influence blood pressure levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711423104">28</xref></sup> Three months of therapy with valsartan at 80 mg daily improved FMD in subjects with hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711423104">29</xref></sup> Valsartan was also shown to induce NO production in endothelial cells through phosphorylation of eNOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711423104">13</xref></sup> and acted as an antioxidant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711423104">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main focus of the present study was the investigation of the beneficial effects of valsartan, but not also the mechanistic background of our results; that represents the limitation of the study. Since the described phenomenon appears to have a significant clinical potential and has not been yet reported, we believe that the description of the phenomenon has enough scientific priority <italic>per se</italic>. Obviously further studies, with the aim of clarifying the underlying mechanisms, are needed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we confirmed that in middle-aged, apparently healthy males functional and morphological arterial wall changes are present as a consequence of the arterial ageing process. After 30 days of low-dose valsartan treatment, FMD, PWV, and β-stiffness improved significantly, confirming the reversibility of these changes. Improvement was present even 3 months after therapy discontinuation. Therefore, this approach needs to be further tested, as it shows promising results.</p>
