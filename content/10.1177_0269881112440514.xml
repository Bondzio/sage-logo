<abstract>
<p>The current study is a systematic review of the literature concerning the possible relationship of antiepileptics and suicide-related clinical features and behaviours. A MEDLINE search returned 863 papers but only five were chosen as relevant. A critical analysis of the Food and Drug Administration report is also included. Overall, the current review suggests there are no convincing data concerning a ‘class effect’ of antiepileptics in inducing any type of suicide-related behaviours. Further research is needed concerning topiramate, lamotrigine and maybe leviracetam. Clinicians are expected to inform patients and their families on the possible increased risk but it is important not to overemphasise the issue, since stopping or refusing to start antiepileptics may result in serious harm, including death of the patient. Future randomised controlled trials should specifically focus on issues concerning depression and suicidal thoughts in patients with epilepsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The first report on the rate of suicide in patients with epilepsy was published in 1941 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112440514">Prudhomme, 1941</xref>), suggesting it is rather high. Epidemiological data are inconsistent but on average suggest that the suicide rate among patients with epilepsy is three to five-fold higher than that in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112440514">Bell et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112440514">Harris and Barraclough, 1997</xref>). Especially in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and complex partial seizures the risk is reported to be 25-fold higher. The presence of depression and cognitive impairment seems to constitute the main risk factors for suicidality in epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112440514">Cockerell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112440514">Iivanainen and Lehtinen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112440514">Klenerman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112440514">Lip and Brodie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112440514">Nilsson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881112440514">Sperling et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881112440514">White et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881112440514">Zielinski, 1974</xref>). However, even patients without psychiatric comorbidity seem to be at a two-fold higher risk to commit suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112440514">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the first case report on antiepileptic-induced suicidality (relating to diazepam use) was published in 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881112440514">Ryan et al., 1968</xref>), the relationship between epilepsy (especially temporal epilepsy) and suicide, which has been reported since the early 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112440514">No author, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112440514">Hancock and Bevilacqua, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112440514">Hawton et al., 1980</xref>), did not include a possible deleterious role for antiepileptics except their use as a tool to commit suicide. There were some early reports on the possible contributing role of antiepileptics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112440514">Brent, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112440514">Hall and Joffe, 1972</xref>) but this was not widely recognised until 2004 when there was a case report on topiramate-induced suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112440514">Abraham, 2003</xref>). More reports followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112440514">Christman and Faubion, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112440514">Mago et al., 2006</xref>) and some authors started discussing the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112440514">Kalinin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Then in 2008 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety warning on antiepileptics on the basis of a meta-analysis, which suggested antiepileptics might double the suicidal risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112440514">FDA, 2008</xref>). However, clinicians were alerted but not persuaded. Around 46% of neurologists treating patients with epilepsy replied that they would make no changes to their everyday clinical practice; 46% replied that they would discuss the issue with at least some of their patients but only 8% would provide written information regarding suicide risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112440514">Shneker et al., 2009</xref>). Since then other studies reported that the FDA warning might be indeed valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112440514">Andersohn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112440514">Olesen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112440514">Patorno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881112440514">VanCott et al., 2010</xref>), but also that, conversely, there might be a protective effect in bipolar patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112440514">Gibbons et al., 2009</xref>) and that only the presence of a previous affective illness acts as a risk factor in epileptic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881112440514">VanCott et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There are many risk factors that are considered to play a role in the development of suicidal behaviour in people with epilepsy. They include psychiatric comorbidities (especially mood disorders), early age of seizure onset, social stigma, severity of epilepsy and occurrence of ictal or postictal psychoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112440514">Bell et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112440514">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112440514">Bell and Sander, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study aims to critically review available published data on the relationship of antiepileptics and suicidal behaviour in patients other than mood disorder patients. Mood disorders were excluded because they put the patient at higher suicidal risk themselves and, in this case, the therapeutic effect of the antiepileptic could mask its suicidal-inducing action.</p>

<title>The FDA report</title>
<p>The FDA report on the relationship between antiepileptics and suicidal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112440514">FDA, 2008</xref>) included 199 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning 11 drugs: carbamazepine; divalproex; felbamate; gabapentin; lamotrigine; levetiracetam; oxcarbazepine; pregabalin; tiagabine; topiramate; zonisamide. These RCTs included 43,892 patients (27,863 in drug arms and 16,029 in placebo arms) with a mean age of 42 years; 79% were Caucasian and the gender distribution was almost equal. The nosological targets for these RCTs were epilepsy, psychiatric disorders (anxiety, binge eating disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and social phobia) and ‘other conditions’ (agitation, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, impaired cognition, insomnia, migraine, neuropathy, obesity, radiculopathy, spasticity and tremor).</p>
<p>The meta-analysis revealed that four patients under an antiepileptic (14/100,000) vs. none under placebo committed suicide. Suicidal ideation or behaviour was present in 104 (0.37%) patients under drug vs. 38 (0.24%) under placebo. The odds ratio (OR) of a drug patient experiencing a suicidal behaviour or ideation vs. a placebo patient was 1.80 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.24, 2.66). Suicidal behaviour had a higher OR=2.92 (95% CI 1.44, 6.47) in comparison to suicidal ideation (OR=1.45 (95% CI 0.93, 2.30). The results were robust to statistical methods and to differences in the treatment durations between the treatment groups.</p>
<p>Concerning differences between diagnostic groups, the epilepsy subgroup had OR=3.53 (95% CI 1.28, 12.10), the psychiatric subgroup had OR=1.51(95% CI 0.95, 2.45) and the other indication subgroup had OR=1.87 (95% CI 0.81, 4.76). The higher risk of events for the drug-treated patients was observed as early as 1 week from initiating treatment until at least 24 weeks. The FDA reported no statistical differences for gender, race, setting and even among the different antiepileptic drug modes of action that is either with increased or not for sodium channels blocking (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, zonisamide), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic/GABAmimetic (divalproex, gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, topiramate), and carbonic anhydrase inhibition modes of action (topiramate and zonisamide).</p>
<p>Although the FDA report concluded that the results concerning individual drugs were generally consistent with the overall result, this might not be the case. Carbamazepine had a prophylactic effect (OR=0.66) and divalproex was neutral (OR=0.91). It is to be noted that all carbamazepine and half of divalproex data came from RCTs on psychiatric disorders. Felbamate had no events in either group and all its data came from epilepsy studies. Two-thirds of tiagabine data came from epilepsy studies and one-third from psychiatric studies and the OR could not be calculated because two patients under tiagabine and none under placebo had an event. The highest OR values were for topiramate (2.57) and leviracetam (2.43). Topiramate data came mainly from studies on ‘other conditions’ (72%) while those of leviracetam came from epilepsy (40%) and psychiatric (39%). The FDA noted that, when divided into antiepileptic drug indications, the OR was greatest for the epilepsy group (OR=3.53), followed by ‘other conditions’ (OR=1.87) and then psychiatric disorders (OR=1.51). In general, the patients in the psychiatric trials had a higher absolute frequency of events in both arms.</p>
<p>For all agents, the 95% CI includes OR=1, except that for topiramate (95% CI 1.21, 5.85) and lamotrigine (95% CI 1.03, 4.40), suggesting that, beyond reasonable doubt, only these two might put patients at a higher risk to experience a suicide-related event.</p>
<p>The FDA analysis manifests a number of methodological problems that must be taken into account. Adverse event outcome data from RCTs were used, instead of systematically collected data, the sample sizes were small and the number of events was limited, in most of the epilepsy trials (92%) included in the final analysis, the study drug was add-on therapy and although 11 antiepileptics were put together in the conclusion, only two of the drugs showed a statistically significant increase in risk of suicidal ideation. The potentially modifying effect of comorbid mental disorders was not taken into account in the FDA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112440514">Hesdorffer and Kanner, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112440514">Nilsson et al., 2002</xref></title>
<p>In 2002, that is 6 years before the FDA analysis, a case–control study based on a cohort of 6880 patients registered in the Stockholm County In-Patient Register with a diagnosis of epilepsy was published. It included all patients aged 15 years or older hospitalised for epilepsy during the years 1980–1989 (around 60% of the total population of epileptic patients in Sweden). The study population was followed up through the National Cause of Death Register and 26 cases of suicide, 23 cases of suspected but not proven suicide and 171 controls (living epilepsy patients) were identified. The analysis suggested that the presence of mental illness produced a nine-fold increase, while specifically the use of antipsychotics produced a 10-fold increase in relative risk (RR). The onset of epilepsy before the age of 18 produced a 16-fold increase in RR and this risk increased further with high seizure frequency and antiepileptic drug polytherapy. However, this study suffered from several problems including imprecise estimates due to incomplete case records (almost half of the cases were undetermined suicide) and reported many associations, which, however, were not statistically significant. No association between risk of suicide and any particular antiepileptic drug, type of epilepsy or localisation or lateralisation of epileptogenic focus on electroencephalography was detected. However, this study was largely based on phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate (the latter two do not increase suicidal risk according to the FDA report, while the first is not included; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112440514">Nilsson et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>One year before the FDA report, the retrospective analysis for suicidal ideation of a case registry of 517 patients taking levetiracetam was published. It suggested a frequency for suicidal ideation of 0.4% (four patients), which is exactly the mean rate reported in the FDA warning and lower than the rate reported by the FDA specifically for leviracetam. However, this study also reports that all of them suffered from a mood disorder, which, however, presented early during leviracetam therapy. The fact that this study included only epileptic patients, while in the FDA analysis 39% of data came from psychiatric RCTs, might be responsible for the lower rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112440514">Mula and Sander, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Another retrospective naturalistic cohort study of the medical and pharmacy claims from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which included data from 14 US states for patients aged 15 and above who were receiving antiepileptics for the first time. Participants were excluded if they had received multiple anticonvulsant drugs on the index date and if, in the 6 months before the index date, they had recorded diagnoses for attempted suicide or medical conditions that could have influenced the risk of suicidal acts (e.g. cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, or long hospitalisation). From 2,247,563 anticonvulsant prescriptions filled between 1 July 2001 and 31 December 2006, eventually 297,620 treatment episodes (for 269,937 patients) were included in the study cohort. The drugs studied were carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, primidone, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate and zonisamide. The most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants were gabapentin (48%), topiramate (19.4%), lamotrigine (7.5%) and valproate (6.2%) and the less commonly used drugs were carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, pregabalin, primidone, tiagabine and zonisamide. Topiramate was chosen as the primary reference drug because it was the second most commonly used agent in the study population and because it is used for a wide range of indications. To investigate the risk of suicidal events in patients beginning to use anticonvulsants for epilepsy, carbamazepine was chosen as the reference because it is an anticonvulsant widely used for initial treatment of epilepsy.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed a very high prevalence of psychiatric and mood disorders, treated even with agents not approved for these conditions. Concomitant use of antidepressants (21.6–68.6%) and antipsychotics were high. The highest rates for co-administration of an antipsychotic were for lamotrigine (25.5%), oxcarbazepine (21.1%) and valproate (25.1%) (e-table 1).</p>
<p>There were 801 attempted suicides, 26 completed suicides and 41 violent deaths within 6 months of starting treatment. Relative to people receiving topiramate, the risk of suicidal acts (attempted or completed) was increased for people receiving gabapentin (hazard ratio (HR)=1.42, 95% CI 1.11, 1.80), lamotrigine (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.43, 2.37), oxcarbazepine (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.52, 2.80), tiagabine (HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.65, 3.52) and valproate (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25, 2.19). There were no significant differences in risk of suicidal acts or violent death between topiramate and carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, primidone or zonisamide. The unadjusted incidence rate of suicidal acts or violent death per 1000 person years was 34.3 for oxcarbazepine, 29.5 for tiagabine, 27.9 for lamotrigine, 25.6 for valproate, 7.5 for gabapentin and 7.4 for topiramate. Thus, these authors concluded that, relative to new users of topiramate, there is an increased risk of suicidal acts or violent death in new users of the anticonvulsants gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine and valproate in the 6 months after starting the drugs. Their analyses were adjusted for age, gender, calendar year of prescription and comorbidities, but additional analysis by us suggested that the HR for attempted or completed suicide or violent death correlated highly with antipsychotic (0.57) and antidepressant use (0.69) at day 180 and day 360 (0.52 and 0.58 respectively) while no correlation was present for the first 30 days. Also, data suggested that younger patients (15–24 years old) might be at a higher risk. The exclusion of patients with a history of suicide might have influenced the data in a way that is impossible to predict. It is most likely that comorbid mental disorders and especially mood disorders determined the initial choice of antiepileptic; it is also possible that antiepileptics with no proven efficacy against mood disorders might be chosen on the basis of a belief that there is a ‘class effect’ and all anticonvulsants are also ‘mood stabilisers’. Such a complicated influence of comorbid mental disorders could be the main source of the results through a combination of more patients at risk for specific drugs (e.g. lamotrigine) plus failure of mood stabilisation (e.g. with gabapentine or leviracetam; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112440514">Patorno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112440514">Procopio, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112440514">Arana et al. (2010)</xref> published an analysis of data on more than five million patients from the THIN data base from the UK, suggesting that the use of antiepileptic drugs is not associated with an increased risk of suicide-related events among patients with epilepsy but instead is associated with such an increased risk in depressed patients and those without epilepsy, depression or bipolar disorder. This conclusion is in contrast to the FDA report, which suggested the epilepsy group to be at the highest risk and the psychiatric at the lowest. This study is very important since it relies on the analysis of a huge real-world dataset.</p>
<p>These authors discuss possible limitations concerning the generalisability of their results, especially concerning the unknown reason for prescribing antiepileptics in patients without epilepsy, depression or bipolar disorder. However, many more limitations exist. The first problem is the fact that suicidal behaviour is a relatively rare event and, even with a sample size of millions of subjects, the authors ended with a highly heterogeneous group and very small sub-samples (e.g. the bipolar group and lithium-treated patients). They excluded patients with a family history of suicide and previous attempts. This suggests that the possible drug effect is homogeneous and no specific sub-population is at a particular risk or particular benefit; this might not be the case.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the increased risk reported by Arana et al. may be confounded by the severity of depression or by undiagnosed psychiatric illnesses or personality disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112440514">Striano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881112440514">Zebley and Ferrando, 2010</xref>). Striano and colleagues made the point that the psychiatric issue in epilepsy should not be minimised or ignored and recommend to routinely evaluate patients with epilepsy for psychiatric conditions</p>
<p>The use of antiepileptics in bipolar disorder or in unipolar depression according to therapist decision might suggest the presence of mixed episodes and complicated or refractory patients and thus the quality of data are very different from those in RCTs. These complicated patients are at a higher risk for suicidal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112440514">Akiskal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112440514">Balazs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112440514">Isometsa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112440514">Rihmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112440514">Rihmer and Akiskal, 2006</xref>) and a similar finding is reflected in the FDA data; only here the controlling vs. placebo washes out the impressions absolute numbers create and provides a RR.</p>
<p>In accord with the above is the suggestion that lithium use had a similar risk with antiepileptic use and that antiepileptics with anti-bipolar indication (valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine) had a high risk (1.35–1.44) while the rest had a low risk (0.24–0.89) (see Table 6 in supplementary material). What is peculiar is the lower suicidal risk for bipolar patients not receiving either lithium or antiepileptics (0.56 vs. 0.74). This is in sharp contrast to the literature and the FDA report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112440514">Baldessarini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112440514">Cipriani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112440514">Gibbons et al., 2009</xref>) and cannot be attributed to other treatment options since antiepileptic use in bipolar disorder and depression is related to higher use of antipsychotics and antidepressants and higher chronicity (see Table 1 in supplementary material). In the same line of thought, the quality of control groups is very difficult to assess. There are patients with epilepsy and depression without current or past year use of antiepileptics and antidepressants; these patients can hardly constitute a fair control group especially in the way it is defined in controlled RCTs.</p>
<p>Finally, supplementary Table 2 basically suggests that the use of anticonvulsants reduces suicidality in most groups (some groups are too small to contribute to conclusions). Also supplementary Table 3 reports that either prior or current antiepileptic use results in similar suicidal rates, suggesting that the condition rather than the medication is responsible. Again, numbers are small with current use relating to fewer than five events in any diagnostic group and it is important that previous anticonvulsant users had higher rates. For attempts (see Table 4 in supplementary material), the picture is somewhat different but essentially does not change the interpretation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a closer look at the data presented by Arana et al. does not support any relationship between use of antiepileptics and suicidality in any diagnostic group. It is not known whether this conclusion applies also to patients with a personal family history of suicidality. It is also doubtful that any comparison can be made to the FDA report, because the quality of the data is sharply different (RCT controlled data vs. naturalistic data).</p>

<p>Finally, recently, a rather small study was done (163 patients from the CERP database) concerning 16 antiepileptics (carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, lorazepam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate and zonisamide). In the various groups utilised by the study, antidepressant use varied from 11–25% and seizure frequency from 2–16 per month. The median duration between two visits with administration of a mood scale was 154 days. It is important that, across the two visits, both depression symptoms and suicidal ideation tended to improve in all groups. However, significant improvements in the proportions of patients with depression (24–11%, <italic>p</italic>=0.029) and suicidal ideation (28–14%, <italic>p</italic>=0.0039) were observed only in the group of patients without any change in their antiepileptic treatment. The only significant difference was between the group without any change and the group in which the antiepileptic dosage was increased and concerned the emergence of new suicidal ideation (11% vs. 6%, <italic>p</italic>=0.05). Reductions in depressive symptoms were similar across groups, ranging from 13–18%. Reduction of suicidal ideation was least for the group of patients with a new antiepileptic added (7%) and largest for the group without any change in treatment (15%), although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, these data suggest that maybe epilepsy itself and its response to treatment rather than medication per se is responsible for the emergence of suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881112440514">Wen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study attempted to perform a systematic review of the literature concerning the possible relationship of antiepileptics and suicide-related clinical features and behaviours. The search revealed only five relevant publications additional to the FDA report. The analysis of these papers revealed that while the FDA report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112440514">FDA, 2008</xref>) implies a ‘class effect’ of antiepileptics in inducing suicidal-related manifestations, this is not supported by the results of that analysis. The data indicate that valproate and carbamazipine are protective or neutral while only topiramate and lamotrigine have a profile that relates them significantly to suicidality. Another potential problem is the fact that adverse event data were used rather than systematically collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112440514">Hesdorffer and Kanner, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The negative study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112440514">Nilsson et al. (2002)</xref> included phenytoin (not included in the FDA report), carbamazepine and valproate; thus, the negative results are no surprise and not in contrast to the FDA report. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112440514">Mula and Sander (2007)</xref> reported a lower risk concerning leviracetam in comparison to the FDA report but this might be due to the fact that these authors included only epileptic patients and not psychiatric like the FDA. Thus, leviracetam might induce suicidality but this is not well proven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112440514">Givon et al., 2011</xref>). The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112440514">Patorno et al. (2010)</xref>, which suggest that topiramate is the drug with the lowest risk, are most likely to be due to comorbid mental disorders and especially mood disorders, which determined the initial choice of antiepileptic. Antiepileptics with no proven efficacy against mood disorders might be chosen on the basis of the belief that there is a ‘class effect’ and all anticonvulsants are also ‘mood stabilisers’. Such a complicated influence of comorbid mental disorders could be the main source of the results through a combination of more patients at risk for specific drugs (e.g. lamotrigine) plus failure of mood stabilisation (e.g. with gabapentine or leviracetam). This mechanism might lie behind all naturalistic studies.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112440514">Arana et al. (2010)</xref> reported that the use of antiepileptic drugs is associated with an increased risk of suicide-related events among depressed patients and those without epilepsy, depression or bipolar disorder. However, a closer inspection of their data suggests no relationship between the use of antiepileptics and suicidality in any diagnostic group. The exclusion of patients with a personal family history of suicidality by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112440514">Patorno et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112440514">Arana et al. (2010)</xref> weakens any conclusion and the naturalistic character of their data makes the comparison to the FDA report impossible.</p>
<p>A previous systematic review that used similar strategies as us detected 90 publications in MEDLINE in comparison to 863 of the current paper and eventually only one relevant research paper in comparison to five of the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881112440514">Ziemba et al., 2010</xref>). Possibly, the extensive automotive method these authors utilised in comparison to the inspection and selection of articles by one of the authors of the current study (KNF) might be responsible for this discrepancy. These authors discuss only the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112440514">Patorno et al. (2010)</xref> and discuss much less the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112440514">Andersohn et al. (2010)</xref>. They concluded that there is little convincing evidence that any particular anticonvulsant medication puts epilepsy patients at a higher risk of suicide, especially given their elevated baseline risk. Reviews conclude that there is a multitude of contradictions in the findings across studies and even within studies, with no study providing clear or convincing support for the FDA conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112440514">Hesdorffer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112440514">Ishihara et al. (2010)</xref> report, after the analysis of naturalistic data from 61,461 patients with epilepsy from the US and the UK, any observational studies of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and suicidality must consider potential prescription bias in the choice of antiepileptics on the basis of history of mood disorders, which is a major risk factor for suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112440514">Bagary, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the current review suggests there are no data concerning a ‘class effect’ of antiepileptics in inducing any type of suicide-related behaviours. There are some data suggesting further research is needed concerning topiramate, lamotrigine and maybe leviracetam. All three might relate to suicidal behaviours through either inducing a mood disorder (topiramate and leviracetam) or because they are preferentially prescribed in patients with mood disorders at a high risk of committing suicide (lamotrigine). Lamotrigine especially needs further study because it is widely prescribed in bipolar patients for the maintenance phase.</p>
<p>It is clear that, for the majority of people with epilepsy, anticonvulsant treatment is necessary. Failure of treatment for any reason is expected to have devastating consequences (accidents causing injury or death, social stigma, global disability, low quality of life and sudden unexplained death). For this reason, a possible risk of suicidality with antiepileptic treatment should be well documented before it influences clinical practice because there might be a number of adverse consequences (e.g. poor medication compliance). However, it is important to focus also on the risk of depression and suicidality in people suffering from epilepsy; screening procedures should be in place routinely and adequate ‘aggressive’ treatment of mood disorders should be the rule. Clinicians are supposed to inform patients and their families of this increased risk but it is important not to overemphasise the issue. It is important to note that the risk of stopping or refusing to start antiepileptics may result in serious harm, including the death of the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112440514">Bell et al., 2009b</xref>). Maybe specific subpopulations of patients with epilepsy are at higher risk to develop psychiatric adverse effects with any antiepileptic treatment. These patients deserve closer monitoring and follow-up. The choice of which antiepileptic drug to use may also be influenced by the presence of depression or suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112440514">Bell and Sander, 2009</xref>). Several factors are implicated in the possible relationship of antiepileptics and suicide-related clinical features and behaviours. This risk could be linked to the severity of epilepsy, a rapid titration and high dosage of the drug, as well as co-administration of more than one agent. However, a recent study in a large cohort of consecutive patients with drug-refractory epilepsy found no relationship between adverse events and co-administration of antiepileptic agents and medication load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112440514">Canevini et al., 2010</xref>). There are some reports suggesting an association between lowered folic acid levels and mental or psychiatric disturbances in a subgroup of patients with epilepsy, although a causal relationship remains to be definitely proven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112440514">Belcastro et al., 2007</xref>). Also, it is reported that suicide in patients with epilepsy after surgical treatment is more frequent than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112440514">Pompili et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is doubtful that either RCTs or naturalistic data can give any reliable answer to this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881112440514">Pompili and Baldessarini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112440514">Pompili et al., 2010</xref>). The picture is similar to that with the FDA putting a warning on antidepressants on the basis of RCT data, with epidemiological data suggesting the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112440514">Gibbons et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112440514">2007b</xref>). In essence, it is a matter of methodology, RCTs do not include suicidal patients while naturalistic data do. But, on the other hand, while RCTs tackle a specific question, the answer is very difficult to generalise; conversely, naturalistic studies already provide a generalised picture but the question is very difficult to develop. The basic problem lies in bioethics; it is not possible to study suicidal subjects by potentially putting them at a higher risk of dying.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it has been proposed that carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproate and lamotrigine could be regarded as drugs with anti-suicidal properties because they all improve cognitive functions and mood in epileptic patients and possess serotonergic mechanisms of action. Conversely, topiramate, tiagabine, vigabatrin, levetiracetam and zonisamide all exert negative effects on mood and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112440514">Kalinin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several case reports suggested levetiracetam, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin and rufinamide could induce self-harming behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112440514">Andersohn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112440514">Kaufman and Struck, 2011</xref>), topiramate was reported to induce psychotic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112440514">Khan et al., 1999</xref>), diazepam to induce self-aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112440514">Berman et al., 2005</xref>), levetiracetam to induce catatonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112440514">Chouinard et al., 2006</xref>) and clonazepam to induce behavioural disinhibition, suicidal ideation and self-mutilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112440514">Kandemir et al., 2008</xref>). Phenytoin use was reported to be associated with psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112440514">Schmitz et al., 1999</xref>). At the end of the day lamotrigine constitutes an enigma and the literature cannot shed any light on this issue. Thus, in the future, RCTs should specifically focus on issues concerning depression and suicidal thoughts in order to elucidate the issue.</p>
<p>The advantage of the current review is that we performed a broad systematic search of MEDLINE with strict criteria and located and reviewed a large number of papers before selecting a small number of studies appropriate for further review. It is highly unlikely that other important studies except for those included in the current review exist. The main disadvantages of the current review are that it was restricted to the search of MEDLINE and to English language articles. An inherent disadvantage is that the papers selected have a significant amount of bias, making conclusions very difficult and unstable.</p>
