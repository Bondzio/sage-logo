<title>Background</title>
<p>Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was introduced in the 1990s as a new method of recruiting hard-to-reach populations in research, mainly in studies focusing on HIV risk behaviour. This method of sampling originates from a smaller number of non-randomly selected study persons, usually called ‘seeds’, who are interviewed and included in the study. Thereafter, these individuals recruit a determined number of other subjects known to them, often three, and in this way, the study sample grows with each wave of recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812465028">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812465028"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812465028">3</xref>]. The newer RDS technique adds important features to older chain-referral methods; clients obtain incentives both for their own participation and for successful recruitment of peers, and their peers are identified only when they volunteer for the study, instead of being identified by the index client. Recruitment is to continue until equilibrium is reached for central variables, i.e. when the distribution of relevant characteristics becomes independent of how these characteristics are distributed among the original seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812465028">1</xref>]. Since the introduction of this technique, it has been applied in a large number of studies, assessing several potentially hard-to-reach populations, including injecting drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465028">4</xref>]. Although many of these studies have been assessing injecting drug users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465028">4</xref>], few have started the sampling process specifically from syringe exchange clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812465028">5</xref>]. The RDS technique mainly has been applied in populations at high risk of HIV in a US setting, in different Asian countries and in Eastern Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465028">4</xref>], and to a lesser extent in Western European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812465028">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812465028"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812465028">8</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the RDS technique has not previously been used in Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>The present study was part of a larger project in cooperation between Lund University and the Swedish National Institute of Public Health (and funded by a grant from the latter), intending to analyse ‘hidden’ illicit substance use in the community. Outreach efforts and research methods in out-of-treatment drug users are of great relevance to the public health field. In a setting with a syringe exchange program (SEP) assumed to have a large coverage among injecting drug users, the present study aimed to examine whether RDS in a syringe exchange setting can be used in order to identify heavy drug users unknown to treatment providers and other authorities likely to get into contact with heavy drug users. Also, the study intended to examine whether characteristics of clients recruited at later stages of the chain-referral process differed from clients recruited earlier in the process.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494812465028" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The present study was conducted in Malmö, Sweden, a city of 290,000 inhabitants, and which is the central urban area of the region of Skane, in close vicinity to the larger capital city of Denmark, Copenhagen. The recruitment of seeds started in August 2008, and the study was closed in April 2009. The study used the SEP at Malmö University Hospital for recruitment into the study. The SEP of Malmö has around 900 unique clients annually, and this SEP and the program of the neighbouring city of Lund, which are both operating since the mid-1980s, were until recently the only SEPs in Sweden. In Sweden, as well as among the clients of the present SEP, heroin and amphetamine are the main primary drugs injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812465028">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812465028">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Six initial seeds were selected, mainly based on the interviewers’ assumption about these subjects’ ability to contact and recruit other study subjects. While the generation of peers was not satisfactory after three months, three additional seeds were selected. Among the nine seeds, six were male and three female, and five were primary heroin users and four primary amphetamine users. The percentage of heroin and amphetamine users, respectively, corresponds roughly to the distribution of these primary drugs at the SEP of Malmö [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812465028">10</xref>]. Clients were assessed with a baseline interview, including questions about demographic data, employment and income, living conditions, marital status and social network characteristics, substance use during the previous 30 days (an adaptation of the substance use sections of the Addiction Severity Index, ASI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812465028">11</xref>]), current readiness to change drug use, contacts with health care and other authorities, and physical disorders including blood-borne infections.</p>
<p>After this assessment, each subject received three numbered coupons, in order to recruit three other drug users for inclusion in the study. Subjects were instructed to recruit ‘heavy drug users’ following the definition used in previous epidemiological and case-finding work in the Swedish setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812465028">9</xref>], i.e. an individual reporting either injecting a drug at least once during the past twelve months, of using a drug by any route of administration daily or almost daily during the past four weeks. Using the system with numbered coupons, an individual could only be included once. Subjects received telephone cards as incentives, one telephone card with a value of SEK 75 (USD 12 at the time of the study) for the interview, and one card with the same value for each (up to three) of the peers recruited.</p>
<p>Recruited clients were instructed to show up for assessment at the syringe exchange, or to call in order to arrange an interview at another location. Only one client chose the latter option, and was interviewed in the offices of the research group. Two interviewers, experienced in clinical and outreach work with heavy drug users, and trained and experienced in research work, were present at the SEP five days a week from the morning until noon, in order to interview recruited patients.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Ethics committee, Lund University, Sweden.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494812465028">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>The study aimed to report the proportion of clients who did not have any previous or recent contact with treatment or other authorities, and to assess characteristics of clients recruited at later stages, in comparison to clients recruited at early stages. Clients in waves 4–9 were compared with seeds and clients in the first three waves of recruitment. These clients were compared in binary analysis (chi-square for categorical variables and <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables). Statistical significance was calculated with 95% confidence intervals. All calculations were carried out using the software SPSS version 17.0.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Among the nine seeds, five were generative. One seed generated 28 peers (nine waves), one generated 18 peers (seven waves), one generated nine peers (five waves), and two seeds generated only two peers (one wave) each (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812465028">Table I</xref>). Altogether, including the nine seeds, 68 subjects were assessed. However, two subjects did not successfully complete the interviews, and were excluded, thus including 66 subjects for further analysis. The three seeds who generated five or more waves were all primary heroin users, but 14 of the 53 clients recruited by them (26%) were primary amphetamine users.</p>

<p>Among these 66 clients interviewed, 71% were male and 91% were born in Sweden. Subjects were, on average, 38.3 years old (median 39 years, range 20–62). A total of 68% did not have stable housing. Nine per cent reported working, whereas 74% were unemployed and 17% were on sick leave or disability pension. Only 18% were married or living with their partner and 50% had children.</p>
<p>A total of 74% were primary heroin users (including one client who reported both heroin and benzodiazepines to be his primary drug), while 26% were primary amphetamine users. All subjects were injectors, and most reported injecting either three times (36%) or four times or more (47%) on a typical day of drug use. All subjects, except one client who was recruited in the first wave, were clients of the SEP. Most subjects reported visiting the SEP at least weekly (70%), whereas 9% reported visiting less than monthly. Thus, with the exception of one individual, the recruitment did not reach beyond the group of syringe exchangers. Half of the subjects reported at least one opiate overdose, and 23% reported at least one suicide attempt. Self-reported hepatitis B and C infection was reported by 36% and 82%, respectively, and all but three (95%) were tobacco smokers. Subjects who reported one other source of clean syringes/needles in addition to the SEP amounted to 94%, most commonly from friends (59%) or from Denmark (30%).</p>
<p>For most variables studied, clients recruited in waves 4–9 did not differ from clients recruited as seeds or during waves 1–3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812465028">Table II</xref>). Among 35 variables studied, only one significantly separated clients recruited later from those recruited early; clients in waves 0–3 were significantly more likely to have children (61% versus 36%, odds ratio (OR) 4.07 (1.16–14.25) after controlling for age). No significant differences were seen with respect to primary drug, injection frequency or other drug-related variables, demographic data, living conditions, income, marital status, prison or treatment history. On a nearly significant level, clients recruited later were more likely to attend the SEP at least weekly (82% versus 61%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.059). None of the variables describing treatment or other authority contracts differed significantly between the groups. Using injection equipment from Denmark was more common in the group recruited later (43 versus 21%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). When controlling for weekly SEP attendance, the association remained between being in the group recruited later and the use of Danish injection equipment (OR 3.82 (1.15–12.63), <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), as well as the association between that group and the higher likelihood of weekly SEP attendance (OR 4.09 (1.14–14.72), <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is the first to assess drug users in a Scandinavian setting with RDS, and, to the best of our knowledge, one of relatively few studies assessing highly problematic drug users in a Western European setting with the present technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465028">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812465028">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812465028"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812465028">8</xref>]. It is also one of very few studies using the RDS technique with seeds recruited specifically at a SEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465028">4</xref>]. While the present study intended to analyse ‘hidden’ drug users less likely to be in contact with treatment and other authorities, the later waves of the present study did not reach beyond the population of syringe exchange clients. Almost all (except for one client already in the first wave of the study) clients were syringe exchangers, and clients recruited in the later stages were no less likely to be frequent attendees, and even tended to be more likely to be frequent visitors. Clients in waves 4–9 also did not differ with respect to syringe sharing, and also were not significantly less likely to report contact with authorities, and while recent social authority contact tended to be less common, recent contact with police or enforcement service tended to be more common in these later waves. Among 35 variables studied, only one significantly separated clients recruited later from those recruited earlier, and one significant difference out of 35 is no better than chance. In summary, there were no clear findings indicating that clients recruited later, several waves away from the seeds, displayed characteristics clearly different from those of the early recruited clients, and they did not appear to be clearly less known to different authorities. The finding that clients more distant from the seeds in the chain-referral process were more likely to obtain syringes from Denmark can not be assumed to indicate a more ‘hidden’ substance use pattern, as they were also more likely to report frequent SEP attendance.</p>
<p>While RDS has proven efficacious in the recruitment of hard-to-reach populations in different settings, the present study, starting with seeds recruited at a SEP, failed to reach beyond the SEP population. While the present technique did not reach beyond the group of SEP clients, and although all successfully generative seeds were heroin users, they did recruit amphetamine users. On the other hand, although this process of chain-referral reached both primary heroin and amphetamine users, despite the fact that all the most generative seeds were heroin users, non-injecting drug users or clients not attending the SEP were not reached. Also, the recruitment process was slower in our study than in the study by McKnight and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812465028">5</xref>], where the seeds were also SEP clients. The fact that non-SEP clients were not reached in our study is also in contrast to the study of McKnight and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812465028">5</xref>], where 19% of clients in the final study material were ex-injectors and 38% never-injectors. This different finding in the present study, although in a markedly smaller group of subjects, may be related to features of the recruitment process carried out here, or to characteristics of the SEP population assessed here. However, in a recent report comparing an RDS dataset in Seattle to other surveys of drug users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812465028">12</xref>], the RDS investigation did not appear to reach a fully representative group of injecting drug users, highlighting barriers of the technique to fully penetrate into all relevant subgroups.</p>
<p>Also, although this must be assessed with caution, one possible explanation could potentially be a high coverage of the SEP of Malmö within the population of drug injectors. Preliminary data from post mortem analyses of heroin overdose fatalities in the present setting, where 71% had previous contact with the SEP, indicated a relatively good coverage of the program among heroin users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812465028">13</xref>]. This, however, must be interpreted with great caution, and needs further evaluation in other studies. Likewise, it is uncertain whether the difficulty in reaching ‘hidden’ drug users is related to features specific to the Swedish or Scandinavian drug scene, such as policy issues. This is beyond the scope of the present study, and may require more in-depth interviewing with out-of-treatment drug users. Limitations of the present study are mainly related to the limited number of subjects, which is in the lower range of sample sizes reported from studies using RDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465028">4</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the present setting, with seeds recruited from the SEP, the RDS technique was unable to reach other heavy drug users outside the syringe exchange population. Also, as a majority of SEP clients reported contacts with other authorities, the method was not able to reach large numbers of ‘hidden’ drug users. Further efforts, such as the active selection of drug users separated from the SEP, or chain-referral processes originating from other settings, may be needed in order to identify ‘hidden’ drug users without contact with syringe exchange, treatment providers or other services.</p>
