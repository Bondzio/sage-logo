<body>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. At present, more than one-third of the world’s population is infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811421284">1</xref></sup> The Khorasan province in Iran has a high prevalence of TB, estimated to be 26 cases per 100,000. This could be due to neighboring Afghanistan, where TB is endemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811421284">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thyroid TB is a rare condition, even in high-prevalence countries, and it has an estimated prevalence of 0.1% to 0.4% of all diagnosed TB cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811421284">2</xref></sup> Since thyroid TB has nonspecific manifestations, the diagnosis is difficult. It can mimic carcinoma, produce diffuse thyroid enlargement suggesting chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, or very rarely present as an acute abscess. In this case report, we describe a patient with thyroid TB that mimicked carcinoma and presented as an acute abscess. This report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599811421284">
<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our Otorhinolaryngology Department at Quaem Hospital of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences with a complaint of a neck mass. She had had the mass for 6 months, and it had gradually increased in size. She complained of dysphonia, dysphagia, and aspiration for the past 3 months. She also had nocturnal low-grade fever, anorexia, and insignificant weight loss. Physical examination revealed a 10- × 10-cm tender, erythematous mass on the right side of the patient’s neck extending to the midline with a rubbery consolidation that moved with swallowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811421284"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). No associated cervical lymphadenopathies were palpated.</p>

</fig>
<p>On indirect laryngoscopic examination, there was a midline fixation of the right true vocal cord. Thyroid function tests revealed a subclinical hypothyroidism, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a huge heterogeneous mass with large hypodense areas from the cricoid to the thoracic inlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811421284"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The trachea was deviated to the left, and the carotid sheath was laterally displaced. There were signs of right recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis in the larynx. A fine-needle aspiration of the mass produced a thick white and yellowish fluid, which was sent for aerobic, anaerobic, and TB smear and culture. The smear was positive for <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, and the culture revealed <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>. A tuberculin skin test was also positive. To alleviate the patient’s symptoms, the abscess was drained via a small incision, and a drain was inserted. Once the acute inflammatory symptoms had subsided, the patient was referred to an infectious disease specialist. She received standard anti-TB medication and responded well to the treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) mainly occurs as a result of hematogenous or lymphogenous dissemination from a pulmonary focus. Extrapulmonary sites of infection commonly include lymph nodes, pleura, and bone, although EPTB can involve any organ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811421284">3</xref></sup> The percentage of EPTB is estimated to be 21% without pulmonary involvement. But both pulmonary TB and EPTB could present simultaneously, so chest radiography should be done in all cases. EPTB is mostly seen in cases of endemic TB and in immunocompromised patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811421284">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the occurrence of thyroid TB is rare, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of a thyroid mass, especially in endemic areas. The symptoms may vary and are particularly nonspecific, making the correct diagnosis difficult. Some cases of thyroid TB may present with a thyroid nodule, chronic thyroiditis, diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811421284">4</xref></sup> an acute abscess, or chronic fistulas. Pressure symptoms such as dysphagia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811421284">5</xref></sup> dyspnea,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811421284">5</xref></sup> or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811421284">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811421284">5</xref></sup> have also been reported. Interestingly, acute abscesses and pressure symptoms are among the least common symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811421284">4</xref></sup> but all were seen in our patient.</p>
<p>Diagnosis is established by acid fast bacilli staining and more precisely by culture. Ultrasonography and CT may also help to identify the location and extent of the mass. These techniques combined with a positive tuberculin skin test and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate should be sufficient for a correct diagnosis. Anti-TB medication can then be used to treat both the pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. The regimen of anti-TB drugs should be administered for a period of 6 months. Occasionally, the acute abscess may need to be drained to relieve the symptoms, as was the case in our patient.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In countries where TB is endemic, the possibility of thyroid TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a thyroid mass, which could be mistaken as a malignant lesion.</p>
