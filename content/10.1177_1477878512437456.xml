<abstract>
<p>This article offers a critique of Harry Brighouse’s ‘autonomy-facilitating education’, which aims to enable students to reflect critically on their lives and society without disposing them to do so. Because it is ‘character-neutral’, this kind of education purportedly avoids some of the controversy surrounding autonomy-promotion. At the same time, it allegedly equips students to withstand common pressures and influences which jeopardize their prospective autonomy. Yet, as I argue here, autonomy-facilitating education cannot live up to the promises Brighouse makes for it. As the case of sex education exemplifies, students need more than a toolbox of rational skills to overcome persistent threats to their autonomy. They need access to an autonomy-<italic>promoting</italic> education that attends to their cognitive and psychosocial development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of recent works in political and educational theory maintain that children have a morally compelling interest in developing the capacity for autonomy and that the liberal state ought to advance this interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512437456">Brighouse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477878512437456">Callan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477878512437456">Levinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437456">Reich, 2002</xref>). One key, self-acknowledged challenge for the authors of these works is to define this interest – and the measures necessary for its advancement – in ways that adequately respect deep diversity and the many different conceptions of the good life that individuals should be free to pursue in a liberal society. Mindful of the challenge, these theorists rightfully resist comprehensive conceptions of autonomy that spell out in detail how individuals should conduct themselves, what projects they should pursue, and what goals and aspirations they should have for their lives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477878512437456">Callan (1997</xref>: 152), for example, argues that children have a fundamental interest in ‘a degree of autonomous development that takes them beyond . . . “ethical servility”’ – or in other words, beyond a condition in which they lack any sense of their own moral equality and worth, and are mere instruments to the fulfillment of others’ wishes. Yet Callan rejects the promotion of more exacting and rationalistic conceptions of autonomy that ‘exalt Socratic self-examination as the summon bonum’ (p. 152) and ‘demand commitment to reasoned self-rule as the apogee of human development’ (p. 154). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437456">Reich (2002</xref>: 96–9) disavows accounts of personal autonomy that call for extreme individualism and relentless rationality. Instead, he defends a conception of ‘minimalist autonomy’ that leaves ‘ample room for many different ways of life, including those that are rooted in faith’ (p. 102). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477878512437456">Levinson (1999</xref>: 30) also espouses what she describes as ‘a minimal but substantive notion of autonomy that . . . does not permit self-enslavement, but on the other hand, does permit the adoption of deep commitments, including love, loyalty, religion, and patriotism’. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse (2000</xref>: 94), as if in chorus with the others, insists that ‘autonomy is compatible with a wide variety of ways of life including those which involve traditional values’.</p>
<p>So long as ‘autonomy’ is understood in a modest sense, most of the aforementioned liberal theorists believe the liberal state should use its regulatory authority over formal schooling to actively <italic>promote</italic> autonomy in children. The exception is Brighouse, who believes the state should <italic>facilitate</italic>, but not promote autonomy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512437456">Brighouse (1998</xref>: 733–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">2000</xref>: 80–2) distinguishes between ‘autonomy-facilitating education’, which aims to equip children to reflect critically on their lives and society without disposing them to do so, and ‘autonomy-promoting education’, which aims to both enable and encourage such critical reflection. He favors the former pedagogical approach for a few different reasons. For one, some individuals may be ‘very ill suited’ to engage in this kind of critical reflection; and by inclining them to do so, autonomy-promoting education may cause these individuals real harm and lessen their chances of leading flourishing lives (Brighouse in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477878512437456">Curren et al., 2001</xref>: 413). For another, autonomy-promoting education is allegedly problematic from the standpoint of liberal legitimacy. Insofar as it not only teaches skills of critical reflection, but also cultivates the inclination to use those skills, an autonomy-promoting education ‘actively conditions’ an autonomy-based conception of the good life, thereby undermining citizens’ ability to give free, unconditioned consent – a prerequisite for liberal legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse, 2000</xref>: 82). According to Brighouse, autonomy-facilitating education sidesteps both of these troubling potential consequences because it is ‘character neutral’ (p. 81): it aims to impart critical thinking skills without simultaneously shaping children’s characters and inclinations. Moreover, Brighouse maintains that there is an additional, pragmatic advantage to autonomy-facilitating education, which has to do with its underlying rationale. The justification for autonomy-facilitating education relies, in large part, on the instrumental value of autonomy in helping individuals discover lives that are good for them. However, unlike autonomy-promoting education, its justification does not rely on the more controversial, perfectionist premise that ‘living autonomously is somehow intrinsically superior to living heteronomously’ (Brighouse in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477878512437456">Curren et al., 2001</xref>: 412). Thus, Brighouse suggests, autonomy-facilitating education may be more amenable to deeply religious parents and other skeptics of autonomy because, as opposed to the more philosophically loaded alternative, it does not presume that their substantive moral views are false.</p>
<p>The question at the heart of this article is whether autonomy-facilitating education – for all of its putative advantages – can reliably enable children to live autonomously (in the modest sense of overcoming ethical servility). My thesis is that it cannot, and that state-regulated schools should <italic>promote</italic>, rather than facilitate, autonomy. In Section 2 of the article, I discuss Brighouse’s case for autonomy-facilitating education in greater detail. In Section 3, I argue that his case ultimately falters, given that individuals do not develop the capacity for autonomy without also developing an autonomous character. In Section 4, I use the example of sex education to examine how schools can better equip children to withstand persistent threats to their autonomy. And in the brief concluding section of the article, I affirm that an autonomy-promoting education – which attends to students’ cognitive and psychosocial development – is necessary to protect their prospective interest in personal autonomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1477878512437456">
<title>The case for autonomy-facilitating education</title>
<p>According to Brighouse, many children grow up in settings unfriendly to the development and exercise of a capacity for personal autonomy. The prospects for becoming autonomous are particularly bleak for those surrounded by poverty whose basic needs (for food, shelter, physical security, and health care) all too often go unmet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477878512437456">1</xref></sup> Many other children who do not grow up in poverty are nonetheless subject to pressures and influences that jeopardize their prospective autonomy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse (2000</xref>: 66) identifies ‘four familiar nonautonomous processes’ that are liable to color the formation of children’s basic beliefs and preferences:</p>
<list id="list1-1477878512437456" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the process by which others coercively restrict the options available to the agent;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the process by which others deliberately misinform the agent about available options;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the process by which the agent ‘subconsciously’ adapts her beliefs and preferences to ‘apparently unchangeable circumstances’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the process by which the agent ‘<italic>consciously and deliberately</italic>’ accommodates her beliefs and preferences to ‘unjust background conditions’.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Fortunately, Brighouse contends, ‘teachable skills’ of ‘critical reflection’ can help developing minds avoid or overcome these ubiquitous processes of coercion, manipulation, and ‘adaptive and accommodationist preference-formation’ (pp. 66–7). As they mature, individuals can be taught to gather and weigh evidence on their own, and to distinguish spurious claims from relatively well-founded ones. In turn, individuals can use these critical thinking skills to consider and appraise different life options. They also can use these skills to reflect upon already-existing commitments – taking a step back and analyzing how these commitments came to be formed in the first place. (Brighouse acknowledges that many of the child’s initial beliefs and preferences are formed non-autonomously, but, he asserts, these beliefs and practices <italic>become</italic> autonomous once they are subjected to rational criticism and potential revision.) In sum, Brighouse argues that with adequate provision for their basic needs, and with the requisite epistemic training, children can learn to transcend the autonomy-inhibiting features of the world in which they grow up.</p>
<p>The fact that children can be taught skills that are conducive to their prospective autonomy does not entail that they should be taught such skills. In the face of parental objections, state imposition of autonomy-facilitating education on all children requires justification. Brighouse mounts an impressive, two-pronged justification consisting of an ‘instrumental argument’ and an argument from liberal legitimacy. The first of these arguments is based on a purported connection between personal autonomy and individual flourishing. Autonomy-related skills, so the argument goes, are instrumental in helping individuals discover ‘how to live well’, particularly under modern conditions of ‘moral and economic complexity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">2000</xref>: 69). Brighouse denies that the employment of such skills is a necessary prerequisite for leading a flourishing life: some individuals will happen upon good lives through sheer luck, or by unreflectively adopting the ways of life privileged by their parents or other authority figures. Still, given that they should not rely on fortunate guesswork and cannot necessarily count on authority figures being both well-informed and well-intentioned, children greatly improve their prospects for living well by developing the capacity rationally to evaluate different life options on their own. Rational reflection is not foolproof and not necessary in all cases, but it is – Brighouse argues – the most reliable ‘known device’ for uncovering how to live well (p. 71).</p>
<p>Brighouse’s second major argument for state imposition of an autonomy-facilitating education is based on an avowed connection between personal autonomy and liberal legitimacy. A legitimate state, according to Brighouse, is one which faithfully seeks the ‘free and authentic’ – which is to say, <italic>uncoerced</italic> and <italic>unmanipulated</italic> – consent of its citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">2000</xref>: 76). However, even a state that is determined to win over its citizens in the most transparent and respectful manner will be unable to ‘refrain entirely from encouraging consent in ways that bypass or pre-empt their rational scrutiny’ (p. 77). This is because in carrying out many of its appropriate functions – including establishing rules, issuing official reports, and guaranteeing individual rights and freedoms – the liberal state is liable to elicit <italic>pre</italic>-reflective approval. Fortunately, Brighouse contends, the state can mitigate the inevitable conditioning of consent by equipping future citizens to scrutinize critically its own institutions and policies. This is where autonomy-facilitating education – with its focus on teaching skills of rational reflection – figures into the argument. By Brighouse’s account, the state should institute autonomy-facilitating education, and supplement it with the relevant humanistic and social scientific content, in order to enable the free and authentic consent that undergirds liberal legitimacy.</p>
<p>In summation, according to Brighouse, teachable skills of critical reflection can help children overcome common pressures and influences which threaten their prospective autonomy. Furthermore, even in the face of objections by some parents and citizens, two central arguments justify state imposition of autonomy-facilitating education, which aims to equip children to reflect critically on their lives and society without disposing them to do so. The instrumental argument suggests that this kind of education helps children discover lives that are good for them. The argument from liberal legitimacy suggests that this kind of education helps children become the kinds of citizens who can freely and authentically consent to the state. However, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse’s (2000</xref>: 82) account, neither one of these arguments justifies state imposition of the ‘more loaded’ autonomy-promoting education, which is defended by theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477878512437456">Callan (1997</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477878512437456">Levinson (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437456">Reich (2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In highlighting a key difference between autonomy-facilitating and autonomy-promoting education, Brighouse draws the following analogy:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Autonomy-facilitating] education does not try to ensure that students employ autonomy in their lives, any more than Latin classes are aimed at ensuring that students employ Latin in their lives. Rather it aims to enable them to live autonomously should they wish to, rather as we aim to enable them to criticize poetry, do algebra, etc. without trying to ensure that they do so. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse, 2000</xref>: 80)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The passage makes clear that Brighouse views autonomy as resting on a set of competencies and skills that can be taught to students in a way that leaves their propensities and motivations unaffected. Students can learn to practice autonomy in the classroom – much like they can learn to translate Virgil’s Aeneid in the classroom – without feeling compelled to make use of this capacity in other settings. Yet there is something odd (and, I think, misleading) about this comparison. For many children – even those destined to become classics scholars, or devotees of the Roman Catholic Traditional Latin Mass – learning to exercise autonomy is liable to have greater relevance and importance, and far broader application in their lives, than learning Latin. I suspect Brighouse would agree, for the very reasons he offers in defense of state imposition of autonomy-facilitating education: learning to exercise autonomy helps individuals discover lives that are good for them and helps them become the kinds of citizens who can freely and authentically consent to the state. But if these reasons are compelling, are we really to believe that state-regulated schools should remain just as ambivalent about whether students practice autonomy in their lives as whether they ‘employ Latin in their lives’? If autonomy-related skills stand to serve such important functions in the lives of individuals and in society at large, should schools really stop short of encouraging students to make use of such skills? For that matter, is it even possible to teach autonomy-related skills without at the same time promoting their use? These are some of the questions that I take up in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1477878512437456">
<title>Why autonomy-facilitating education does not suffice</title>
<p>Brighouse draws compelling connections between personal autonomy, individual flourishing, and liberal legitimacy in his work. Yet his account of how state-regulated schools can (and should) enable children to exercise personal autonomy defies plausibility. In this section, I argue – in concert with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477878512437456">Callan (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477878512437456">2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437456">Reich (2002</xref>: 247, note 28) – that Brighouse’s case for autonomy-facilitating education ultimately falters given that individuals do not develop the capacity for personal autonomy without also developing an autonomous character. Moreover, I contend that the implementation of autonomy-promoting education in state-regulated schools is justified, even though such implementation is bound to have non-neutral effects on different cultural traditions and ways of life.</p>
<p>As I indicated in the previous section, Brighouse associates the capacity for personal autonomy with the ability to think critically about one’s ethical commitments and life options. By his account, to be capable of such critical thinking, one must possess (though not necessarily feel compelled to use) certain rational skills – of which he considers weighing evidence and evaluating truth claims to be noteworthy examples. Brighouse contends that state-regulated schools can (and should) enable children to exercise personal autonomy by imparting critical thinking skills in the classroom without encouraging the use of such skills outside the classroom. Indeed, his distinction between autonomy-facilitating and autonomy-promoting education, and his ringing defense of the former, both hinge on this very possibility.</p>
<p>The problem, here, is that individuals do not develop the capacity for personal autonomy by acquiring rational skills alone. To develop this capacity is to become a certain sort of person – one who does not merely possess rational skills, but who is inclined to use those skills in a variety of circumstances and in different areas of one’s life. Thus, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477878512437456">Siegel (1988</xref>: 41) says in reference to an ‘education aimed at the development of critical thinking’ also applies to an education aimed at the development of personal autonomy: it is ‘a complex business, which must seek to foster a host of attitudes, emotions, dispositions, habits and character traits as well as a wide variety of reasoning skills’. To be sure, learning rational skills – such as how to gather and weigh evidence and how to assess the reasons that are leveraged in support of various beliefs, claims and actions – is a necessary precondition for the development of personal autonomy. An individual who lacks such skills will not be able to reflect rationally on her ethical commitments and life options. She will be substantially more reliant on the judgment of others, and more susceptible to manipulation, than she otherwise might be.</p>
<p>Yet while learning rational skills is certainly necessary, it is not sufficient to become capable of personal autonomy. To become so capable, in addition to acquiring skills, one must develop a certain character, as well as certain mental habits and dispositions which are akin to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477878512437456">Siegel (1988</xref>: 39) collectively refers to as the ‘critical attitude’ or ‘critical spirit’. Those who possess the critical spirit are loath to accept claims without warrant. They are positively inclined to weigh evidence carefully and impartially before reaching a particular conclusion. They subject their own beliefs (as well as others’ beliefs) to a range of criticism, and prove willing to revise those beliefs in light of new evidence or compelling counterarguments. In short, they ‘value good reasoning’ and are ‘disposed to believe and act on its basis’ (p. 39).</p>
<p>Once we acknowledge that autonomous individuals evince rational habits and dispositions, in addition to skills, doubts emerge as to the plausibility of autonomy-facilitating education. Equipping children to exercise personal autonomy appears to have more to do with the formation of character and identity than Brighouse suggests. With his apt analogy between the cultivation of autonomy and the cultivation of patience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477878512437456">Callan (2002</xref>: 123–5) casts even further doubt on the plausibility of autonomy-facilitating education. Callan argues that, like patience, autonomy is a character virtue that ‘bend[s] the will toward some ends rather than others’ (p. 124). As such, it cannot be instilled in children without impinging upon their dispositions and characters and without acceding to the very perfectionism that Brighouse disavows.</p>
<p>In a world where instant gratification exerts a powerful lure, children need encouragement and positive reinforcement from adult role models to develop patience. They need ‘emotional comfort and high praise’ to sustain early efforts at exercising this virtue, and to surmount the difficulties and frustrations that inevitably arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477878512437456">Callan, 2002</xref>: 125). By the same token, children need encouragement and affective support to develop the capacity for personal autonomy. Especially for those not yet accustomed to its challenges, exercising (or attempting to exercise) autonomy can be arduous, and can bring unwelcome consequences. Consider Callan’s example of the child who autonomously confronts petulant and boorish behavior among her peers and ends up losing peers as a result. How should parents or educators, who want to enable the child to steel her resolve and maintain her moral independence, respond in such a case? Callan contends that they should acknowledge and celebrate the <italic>intrinsic</italic> merit of her actions. Having suffered the loss of friends, she may well have doubts about the long-term instrumental benefits of exercising autonomy. Thus, maintaining one’s moral independence in the face of tribulations must be presented to her as praiseworthy and ‘admirable in itself, something to be cherished in the image of the human being she should want to be’ (p. 125).</p>
<p>If children were innately predisposed to become autonomous, or if they all grew up in milieus that were reliably supportive of their prospective autonomy, the kind of active encouragement and positive reinforcement to which Callan points might not be necessary. But, in actuality, neither of these conditions holds true. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse (2000</xref>: 71) himself postulates that children are not ‘hard wired’ to be autonomous, and he acknowledges that they are inevitably subject to pressures and influences which jeopardize their prospective autonomy (see the previous section). Of course, as I noted previously, Brighouse also asserts that teaching children certain rational skills – <italic>without</italic> concomitantly encouraging them to use such skills – is sufficient to prepare them to overcome familiar processes of coercion, manipulation, and adaptive and accommodationist preference formation. Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477878512437456">Callan (2000</xref>: 146–7) argues persuasively against this latter assertion. By Callan’s account, the non-autonomous processes to which Brighouse refers typically do not function by ‘blocking the acquisition of knowledge or skill’ (p. 146). Instead, these processes shape children’s ‘affect and desire’ in such a way that even if they subsequently acquire knowledge and skill that is conducive to their autonomy, they will be reluctant or unwilling to use it for that end.</p>
<p>In sharpening the above point, Callan offers an example of a child who is taught to believe that a woman’s proper place is in the home, and that she must become a housewife when she grows up. Although the phrase does not appear in Callan’s brief description, it is clear from context that the child is now – and, barring the right kind of intervention, will continue to be – ‘ethically servile’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477878512437456">2</xref></sup> She has been conditioned to put others’ interests above her own, to fulfill a predetermined role in her family and in society, and to consent to ‘political structures that foist that role on her and other women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477878512437456">2000</xref>: 147). Callan notes that, if all that sustains the child’s belief that she must become a housewife is a lack of the relevant knowledge or skill, then exposure to Brighouse’s autonomy-facilitating education might be enough for her to rethink her goals and revise her plans for the future. However, if, as is more likely the case, ‘emotional inhibitions’ have been inculcated in the child such that she is loath to expose the aforementioned belief to reflective criticism, ‘then knowledge of alternative careers and the skills to pursue them acquired later will do nothing to shake her sense of domestic destiny’ (p. 146). Autonomy-facilitating education, in other words, cannot help to liberate and empower a prototypical, ‘Ethically Servile Child’. It is simply powerless to counteract the kind of conditioning that generated and sustains her servility.</p>
<p>Certainly, Brighouse is right to stress the normative importance of autonomy for individual well-being and liberal legitimacy. He is also right to acknowledge that children inevitably encounter pressures and influences which threaten their prospective autonomy. Yet Brighouse misconstrues the workings of these pressures and influences, and wrongly suggests that a character-neutral education can empower children to overcome them. If they are to become capable of exercising autonomy, and realizing the benefits thereof, children must acquire more than a toolbox of rational skills. They also must develop the motivation and will to use those skills in the face of substantial pressure to do otherwise. Such development is unlikely to occur naturally or spontaneously; it requires prodding, encouragement, and positive reinforcement from adult role models. Thus, in the name of bolstering children’s opportunity to become autonomous, state-regulated schools should implement the character-<italic>partial</italic>, autonomy-<italic>promoting</italic> education that Brighouse disavows, rather than the character-neutral, autonomy-facilitating education that he advances.</p>
<p>Admittedly, encouraging and positively reinforcing children’s initial efforts at autonomy – the hallmark of autonomy-promotion – increases the likelihood that they will pursue ways of life amenable to the continued exercise of autonomy. This is a necessary and justifiable consequence of preparing children to make their own, independent decisions about how to live. Consider, again, the analogy between autonomy and patience. Acquiring patience affects the way one looks at the world, the appeal of various life options, and the probability that one can pursue certain options with success. (As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477878512437456">Callan (2002</xref>: 124) observes, teaching and parenting are apt to be more attractive to – and less taxing on – the patient person than the impatient one.) Similarly, developing the capacity for autonomy is bound to color one’s perceptions, behaviors, and proclivities – the upshot being that one will be drawn towards ways of life that are compatible with the realization of this capacity and repelled by ways of life that are not. ‘In learning to become autonomous’, Callan writes, ‘we acquire no neutral instrumentality but a character primed to resist the attractions of heteronomous lives’ (p. 126). This is not to suggest that it is impossible for an autonomous person to relinquish her autonomy and choose ‘a life of servility’; it is to suggest, however, that by making such a choice she would be acting ‘<italic>against</italic> the grain of character’ (p. 123; <italic>original emphasis</italic>).</p>
<p>In the final analysis, liberal proponents of autonomy must accept that the process of enabling children to live autonomously is bound to have non-neutral effects on different cultural traditions and ways of life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437456">Reich (2002</xref>: 114) acknowledges, a state that cultivates autonomy ultimately shapes and constrains cultural diversity, establishing ‘an environment in which autonomy-friendly ways of life are far likelier to flourish than autonomy-unfriendly ways of life’. Brighouse – in calling for the implementation of a character-neutral, autonomy-facilitating education in state-regulated schools – hopes to mitigate this consequence. Yet, as the preceding paragraphs indicate, cultivating autonomy, in practice, is not a character-neutral process, but a character- and identity-shaping one which ultimately disposes its subjects to value and protect their newfound moral independence. Thus, if liberals are coherently to defend the cultivation of autonomy as a goal of education policy, they cannot avoid the perfectionist claim that living autonomously is intrinsically superior to living heteronomously. And they must admit that this policy goal favors some cultural traditions and ways of life over others.</p>
<p>At first blush, this seems like a paradoxical position for liberals to take. After all, the aims of education in a liberal state – and the measures conducive to achieving those aims – should be articulated in ways that adequately respect deep diversity. A state acts oppressively and plainly fails to respect deep diversity when it uses its regulatory authority over formal schooling to impose a comprehensive conception of the good life on future citizens. Yet a state which promotes personal autonomy – where ‘personal autonomy’ is defined modestly, in terms of the supersession of ethical servility – does no such thing. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477878512437456">Reich (2002</xref>:118) asserts, ‘the capacity for and exercise of minimalist autonomy is entirely consistent with broad cultural diversity’. Autonomous individuals freely pursue many different ways of life – including those that involve profound religious commitments, traditional values, and communal attachments. That said, it would be erroneous to claim that autonomy-promoting education is supportive of all cultural traditions and ways of life, and disruptive to none. ‘[T]hose cultural traditions that inscribe rigid hierarchies of domination, or that emphasize unquestioning obedience to authority’ (p. 119), for instance, will have greater difficulty attracting or maintaining adherents among people who have been exposed to this kind of education. Yet this is not a justifiable reason to deny children the opportunity to become autonomous. A liberal state, with the courage of its convictions, should not hesitate to help future citizens develop the cognitive and emotional wherewithal to overcome ethical servility, regardless of the effect on particular cultural traditions and ways of life.</p>
<p>In this section, I have argued that autonomy-facilitating education does not equip children to overcome common pressures and influences which jeopardize their prospective autonomy, and therefore, state-regulated schools should implement autonomy-promoting education instead. In the following section, in the interest of concretizing these arguments, I consider the impact such implementation can have on a particularly problem-laden, but nevertheless important, part of the school curriculum: sex education. I begin by briefly examining what recent studies suggest about the effectiveness of two major, existing approaches to sex education in the United States: ‘abstinence-only’ programs, which focus singularly on convincing students to abjure sexual activity before marriage, and ‘comprehensive’ programs, which generally emphasize the benefits of abstinence while also providing detailed, medically-accurate information about contraception, reproduction, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). I argue that neither of these approaches, as currently practiced, adequately protects children’s vital interest in sexual self-determination. Autonomy-promoting sex education, on the other hand, can succeed where these other approaches fail, insofar as it attends to students’ cognitive <italic>and</italic> psychosocial development.</p>

<title>The case for autonomy-promoting sex education<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1477878512437456">3</xref></sup></title>
<p>In spite of the gargantuan sums the US government spends each year on abstinence-only sex education programs,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1477878512437456">4</xref></sup> independent research – including a recently released, multiyear study commissioned by Congress – suggests that such programs are ineffective at delaying the age of first coitus, reducing the number of sexual partners, and encouraging sexually active teens to return to abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477878512437456">Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477878512437456">Trenholm et al., 2007</xref>). In light of these findings, state support for abstinence-only education is difficult to justify, particularly if other approaches prove to be more effective at reducing the personal and social costs associated with adolescent sexual activity. Moreover, even if abstinence-only programs did prove to be effective (even <italic>very</italic> effective) at promoting abstinence, they still would be difficult to justify in light of the autonomy-related concerns raised in this article. Suppose we can agree that it is generally best if teens abstain from sex until they’re older, and perhaps until they’re married. And suppose further that, by providing abstinence-only education, we persuade a greater number of teens to remain abstinent. While this may be a desirable outcome, it is not a sufficient criterion of educational success. From a longer-term perspective of their best interests, convincing adolescents to postpone sex – however desirable – is at best a mixed blessing if our methods for accomplishing this involve withholding information (or providing misinformation) about reproduction, contraception, and the spread of STIs, and teaching them simply to defer to authorities on matters of fundamental importance to their own well-being. A sex education curriculum that properly respects adolescents’ present and <italic>future</italic> welfare, as well as their prospective interest in autonomy, will help them understand the reasons why they should abstain from sex, and give them the tools they need to make healthy, independent decisions about their own sexuality – objectives that are more commonly associated with comprehensive approaches to sex education.</p>
<p>Yet while I have pointed to some empirical data that indicates that abstinence-only education is ineffective, I have not offered any evidence that suggests comprehensive sex education is any more effective in shaping adolescent sexual behavior in positive ways – by discouraging risk-taking and increasing the use of contraceptives, for instance. Without such evidence, we might conclude that, whatever form it takes, sex education in schools does not make an appreciable difference in the lives of individual students, and does not confer benefits on society. Should not schools, then, avoid sex education altogether, especially given the explosive controversy that surrounds the subject, and the impassioned sentiments it invokes among parents and citizens? Are not limited public revenues better spent on programs and services that have a discernable positive impact on the lives of individuals – such as nutrition assistance for low-income families, Pell Grants for college students, and health care and rehabilitation programs for wounded veterans?</p>
<p>Indeed some scholars, while acknowledging that comprehensive sex education is not the ‘corrupting social practice’ many of its conservative detractors make it out to be, nevertheless raise doubts about its efficacy in promoting safe and responsible sexual behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477878512437456">Moran (2000</xref>) critiques what he describes as the ‘instrumentalist model’ of sex education, and the stock that both supporters and detractors of comprehensive sex education put on the impact of this model. Citing a handful of studies conducted over the last half century, he notes that students who complete comprehensive sex education courses ‘know more sexual facts’ than their peers who don’t take these courses (p. 219). And students who take these courses ‘evince the intention, at least, to alter elements of their [sexual] behavior’ (p. 219). Yet these studies do not suggest that these students actually do alter their behavior in any significant way. On the one hand, according to Moran, exposure to comprehensive sex education does not appear to increase sexual activity among adolescents. On the other hand, it does not appear to decrease such activity, or make it more likely that adolescents will practice safe sex by using contraception.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477878512437456">Whitehead (1994</xref>: 67) critiques what she describes as the ‘technocratic approach’ to sex education, which focuses on imparting knowledge and technical skills such as information about condoms and instruction in their use. Supporters of this approach assume that ‘once teenagers acquire a formal body of sex knowledge and skills, along with the proper contraceptive technology, they will be able to govern their own sexual behavior responsibly’ (p. 67). Yet, according to Whitehead, research on adolescent sexuality has not established a clear connection between sexual knowledge and sexual behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1477878512437456">5</xref></sup> Citing a decade of work by renowned sex education researcher Douglas Kirby, Whitehead reaches the same conclusion Moran does: while courses that employ the technocratic approach may help students become more informed about contraception, pregnancy, and STIs, they do not help convince these students to postpone sexual activity, or to engage in safe sex. Ultimately, she argues, the faith that advocates of the technocratic approach place in ‘the power of knowledge to change behavior’ is divorced from the stark realities of adolescent sexuality (p. 67).</p>
<p>Looming large among those realities is the distressing frequency of sexual coercion in the lives of adolescents. Recent data on young people’s own interpretations of their initial sexual experiences suggests that many are being initiated into sex before they’re ready and willing to give authentic consent, and that adolescent girls are especially susceptible to manipulation and exploitation. In a 2006–2008 national survey of 18–24-year-olds whose first experience of coitus occurred before the age of 20, 7% of females in the sample reported that this initial experience was non-voluntary, 10% described it as ‘unwanted,’ and 47% described having ‘mixed feelings about it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512437456">Abma et al., 2010</xref>). And in a separate, 2003 national survey of sexually active, 15–17-year-olds, 36% of females in the sample reported that they had ‘been in a relationship where things were moving too fast sexually’, 31% said that they had ‘done something sexual they really didn’t want to do’, and 33% said that they had ‘had oral sex to avoid having intercourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477878512437456">Kaiser Family Foundation, 2003</xref>). These statistics suggest that alarming numbers of young people are victims of sexual coercion of one kind or another. And, when we focus attention on this stark reality, the limitations of the technocratic approach to sex education come to light. If it is to help adolescents resist pressure and take control of their own sexuality, sex education must do more than equip them with a spectrum of knowledge. As Kirby says, ‘Ignorance is not the solution, but knowledge is not enough’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477878512437456">Whitehead, 1994</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>The technocratic approach to sex education with which Moran, Whitehead, and others find fault operates under the assumption that adolescents merely need access to a breadth of information about the mechanics of sex and reproduction, contraception, and the spread of disease in order to make healthy, independent sexual decisions. It focuses exclusively on students’ cognitive development in the area of sexuality, without attending to their emotional and character development. In this respect, technocratic sex education bears a resemblance to Brighouse’s character-neutral, autonomy-facilitating education. Both of these forms of education share the same basic weakness: they fail to address the psychosocial prerequisites of autonomous agency. Adolescents need more than access to a body of knowledge to achieve sexual self-determination. They also need to develop a strong and secure sense of their equal moral worth as individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477878512437456">D’Onofrio, 2003</xref>: 16). Moreover, they need to develop the self-esteem, self-confidence, and willingness to assert their rights and basic interests in their relationships with others, and to resist unsolicited and unwanted sexual advances. Developing and reinforcing these psychosocial capacities is particularly important in a world where the popular media screams ‘Sex!’ from every corner; where peers reinforce the message that ‘Everyone’s doing it!’; where bullying is omnipresent; where new technologies facilitate exploitation;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1477878512437456">6</xref></sup> and where ‘giving in to sex’ is often perceived as a necessary precondition for love and social acceptance.</p>
<p>The preceding discussion suggests that a sex education curriculum that adequately protects children’s and teens’ basic interest in becoming sexually autonomous individuals must attend to their cognitive <italic>and</italic> psychosocial development. Sex educators must present a range of up-to-date, accurate information about the mechanics of sex and reproduction, the effectiveness of various forms of contraception (and instruction in their use), and the medical risks associated with different sexual activities. They also must provide students with information about their susceptibility to being bullied and cajoled into sexual activity before they are ready for it. And, beyond that, they must help and encourage students to develop the emotional strength, as well as the critical thinking and social skills necessary to resist coercion. Executing these lessons in a way that is meaningful for children and teens – and that maximizes retention – will involve addressing difficult and awkward topics in a frank and plainspoken way, and creating a safe social environment for active student participation. It also will involve the use of a variety of interactive instructional methods and technologies, such as short lectures, class discussions, video presentations, live skits, role playing, simulations of risk, and condom demonstrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1477878512437456">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>While these methods – when implemented together – have proven effective in increasing students’ sexual knowledge, they also go beyond the merely informative to address the affective and conative dimensions of independent sexual decision-making. And herein lies their educational power. Because children and teens have a basic interest in becoming autonomous, self-respecting adults, and because sexuality is an area in which they are particularly susceptible to manipulation, exploitation and abuse, sex education must do more than transmit information. It must be ‘comprehensive’ not only in the cognitive sense, but also in the sense that it encompasses the emotional and volitional capacities required for sexual self-determination. To put the matter in more concrete terms, an autonomy-promoting sex education will help adolescents understand why it is a good idea to avoid precocious sexual activity, and why they should insist that their partner use a condom when they do have sex. But it also will help them develop the psychosocial wherewithal to make these kinds of decisions – and insist that others respect these decisions – in the face of enormous pressure to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Meeting these educational objectives will require significant investments of time and resources, and parental involvement in the design and conduct of the curriculum. At present, sex education occupies a very small niche in the curricula of most junior high and high schools in the United States – a fact which helps to explain its minimal effectiveness in promoting safe and responsible sexual behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1477878512437456">8</xref></sup> Making more room in the required curriculum for the kind of sex education I have outlined above will be a tough sell in the current test-obsessed educational policy climate. Yet it will be necessary if we are to do justice to the basic welfare and developmental interests of individual children.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>After mounting his spirited defense of autonomy-facilitating education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512437456">Brighouse (2000</xref>: 82) offers the following concession: ‘I should emphasize that I have not shown that autonomy-facilitation is <italic>all</italic> that is owed to children, and am open to the possibility that autonomy should be actively promoted’ (<italic>original emphasis</italic>). My argument has been that autonomy should indeed be promoted in state-regulated schools, in spite of the various concerns that Brighouse registers regarding character formation, liberal legitimacy, and justification in the face of dissent. As the case of sex education exemplifies, a character-neutral education cannot equip children to overcome ever-present pressures and influences that jeopardize their personal well-being and prospective autonomy. If schools really are to enable children to surmount these pressures and influences, they must do more than furnish them with information and critical thinking skills. They must help them develop the cognitive <italic>and</italic> psychosocial capacities that are intrinsic to autonomous agency.</p>
