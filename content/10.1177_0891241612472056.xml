<abstract>
<p>Despite the popularity of cosmetic surgery and a decrease in medical risks associated with breast implant surgeries, there remains both social and cultural stigma attached to those who undergo the procedure. Although a variety of perspectives have been examined in research on cosmetic surgeries, sociological attention toward stigma and cosmetic surgery is underdeveloped. Through in-depth interviews of twenty women with breast implants, I explore stigma as it manifests in women’s accounts of breast implant surgery experiences, both pre and post surgery. Aligning with Goffman’s concept of stigma, for the study participants, breast implant surgery represents a motivation for reducing visibility of a physical stigma, and a consequence of making a stigmatized choice leading to character blemishes and tribal stigma. As they confront new stigmas post cosmetic surgery, women with breast implants engage in various stigma management strategies.</p>

<p>Those who study deviance have often been fascinated by individuals who break social norms to various extents. One such group of “outsiders” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241612472056">Becker (1963)</xref> identified them, are women who undergo cosmetic breast implant surgery. Cosmetic surgery is one of many methods (e.g., beauty products and diet/fitness practices) by which women’s bodies are disciplined and molded in accordance with the cultural ideal. Cosmetic surgery recipients are “outsiders” in a culture of femininity that tends to espouse certain beauty practices and shun others. Recipients are often perceived as having gone “too far” and risk being judged for stretching the socially acceptable limits of “good” femininity.</p>
<p>Women who undergo cosmetic breast implants surgery, in particular, face a higher risk of being stigmatized both because breasts are a defining characteristic of femininity and sexuality in Western society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241612472056">Byrne 1996</xref>) and because the invasive nature of breast implant surgery sets it apart even among other surgical beauty practices (e.g., hair transplants, or rhinoplasty). Consequently, labels of “bad” are attached to women’s moral character where bad girls are associated with “loose” sexuality and “good” girls embody socially approved images of femininity (such as those who do not undergo cosmetic surgery). In this study, I examine how having cosmetic surgery is stigmatizing in its own right. Women’s narrative accounts theorized with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman’s (1963)</xref> types of stigma reveal that while the practice of cosmetic (in contrast to reconstructive) surgery may reduce self-perceived physical stigma, it may also result in defamation of character and tribal stigmas. In the end, those who choose to undergo cosmetic breast implant surgery negotiate and navigate cultural constraints that are reinforced through stigmatization at both ends of the surgery.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman (1963)</xref> described stigma as a social attribute that becomes the basis of social rejection; those who are “rejected” are thus compelled to engage in tactics to manage and navigate social interactions so as to minimize exposure to stigma. These tactics include making efforts to reduce visibility of a stigma, and to strategically avoid, manage, and/or confront stigmatization. Drawing from this framework, I conceptualize stigma as not only motivation for getting breast implants (as an attempt to reduce visibility of perceived stigmas associated with presurgery bodies) but also as a consequence of the surgery itself, as stigma again manifests in social interactions after cosmetic breast implant surgery.</p>
<p>Feminist scholars have played a significant role in the sociology of body modification practices and have provided multiple perspectives with regard to the role of cosmetic surgery in women’s inequalities. As they are crucial to the sociological understanding of women’s participation in cosmetic surgery, I discuss these perspectives in depth in another section of this paper. Besides feminist frameworks, prior research on stigma as a central theme in understanding cosmetic surgery has focused on general attitudes toward stigmas associated with cosmetic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241612472056">Delinsky 2005</xref>), on stigmatization as motivation for seeking cosmetic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241612472056">MacGregor 1981</xref>), or on psychological processes that address aesthetic surgery patients’ vulnerability to stigmas, both prior to and post surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612472056">Bradbury 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241612472056">Reich 1969</xref>). None of these studies, however, have (1) relied on women’s narratives or (2) have adopted the framework of stigma to inform deeper understandings of such narratives.</p>
<p>Based on in-depth interviews with women who underwent breast implant surgery, I argue that stigma is a central theme in women’s accounts of breast implant surgeries, and in particular, it appears in three forms. The three faces of stigma endemic to the process of breast augmentation are the stigma of <italic>perceived abnormality</italic> that occurs presurgery, the stigma of <italic>being unnatural</italic> and <italic>powerless</italic> postsurgery, and the management of such stigmas using multiple strategies. Examining women’s accounts of cosmetic breast implant surgery guided by Goffman’s types of stigma and stigma management provides evidence that has significant implications for prior feminist perspectives on cosmetic surgery.</p>

<title>Brief History of Breast Augmentation</title>
<p>The history of breast idealization and its corresponding practices date back to the 1800s in Europe when women were encouraged to wear corsets to attain the right fit of a gown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0891241612472056">Yalom 1997</xref>). The emergence of silicone in breast enhancement procedures was first common among Japanese women at the end of World War II. Silicone was injected in the breasts of Japanese prostitutes in order to make them more appealing to American servicemen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0891241612472056">Zuckerman 1999</xref>). The popularity and use of breast implants exploded in the United States in the 1970s with the development of the silicone <italic>implant</italic>, which was touted as having more “lifelike” fluidity. Packaging the implants with clear jelly eliminated migration of the implant, or the liquid that could cause harm when ruptured inside a woman’s body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241612472056">Angell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0891241612472056">Zuckerman 1999</xref>). By 1977, a million women were getting themselves “snipped, sculpted, tucked, and reshaped every year” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241612472056">Byrne 1996</xref>, 66).</p>
<p>Since the first silicone breast implant surgery was performed in the United States in the 1960s, approximately one million women had devices surgically inserted to enlarge or reshape their breasts for cosmetic purposes by 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0891241612472056">Zuckerman, Nagelin-Anderson, and Santoro 2009</xref>). In 1992, 80 percent of the 150,000 women who received breast implants did so for cosmetic breast augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241612472056">Angell 1992</xref>). The American Society of Plastic Surgeons reports that of the 1.8 million total cosmetic operations performed in 2006, 329,000 (approx. 18%) were breast augmentation procedures. It has since become the number one most desired and performed type of cosmetic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241612472056">American Society of Plastic Surgeons 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>An increase in popularity also gave rise to various cultural perceptions and attitudes toward breast implant surgeries. Breast implants are becoming an accepted form of self-expression and a resource for improvement in women’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241612472056">Delinsky 2005</xref>). A national survey indicates that more than half (51%) of Americans approved of cosmetic plastic surgery, a 3% increase from 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241612472056">American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery 2011</xref>). Moreover, examinations of the normalization of cosmetic surgery reveal that along with media coverage, survey findings on attitudes portray cosmetic surgery in a favorable light, and as a way of the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241612472056">Brooks 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241612472056">Conrad and Jacobson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0891241612472056">Seay 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Feminist Perspectives and Cosmetic Surgery</title>
<p>Most scholarly inquiries into cosmetic surgery have stemmed from feminist perspectives that analyze women’s engagement in body modification practices in light of social status and power dynamics. For instance, some argue that women’s bodies are objectified in modern culture, and are thereby subjected to sundry evaluations and regulations associated with various ideal images and standards of femininity that in turn create and reinforce inequalities between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0891241612472056">Weitz 2003</xref>). Although most agree with the stance that women’s bodies are a central part of understanding women’s subordination, feminist discussions on the body have not constituted a unified voice, and resemble more of a contentious dialogue. These contentions tend to boil down to issues of whether women are complicit in their own oppression, or whether they are seen to take action in response to society’s pressure to pigeonhole them into constricting images of what it means to be a woman. These debates become especially contentious around issues that seem to blur the line between resistance and complicity (or agency and structure), such as when women participate in extreme cosmetic body modification practices such as surgery.</p>
<p>Although there is no single type of feminism/feminist theory on cosmetic surgery and definitions of “oppression” in relation to cosmetic surgery vary, feminist scholarship on cosmetic surgery has been broadly patterned toward one of two approaches. Cosmetic surgery has been discussed both as an example of women’s oppression and as women’s empowerment. The first approach emphasizes the coercive aspect of the beauty culture and women’s inability to make autonomous decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241612472056">Bordo 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241612472056">Dull and West 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0891241612472056">Stewart 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0891241612472056">Young 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891241612472056">Zimmerman 1998</xref>). Cosmetic breast implant surgery is one (of many) forms of oppression that is carried out either through dictations of “ideal” bodies or norms that govern what women “should” do with their bodies. Buying into the beauty standards that are created for them, women start to believe that embracing those standards could be a pathway to their success and become “victims” of cultural oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241612472056">Blum 2003</xref>). Similarly, others like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241612472056">Parker (1995)</xref> identify ideological subjugation as men controlling cultural constructions of femininity to suit their own purposes. Media images, for instance, are constant reflections of male preferences and female aspirations; they create a culture that may drive women to cosmetic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891241612472056">Powers 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0891241612472056">Wolf 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>For instance, based on interviews with twenty-five women whose silicone implants ruptured, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891241612472056">Zimmerman (1998)</xref> explores social pressures such as the medicalization of beauty and the role of surgeons in women’s personal decision to undergo breast implant surgery. In sum, norms and expectations governing candidate selection, the informed consent process, and women’s misconceptions about medical terminology, in essence, undermine women’s ability to act with agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241612472056">Byram et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241612472056">Morgan 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>One subset of such perspectives on the beauty culture is the construct of the “male gaze,” a term used to emphasize the role of men in women’s construction of their self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241612472056">Mulvey 1989</xref>). According to the male gaze, men are the watchers, and women tend to maintain and adjust their appearances based on the expectations of men. Thus, in a society where women face social pressures associated with femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891241612472056">Zimmerman 1998</xref>), are subject to ideological subjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241612472056">Parker 1995</xref>), and a “gaze” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241612472056">Mulvey 1989</xref>), how much personal choice or agency do they really have?</p>
<p>The second viewpoint, on the other hand, insists that women are not simply “hapless victims” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891241612472056">Peiss 1998</xref>) and that criticisms have largely relied on macro-level cultural discourse on the meanings attached to body and identity, or have addressed physiological factors associated with varying cosmetic procedures, leaving out women’s experiences by their own account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin 2000</xref>). This framework sheds light on aspects of cosmetic surgery which reveal that women exercise their autonomy in seeking surgery and as a result become empowered to more accurately express their identity, pleasurable physicality, and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241612472056">Davis 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241612472056">Fraser 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0891241612472056">Wolkovitz 2005</xref>). Engaging in cosmetic surgery is something that women <italic>do</italic>, for themselves and not for boyfriends, husbands, or other significant individuals in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241612472056">Davis 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars from this camp do not reject social, cultural, or structural influences entirely; rather, they emphasize a different part of the process. For instance, just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin (2000)</xref> acknowledges that women who engage in cosmetic surgery are participants of a cultural context in which physical appearance is a means for inner self-expression, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241612472056">Gagné and McGaughey (2002)</xref> also argue that cosmetic surgery provides means for solving problems but also reproduces hegemonic ideals. Much like synthesis theories that originated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241612472056">Giddens (1984)</xref> and were later revised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241612472056">Sewell’s (1992)</xref> theory of duality, the decision to receive breast implants is entwined in a nexus of “knowledgeable” social actors and seemingly restrictive social systems. For such theorists, structures “empower <italic>and</italic> constrain”social action, and actions in turn reproduce social structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241612472056">Sewell 1992</xref>, 19).</p>
<p>Such prior findings and perspectives are crucial to our understanding of the social and cultural processes that influence a personal decision to receive breasts that are surgically implanted. In addition, through these prior perspectives we can understand women’s experiences with cosmetic surgery not only in light of oppressive forces but as well as in light of their autonomy and agency. What such studies have overlooked, or stopped short of, however, is identifying stigma as a manifestation of the cultural constraints faced by women, both at the preoperational stage and in the after-the-fact experiences of women. In addition, women draw on these exact constraints (stigmas) to manage the stigmas attached to their participation in cosmetic breast implant surgery.</p>
<p>In prior examinations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891241612472056">Zimmerman 1998</xref>), for instance, participants were in fact responding to stigmas that they faced for not meeting cultural standards of femininity (i.e., “large” breasts) dictated by male significant others, or male cosmetic surgeons. Only by framing women’s experiences with stigma do we become aware of a “constant” (rather than only at the decision-making phase) presence of cultural constraints in women’s lives. Even after they have undergone cosmetic surgery, many women face new standards of femininity that they no longer meet, such standards are less about physical appearance and more about morally “good” and “bad” femininity. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin’s (2000)</xref> analysis of the social costs associated with participating in cosmetic surgery reveals that women struggle with an incongruity between their surgically altered, yet “normal,” body and a new self that grapples with perceptions of “inauthenticity.” Although limited in its scope and depth, Gimlin provides a strong foundation for a full-fledged analysis of stigma particularly as it pertains to women’s post–cosmetic surgery experiences.</p>
<p>As such, this study extends prior feminist perspectives by arguing that the debate on whether cosmetic surgery is a sign of women’s oppression or women’s empowerment can perhaps find some resolution through an approach that highlights the role of stigma in both making the decision to receive breast implants <italic>and</italic> life after undergoing surgery. Stigma represents social control revealed by social rejection. Stigma depends on the aggressive maintenance of cultural standards and the preservation of boundaries around certain behaviors, beliefs, and status characteristics. However, stigma also provides the motivation for women to take control of their situation and attempt to overcome the negative labels forced upon them. The women in this study intended to move beyond and resist the stigmas they faced. Their experiences highlight the physical and mental effort they expended to avoid the “spoiled” social identities. When the respondents realized that they had simply traded one stigma for another by getting breast implants, the nature of stigma changed again; no longer an oppressive force, no longer the springboard into action, stigma became the means by which women shifted the stigma elsewhere.</p>

<title>Stigma, Stigma Management, and Cosmetic Surgery</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman (1963)</xref> defined stigma as a social or physical attribute that is used as the basis for social rejection, and he identified three major types of stigma: <italic>physical deformities, blemishes of individual character</italic> (based on actions regarded as deviant), and the <italic>tribal stigmas</italic> of belonging to a specific race, nation, and religion. The first type of stigma associated with a physical deformity has been found in prior research on cosmetic surgery with regard to motivation for receiving breast implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241612472056">MacGregor 1981</xref>). Just as stigmatized groups seek to reduce the visibility of their “physical” stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612472056">Bradbury 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman 1963</xref>), those who seek cosmetic surgery want to hide their stigma of having what they perceive to be a bodily abnormality (a “mark”). This is the case especially for women with “small, abnormal, or misshapen” breasts who can feel unfeminine and a sense of stigma due to their incompatibility with cultural demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612472056">Bradbury 1994</xref>). Thus, the lens of physical stigma is powerful in revealing the intricacies of how narratives about motivations for breast implant surgery are implicitly tied to narratives about perceived stigmas.</p>
<p>Cosmetic surgery recipients also experience stigma due to blemishes of character. Despite the “apparent normalization” of cosmetic surgery, men and women who seek cosmetic surgery are still looked down upon by the larger culture and may be subject to negative stereotypes or social rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241612472056">Delinsky 2005</xref>). Some experience stigma as a result of cosmetic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0891241612472056">Stewart 1998</xref>). Media analyses reveal that the media cast cosmetic surgery patients as vain, narcissistic, or psychologically maladjusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241612472056">Haiken 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241612472056">Reich 1969</xref>). Patients avoid and hide disclosure of participation in cosmetic surgery from individuals in one’s reference group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241612472056">Bradbury 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, tribal stigma is a theme that is consistently present in women’s accounts of cosmetic surgery. Although Goffman conceptualized tribes as a specific race, religion, or nation, more recent conceptualizations of “tribe” include “tribes of femininity,” where perceptions of gender norms are shared by the members of the tribe consisting of women who subscribe to those norms, the “good” girls/women, and women who are perceived to not conform, “bad” girls/women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241612472056">Nack 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891241612472056">Tewksbury and McGaughey 1997</xref>). For instance, women with chronic STDs face the label of “bad” because of existing stereotypes that associate the acquisition of an STD with promiscuity. Other members of the “bad” group include prostitutes, porn stars, and exotic dancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241612472056">Nack 2002</xref>). It is important to note that there are multiple tribes of femininity that correspond to specific actions, behaviors, and lifestyles and that context is key to determining which tribe one may fall under. For instance, women who have reconstruction after a mastectomy would likely not be in the same tribe as those celebrities who undergo “double D”–sized breast implant surgery purely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., “bad”) or even “everyday” women who undergo cosmetic surgery because they had “nothing” (i.e., “good”).</p>
<p>Women who undergo breast implant surgery, like other stigmatized groups, adopt a series of tactics for managing stigmas they face for opting cosmetic surgery. In fear of being negatively stereotyped (i.e., of being abnormal or unordinary), stigmatized groups not only make efforts to creatively avoid, manage, and confront stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241612472056">Reissman 2000</xref>) but also strive for “autonomy and moral worth” in order to maintain a positive sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241612472056">Anderson and Snow 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612472056">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>). Reactions to stigmatization include stigma consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241612472056">Pinel 1999</xref>), stigma transference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241612472056">Lichtenstein 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241612472056">Nack 2000</xref>), defensive “othering” or distancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241612472056">Pyke and Dang 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241612472056">Schwalbe et al. 2000</xref>), and the use of stigma disidentifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0891241612472056">Taub, MCLorg, and Fanflik 2004</xref>), which stem from exclusion strategies of in-group/out-group models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241612472056">Anderson, Snow, and Cress 1994</xref>). Stigma consciousness occurs when one becomes aware of the potential negative stereotypes that could apply to them, and stereotype-threats occur when one becomes concerned with whether one confirms that stereotype through certain behaviors. Stigma transference occurs when the stigmatized transfer blame onto another individual/group as a response to either experiencing or avoiding stigma firsthand. This process has been found in experiences of individuals with sexually transmitted infections or diseases where part of managing the stigma of being sexually diseased involves deflecting blame on current and former sexual partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241612472056">Lichtenstein 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241612472056">Nack 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals not only show awareness of negative stereotypes but they also endorse them by engaging in defensive othering. Defensive othering or strategies of exclusion occur when stigmatized individuals legitimate negative stereotypes and devalued identities by referring to “others” to whom these stereotypes apply, but not to themselves. For instance, various groups engage in defensive othering when seeking acceptance into the dominant group by redirecting stigmas onto others, supporting the legitimacy of the stigma. This process has been shown to occur among homeless men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241612472056">Snow and Anderson 1987</xref>), homeless children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241612472056">Roschelle and Kaufman 2004</xref>), among women who become critical of other women to show solidarity with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241612472056">Padavic 1991</xref>), among welfare mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241612472056">Davis and Hagen 1996</xref>), and among racial and ethnic groups such as the Irish who distance themselves from those whose behavior feeds the stereotype of the “Irish drunk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241612472056">Field 1994</xref>). Finally, individuals adopt stigma disidentifiers when making strategic efforts to separate their situation from stereotypes. For instance, in a study on women with physical disabilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0891241612472056">Taub, MCLorg, and Fanflik (2004)</xref> find that when faced with potential judgments of laziness, students with disabilities further affirm their disability status to convey that it interferes with their ability to perform well.</p>

<title>Normal</title>
<p>Drawing on Goffman’s original observation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241612472056">Jones (1984)</xref> defines stigma as the link between an “attribute and a stereotype” where the individual possessing the mark (attribute) fails to meet the social expectations (stereotypes) of “normals.” An attribute is not solely sufficient in leading to social rejection because an attribute that is discreditable in one context may evidence usualness in another context. Factors that determine discredibility are expectations (or norms) associated with an individual’s social identity (e.g., gender, race, class). Some propose the term “label” instead of “attribute” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241612472056">Link and Phelan 2001</xref>), as this implies that the stigma is characterized by a pattern of social responses to a group or individual. Thus, the identification of something as a stigma is contingent on its “degree of perceived distance from some imagined or accepted norm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891241612472056">Ellis 1998</xref>, 524) and the identification of differences that socially matter among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241612472056">Link and Phelan 2001</xref>). Stigma management strategies such as passing represent attempts to be perceived as “normal.” Stigma passing has been found, for instance, to occur among Holocaust survivors where one strategy of pursuing the norm was to “pass” as a nonsurvivor or even a non-Jew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891241612472056">Stein 2009</xref>). Similarly, scholarship on body image finds that an evaluation of oneself in comparison to the “normal” is one of the central components of body image attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241612472056">Cash, Thériault and Milkewics 2004</xref>). Particularly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241612472056">Davis (2003)</xref> finds that women seek cosmetic surgery as a means for changing their identities to match more closely to the identities of women who are perceived to be “normal.” Similarly, women in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin’s (2000)</xref> study on cosmetic surgery describe ways in which their small breasts deprived them of living an “ordinary” life.</p>
<p>Racialized body images provide a basis of comparison for those who seek to be “normal.” On one hand, there are patterns that reveal a general desire for matching dominant images of “whiteness” which create hierarchies within social groups especially among women of color. For instance, the various inventions that “relax” the natural texture of women’s hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241612472056">Nelson 1997</xref>), or whiten skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241612472056">Ashikari 2005</xref>), suggest a global trend toward whiteness as the norm. Moreover, racially specific cosmetic surgeries such as eyelid surgery among Asian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241612472056">Kaw 1998</xref>), rhinoplasty among Jewish and Italian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241612472056">Kaw 2003</xref>) also contribute to a standard of beauty that reflects dominant white images. On the other hand, different social groups adhere to different perceptions of the “normal” based on expectations associated with them <italic>by</italic> dominant groups. For instance, rises in the popularity of buttocks lifts among Dominicans who “like the curves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241612472056">Dolnick 2011</xref>) is an example of a trend away from obscuring one’s ethnicity. “Normals” then, vary based not only on one’s social location within a racial hierarchy, but also on whether one embraces or rejects specific racial images.</p>
<p>In addition to racialized body images, youth bodies also serve as comparison points for what is perceived to be “normal.” In a culture where it is the “norm” to sexualize women’s breasts, those who choose to breastfeed redefine breasts to reflect a maternal body rather than one that is often portrayed as an object of sexual desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241612472056">Stearns 1999</xref>). Those who do not choose to breastfeed have concerns about the effect that breastfeeding will have on their (youthful, and perhaps sexualized) bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241612472056">Foster, Slade, and Wilson 1996</xref>). In other words, breastfeeding women navigate cultural and social sexualization of breasts to represent maternal bodies, and then face concerns with whether their postnursing breasts will maintain their sexual appearance. Another image of the “normal” according to which women judge their physical appearance, then, consists of breasts that have not been through pregnancy or nursing, or, at the least, do not appear as such.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>I relied on twenty semistructured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews to capture how respondents understand and give meaning to their experiences and decision-making processes concerning cosmetic breast augmentation surgery. Qualitative interviews, through their usage of in-depth testimonies, have a way of revealing how men and women in society interpret reality, how the subject creates and identifies his or her reality through interactions involving the exchange of symbols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241612472056">Berg 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Using accounts of the respondents was well suited for my purpose for several reasons. Account-making was initially defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0891241612472056">Scott and Lyman (1968)</xref> as statements that convey explanations for deviant behavior from one actor to another. More recently, the meaning of accounts has been expanded to include representations of the ways in which individuals interpret reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891241612472056">Vanderford and Smith 1996</xref>), organize their thoughts on the social world in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241612472056">Orbuch 1997</xref>), and give meaning to their everyday experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891241612472056">Pyke 2000</xref>). Accounts include story-telling, narrations, recollections, verbal explanations, and representation of these by scholars and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241612472056">Ewick and Silbey 1995</xref>). Through stories and narratives, individuals create and represent an identity, a “sense of self” and the relationships between their self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241612472056">Gergen and Gregen 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241612472056">Harvey, Weber, and Orbuch 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891241612472056">Orbuch et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891241612472056">Sternberg 1995</xref>), and display their knowledge of appropriate ways of acting and accepted reasons for doing what they have done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241612472056">Harre, Clarke, and De Carlo 1985</xref>). In the midst of conflicting advice, social stigmas, and tangled emotions, women who engage in cosmetic surgery use accounts to make sense of, and give meaning to, their experience with breast implants and in doing so provide insight on their experiences with stigma. In this study, I use accounts as ethnographic “narratives” rather than “explanations or justifications” for deviant behavior.</p>
<p>I relied on a nonprobability, snowball and referral sampling method to select respondents mainly because individuals sought in this study are not easily accessible in group settings, where women come together based on the commonality of having had breast implant surgery. Various methods of soliciting respondents were used to ensure a more representative sample. Newspaper advertisements, online postings, distribution of fliers, campus newspapers in local universities and colleges, and networks through personal contacts were ways of gaining access to interviewees who provided a base for additional contacts. The sample was largely drawn from suburban areas in Southern California. Despite my efforts to broaden the subject pool, to my surprise, gathering data became difficult when finding women who were willing to talk to a researcher about their personal experiences with breast implant surgery. Although I would hear about potential respondents who had undergone breast implant surgery through my personal networks, most of them were unwilling to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The sample consisted of only women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery (as opposed to those who undergo reconstructive surgery due to medical conditions). Women from a variety of age groups participated in the study. Eleven respondents were between twenty and thirty years of age, four were between thirty and forty years old, three were between forty and fifty-one years old, and two of the women were more than sixty years of age. Twelve women are white, six are Latino, and two are Asian, and all of the respondents are heterosexual. The sample includes three graduate students, five undergraduate students, two retired workers, one model, two teachers, two administrative assistants, a sales representative, a language interpreter, an independent contractor for administrative projects, a real estate investor, and a housewife.</p>
<p>The interviews varied in duration from fifty minutes to two hours. I left the choice of location up to the interviewee in order to ensure an environment conducive to conversation on such a personal and sometimes sensitive topic. I visited homes of some women, I interviewed others in study rooms at university libraries, outdoors on a nearby bench, and some just preferred a quiet neighborhood coffee shop. By a comparison of interview responses in my sample, it seemed that all of the women spoke freely and expressed themselves with equal comfort whether the interview took place in their home or outside. In addition, my “stranger value” benefited the study in collecting information that was sometimes sensitive and private to the respondents because the respondents did not have personal attachments that could lead to a fear of being judged.</p>
<p>An interview guide consisting of probes allowed the respondents freedom to direct the flow of the conversation and entailed not bombarding them with numerous questions. Some examples of probes that were used in the interviews included the following: silent probes—where my silence implied that I would like the respondent to keep talking about the issue; elaboration probes—“Oh really? Tell me more . . . ” where, as an interviewer, I expressed interest in what the respondent was saying; and lastly, “how and why” probes—which prompted respondents to provide more in-depth descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241612472056">Bernard 2000</xref>). Interview questions included standardized items on self-identification that addressed how the respondents evaluated themselves, both physically and ideologically. In addition, I asked about interactions with intimate partners, family members, and friends that revealed the role of the women’s social networks, family members, and intimate partners in their decisions to undergo breast implant surgery. Other standardized questions were related to coping with unforeseen physical complications with the procedure as well as emotional management techniques the women employed after having received breast implants. Moreover, I asked about the ways in which the implants affected different aspects of the respondents’ lives.</p>
<p>An approval by the institutional review board (IRB) ensured the welfare of human subjects. I provided respondents a detailed explanation of the purpose of the study on an informed consent, and a description of their rights as subjects in an academic research study. In an attempt to maintain confidentiality of the respondents’ identity, I use pseudonyms when using quotes. I also provided respondents with a list of counseling services in the area, whom they could contact in the case of serious distress and trauma caused by their participation in the study.</p>
<p>Limitations to this methodological approach mainly stem from the use of snowball sampling methods. Although efforts were made (e.g., newspaper advertisements, posts) to avoid relying too heavily on this form of sampling method, it was the primary way that respondents were recruited in this study. Snowball sampling methods tend to restrict the demographic background of the respondents because it is a technique that relies on social networks and interpersonal ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241612472056">Browne 2005</xref>). Although the findings revealed in this study may be generalizable to populations of women that are similar to the respondents in this study (representing a broad range of age, ethnicity, occupational status, etc.) these patterns cannot be generalizable to all women’s experiences with breast implants. For instance, although efforts were made to include such perspectives, I did not have the opportunity to interview women for whom breast implants were a central part of their occupation (i.e., dancers, or strippers).</p>
<p>Interviews were audio-recorded with the respondents’ consent and were later transcribed into textual form. Patterns of similarities and dissimilarities among responses were the main method of analyzing the data. These patterns, or themes, became the “ground” work for the comparison of responses among the twenty subjects. This was possible through meticulous and systematic methods of data storage using Atlas <italic>Ti</italic>, which enabled quick “finds” and provided coding functions that compiled quotes associated with a particular theme into a report.</p>
<p>An inductive method of analysis of coded responses revealed the following themes: (1) the physical-deformity stigma of having abnormally shaped/sized breasts, (2) the stigma associated with blemish of individual character as a result of undergoing breast implant surgery (and the accompanying realization that one stigma was simply traded for another), and (3) the subsequent management of the traded stigma of being “fake” or “coerced” while drawing from norms associated with tribes of femininity where there are “good” girls/women and “bad” girls/women.</p>

<title>Findings</title>

<title>Stigma of Abnormal Breasts</title>
<p>One of the defining components of stigma is the perceived distance from a norm. This was reflected in the responses of women who wanted to feel “normal.” Referring to their breasts before surgery, they stated that they had “nothing.” They repeatedly drew attention to not having any breasts at all, or had breasts that were “misshapen,” in order to express their “need” for implants. As an example, Sara, forty-two, states, “Like I said, I wish I had pictures to show you. I didn’t have anything and I was pretty darn small.” Similarly, Patty, twenty-three, states, “I really, really couldn’t fit in a size A. There was really nothing and a nipple. It was a flat thing and a nipple, it was just ridiculous.” Erin, thirty-nine, shares Patty’s sentiment on her breast size, “My original size, nothing.”</p>
<p>Eight respondents used the term “nothing” to describe the appearance of their breasts as being abnormal, yet when asked what “normal” was, they gave different meanings. For instance, Sara says, “I think if you have any breasts at all, to me that’s big enough. I guess it’s a matter of personal taste.” Another respondent, Nina, fifty-one, asserts, “So, to me, I just felt abnormally small. I was comparing myself to someone who had something.” Differing slightly from Sara and Nina, Patty said, “I just want to be proportionate. I wanted to be, but at the same time, my hips are so wide still. So you can only go so far [through surgery] to look normal.” Unlike Sara and Nina for whom <italic>any</italic> breasts represented the norm, for Patty, breasts proportional to the body was the norm for which she was striving.</p>
<p>Race and ethnicity provided another context for defining “normal.” Respondents who were not white alluded to cultural expectations of body image. Susan felt that she was different from the rest of the girls growing up. Like other Latinas in the study, Susan, twenty-two, referred to beauty images in the Latino culture. In explaining how she came to think of her breasts as too small, she said:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m Hispanic, and so when you watch Hispanic TV 90% of the women have big boobs and that’s a very prominent thing, it’s all about being curvy, so kind of a cultural thing because Hispanic women are supposed to be curvy and all that stereotypical stuff.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another Latina respondent, Anna thirty-two, further explained that she assessed herself based on the standards she had grown up watching on television. Whereas Susan emphasized a cultural context (e.g., “Hispanic TV”) in discussing significant influences on becoming aware of her small breasts above, Anna referred to media images that were not culture-specific to present her views on a “beautiful woman.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think [the influence] was more images on TV, what I had grown up seeing on TV or what I had as the ideal of a beautiful woman, so when I’d see myself in the mirror I didn’t look like that, my boobs didn’t look like that [laughed] they looked like . . . I always joked about it. I’d say they looked like two socks with a marble in it, ’cause that’s the best way I could describe it. They were just hanging, they really didn’t look good. I was very unhappy about them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Jennifer, twenty-two, a Korean respondent, discussed her “typical” Asian body conveying that she did not meet expected “American” body norms.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In general, people will design clothing based on general like consensus on sizes and so like when I would try on clothes that I liked, it wouldn’t fit me right cause you know like usually Asians tend to have smaller breasts and umm . . . I mean I know there are a lot of American people that have smaller breasts but it’s just usually larger, in comparison, than an Asian so I wasn’t happy about that ’cause I loved wearing [different] clothes and things I liked and if it doesn’t fit right then I don’t wanna wear it, I <italic>can’t</italic> wear it so I talked to my parents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Making an account of their need for breast implants, Susan, Anna, and Jennifer referred to racialized notions of the “normal” body. Whereas Anna and Susan discussed Latina body images in terms of what they aspired to, Jennifer on the other hand drew on a racialized, particularly Asian, body image of herself as something she sought to change. The Latina women held themselves to racialized standards of “normal” rather than striving to resemble “white” women’s bodies, yet Jennifer referred to her dissatisfaction with the “typical” Asian body and strived to deviate from it, a pattern that corresponds to the popularity of eyelid surgery among Asian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241612472056">Kaw 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Motherhood also played a part both as a motivating factor and as a standard for “normal.” Seven respondents expressed that their body changed as a result of breast-feeding and this natural process seemed to give the women an opportunity of having “large” breasts for a period of time. However after the experience of having “normal” breasts while pregnant or nursing, the women described their breasts as even “worse.” Heather (thirty-eight) discusses the impact that breast feeding had on her breasts as well as on her career as a model. She said:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was modeling and then I had my daughters, (they’re four years apart), and after I had her I had a lot of milk in my breasts, they were huge, too much and afterwards they were kind of empty I guess, they were concave and my nipples would fall in and so they were really horrible and consequently because I was so thin after my pregnancy they got even smaller and I couldn’t get work modeling again. . . . After my son [my breasts] were even worse.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another respondent, Erin (thirty-nine) also discusses her experience with breast-feeding as an influence on her decision.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have two kids and I thought after I had kids that my breasts would stay big, I was huge when I was nursing but after I nursed, I lost everything. I was flat as a boy and I didn’t wanna look like [that] and plus I had a bone in the middle of my chest so I was going through this phase like “everyone all of a sudden has boobs.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“Normal” breasts were breasts that had not been through a full-term pregnancy and/or nursing an infant. Respondents like Heather and Erin attributed their abnormal breast size to breast-feeding. Although changes in breast size and shape due to childbirth and breast feeding itself is not uncommon or abnormal, the women drew on these experiences to construct a juxtaposition of postpregnancy/postnursing “saggy, flat, and concave” breasts with what they considered to be “normal.” Both Erin and Heather’s responses imply that they felt abnormal in shape and size prior to pregnancy and nursing, and that their perception of their breasts seemed to worsen after.</p>
<p>The women justified their decision to undergo surgery by describing their breasts as “abnormal” in size and/or shape. In narratives about cosmetic surgery, women show to themselves and to others that the new appearance is both deserved and a better indicator of the self than the old appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin 2000</xref>). The decision to undergo breast implant surgery is contextualized between self-evaluations of having “nothing” and comparisons of the respondents’ own bodies with “normal” bodies. The women’s perception of normal and their perceived distance from the accepted norm revealed their fear of being stigmatized for the “physical deformity” of having “nothing.” Normal consisted of women with “some” breasts, racialized bodies, or even pregnant/nursing bodies and represented broader social standards of beauty that the women strived to meet.</p>
<p>Women’s sense of stigma became pronounced in their discussions of real or potential intimate relations with men. The respondents wanted to be “normal” for the men with whom they were romantically involved and made efforts to reduce the visibility of the stigma of “small” breasts. For instance, Cathy, twenty-four, states, “At least every guy I dated before my surgery, we’d date like two and a half weeks and I’d freak out about having to tell him [that I had small breasts].” Moreover, Annemarie, twenty-five, describes her experience with becoming intimate and her use of Wonderbras© to stall exposing her “little” breasts. She says:
<disp-quote>
<p>I always knew that my boobies were little . . . there were several times when [on] dates I would feel like I didn’t want them to look at them. I didn’t want them to touch them, and I remember I used to wear those wonder bras. There was one instance when I was with a guy and I was wearing a wonder bra . . . he was about to take my wonder bra off and I was like NO! because without the wonder bra, you’re not there anymore, so I was so freaked out that I decided that I gotta go, I said “oh it’s late” and I ran out because you know, you feel very conscious of it . . . when the time came to become intimate with the person, you have to come out and say, “by the way . . . .” I don’t want that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these accounts of interactions with intimate partners, cultural ideals played out when the women’s anxiety made them reluctant to pursue intimate relations after a certain point of physical contact before undergoing the surgery. In describing their original breasts as “nothing” or “abnormal,” the women based their evaluations on comparisons to the norm. In these interactions, the “male gaze” became more visible and real when the women decided that they were not “normal.” Standards of feminine bodies (i.e., cultural constraints) informed both the women’s self-evaluations and how they expected intimate partners to evaluate them. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman (1963)</xref>, a central theme in the life of the stigmatized is acceptance; however, rather than seek acceptance, the women in this study sought cosmetic surgery in order to eliminate stigmatization associated with “small, abnormal” breasts. In the following section, we see that the women did not in fact escape stigmatization by undergoing surgery, but rather traded one set of stigmas (of having small or abnormal breasts) for the new stigma of having “fake” breasts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0891241612472056">
<title>Trading Stigmas</title>
<p>In describing their experiences after the surgery, respondents referred to judgments and negative stereotypes associated with having breast implants. Particularly, they raised the issue of having artificial (“not real”) breasts. Ema, sixty-two, and Jackie, sixty-four, two older respondents, emphasize this theme.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would say I’m no happier with it… when I was younger, I was oblivious to the fact that, that you could tell, when I wore a bathing suit or something. I mean anybody could tell, that it’s not real.—<italic>Ema</italic></p>
<p>Only with my girlfriends. . . . I wouldn’t tell guys about it. I’d say “don’t look at the scars, of course they’re natural,” but girlfriends, you know, wanna know.—<italic>Jackie</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ema’s perception that her breasts were easily identifiable as implants made her dissatisfied with her decision to undergo the surgery. Alluding to being young and unaware of how artificial her breasts appear, she seemed regretful of having breasts that do not seem natural. Jackie discussed her efforts to convey that her breasts are natural especially with men but seemed more comfortable revealing her breast implants to other women. As a much younger respondent, Patty describes concerns for her future intimate relationships and how her breast implants could become an obstacle in her dating whom she wants.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So I had to think like I’m going to get this done and I pray to God, that the guys I like will like me even though I have it, [I feared] they would think “you’re so fake, you’re so vain, I don’t want a girl like that.”—<italic>Patty, twenty-three</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these cases, women feared being stigmatized for being “fake” or “unnatural.” While Ema expressed her concern with being stigmatized for not “being real” in general, for other women like Patty and Jackie, these fears surfaced in their accounts of not being accepted by an intimate partner <italic>post</italic> surgery. An important distinction to make is the use of the terms “natural” versus “normal.” Although being abnormal was perceived to be a negative trait prior to surgery, being unnatural was a trait the women feared after undergoing the surgery. Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241612472056">Gimlin (2000)</xref> found that women faced a discrepancy between a surgically achieved “normal” body and an “authentic” self, in their strive to pass for normal, the respondents in this study played a balancing act between overcoming the abnormal, while at the same time not going too far toward the unnatural.</p>
<p>Some respondents anticipated and feared judgments that reflect popular stereotypes of women with breast implants. Tammy, a twenty-three-year-old graduate student expresses such concerns:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know. It’s not like openness about plastic surgery. Like there’s a pressure to get it done, but after you get it done, it’s like how are people going to look at you, <italic>like you’re a bimbo</italic>. So that was something I was worried about.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tammy acknowledged the pressure of participating in cosmetic surgery. Moreover, although Tammy states that she did not actually experience being treated differently, the fear of being coined a “bimbo” was a preoccupation for her. Another respondent, Annemarie, refers to hearing comments that questioned the psychological well-being of those who get breast implants.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When you confess they’re fake, people think about you as unstable, that you don’t have any confidence in yourself and that’s why you have to get them. I got comments like, “Oh girls who get breast implants have a low self-esteem.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later in the interview, Annemarie also describes her way of coping with such comments:<disp-quote>
<p>I was very conscious of it and I would walk around slouched . . . because I felt like everybody was looking at my breasts and I thought, “is this what I really wanted?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These accounts reveal the process by which the women traded one set of stigmas associated with a physical deformity of having breasts that were not “normal” for a new set of stigmas associated with blemishes of individual character. In addition to concerns with being perceived as “not real,” and “fake,” respondents also felt distressed for being associated with negative stereotypes of a “bimbo,” or being insecure or psychologically unwell. While some of the women actually experienced stigmatization through verbal disapprovals as Annemarie did, others like Tammy anxiously anticipated the new stigmas against women with breast implants. In addition, Annemarie’s efforts to hide her breasts revealed her preoccupation with being <italic>re</italic>-stigmatized. In an attempt to rectify the stigma of abnormal or disproportionate breasts, women sought surgery. However, after undergoing cosmetic surgery, the women faced new stigmas of being perceived as fake, vain, a bimbo and having low self-esteem.</p>

<title>Managing Stigmas</title>
<p>Another consistent finding in accounts of women with breast implants is the types of stigma management strategies that the women adopted. Several respondents distinguished their experiences with breast implant surgery from stereotypical images of women who undergo breast implant surgery. In these responses, we see patterns of Goffman’s third type, tribal stigma. By distancing themselves from such women, the respondents manage stigma. First, in describing her mother’s interest in the surgery Patty conveys her opinion on the matter. She states,
<disp-quote>
<p>[My mom] was also having problems shopping and going to the gym and finding a good sports bra. . . . But she actually decided, which people were freaking out about, that she was going to get it, so she was like [we’ll] get it done together, so people were like it was going to be this Beverly Hills moms and daughters, where like you go in and troll for men together afterwards, I’m like <italic>eww</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patty discusses her mom’s desire to also receive implants and also expressed her disgust for “Beverly Hills mom and daughters that undergo cosmetic surgery and then go out looking for attention from men.” This implies a conscious effort to first show disapproval of mothers and daughters engaging in such behavior and, secondly, an effort to convey in her account that she is not one of “those people.” She further separates her experience from magazine girls in the following way.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Most people [weren’t] even concerned about the safety issue, but it just seemed like people were really scared that I wanted to be like a magazine girl, which I’m like <italic>ugh</italic>! —<italic>Patty, twenty-three</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her account, Patty denies wanting to be a magazine girl, as others in her social circle often assumed. She conveys that she is not one of “those” women who got breast implants as a result of following media images. In addition, aside from distinguishing herself from “them,” Patty is critical of popular explanations in the media for women’s participation in cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>Another respondent, Susan, emphasizes the difference between her experience and women who receive “double D” size breasts:
<disp-quote>
<p>People have that stereotype about breast implants. I think it fits for people who get double Ds and want to flaunt them. People with breast implants are porn stars or air heads, you know, insecure about their bodies and stuff like that, or [want] more attention. But when you do it because you are asymmetrical, or you absolutely have no breasts, that’s a different story. And you can only understand it, [if] you have that experience.—<italic>Susan, twenty-two</italic></p>
<p>Similarly, Tammy makes a distinction between her experience and someone who might be stigmatized for their breast implants. No one has treated me any differently, I think it’s because I didn’t go really large, like it’s not so large and it’s also a size that’s really proportioned to me and so people think that that’s the size that I’ve always had.—<italic>Tammy, twenty-three</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tammy justifies not being treated differently because of her decision to not go “really large,” implying that only when breasts are disproportionately large, would she be treated differently, or be stigmatized as a “bimbo.” Tammy adopted the response of creatively avoiding being labeled in a negative fashion by conjuring up images of women with “really large” breasts, an image which she did not fit.</p>
<p>Respondents in this study commonly managed the stigma associated with blemishes of individual character by refusing to be identified with negative stereotypes. The women distinguished their experience from those “magazine girls,” or “porn stars with double D’s.” This process reveals how the women experienced tribal stigmas as represented by the “good vs. bad” tribes of femininity or womanhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241612472056">Nack 2002</xref>). Drawing from existing gender norms that attach specific behaviors with “bad” girls/women, the respondents made an effort to show not only their awareness of but also their subscription to these norms. They transferred the stigma that they faced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241612472056">Nack 2000</xref>) by claiming that they were not like the stereotypical recipients of breast implants, whom they saw as not having a serious need. They responded to a status shift from being “good girls/women” without breast implants to potentially being linked to “bad girls/women” who are vain porn stars by constructing a boundary between “them” and their own experiences.</p>
<p>As such, first, the women conveyed stigma consciousness where they expressed their awareness, of potential negative stereotypes that may be associated with their participation in breast implant surgery. Second, they not only transferred stigma by showing contempt towards those women who fit negative stereotypes (e.g., “a magazine girl . . . ugh!”) but they also revealed their endorsement of such stereotypes. Finally, the women engaged in defensive othering where they conveyed in their accounts that women with “double Ds who flaunt them” were “a different story” than their own. Through such stigma management strategies, the women, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241612472056">Goffman (1963)</xref> described it, once again strived to “pass” for normal, where normal was someone who had undergone breast implant surgery for reasons that were more rational than a stereotype. Adopting stigma management strategies like stigma consciousness, stigma transference, and defensive othering, the <italic>stigmatized</italic> became the <italic>stigmatizers</italic>.</p>
<p>Discussions of whether the women perceived their decision to be heavily influenced by external factors also revealed some ways in which women resisted re-stigmatization. However, this time re-stigmatization was less about being associated with negative stereotypes of “airheads and bimbos” and more about the fear of being perceived as powerless and coerced. Most of the respondents emphasized that their decision was all (or at least primarily) their own. The response of Allison, a college student, was typical. She said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, considering that my friends don’t really support it and my family wouldn’t have chosen it for me to do, I don’t know because part of it was the way that I thought others were going to see me. So I don’t know if that’s considered them or me. I guess it’s considered me right? I’d say 100% was me. Maybe 5% [my boyfriend was] putting that into my mind, but the whole decision was mine.—<italic>Allison, twenty-two</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Self-reflection was common in responses to whether their decision was heavily (or lightly) influenced by social or cultural factors. Responses that seemingly emphasized the women’s independence in making the decision to undergo surgery, in fact, consisted of subtle references to factors that contradicted their claims to independence. As Sara explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>I would say it was all my decision. My boyfriend wasn’t pressuring me and told me many times, I’m fine either way so . . . but I knew that he’d be happy with them too but it was all my decision.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sara makes a subtle reference to her boyfriend in the decision-making process and emphasizes that he was not pressuring her. Yet she also indicates that he would be “happy” with her breast implants. Resisting the stigma of “hapless victim,” Sara stressed that the decision was “all” hers. However, she suggests that she was aware of her boyfriend’s dissatisfaction with her natural breast size and this affected her decision. In the same way, Nina’s claim that her decision is “all her” is followed with anecdotal evidence of her ex-gynecologist’s influence:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would guess, it was all me. It was just me thinking I wasn’t whole enough. I wanted to look average. . . . My gynecologist [was] doing a breast exam, I remember saying to him, “I’m thinking about breast implants” and he said, “well maybe for you, it would be a good idea” I was surprised. Especially later, I thought, “why would he say that?” But no it was all me, just thinking I want to look like a woman, with some cleavage.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nina’s presentation of her decision being “all her” conveys her effort to resist the stigma of being influenced and coerced by other people, including her gynecologist. However, the anecdote of the gynecologist’s encouragement in Nina’s decision to undergo breast implant surgery not only provides evidence of general social influence attached to her decision but also implies Nina’s experience with medicalization of beauty as well as the prevalence of the “male gaze.” As a male practitioner, the gynecologist practiced his privilege as the “watcher” who felt entitled to evaluate Nina’s breast size and subsequently her decision to undergo breast implant surgery. Moreover, as a representative of the institution of medicine, the gynecologist exercised his socially legitimized power to select another candidate for cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>Another respondent, Amy, describes her perspective on what influenced her decision as such:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think definitely a lot of it came from the outside just from me seeing other women, the media, just everything got that into my head . . . you know everybody has outside influences. And I think my husband kind of had [an influence] . . . but it was really me that went forward and decided that I really wanted them done.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the women traded the stigma of physical deformity for stigmas of character, women also confronted stigmas associated with being perceived as coerced and forced into breast implant surgery. In fear of being perceived as a “cultural dupe,” or “oppressed woman” a new blemish of the character, the women sought to present themselves as independent and autonomous in accounts about being “above the influence.” However, they simultaneously attributed their decision (to undergo surgery) to wanting to please others, or needing to fit into the norm to highlight the societal expectations placed on them. For instance, Amy admits the influence of “other women, and the media” on her decision to undergo surgery. Based on a culture where media images reflect male preferences, Amy acknowledges the influence of such images on her decision. However, she quickly clarifies that although these influences lead her to the decision, she acted on her agency and moved the process forward.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Accounts of women with breast implants reveal that women who undergo breast implant surgery are not only aware of the stereotypes and stigmas of cosmetic surgery (stigma consciousness) but actively engage in resisting these stereotypes through multiple stigma management strategies. Moreover, these accounts provide compelling examples of the ways in which constructions of feminine beauty remain oppressive and shape both the motivations for and consequences of breast enlargement surgeries. As a large body of research on cosmetic surgery has stemmed from feminist perspectives, emphasis has largely been placed on women’s agency and cultural influences in examining motivations for cosmetic surgery. Stigma is a sociological mechanism that simultaneously transcends and clarifies these disparate feminist positions. First, as women narrate their initial experiences with “abnormal” breasts (whether they were “misshapen, small, or disfigured” due to post-pregnancy physical changes) they presented a need and rationalized their decision to undergo breast implant surgery. The women faced cultural constraints in the form of standards of feminine bodies, and in response, exercised their autonomy in electing breast implant surgery. However, by deciding to undergo breast implant surgery, they in turn reinforced the same cultural constraints or hegemonic norms of beauty and femininity. Here, stigma played the role of a contextual trigger that motivated the women into agentic action that would address their perceived physical stigmatization.</p>
<p>Second, the women faced a form of cultural constraint that reminded them of how women’s actions and bodies tend to be consistently judged when they traded their physical stigma (small breasts) for stigmas of character (“fake”). Now they were facing judgments of being perceived as “bad” girls, a group that also included “porn stars and air heads.” They drew on norms associated with tribes of femininity according to which women are either “good” (us) or “bad” (them). Finally, stigma also provided a basis for boundary maintenance. As the women adopted stigma transference and defensive othering strategies for managing stigma, they resisted stigmatization by distancing their experiences from negative stereotypes of women with breast implants. In turn, by transferring stigma off of themselves onto women with “humungous” breasts (“bad” girls/women), those who are “actually bad” the women added legitimacy to the very stigmas formerly used against them.</p>
<p>Findings from the present analysis have implications for existing feminist contentions surrounding the topic of cosmetic surgery. Whereas feminist perspectives have in the past, been likely to frame cosmetic surgery in light of women’s oppression or women’s empowerment and autonomy, this study’s focus on stigma reveals a perhaps underlying mechanism within existing frameworks. The distinct contribution of this study is the identification of stigma as the mechanism by which the broader cultural context surrounding women’s “good” bodies translates into individual participation in, as well as individually lived-experiences after, one of the most extreme types of beauty practices. Women respond to cultural constraints (stemming from expectations to meet standards of “normal” feminine bodies) by taking action, and yet face newer constraints (stemming from expectations associated with being “good”). Such a perspective aligns more with a feminist perspective which argues that whether they are making autonomous decisions, taking action or are complicit in their own cultural oppression, all women navigate stigma. Thus it is the presence and manipulation of stigma that both constrains and empowers women who undergo cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, examining the multiple faces of stigma within a culture of beauty that defines women by their physical appearance provides new insight on how women who undergo cosmetic breast implant surgery participate in a deviant act even though they seek to meet existing cultural standards of “normal” feminine bodies. Invoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241612472056">Becker’s (1963)</xref> term for social deviants, women who participate in cosmetic surgery start out as “outsiders” in their own eyes, long to become “insiders” by opting surgical body modification, and in turn become “outsiders” to the tribe of “good” femininity.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to understand experiences of women who undergo breast implant surgery for economic or professional reasons (such as is often the case among women who are models, exotic dancers, and/or those who work in pornography). Stigma may either play a much reduced role in the accounts of women who find themselves embedded in a community where the decision to undergo breast augmentation surgery is purely economic or such accounts may reveal a different face of stigma that has not been revealed in present accounts. Similarly, another limitation of the sample in this study is the lack of a wide range of socioeconomic statuses. Not all women who wish to undergo breast implant surgery have the financial means to do so. The inclusion of such experiences might intensify stigma’s role as a motivation where women who cannot afford the augmentation may perhaps make a stronger effort to express their “need” or “desire” for cosmetic surgery and perhaps face different forms of stigma for displaying support for a type of body modification that is often associated with the “leisure class.”</p>
<p>In addition, research on how women “resist” the cultural pressures (i.e., stigmatization) detailed in this study is needed. For instance, studies that compare the experiences of women who feel stigma surrounding their bodies but do <italic>not</italic> undergo body modification surgery with those of women in this study could provide further insight on the relationship between stigma and body modification practices like breast implant surgery. The juxtaposition of women who experience similar social pressures to achieve physical normality but choose different outcomes in dealing with that pressure may reveal more faces of stigma that were not addressed in this study. Last, given the rising rates of participation in cosmetic surgery among men, further research might also focus on experiences of men with regard to the stigmas that they experience, trade, and manage.</p>
