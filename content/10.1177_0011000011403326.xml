<abstract>
<p>This meta-analysis synthesizes the findings of 60 independent samples from 51 studies examining racial/ethnic discrimination against Latina/os in the United States. The purpose was to identify individual-level resources and outcomes that most strongly relate to discrimination. Discrimination against Latina/os significantly results in outcomes pertaining to health, mental health, education, and employment. Mental health indicators have the strongest correlations with discrimination. Among the individual resources resulting from this meta-analysis—personal constructs and strengths, social support, acculturation, enculturation, acculturative stress, and active coping skills—personal constructs and strengths (e.g., self-esteem and self-efficacy) have the strongest correlations with discrimination and outcomes. These findings are significantly moderated by sample age, ethnicity, and regionality. Implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>The term <italic>Latina/o</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011000011403326">1</xref></sup> encompasses individuals representing an array of ethnicities and nationalities. It may include people who are, either themselves or descendants of those who are, from Mexico, Cuba, Central America, South America, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and other nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0011000011403326">U.S. Census Bureau, 2007</xref>). According to the Unites States Census Bureau, there were an estimated 45.5 million Latina/os living in the United States (U.S.) as of 2009, representing 15.1% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0011000011403326">U.S. Census Bureau, 2009</xref>). The Latina/o population is expected to rise to 102.6 million or 24.4% of the U.S. population by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0011000011403326">U.S. Census Bureau, 2006</xref>). Whereas some areas of the country are predominantly Latina/o, including Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California, in other areas of the country, Latina/os remain a small minority.</p>
<p>Researchers have demonstrated that, despite being a numerical majority in some cities, Latina/os living in the U.S. continue to experience discrimination in education, health care, job settings, and daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000011403326">Pérez, Fortuna, &amp; Alégría, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, a growing body of literature has addressed how Latina/os experience and deal with discrimination. The purpose of our study was to quantitatively summarize the research on the individual resources and outcomes related to personal experiences of discrimination for Latina/os in the hopes of providing a cohesive understanding of the phenomenon. In 1999, the U.S. Surgeon General released his report on mental health citing discrimination as a primary issue plaguing our population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0011000011403326">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999</xref>) and, according to a national survey performed in 2007, more than half of all Latina/o participants (54%) reported believing that discrimination is a major problem that has prevented Latina/os from succeeding in the U.S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011000011403326">Pew Hispanic Center, 2009</xref>). Counseling psychologists, thus, have an ethical responsibility to address this social malady (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011403326">American Psychological Association, 2002</xref>); this duty is furthered by the recent impetus the field has placed on promoting social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000011403326">Arredondo &amp; Perez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0011000011403326">Vera &amp; Speight, 2003</xref>). Identifying the best mechanisms by which Latina/os successfully combat the damaging effects of discrimination is, therefore, a timely and critical matter of investigation in counseling psychology.</p>
<p>Discrimination against Latina/os in the U.S. has been found to take on a variety of forms. Some of the commonly held stereotypes Latina/os face include being labeled as “lazy, overemotional, unreliable, illegally in the United States, speaking broken English, and criminal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011403326">Delgado-Romero, Galván, Hunter, &amp; Torres, 2008</xref>, p. 331). Machismo, a culture-specific quality associated with Latino men, is often depicted negatively as being abusive or domineering despite being a multidimensional construct incorporating such positive features as chivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011403326">Arciniega, Anderson, Tovar-Blank, &amp; Tracey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011403326">Delgado-Romero et al., 2008</xref>). In a recent qualitative study examining the discrimination experiences of Latina/o youth in Los Angeles, California, and Trenton, New Jersey, researchers identified common themes of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011403326">Córdova &amp; Cervantes, 2010</xref>). Latino youth reported experiencing discrimination from both peers and teachers and reported being ridiculed, ostracized, and made to feel as though they were second-class citizens to their White counterparts. Discrimination has also been thought to affect different Latina/o ethnic groups differently. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011000011403326">Niemann (2001)</xref> provided a review of literature on stereotypes regarding Chicana/os in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011403326">Dawson and Panchanadeswaran (2010)</xref> explored discrimination against Dominicans.</p>
<p>Similar to other minorities in the U.S., personal experiences of discrimination occur in multiple settings and have been linked to a number of negative outcomes for Latina/os. Mental health and health-related outcomes are among the most prevalent outcomes studied in relation to discrimination. Discrimination has been found to be significantly and positively related to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011403326">Hwang &amp; Goto, 2008</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla, Kim, &amp; Lam, 2010</xref>), and psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000011403326">Moradi &amp; Risco, 2006</xref>) for Latina/os. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011403326">Flores, Tschann, Dimas, Pasch, and De Groat (2010)</xref> believed that incidences of discrimination are experienced as traumas for Latina/os and found that post-traumatic stress symptoms are significantly correlated with experiences of discrimination. Furthermore, those who report experiencing higher levels of discrimination are also less likely to engage in healthy behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011403326">Bianchi, Zea, Poppen, Reisen, &amp; Echeverry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2010</xref>) and more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011403326">Kulis, Marsiglia, &amp; Nieri, 2009</xref>). Academic and employment outcomes have also been examined in relation to discrimination against Latina/os. Latina/os who personally experience discrimination in the workplace are less likely to report job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011403326">Foley &amp; Kidder, 2002</xref>) and more likely to report intentions to leave their current employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000011403326">Foley, Kidder, &amp; Powell, 2002</xref>). For Latina/o youth in schools, those who report experiencing greater discrimination have been found to have lower academic motivation and achievement and are less likely to feel as though they belong in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011403326">Alfaro, Umaňa-Taylor, Gonzales-Backen, Bamáca, &amp; Zeiders, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is a clear link between discrimination and various outcomes, empirical and conceptual models on discrimination have identified other factors, such as individual resources and contextual variables, that influence the extent to which discrimination leads to negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011403326">Brondolo, Brady ver Halen, Pencille, Beatty, &amp; Contrada, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011403326">Pascoe &amp; Smart Richman, 2009</xref>). The biopsychosocial model outlines the processes involved in the discrimination-distress link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011403326">Clark, Anderson, Clark, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>). This model was originally developed for use with African American populations; however, it has been applied to and supported by research relating to other ethnic minorities as well. This model posits that there are individual-level factors, such as psychological and coping variables, that attenuate the strength of the relationship between discrimination and poor outcomes. Furthermore, there are certain contextual variables that are found to influence the extent to which discrimination experiences lead to negative outcomes for minorities, including social status and other sociodemographic factors. Thus, individuals who experience discrimination are situated in a particular context and use their resources in a manner that either buffers or exacerbates the impact of these discrimination experiences.</p>
<p>In research on Latina/os in particular, the individual-level factors that have been associated with discrimination and its outcomes include positive constructs about the self and others, social support, ethnic identity, and coping skills. Individuals who endorse positive views about themselves (i.e., high self-esteem or self-efficacy) and who hold positive views of others and the world around them (i.e., beliefs in a just world) are thought to be protected from being negatively affected by discrimination experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011403326">Foley &amp; Kidder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000011403326">Moradi &amp; Risco, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011403326">Pascoe &amp; Smart Richman, 2009</xref>). In addition, the well-being of individuals who have the support of others is also less likely to be affected by discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011403326">Brondolo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011403326">Pascoe &amp; Smart Richman, 2009</xref>). Similarly, those who use active coping strategies to address their experiences of discrimination are less prone to suffering negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011403326">Pascoe &amp; Smart Richman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor, Vargas-Chanes, Garcia, &amp; Gonzales-Backen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Some researchers have identified ethnic identity and acculturative processes as protective factors against the negative outcomes of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011403326">Brondolo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). Proponents of this belief posit that strong connections with ethnically similar others may ameliorate the negative effects of discrimination. However, findings from empirical research were mixed, with some results indicating that ethnic identity moderates the discrimination-distress relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011403326">Armenta &amp; Hunt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor &amp; Guimond, 2010</xref>) and others finding no connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011403326">Eccleston &amp; Major, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000011403326">Moradi &amp; Risco, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011403326">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al. (2010)</xref> argued that, instead of examining ethnic identity, investigating the processes of acculturation (adaptation to the dominant culture) and enculturation (socialization into one’s own culture) separately may lend a better understanding of the link between discrimination, cultural affiliation, and distress outcomes. However, results from a study examining both separately were also contradictory to what was expected in that enculturation was found to augment the negative effects of discrimination, and acculturation appeared to have no significant moderation effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, there has yet to be a clear agreement on the roles of ethnic identity, acculturation, and enculturation in the outcomes of discrimination.</p>
<p>In addition to individual resources, sociodemographic variables such as sex, age, personal income, and marital status have also been conceptualized to influence discrimination and its outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011403326">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000011403326">Kessler, Mickelson, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>). However, only a few studies have included these factors in their investigations of discrimination and its outcomes. For instance, one study examined the effects of linguistic acculturation and time spent in the U.S. as moderators of the outcomes of discrimination, only to find no significant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011403326">Kulis et al., 2009</xref>). In another study, gender was found to significantly influence the relationships between discrimination, academic motivation, and academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011403326">Alfaro et al., 2009</xref>). For boys, academic motivation mediated the relationship between discrimination and academic success; however, this was not the case for girls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011403326">Flores and colleagues (2008)</xref> found that the relationship between perceived discrimination and physical health was significantly higher for men than for women. Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000011403326">Pérez et al. (2008)</xref> hypothesized and found that Latina/os who identify as Cuban reported experiencing less discrimination as a result of having stronger support systems by living in more enclave-type settings. Immigration status, English language proficiency, ethnicity, age, gender, and region of residence are six other variables thought to influence discrimination and its outcomes for Latina/os, yet there is a paucity of research to support this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000011403326">Pérez et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Because a number of studies examining the effects of discrimination on Latino/as in the U.S. yielded mixed findings, it is important to develop a cohesive understanding of how Latina/os experience and deal with discrimination. To date, no research synthesis has quantitatively summarized the empirical literature on discrimination against Latina/os. Similarly, no comparisons have been drawn between the outcome variables most strongly associated with discrimination, nor has research identified the individual resources that are the most important in either buffering or dealing with the negative outcomes of discrimination. Answers to these questions are critical for counseling psychologists to develop interventions and assist their Latina/o clients in coping with discrimination experiences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to assess how various sociodemographic factors may influence the relationships between discrimination, individual resources, and/or outcomes. Because these variables have been hypothesized to influence how discrimination leads to outcomes, it is important to move the literature forward by examining these variables as possible moderators in the discrimination-distress link. Lastly, it is important to clarify some of the empirical and conceptual discrepancies found within the literature on discrimination against Latina/os, such as the mixed results regarding the role of ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al., 2010</xref>) and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011403326">Eccleston &amp; Major, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000011403326">Moradi &amp; Risco, 2006</xref>) in relation to discrimination and its outcomes. Clarifying these questions will enable counseling psychologists to advance the field and to better serve Latina/o populations.</p>

<title>This Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to statistically synthesize the literature on discrimination against Latina/os in the U.S. with the hopes of informing future research and interventions in this area. In particular, we were interested in examining what individual resources and outcomes are related to discrimination people experience in their everyday lives. Our primary aims were to (a) identify the most likely outcomes of discrimination; (b) identify the individual-level resources most strongly correlated to discrimination and its outcomes; and (c) assess which sociodemographic variables most strongly moderate the relationships between discrimination, individual resources, and outcomes. With respect to the latter question, we were particularly interested in determining the roles of ethnicity, gender, social class, immigration status, age, and regionality. Because these sociodemographic factors have been identified as potential moderators in the discrimination-distress link, we chose to consider them in our meta-analysis.</p>
<p>We addressed our research questions using meta-analytic strategies. Meta-analysis is a statistical technique that enables researchers to quantitatively aggregate study findings using effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000011403326">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985</xref>) and, thus, provides a cohesive picture of the phenomenon of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011403326">Glass, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000011403326">Quintana &amp; Minimi, 2006</xref>). Meta-analysis is a useful tool to estimate the overall effect of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011403326">Cooper, 2009</xref>), to compare findings by study characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000011403326">Cooper, Hedges, &amp; Valentine, 2009</xref>), and to explore sources of between-study variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011403326">Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998</xref>). In addition, meta-analysis is statistically more powerful than individual studies are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011403326">Cohn &amp; Becker, 2003</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011000011403326">2</xref></sup> and, thus, yields more reliable and generalizable conclusion based on an inclusion of larger samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011403326">Cohn &amp; Becker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011403326">Cooper, 2009</xref>). For these reasons, we chose the meta-analysis as a means of addressing our research questions.</p>

<title>Literature Search Procedure<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011000011403326">3</xref></sup></title>
<p>Three major searches were conducted to gather the studies that were included in this meta-analysis. First, studies were extracted from a larger meta-analytic study examining coping with all forms of discrimination. Studies collected in this initial pool were located with a computerized Boolean search in February 2009 using EBSCOhost, including PsycINFO and ERIC as the databases. The key terms that were searched included different forms of discrimination (<italic>racism, sexism, homophobia, heterosexism, ageism, classism</italic>) or discrimination (<italic>discrimination, stigma, prejudice, stereotype</italic>) coupled with any aspect of identity (<italic>race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, social status, socioeconomic status</italic>). These studies were then limited to those that included terms relating to either coping or mental health and later to those that included data relevant to Latina/o Americans. All of these procedures were performed twice (by one psychology doctoral student and by the first author) and 100% agreement was reached. Eight studies resulted from these procedures.</p>
<p>A second search was conducted in June 2010 using the same procedures described above, except with <italic>discrimination</italic> or <italic>racism</italic> as key terms along with one of the following: <italic>Latina, Latino</italic>, or <italic>Hispanic</italic>. This search was then narrowed to those studies that were empirical and contained statistical information relevant to this study. The first author conducted the search and the second author checked for accuracy. Agreement among the authors was 100% as to which articles should be included in this study. Ten studies were located in this second round of data collection. To lessen the potential threat of publication bias, we performed another search targeting only unpublished studies using dissertation abstracts in PsycINFO and ERIC via EBSCOhost in June 2010. Ten unpublished dissertations were found that met the inclusion criteria of the current review described above.</p>
<p>The last round of computerized searches were performed in January 2011 using the same procedures described above, except in place of <italic>Latino, Latina</italic>, or <italic>Hispanic</italic> as search terms, we specified all ethnic groups and world regions that would assist us in locating studies related to Latina/os. These terms included <italic>Mexican, Caribbean, Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, South American, Argentinian, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Paraguay, Peruvian, Uruguayan, Venezuelan, Brazilian, Central American, Belizean, Costa Rican, Salvadorian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan</italic>, and <italic>Panamanian</italic>. In addition, to ensure the comprehensiveness of dataset, we performed an ancestry search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011403326">Cooper, 2009</xref>) in which we examined the reference lists of all included studies for possible inclusion. The last round of searches yielded a total of 23 studies, including 6 published and 17 unpublished studies. Therefore, a total of 51 studies (24 published and 27 unpublished) were included in the current review.</p>

Specifically, studies were coded for (a) sample characteristics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, social status, average length of residence in U.S., and immigration status; (b) study design characteristics including the total sample size, geographic region from which data were gathered (Northeast, West, Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, national, and mixed regions), ethnicity of participants (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, mixed ethnic groups), publication year and type (unpublished versus published), type of study setting, age of data source (mean age of 16 or under, or children, versus mean age above 16, or adolescents or adults); and (c) study variables characteristics. Study variables were chosen based on prior empirical and conceptual models of discrimination-distress mentioned previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011403326">Brondolo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011403326">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011403326">Pascoe &amp; Smart Richman, 2009</xref>), including discrimination (measures of perceived personal experiences of discrimination and/or racism), individual resources (measures of resources that people use to mitigate or cope with discrimination), and outcomes (measures of health, mental health, and life satisfaction). We also included academic and job-related outcomes.</p>
<p>To make comparisons across studies and gain a better understanding of the different variables associated with discrimination, we needed to create subcategories for individual resource and outcome variables. As is usual with meta-analyses, subcategories were created such that like variables were clustered together and unlike variables were separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011403326">Becker, 2000</xref>). The first and second authors performed this sorting process until they reached 100% agreement. Please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000011403326">Table 1</xref> for the designation of all study variables into categories and subcategories along with information about the originating article.</p>
<p>The final list of subcategories for the individual resources included (a) personal constructs and strengths such as personal self-esteem, academic motivation, and beliefs in a just world; (b) social support such as social embeddedness and family support; (c) acculturation to the U.S.; (d) Latina/o acculturation or enculturation; (e) acculturative stress; and (f) coping strategies such as proactive coping, problem-based coping, and active coping. Final subcategories for the outcomes category included (a) depression, (b) anxiety, and (c) psychological distress including overall measures of mental health (e.g., Brief Symptom Inventory); (d) job dissatisfaction and performance, which incorporated employment and education-related indicators such as intention to leave current employment, job dissatisfaction, and school performance, and (5) health-related behaviors such as engagement in healthy habits and frequency of substance use.</p>

<title>Effect Size</title>
<p>The Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) describing the relationships between racial discrimination, individual resources, and outcomes were used as the primary effect-size index of the current meta-analysis. A nonnormality r distribution was handled by transforming <italic>r</italic> to Fisher’s <italic>z</italic> via <italic>z<sub>i</sub></italic> = .5 × ln(1 + <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> / 1 − <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic>), where ln is the natural logarithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000011403326">Borenstein, 2009</xref>). The conditional variance of <italic>z<sub>i</sub></italic> is computed via <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic> = 1 / (<italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> − 3), where ni is the sample size for ri. All estimates (e.g., means and standard errors) based on the converted Fisher’s <italic>z</italic>s were back-transformed into <italic>r</italic> metric using the formula <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0011000011403326"><mml:math display="inline" id="math1-0011000011403326">

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>The statistical analyses in this meta-analysis followed methods proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000011403326">Hedges and Olkin (1985)</xref> and described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000011403326">Cooper et al. (2009)</xref>. A number of researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011403326">Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011000011403326">Raudenbush, 2009</xref>) suggested that meta-analysts should treat study effects at random in cases where effect sizes are likely to be affected by a large number of uncontrollable factors. In addition, when a meta-analyst purports to generalize study findings to the population of studies, random-effects model is considered to be more appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000011403326">Quintana &amp; Minimi, 2006</xref>). Thus, we used the random-effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011000011403326">Raudenbush, 2009</xref>) for computing the overall effects among discrimination, individual resources, and outcomes, which incorporated the estimated additional uncertainty in the variance of effect sizes.</p>
<p>Mixed-effects models were then employed when comparing effects across the categorical moderator variables (i.e., types of individual resources, types of outcomes). Using methods of moments, the mixed-effects model with categorical variables calculated the additional uncertainty in the effect size variance within each subcategory. The average effect size for each subcategory was then estimable. More details about the random-effects and the mixed-effects model can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011000011403326">Raudenbush (2009)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section7-0011000011403326">
<title>Dependency</title>
<p>Dependency among effect sizes is an issue that often arises in meta-analyses; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011403326">Becker (2000)</xref> suggested, it can be handled in the following ways: (a) to average dependent effect sizes, (b) to choose one effect size from the most valid or representative measure of the variable, (c) to separate effect sizes into subcategories, and (d) to use multivariate meta-analytic methods.</p>
<p>There were three different types of instances in which we faced the issue of dependency in this study. First, in some studies researchers included different subscales of a measure representing the same construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011000011403326">Rosas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0011000011403326">Van Buren, 2004</xref>), and we subsequently averaged the relevant correlation coefficients into a single measure. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0011000011403326">Van Buren (2004)</xref> used the Adolescent Discrimination Index, which has three subscales of perceived personal discrimination. Correlations for each of these subscales were averaged to represent a single measure of perceived personal discrimination. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011000011403326">Rosas (1999)</xref> used a measure with four different subscales of the Racism and Life Experiences Scales (RaLES). In this study. however, the correlations of only three of the four subscales in this measure (Micro-Experience, Racism Frequency, Racism Stress) were relevant to our study and, thus, were averaged into a single measure of personal experiences of discrimination. The remaining subscale (Group Impact) assessed the extent to which individuals believed their cultural group in general was a target of discrimination. Because this subscale was not a measure of personal experiences of discrimination, our focus of interest in this study, the effect sizes for this particular subscale were not included in our analysis.</p>
<p>Second, when studies used multiple measures of the same construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011403326">Dawson &amp; Panchanadeswaran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011403326">Edwards &amp; Romero, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011403326">Ghazarian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000011403326">Lopez-Kinney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011000011403326">Ornelas, 2009</xref>), we aggregated the correlations for a single measure of the construct. This occurred in six different studies. In particular, we averaged correlation coefficients from two measures assessing respondents’ adherence to Latina/o culture (i.e., Latina/o Values Scale and Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican American–II) from the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al (2010)</xref>. We also computed an average correlation from paternal and maternal support and treated it as a measure of parental support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011403326">Ghazarian (2008)</xref>. Similarly, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000011403326">Lopez-Kinney (2001)</xref>, correlation coefficients related to problem-focused coping and emotional-focused coping were aggregated to represent one’s active coping skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000011403326">Foley et al. (2002)</xref> used factor analysis in their study and included multiple indicators for perceived ethnic discrimination (4 indicators), distributive justice (2 indicators), and intention to leave a job (4 indicators). For each of these three constructs, we averaged the effects sizes of relevant indicators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011000011403326">Ornelas (2009)</xref> had two variables related to personal experiences of discrimination, which we averaged for our analysis, including unfair racial/ethnic treatment at work and in healthcare settings.</p>
<p>Lastly, three longitudinal studies reported findings across multiple time points (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011403326">Alfaro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011403326">Armenta &amp; Hunt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). In these three studies, we chose correlation coefficients measured at the very first time point. We believed the first time point to be the most valid measure of the variables because, in choosing this time point, we ruled out possible test-retest effects.</p>

<title>Description of Studies</title>
<p>A total of 60 independent samples from 51 studies (27 published and 24 unpublished studies) produced 211 correlation coefficients (r). Two studies included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000011403326">Garcia (2006)</xref> were treated independently. Study findings presented separately by gender (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011403326">Alfaro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0011000011403326">Shorey, Cowan, &amp; Sullivan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000011403326">J. A. Garcia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor et al., 2008</xref>), age (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000011403326">Delgado, 2009</xref>), and ethnic background (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0011000011403326">Swami, 2005</xref>) were treated as independent study samples. Also, when studies provided results for multiple racial groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011403326">Alfaro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0011000011403326">Shorey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor et al., 2010</xref>), correlation coefficients exclusively for Latino participants were obtained.</p>
<p>The majority of studies (i.e., 42 of 51 studies) were published in the past 10 years, and the remainder were published in the 1990s with one exception, published in 1985 (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000011403326">Oliver, Rodriguez, &amp; Mickelson, 1985</xref>). These studies were conducted in various geographical areas of the U.S., including the Northeast (<italic>k</italic>= 3), West Coast (<italic>k</italic>= 20), Southeast (<italic>k</italic>= 3), Midwest (<italic>k</italic> = 5), and Southwest (<italic>k</italic>= 10). In some studies, data were gathered nationally (<italic>k</italic> = 4) or in different regions throughout the U.S. (<italic>k</italic>= 3). Thirteen studies were funded by sources such as the National Institute of Health, National Institutes of Mental Health, National Institute of Drug Abuse, Department of Health and Human Services, McArthur Foundation, and universities. Most studies obtained samples using nonprobability sampling methods such as convenience or purposive sampling, and few used data from the randomized controlled trials (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011403326">Kulis et al., 2009</xref>) or pre-existing research (i.e., B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0011000011403326">Rivera, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Sample sizes varied from 33 to 1,843 (<italic>M</italic> = 312.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 363.34), and the mean age of participants ranged from 10 to 55.50 years old (<italic>M</italic> = 24.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.87). Among the 60 independent samples, 18 were exclusively focused on children under the mean age of 16 years (<italic>M</italic> age = 14, <italic>SD</italic>= 1.98) and the rest were based on adolescents and adults, with a mean age of above 16 years (<italic>M</italic> age = 30.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.56). Of a total 13,750 subjects from 60 independent samples, females represented 51.88%, whereas males represented 48.11%. The majority of study samples (<italic>s</italic> = 39) had participants that included Latina/o participants representing various ethnic backgrounds including Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, El Salvadorian, Guatemalan, and Nicaraguan, and a few were exclusively based on a particular ethnic group (s = 11 for Mexican; <italic>s</italic> = 3 for Dominican; <italic>s</italic> = 1 for Puerto Rican; <italic>s</italic> = 1 for Cuban). Only five studies provided the average length of residence in U.S.</p>

<title>Publication Bias</title>
<p>After including both published and unpublished studies in our analyses, we assessed whether publication bias was likely to be problematic in our samples. First, the scatter plot of 211 correlation coefficients against sample size appeared to be symmetric and funnel shaped. Also, Egger’s regression test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0011000011403326">Sutton, 2009</xref>) for funnel plot asymmetry was found to be insignificant for 211 effect sizes, <italic>t</italic>(209) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .66, indicating no presence of the potential publication bias. In addition, three series of the Egger’s regression test of intercept for all pairs of relationship among three variables separately indicated no statistical evidence supporting potential publication bias: <italic>t</italic>(81) = 0.58, p = .56 for the relationship between discrimination and individual resources; <italic>t</italic>(67) = 0.89, p = .39 for the relationship between individual resources and outcome; <italic>t</italic>(109) = 1.90, p = .06 for the relationship between discrimination and outcome. This provided us with additional confidence in the validity of our results.</p>

The estimated overall correlation was 0.23 with a standard error (SE) of 0.02, which was statistically significant (<italic>z</italic> = 12.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Such results indicated that the relation of racial discrimination to outcome was statistically significant and positive. The link between racial discrimination and outcome significantly differed depending on five types of outcome measure (QBetween (4) = 68.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The estimated correlation coefficients were statistically significant and positive for all five types of outcome measures: <italic>r̄</italic>= 0.29 for depression (<italic>z</italic> = 6.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), <italic>r̄</italic> = 0.37 for anxiety (<italic>z</italic> = 7.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), <italic>r̄</italic> = 0.19 for psychological distress (<italic>z</italic> = 6.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), <italic>r̄</italic> = 0.23 for job dissatisfaction (<italic>z</italic> = 5.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and <italic>r̄</italic> = 0.15 for unhealthy behaviors (<italic>z</italic> = 5.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Planned post-hoc comparisons using Bonferonni adjustment were employed to control the chance of committing a Type I error at a preset alpha level of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011403326">Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998</xref>). The post-hoc comparisons showed that the relation of discrimination to anxiety was statistically different from its relation to psychological distress (<italic>z</italic> = 3.09, <italic>p</italic> = .0002). Also, the relations of discrimination to anxiety (<italic>z</italic> = 2.80, <italic>p</italic> = .005) and depression (<italic>z</italic> = 3.77, <italic>p</italic> = .002) were statistically higher than its relation to unhealthy behavior.</p>

<title>Relationship Between Racial Discrimination and Individual Resources</title>
<p>From a total of 83 correlation coefficients representing the relation of discrimination to individual resources, the estimated weighted-average correlation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011000011403326">4</xref></sup> was −0.07 with a SE of 0.02, having a 95% confidence interval of −0.12 and −0.03. The relationship between racial discrimination and individual resources was statistically significant (z = −3.44, p &lt; .01), suggesting that racial discrimination was significantly related to individual resources. The magnitude of this relationship was different depending upon type of individual resources, QBetween (5) = 648.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
<p>Personal constructs and strengths (<italic>r̄</italic> = −0.22, z = −6.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), acculturation (<italic>r̄</italic> = −0.06, <italic>z</italic> = −2.16, p = 03), and acculturative stress (<italic>r̄</italic> = 0.28, <italic>z</italic> = 6.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were significantly related to racial discrimination. The planned post-hoc comparisons using Bonferonni adjustment indicated that racial discrimination showed significantly higher relations to personal strengths than its relations to acculturation (<italic>z</italic> = −3.77, <italic>p</italic> = .0002) and enculturation (<italic>z</italic> = −5.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of our meta-analysis was to examine the relationships between personal experiences of discrimination, individual resources, and outcomes for Latina/os in the United States. Our aims were threefold: to identify the most probable outcomes of discrimination against Latina/os, to pinpoint what individual resources are most strongly related to discrimination and its outcomes, and to determine what demographic variables significantly moderate the discrimination-distress relationship. With respect to the first question, all five outcomes (anxiety, depression, psychological distress, education and employment outcomes, and unhealthy behaviors) were found to have significant and positive correlations with discrimination. However, anxiety appeared to have the strongest correlation with discrimination, followed by depression, and academic or job performance and dissatisfaction. The least likely, yet still significant outcome associated with discrimination was unhealthy behaviors, which incorporated variables such as general health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011403326">Bianchi et al., 2004</xref>), alcohol and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2010</xref>), and perceived physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0011000011403326">Swami, 2005</xref>) Thus, when developing interventions for Latina/os to combat the negative effects of discrimination, it is important for counseling psychologists to deliver interventions that target primarily anxiety and depression. Our finding that academic and employment outcomes are just as likely to be affected by discrimination as mental health underscores the important role that counseling psychologists have adopted as social justice advocates. An important aspect of reducing discrimination outcomes for Latina/os may be to extend beyond the confines of traditional counseling and psychotherapy and develop systemic interventions in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2010</xref>) and the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011403326">Foley &amp; Kidder, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>With regards to our second research question, among all of the individual resource variables, personal constructs and strengths were the most consistently and strongly correlated with the discrimination-distress link. Personal constructs and strengths included self-esteem, self-efficacy, just-world beliefs, self-acceptance, procedural justice, and academic motivation. Our results suggest that clients who do not have positive self-concepts or beliefs about the world may be especially vulnerable to experiencing the negative effects of discrimination. It is imperative when working with Latina/o clients who experience discrimination to assess how they generally view themselves and the world around them. Helping Latina/o clients foster positive beliefs about themselves and others may be the best strategy for reducing negative outcomes—more important than fostering social support or cultural identity. Counseling psychologists may, therefore, wish to develop discrimination interventions that specifically target the acquisition and maintenance of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and beliefs in a just world.</p>
<p>We found that social support is not significantly related to discrimination, but it is significantly and negatively related to discrimination-linked outcomes. The first finding may appear counterintuitive because environments with higher levels of discrimination should result in lower levels of social support for Latina/os. However, this finding makes sense in light of the Latina/o cultural value of <italic>familismo</italic>, which emphasizes strong, close ties with immediate and extended family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011403326">Delgado-Romero et al., 2008</xref>). Because the most important relationships in traditional Latina/o culture are familial and hence less likely to be discriminatory, social supports derived from the broader environment, which are more likely to be discriminatory (peers, colleagues, community members), are less important. The second finding related to social support indicates, however, that amount of support does indeed relate to the extent to which Latina/os suffer from negative health, mental health, or educational or employment outcomes in relation to discrimination. Latina/os with stronger support networks have a better ability to cope with discrimination. Counseling psychologists should, therefore, recognize that garnering support from families may be important in helping Latina/os cope with discrimination. Furthermore, when needing support, Latina/os may turn to family and other nontraditional helpers before mental health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011000011403326">Prieto, McNeill, Walls, &amp; Gomez, 2001</xref>). Future research is needed to determine whether interventions reducing the effects of discrimination for Latina/os may be more effective if targeted broadly toward families and communities rather than individuals or groups of peers.</p>
<p>Active coping skills were not found to be significantly related to either discrimination or outcomes. This was surprising because we expected to find a positive relationship between discrimination and active coping and a negative relationship between active coping and outcomes. This would indicate that the more Latina/os are faced with discrimination, the more likely they will increase in their use of active coping strategies. Increased active coping would in turn decrease Latina/os’ chances of poor outcomes. However, on further examination of the primary studies, we found that the correlations between discrimination and active coping varied in direction, with some indicating a positive relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011403326">Edwards &amp; Romero, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000011403326">Lopez-Kinney, 2001</xref>) and others a negative one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011403326">Bianchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011000011403326">Torres, 2009</xref>). Similarly, some studies resulted in a positive relationship between active coping and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011403326">Chávez &amp; French, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0011000011403326">Walters, 2005</xref>), whereas others found a negative relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011403326">Bianchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0011000011403326">Torres, 2009</xref>). Thus, although these correlations are significant within the context of the individual studies, when averaged in our overall analysis, the mean correlation was insignificant. In future research, it will be beneficial to target which specific coping strategies are most activated with discrimination and which are best for reducing the negative outcomes of discrimination.</p>
<p>With respect to cultural identity factors, acculturation was the only variable that was significantly correlated with both discrimination and outcomes. Whereas enculturation was found to be unrelated with discrimination or outcomes, acculturative stress was significantly related to discrimination but not outcomes. Our overall results suggest that having stronger connections with the dominant culture is related to reduced discrimination experiences and outcomes. Caution should be taken to not overinflate these findings because the effect sizes associated with these significant relationships are small (−.06 between discrimination and acculturation and −.13 between acculturation and outcomes). However, these findings seem plausible in that those who perceive discrimination may not wish to acculturate to a society that discriminates against them and, as a result of resisting acculturation, are more likely to experience distress. Again, because this study is purely correlative in nature, we were unable to test this hypothesis; we believe that further exploration is needed before this tentative hypothesis is accepted.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, although we identified a trend in how cultural identity factors relate to discrimination and its outcomes, there were great discrepancies in results across the individual studies. For instance, whereas some studies indicate no relation between cultural identity factors and discrimination and its outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2010</xref>), others find positive relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011000011403326">Piedrahita Palacio, 2007</xref>), and still others result in negative correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011403326">Cislo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0011000011403326">Torres &amp; Ong, 2010</xref>). These inconsistencies mirror the divergent theoretical arguments about whether acculturation and enculturation processes decrease or enhance discrimination outcomes. The complexities of these cultural identity processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011000011403326">Pizarro &amp; Vera, 2001</xref>) complicate a clear connection with the discrimination-distress link. Perhaps these inconsistencies and complexities fuel researchers’ curiosities as two thirds of the research investigating coping with discrimination are focused on ethnic identity or acculturation. We posit that Latina/os might be better served by counseling psychologists attending to individual resources that are already demonstrating strong correlations with discrimination and its outcomes, particularly those that are teachable skills rather than cultural identity factors that do not specify certain abilities that facilitate coping with discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011403326">Alamilla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000011403326">Lee, 2003</xref>). However, if researchers wish to further disentangle the complexities of how cultural identity factors relate to experiences and outcomes of discrimination, we believe that a clearer understanding may emerge if researchers identify and explore specific processes involved in acculturation and enculturation that may tie to discrimination.</p>
<p>With respect to our third research question, our results investigating sociodemographic factors as moderators of the relationships between discrimination, individual resources, and outcomes led to new developments in this area. Our findings are the first to suggest that it is imperative to consider age differences when discussing discrimination and its correlates, which is a noteworthy result given that a large percentage of Latina/os are youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011000011403326">Pew Hispanic Center, 2009</xref>).We found that children were significantly less likely than adults were to suffer negative outcomes in relation to discrimination. Furthermore, the relationship between discrimination and individual resources was significantly greater for children. Assuming a potential causal link, it seems that children may be more likely to use individual resources when faced with discrimination. However, there were no significant differences between children and adults in how these coping skills may reduce the impact of discrimination. Counseling psychologists may, therefore, wish to develop different interventions for children and adults coping with discrimination. Adults especially may need more guidance in recognizing when the coping strategies they already possess may be helpful in dealing with incidences of discrimination.</p>
<p>In our examination of ethnic group differences, we found that studies with mixed ethnic groups demonstrated the largest correlation between discrimination and outcomes. In terms of specific ethnic groups, the discrimination-distress link was significant for Cubans and Mexicans but not for Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. Furthermore, the relationships between all the measured variables (discrimination, individual resources, outcomes) were significant only for Cubans and mixed ethnicities. Therefore, it appears that there are some variances across ethnic groups in how discrimination experiences may lead to outcomes. Further research is needed to discern what cultural factors may play a role in how the different ethnic groups experience and cope with discrimination. For instance, although our findings do not support this, several researchers have suggested that Dominicans and Puerto Ricans may experience higher levels of discrimination than other Latina/os because of their tendency to have darker skin tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011403326">Araujo &amp; Borrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011403326">Dawson &amp; Panchanadeswaran, 2010</xref>). Chicanos (Mexican Americans), representing the largest population of Latina/os in the United States, may also have a unique set of experiences and ways of coping with discrimination as a result of long-standing sociopolitical issues related to immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011403326">Flores et al., 2010</xref>). Although our study is limited in presenting a clear pattern of or reason for ethnic group differences, we agree with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000011403326">Liang, Salcedo, Rivera, &amp; Lopez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000011403326">McNeill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor &amp; Fine, 2001</xref>) who have argued that examining ethnic culture is a critical line of inquiry when exploring issues related to Latina/os.</p>
<p>We found that each of the relationships between discrimination, individual resources, and outcomes were significantly moderated by the region of the country in which data were gathered. In the overall relationship between discrimination and outcomes, the Northeast region was the only region that was not statistically significant. We believe this particular result should be interpreted with caution between there were only two effect sizes and a wide standard error associated with this effect size. However, for all other areas (West, Southeast, Southwest, Midwest), discrimination was significantly linked to poor outcomes for Latina/os. The relationship between discrimination and individual resources was only significant for Latina/os in the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest, whereas the relationship between individual resources and outcomes was only significant for the Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and national datasets. Although we are unable to make causal inferences, our preliminary findings emphasize the need for further research into how individuals who reside in various regions of the country specifically deal with discrimination.</p>
<p>We were limited in our abilities to examine differences in our model by three other important sociodemographic variables—immigration status, gender, and social class—because data examining differences in these subgroups were not readily available. However, future research may wish to target these specific questions so as to address how subgroups of Latina/os experience and deal with discrimination. The dangers of ignoring these subgroups and of assuming uniformity among Latina/os and other groups have been discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000011403326">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000011403326">McNeill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0011000011403326">Umaňa-Taylor &amp; Fine, 2001</xref>). Although sociodemographic variables in general are important to consider in examining the outcomes of discrimination, few studies examine these constructs as potential moderators. Furthermore, when they are considered in research, there are no formal or uniform methods of reporting some of this data (such as immigration status and social class); therefore, it is difficult to make comparisons or draw conclusions about the influence of these variables. A systematic method of coding important sociodemographic variables and the consistent inclusion of these factors in studies examining discrimination would be fruitful in moving the field forward.</p>
<p>In sum, more attention toward how Latina/os deal with personal experiences of discrimination is needed, particularly given this current sociopolitical climate as studies have suggested that discrimination against Latina/os has increased due to recent immigration controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011000011403326">Pew Hispanic Center, 2007</xref>). The field of counseling psychology is still in its nascent stages of researching this topic, as evidenced by the few articles published on this subject matter in counseling and counseling psychology journals. However, it is imperative that counseling psychologists generate and use empirical evidence to support intervention programs that increase skills targeted toward reducing the negative effects of discrimination. It is also important that counseling psychologist consider how their interventions may vary depending on sociodemographic factors and that they have the research with which to arm themselves. Furthermore, it is critical that these latest developments be incorporated not only into current practice but also into training so future generations of counseling psychologists can advance this line of inquiry and develop more sophisticated understandings of how to work effectively with Latina/o clients. Finally, counseling psychologists should advise in the creation of policies, in multiple contexts and settings, to reduce the impact of discrimination experienced by Latina/os. The results from this current meta-analysis provide a solid foundation for moving forward in these next steps.</p>
