<title>Background:</title>
<p>We sought to evaluate antimicrobial use among patients with advanced cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Retrospective review of patients experiencing cancer-related death while hospitalized.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Among 145 patients, 126 (86.9%) received antimicrobials for a mean of 12.5 ± 12.9 days. 88 (69.8%) of 126 had clinical findings suggestive of infection. Sixty-one patients (48.4%) had positive cultures, the remaining were treated empirically. “Comfort care” was ultimately pursued in 99 (78.5%) of 126; 35 (35.4%) of 99 continued to receive antimicrobials after a transition to comfort care for an average of 1.6 ± 1.1 days. On average, antimicrobials were discontinued &lt;1day prior to death.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Antimicrobial use was common among patients with advanced cancer. Even after transition to comfort care, more than one third of patients remained on antimicrobials. The risks and burdens of antimicrobials should be carefully examined when comfort is the stated goal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Treatment of cancer patients with antimicrobials at the end of life is a common practice.<sup>

</sup> Previous studies note the presence of infection at the time of death in as many as 47% to 63% of patients,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111432625">4</xref>
</sup> and a large portion of patients (64%-84%) with advanced cancer receive antimicrobial treatment during their last week of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111432625">5</xref>

</sup> Patients with advanced cancer are susceptible to infection both due to their underlying malignancy and as a result of cancer therapies. Conditions such as bronchial obstruction, poor nutritional status, frequent hospitalizations, treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, tumor necrosis, indwelling catheters, and compromised mucosal barriers are among the myriad of factors that may contribute to cancer-associated infection. The threshold to treat probable or even possible infection is therefore low, and aggressive management in terms of broad-spectrum antimicrobials is sometimes pursued even when the overall prognosis is extremely poor.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial therapy prescribed during the final weeks of life may be intended to treat a potentially reversible condition or symptomatic infection. In such cases, antimicrobial therapy is typically viewed as “usual care,” rather than an aggressive intervention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111432625">8</xref>
</sup> Often antimicrobials are used when other aggressive treatments such as chemotherapy, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis are not considered appropriate by patients and physicians.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111432625">9</xref>
</sup> Yet antimicrobial treatment, especially parenteral therapy, is not without significant risks including drug-related adverse effects, the need for indwelling lines, and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection. In addition to these burdens, the threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance is an important consideration both for individual patients and society at large.</p>
<p>Several previous reports have examined the patterns of antimicrobial use among patients with advanced cancer in hospice and palliative care settings.<sup>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1049909111432625">
<title>Setting and Population</title>
<p>The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) is an 850-bed tertiary care facility that includes the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMCCC). Our study population includes all adult patients in the University of Michigan Cancer Registry who were inpatients from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007 and met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥18at the time of cancer diagnosis, (2) estimated 5-year survival &lt;20% as predicted by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Cancer Statistics Review,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111432625">11</xref>
</sup> and (3) died while an inpatient at UMHS.</p>
<p>For these patients, medical records were reviewed and clinical information abstracted with a focus on timing of end-of-life decision making and the use of antimicrobial therapy. The hospital pharmacy database was queried to obtain administration records for all parenteral and parental-equivalent antimicrobial medications. The unit of time was delineated in 1-day increments. Demographic data, type of malignancy, location of death (intensive care unit [ICU] vs general floor), and the presence of advanced care planning were ascertained. Microbiology results and antimicrobial use was also recorded. Clinical records were abstracted by a physician and reviewed by an attending infectious diseases physician (P.N.M.) in order to distinguish between culture-based and empiric antimicrobial therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111432625">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Continuous data were described and summarized by mean ± standard deviation or median with interquartile range (IQR). Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare proportions. Student <italic>t</italic> tests were used for comparing means of continuous variables. A 2-tailed <italic>P</italic> value of .05 or less was considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). This study was approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-1049909111432625">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We identified 145 patients who experienced cancer-related deaths while hospitalized at UMHS from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007; mean age was 60.3 ± 11.7 years (range 22-88) and 57.6% were male. The most common cancer sites included lung (35.2%), liver (6.9%), esophageal (6.9%), colorectal (5.5%), and leukemia (28.3%).</p>
<p>Reasons for admission varied and included progression of known cancer (29.0%) and infectious complications (27.6%) as the 2 most common. Twenty-five (17.2%) were admitted for newly diagnosed cancer; the majority with leukemia, 17 (68%) of 25. Median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 4-16). In terms of advanced care plans, 32 (25.4%) had their preferences formally documented prior to admission and another 26 (17.9%) completed a plan within 24 hours of admission.</p>
<p>Among 145 patients, 126 (86.9%) received parenteral (or parenteral equivalent) antimicrobials at some point during hospitalization for suspected or proven infections. Medical records document clinical concern for possible infection in 88 (69.8%) of 126; 34 (27.0%) had fever at the time of admission. Sixty-one patients (48.4%) had positive microbiologic cultures, while the remaining 65 (51.6%) were treated empirically.</p>
<p>Among patients treated with antimicrobials, the most common infectious diagnosis was pneumonia in 58 (46.0%) of 126. The presence of pneumonia was established by clinical findings in 39 (67.2%) of 58, and by sputum or bronchoscopic cultures in 19 (32.8%) of 58. Bloodstream infections were present in 34 (27.0%) of 126; urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 (7.9%) of 126. Intra-abdominal infections were present in 15 (11.9%) of 126 patients; specific infections included peritonitis (6), cholangitis (6), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (3). Empiric antimicrobial treatment for fever of unclear source occurred in 15 (11.9%) of 126. Among the patients who received antimicrobials, 7 (5.6%) patients developed <italic>C difficile</italic> infection. Among the 61 patients with positive microbiologic cultures, 19 (31.1%) demonstrated multidrug-resistant organisms.</p>
<p>In terms of specific antimicrobial agents, vancomycin was administered most frequently with use recorded in 91 (72.2%) patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111432625">Table 1</xref>). Among patients receiving vancomycin, 9 had documented infection with methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), 3 had coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 1 had <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>–resistant to ampicillin. The majority of the remaining patients (85.7%) received vancomycin without a clear microbiologic indication.</p>

<sup>a</sup>Several patients received more than 1 agent.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Eighty-nine patients (70.6%) received extended-spectrum penicillins, mostly pipercillin/tazobactam (81 patients). Cephalosporins were given to 49 (38.9%) and carbapenems to 15 (11.9%). Nearly two thirds of patients treated with antimicrobials received a fluoroquinolone (82 of 126; 65.1%), mostly levofloxacin (75 of 82 patients). Besides vancomycin, other gram-positive agents were given including daptomycin (10 patients, 7.9%) and linezolid (7 patients, 5.6%); 3 patients received both. Metronidazole use was also frequent with 39 (30.1%) patients receiving this agent.</p>
<p>Among the patients who received antimicrobial therapy, the mean duration of treatment was 12.5 ± 12.9 days (median 8, range 1-81). Among patients with leukemia (n = 37), the mean duration of antimicrobial use was 19.2 ± 14.5, which was significantly longer than use among patients with nonleukemic malignancy (9.6 ± 11.1 days), <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01. Among the 65 patients receiving empiric treatment, the average duration was 8.0 ± 6.9 days (median 6, range 1-34), while patients who received culture-guided therapy (n = 61), the duration was 17.2 ± 15.8 days (median 13, range 1-81), <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01. Among the patients with an advanced care plan (n = 75), the average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 10.5 ± 10.4 days, while those without a care plan (n = 51) were treated longer with an average of 13.7 ± 14.2 days, although the difference did not achieve statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .17).</p>
<p>Among the entire study population (n = 145), 64 (44.1%) patients died in the ICU and 59 (40.7%) underwent mechanical ventilation at some point during hospitalization. As expected, antimicrobial use among these patients was extensive. On average, duration of antimicrobial use was longer among patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (n = 54) compared to those who did not receive mechanical ventilation (n = 72), 16.4 ± 15.9 days versus 9.5 ± 9.1 days, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01. Patients that died in the ICU (n = 59) were treated for an average of 14.6 ± 15.3 days, while patients that died on non-ICU services (n = 67) received an average of 10.6 ± 10 days, <italic>P</italic> = .08.</p>
<p>Patients were identified as “actively dying” by the use of terminology such as “end stage,” “dying,” “terminally ill,” “moribund,” “situation hopeless/grave,” and “prognosis grim” in 100 (79.4%) of 126 of cases. The first occurrence of such documentation occurred an average of 3.3 ± 4.1 (median 2) days prior to death. A “comfort care” goal was ultimately pursued for 99 (78.5%) of 126, however 35 (35.4%) of 99 continued to receive antimicrobials after a transition to comfort care for an average of 1.6 ± 1.1 days (median 1, range 1-6).</p>
<p>Among all patients who received antimicrobial therapy, 57 (45.2%) of 126 had therapy discontinued prior to death. On average, the time between antimicrobial discontinuation to death was 0.8 days ± 2.1 (median 0). Time from antimicrobial discontinuation to death did not vary based on underlying disease, type of infection, type of treatment (empiric vs culture-guided), comfort care status, or presence of an advanced care plan.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The preceding results characterize the nature of antimicrobial use among hospitalized patients with cancer near the end of life. These findings offer additional confirmation that antimicrobial treatment is common among patients with advanced cancer. Overall, we identified antimicrobial use among 87% of our patient population. More remarkable is that even when overall goals of care shifted to comfort care, the use continued in more than one third of patients. Although the issue of antimicrobial use at the end of life has been addressed by other investigators,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111432625">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111432625">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111432625">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111432625">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111432625"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111432625">14</xref>
</sup> this study is unique in its description of antimicrobial use among a cohort of patients with advanced cancer in an acute care setting.</p>
<p>Among patients receiving antimicrobials, more than half were treated empirically. The use of broad-spectrum agents was frequent, especially vancomycin (72%) and pipercillin/tazobactam (64%). Among the 91 patients who received vancomycin, only 14% had a clear microbiologic indication for use. Although some of the remaining patients may have had an acceptable indication (ie, intolerance to beta-lactam agents), the majority likely received vancomycin inappropriately. This extensive use of vancomycin is particularly notable, given focused efforts to limit inappropriate use of this agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111432625">15</xref>
</sup> Besides vancomycin-related toxicities (nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, leukopenia, etc), excess use increases the risk of acquiring resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE), as well as vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant <italic>S aureus</italic> (VISA and VRSA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111432625">16</xref>
</sup> Although we did not specifically record the presence of antimicrobial related adverse effects, we did identify 7 cases of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, a rate that is many times higher than the general inpatient population.</p>
<p>The use of parenteral antimicrobials can be considered “aggressive care” in that it requires intravenous access and drug level monitoring. Besides significant drug-related toxicities and health care costs, patients receiving antimicrobials are at increased risk of acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant organisms as well as <italic>C difficile</italic> infection. Yet, observational studies have shown that antimicrobials are withdrawn later than other aggressive interventions, including parenteral nutrition, mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and blood transfusions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111432625">9</xref>
</sup> Generally speaking, in the acute medical-surgical setting, the goals of care are usually to decrease both morbidity and mortality. If the goals of care shift to focus solely on quality of life and comfort as the death becomes imminent, the treatment of empiric and even proven infection should be carefully reevaluated.</p>
<p>Though a majority of patients in our study were noted to be actively dying at some point during their hospitalization, antimicrobials were continued until an average of 0.8 days prior to death. Although the current study is limited both by retrospective design and by sample size, we were not able to identify any specific patient-related factors, such as the presence of an advanced care plan or comfort care status, that appeared to impact the time from discontinuation of antimicrobials to death.</p>
<p>Possible reasons for the persistence of treatment include the desire to treat all potentially reversible causes, the belief that antimicrobials are part of “usual care,” and the notion that antimicrobials provide symptomatic or even symbolic comfort to patients, family members, and providers. Previous studies have shown that terminally ill patients with cancer often receive antimicrobials in hospice settings despite the absence of survival benefit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111432625">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Numerous investigators have attempted to determine whether antimicrobial therapy provides symptomatic relief at the end of life. Most of the existing literature examines patients either with cancer or advanced dementia. For patients with malignancy, apart from specific conditions such as a symptomatic UTI, treatment of infections at the end of life has not been shown to improve symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111432625">17</xref>
</sup> Although there is some evidence to suggest that antimicrobial treatment of pneumonia may provide symptomatic benefit among patients with advanced dementia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111432625">18</xref>
</sup> a recent prospective study of patients with advanced dementia and pneumonia demonstrated an association between antimicrobials and increased discomfort.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111432625">19</xref>
</sup> The treatment of pain, fever, and dyspnea with modalities such as opioids and antipyretics remain effective means of providing symptomatic benefit.<sup>

</sup> Additionally, prolongation of the dying process may be an unintended consequence of antimicrobial treatment.<sup>

<p>In our study a substantial portion of patients remained on antimicrobials after a decision to pursue comfort-oriented care was made. Though the average duration of continued therapy was brief, the continuation of antimicrobials represents a possible distraction from the focus of comfort at the end of life. Although the reasons for continuing therapy are not clear, one possibility is that providers may not want to pursue active discussions with patients’ family members or surrogates about discontinuing antimicrobials as these medications are often perceived by patients, family members, and even providers as benevolent, nonburdensome, and almost basic care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111432625">4</xref>
</sup> A discussion about withdrawing antimicrobials may be perceived as a daunting task not worth pursuing for a clinician who likely has already discussed the pros and cons of other major life-sustaining treatments such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, dialysis, or feeding tubes, for example. Rather than discussing the particulars of treatment, a more productive approach might be one focused around “goals of care.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unintended consequences of antimicrobial therapy not only include burdens to the individual patient but also extend to other patients through the possible selection of antimicrobial resistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111432625">8</xref>
</sup> For instance, previous work demonstrates that futile care in the critical care setting increases the risk of bacterial resistance<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909111432625">22</xref>
</sup> and as such, may cause harm to other patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111432625">23</xref>
</sup> Ethical decisions regarding use of antimicrobial treatment in a potentially futile situation are problematic and may require considering both duty to the individual patient as well as minimizing antimicrobial resistance globally.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909111432625">24</xref>
</sup> Given our findings, we suggest that clinicians carefully consider appropriate indications for antimicrobial use at the end of life.</p>
<p>Several limitations to our study exist, including its retrospective nature, the heterogeneity of the sample with regard to cancer diagnoses (leukemia vs solid tumors), and an inability to associate antimicrobial use with symptomatic benefits or adverse outcomes. Despite these shortcomings, our findings provide important additional confirmation of the frequent and potentially unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials among cancer patients at the end of life.</p>
<p>Additional research is needed into the factors contributing to aggressive use of antimicrobials at the end of life. Beliefs about the benefit of antimicrobials may outweigh evidence, and understanding the values that drive decision making among physicians, families, and patients specifically with regard to antimicrobial use should be examined prospectively.</p>
