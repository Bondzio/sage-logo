<title>7<sup>th</sup> April: The Second Sunday of Easter</title>
<p>The risen Lord Jesus stood among the disciples and said: “Peace be with you.”</p>
<p>Lord, we pray for peace in your world, especially remembering before you Afghanistan, Syria .……. and all places where ordinary people suffer because of armed conflict or oppression.</p>
<p>We pray for all people who live under conditions of warfare or oppression, especially the elderly, the sick, the mothers and the children. And we pray for all people everywhere who are hungry, thirsty or afraid today.</p>

<p>Jesus did not reject Thomas because he found it difficult to believe. Help us when we find belief in you difficult or impossible, give us your gift of faith, and grant that we may be among the blessed ones who come to believe even though they have not seen. Bring us Lord, to that point where like Thomas we kneel before you in adoration, whispering: My Lord and my God.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lord, hear us…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We remember before you our brothers and sisters who are unable to share in our Easter joy, because their suffering is too great, as a result of war, human cruelty, sickness or natural disaster. We also pray for all those who have not heard the message of Easter, or have not as yet been able to respond to it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lord, hear us…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a short time of silence, we bring before you Lord, all those things and people that are on our minds and close to our hearts today. …. (pause)</p>

<p>We ask your blessing on all who are sick and their families and friends. Especially we remember before you……………… and those who care for them and care about them.</p>
<p>We pray for those who mourn…. Parents whose children have died … widows and widowers who have lost a much-loved life- partner…. Families of soldiers and civilians who have lost their lives in conflicts around the world.</p>
<p>We ask you to give all grieving people your peace which is beyond anything we can understand, and the Easter hope that death is not the end.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lord, hear us…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We remember before you those who have died, especially those we have known and loved, and we pray for those who have recently died, among them …… And we remember those of our community whose year’s mind is around this time….</p>

<title>14th April: The Third Sunday of Easter</title>
<p>Jesus asked Peter if he loved him, and then asked him to feed his sheep. Lord, give us Peter's love, a love that returns to you again and again, even when, like Peter, we have denied you by the things we say and do. Forgive us for the times we have fallen away, and empower us to show our love as we feed Jesus' sheep by lovingly serving our fellow human beings, whoever they may be, and however difficult we may find the task.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lord, hear us…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We pray for your Church throughout the world. We ask that we may be led to unity, so that there will be one flock, just as we all follow the one Good Shepherd. We pray for the bishops and clergy, and all those who lead and serve your people. We pray that those whom you are calling to be pastors and ministers of your people may hear and respond to your call, and faithfully serve your Church. May they be true shepherds, seeing their calling as that of Christ, sharing his abundant life and devoting their lives to the good of their flock.</p>
<p>We pray for this congregation and for everyone that lives and works in our parish.</p>
<p>We pray for those in leadership in our church, and ask your blessing on the work of all of us in our different vocations and ministries among your people. Keep us ever mindful that we are here to serve you and our neighbours, and not ourselves.</p>

<p>We pray that those who are passing through the valley of the shadow of death may see in you the gate to eternal life, and fear no evil. We remember before you with gratitude those who have died: those we have known and loved, and those who have recently died, especially.….</p>
<p>and we pray for those who mourn their loss. We pray for parents whose children have died. And we remember before you those whose year’s mind is around this time…….</p>

<title>21<sup>st</sup> April: The Fourth Sunday of Easter</title>
<p>Today is Good Shepherd Sunday, and also Vocations Sunday.</p>
<p>Almighty God, your Son our Lord Jesus Christ came to break down the dividing walls of hostility between people. Help us to overcome our hostility and prejudice towards other people, and to break down the walls and barriers that prevent us from seeing Christ in all our brothers and sisters</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lord, hear us…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jesus is the good shepherd who lays down his life for his flock. He longs for his other sheep, the ones who are not yet in his sheepfold, to hear his voice and to be led home to him, so that there will be one flock and one shepherd. Lord, help us to play our part in bringing others to Jesus. Guide us and strengthen us, put the right words on our lips and the right attitudes and actions in our lives, so that those who meet us may be brought to you and not turned away from you because of our inadequacies.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lord, hear us…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On Vocations Sunday, we pray that those whom you are calling to be pastors and ministers of your people may hear and respond to your call, and faithfully serve your Church. May they be true shepherds, seeing their calling as that of Christ, sharing life abundantly and devoting their whole lives to the good of their flock. And we pray that we may all hear your voice calling us, and obey your call, so that we may each find our true vocation in life, the thing which you call each of us to do and to be.</p>

<p>We thank you Lord, for the gift of music, and for the work of the organists, choirs, and music groups who enhance our worship. We thank you for our bellringers and for those who take care of our churchyard and church buildings. And for all those who in many different ways contribute to the life of our community.</p>
<p>We pray for this congregation and for everyone that lives and works in our parishes.</p>

<title>28th April: The Fifth Sunday of Easter</title>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you gave us a new commandment, to love one another as you have loved us. We know that we can only begin to obey your new commandment if we rely not on our own strength, but on the power of your Holy Spirit working within us. Help us to make ourselves open to that Spirit, and let your love fill us and overflow onto all those with whom we come into contact, so that all may know that we are your disciples</p>

<p>Lord, hear us…</p>

<p>We pray for the leaders of the nations, that they may not exploit the citizens under their jurisdiction, but see them as people to be honestly governed, nurtured, and protected.</p>

<p>We pray for all those who are persecuted. And we pray for those who persecute them, asking that your Holy Spirit may convert their souls and soften their stony hearts.</p>

<p>We pray for your Church throughout the world, asking that Christians of all traditions may come to a greater understanding and respect for one another as we work together to bring the Good News of Jesus to those who do not know it yet.</p>
<p>We pray for this congregation and for everyone that lives and works in our parishes.</p>
<p>Give us courage, strength and good humour, as we try to support and serve one another and the communities in which we live. We pray for our parish priest, and ask your blessing on his work, and on the work of all of us in our different vocations and ministries among your people.</p>

<p>Lord, your son Jesus Christ came so that we might have life, and have it to the full. Give grace to us, our families and friends, and to all our neighbours; that we may live in your light and serve you through lovingly serving others. Keep us aware of Christ's risen presence dwelling within us, help us to share your peace with our fellow people, and to love as you love us.</p>
