<p>The endorsements at the front of this book use up many of the applicable adjectives for this five-volume project: ‘sweeping’, ‘pathbreaking’, ‘monumental’. This multi-volume, multi-editor endeavour is indeed impressive in its scope and in its ambition to be cross-nationally comparative across regions and regime types. The remit of the current review is more modest, covering just one of the five volumes, that on Europe. Thus, like the proverbial blind men describing different parts of the elephant, this review is fated to give only a partial picture of a massive intellectual undertaking.</p>
<p>The European volume provides an excellent overview of some of the current challenges of party politics in ten European democracies. While the chapters are divided into sections labelled ‘Western Europe’, ‘Scandinavia’ and ‘Eastern Europe’, none of the chapters in this particular volume attempt to generalize about developments in the region as a whole, or within those sub-regions. (Broader generalizations appear elsewhere in the five-volume set.) Instead, each of the chapters presents a stand-alone introduction to party politics in a single country. As such, this collection will be a valuable resource for students and scholars wanting to learn more about the development and current position of political parties in any of the countries covered in this volume.</p>
<p>The book’s Foreword notes that ‘the purpose of each chapter is to examine the relationship between political parties and democracy, providing the necessary historical, socioeconomic, and institutional context as well as the details of contemporary political tensions between the two’ (xii). The chapter authors interpret that mandate in very diverse ways. Some focus on history (for instance, chapters on Poland and Italy), some focus primarily on party systems (for instance, chapters on Germany and Hungary), while still others are concerned with more theoretical issues about the ways that parties can (and perhaps do) foster democracy (for instance, chapters on the UK and Denmark). Chapters also vary in length and in detail. A few include information on, and analyses of, recent election results (cf. France, Denmark, Hungary), while most do not. A few chapters include data about attitudes towards parties and information about party membership (cf. Spain, Norway), but most do not. Some chapters are organized around discussions of party functions, but most are not.</p>
<p>This diversity of structure and themes is not surprising. Anyone who has edited a multi-author project has considered the trade-offs between imposing a uniform chapter structure and giving authors the freedom to decide what is important about their own subject. Given the broad range of countries included in this volume, it undoubtedly made sense to forego an overly rigid framework in favour of letting expert authors define the most important issues as related to their own countries. The advantages of this choice are clear in the European volume reviewed here: the well-qualified authors are able to focus on the issues that they deem to be most important for understanding the relationship between parties and democracy in their country. Because of this, the chapters not only provide insights about political developments in each country, but also touch on country-specific scholarly controversies about those developments. This strengthens the chapters as independent contributions, and each of them makes for interesting reading. The price to pay for this somewhat eclectic approach is that it is more difficult for readers to compare developments across different countries, or to identify common themes and trends. This, however, is a price worth paying, not least because there are plenty of volumes that sacrifice detail for the sake of formulaic comparisons. This collection stands on its own merits, and the pictures it provides of party politics at the beginning of the twenty-first century will be a useful resource for today’s students and scholars. It will also likely be a valuable historical reference for future generations of party researchers.</p>
