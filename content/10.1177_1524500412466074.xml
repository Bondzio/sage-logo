<abstract>
<p>Social marketing has a long and robust history in health education and public health. Social marketing strategies are designed to promote desired behaviors in high-priority health-related areas. Most prior initiatives have utilized an “orientation to consumer needs” in program design and delivery. Traditional social marketing campaigns have targeted patients or specific segments of the public, rather than physicians and other healthcare providers, to deliver health-related messages. This commentary explores an emerging opportunity for the social marketing and medical education communities to collaborate and influence social change of medical students, interns, and residents – an “undiscovered” but influential consumer market. The authors offer a primer on the medical education environment as it relates to social marketing strategies for healthcare providers. Key themes and emerging needs in medical education are outlined. In particular, four major areas for collaboration with the social marketing community are highlighted. These include: emphasis on social accountability, use of technology in education and medical practice, alignment with changes in health care delivery, and future directions in the health care workforce. In addition, four practical strategies for meaningful collaborations between medical education and social marketing leadership are presented. The medical education environment is an ideal platform for social marketing techniques to influence the behavior of developing physicians.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social marketing has a long and robust history of application in health education and public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412466074">Andreasen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412466074">Ling, Franklin, Lindsteadt, &amp; Gearon, 1992</xref>). Social marketing strategies have been designed to promote desired behaviors in high-priority health-related areas such as cancer prevention, nutrition, family planning, prevention of cardiovascular disease, and infection control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412466074">Andreasen, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412466074">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412466074">Walsh, Rudd, Moeykens, &amp; Moloney, 1993</xref>). Most of these initiatives have utilized an “orientation to consumers’ needs” for program design and delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412466074">Lefebvre &amp; Flora, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412466074">Ling et al., 1992</xref>). Evidence suggests that consumer orientation is a key element for successful social marketing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412466074">Maibach, Rothschild, &amp; Novelli, 2002</xref>). To date, the <italic>consumer</italic> in health-related social marketing practice has largely been patients or targeted segments of the public at large. Physicians and other health care providers have been partners in program execution but are less often the target audience of social marketing practice. This commentary explores an emerging opportunity for the social marketing and medical education communities to collaborate in an effort to influence social change during the education and development of medical students, interns, and residents—an “undiscovered” but influential consumer market.</p>

<title>Social Marketing and Physicians</title>
<p>Social marketing campaigns and targeted efforts are active in countries across the globe. Many of health-related efforts involve physicians and other health care practitioners. In the United Kingdom (UK), for example, the government has funded numerous social marketing efforts including the establishment of a nonprofit National Social Marketing Centre (NSMC). The NSMC serves as a center of excellence for social marketing and behavior change in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412466074">Reynolds, 2012</xref>). Health-related social marketing efforts in the UK use several approaches. On one level, social marketing strategies leverage general practitioners and their supporting team as partners to promote broad public health programs (e.g., cervical and breast cancer screening and early detection of lung cancer). Other social marketing campaigns directly target physicians to change practice behaviors (e.g., universal hand washing procedures;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412466074">National Social Marketing Centre [NSMC], 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412466074">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412466074">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412466074">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United States (US), as in the UK, social marketing places a major emphasis on public health and educational campaigns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a leading funder of social marketing interventions that focus on priority health areas such as HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412466074">National Prevention Information Network [NPIN], 2012</xref>), obesity, nutrition, and prevention of birth defects and developmental disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412466074">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012</xref>). As in the UK, many of these campaigns seek to partner with physicians to promote screening or program implementation. Less frequently is the physician the primary target audience for any particular program.</p>

<title>Primer on the Medical Education Environment</title>
<p>Medical education in the United States has a two-tiered program of undergraduate (medical school) and graduate (residency) medical education. Programs of undergraduate medical education  are in place at 137 accredited allopathic medical schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412466074">Assocation of American Medical Colleges [AAMC], 2012</xref>) and 26 osteopathic medical schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412466074">American Osteopathic Association [AOA], 2012</xref>) across the US. Students typically complete medical school in 4 years adhering to a rigorous curriculum of basic sciences, clinical sciences, translational science, public health, patient care, and other topical areas (e.g., ethics and behavioral health). Each year more than 20,000 students graduate from accredited U.S. medical schools (AAMC, 2012; AOA, 2012).</p>
<p>In the fourth year of medical school, individuals apply for a program of graduate medical education (GME) in one of the nation’s 400 major teaching hospitals, health systems, or smaller community-based hospital settings. The first year of GME is historically referred to as <italic>internship. </italic>This is followed by two or more years of residency, at which point physicians are eligible to sit for national board certification examinations in their specialty area. Governed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, more than 113,000 physicians are currently pursuing graduate medical education in approximately 8900 programs, representing 133 specialties and subspecialties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412466074">Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), 2012</xref>). During GME training, physicians deliver clinical care to patients and receive formal education and mentorship from program faculty and other supervising physicians. GME training is also where physicians seek specialization in a medical (e.g., medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics) or surgical (e.g., orthopedics and general surgery) specialty. After completion of a general residency, some physicians pursue further subspecialized training known as a <italic>fellowship, </italic>which further develops skills and knowledge in a more focused area of the residency specialty (e.g., cardiology and endocrinology).</p>

<title>Medical Education Needs (and Social Marketing Opportunities)</title>
<p>The past decade has seen regular appeals for change in the content, processes, and delivery of medical education. A synthesis of 15 reports from 2000 to 2010 suggests 8 major themes for change in medical education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500412466074">Table 1</xref>). Of these eight themes, four have particular relevance for social marketing as an emerging influence in medical education. They include: (1) An emphasis on social accountability, (2) Use of new technology in education and medical practice, (3) Alignment with changes in the health delivery system, and (4) Future directions in the health care workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500412466074">Skochelak, 2010</xref>). These themes as they relate to social marketing are discussed next.</p>

<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148; ACA) necessitates changes to health care delivery and financing within the United States. The ACA takes steps to reduce barriers to health care for Americans and imposes new expectations for accountability and health care outcomes on physicians. Redesign of health systems, enhanced transparency in communication, shared decision making, improved preventive care, the use of multidisciplinary care teams, expanded use of electronic health records, reductions in avoidable hospital readmissions, expanded patient safety and quality activities, and improved value are a few key legislative elements within the ACA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412466074">Kocher, Emanuel, &amp; DeParle, 2010</xref>). These manifold changes translate into an acute need for changes in the design, implementation, financing, and oversight of American medical education all of which will improve the social accountability of health care in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412466074">Kocher et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenges and barriers in translating evidence from the medical literature into everyday clinical practice are well cited in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466074">David &amp; Greer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412466074">Feifer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466074">Gimbel, Olsen, Williams, &amp; Stephens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412466074">Heisler &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412466074">Morris &amp; Clarkson, 2008</xref>). Clinical practice guidelines for most major clinical conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes care and congestive heart failure) represent the most common vehicle for translating current evidence to improve the quality and safety of clinical care into practice. Barriers to clinical practice guideline adoption include organizational, workflow, financial, and individual barriers. Many of the traditional barriers to guideline adoption are relevant to a number of social marketing principles including behavior goals, customer insight, segmentation and targeting, competition, exchange, and the marketing and intervention mix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412466074">Morris &amp; Clarkson, 2008</xref>). The use of social marketing strategies to address barriers and influence physician behavior could augment guideline adoption and improve the delivery of patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466074">David &amp; Greer, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important area where social marketing could have a dramatic impact on the landscape of medicine in the United States is in the realm of workforce distribution. Currently, the number of GME positions for each medical specialty is controlled by medical education community. The need for GME positions for each specialty is dynamic and shifts based on workforce needs. Traditionally, 80% of medical school graduates pursue subspecialty training, often to help offset a large burden of educational debt. During the past several decades, shifts in market forces and student interest have led to an acute shortage of providers in primary care specialties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466074">Dorsey, Nicholson, &amp; Frist, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412466074">McDermott, 2011</xref>). With an anticipated shortage of over 22,000 primary care physicians in the next 10 years, professional societies, academics, and policy makers have appealed for methods and strategies to support the redistribution and recruitment of physician trainees into primary care specialties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412466074">AAMC, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466074">Dorsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412466074">McDermott, 2011</xref>). Changes in the prestige and desirability of different medical specialties could be potentially improved by the application of social marketing strategies in medical education (AAMC, 2008). Social marketing strategies also apply to the use of other health care practitioners (nurses, physician assistants, and allied health professionals) in the context of the Patient Centered Medical Home to promote, distribute, and equilibrate the delivery of primary care across broad populations.</p>

<title>Social Marketing in Medical Education—Published Research</title>
<p>In a 2001 commentary, David and Greer promoted the application of social marketing to medical education. Social marketing could be used to change consumer and physician behavior, address challenges in the translation of evidence into practice, and improve the effectiveness of traditional didactic lectures in medical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466074">David &amp; Greer, 2001</xref>). The authors also called for a systematic evaluation of social marketing in the context of medical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466074">David &amp; Greer, 2001</xref>). Despite this appeal, just two manuscripts related to social marketing and medical education have appeared in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The first study showed that first year medical students exposed to an educational intervention with social marketing elements significantly increased their comfort level in developing a health education brochure for patients with diverse health literacy backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412466074">Primack, Bui, &amp; Fertman, 2007</xref>). In this study, social marketing was not used in an interventional sense to directly persuade student behavior. In the second study, our research team conducted a clustered quasi-randomized control social marketing-based intervention involving third year medical students (<italic>n</italic> = 155). The study involved a simulated outpatient clinical encounter between an established physician educator and asthmatic patient. Participating students were asked to document the encounter using an electronic medical record (EMR). The intervention involved a series of embedded social marketing messages using both behavior-seeking and behavior-avoiding prompts delivered by the physician educator. The primary outcome measure was student use of the preferred evidence-based asthma EMR template to document the simulated case. Following this brief intervention, students in the experimental group were four times more likely to use the desired template than controls. This behavior persisted 30 days later, in a repeat documentation activity without additional intervention, where the experimental group students were 2.5 times more likely to use the desired template than control group students. Under these controlled conditions, a social marketing-based intervention significantly influenced medical student behavior in the desired direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466074">Gimbel et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for Social Marketing in Modern Medical Education</title>
<sec id="section7-1524500412466074">
<title>The Nexus of Need and Opportunity</title>
<p>Using the social marketing concepts of consumer orientation and mutual fulfillment of self-interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412466074">Maibach et al., 2002</xref>), there are multiple themed areas for potential collaboration between the social marketing and the medical education communities:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Adoption and use of new technologies (Electronic Health Records—EHRs) in medical education and clinical practice: Evidence suggests that widespread implementation and physician use of EHRs has been slow to gain traction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412466074">Jha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524500412466074">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). This is partly due to lack of physician understanding of how EHR technology can improve practice management, clinical quality, and patient safety. It is also partly due to the fact that physicians often view mandatory EHR documentation as “additional work.” When introducing EHR technology, it is particularly difficult to modify the behavior of well-established physicians. An alternative, or complementary, strategy is to introduce EHRs and other health-related technologies during undergraduate and graduate medical education where physician behaviors are more adaptable. There is currently no optimal strategy for when and how to introduce technology in medical education, thus offering a robust opportunity for collaborative research with social marketing researchers. Given that technology use is not typically evaluated in medical education or as part of board certification or licensing requirements, the social marketing principle of <italic>exchange </italic>might apply here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412466074">Morris &amp; Clarkson, 2008</xref>). Specifically, using social marketing approaches to promote the “attractive benefits” of learning to use technology early in the physicians’ development as compared to the added “costs” of cramming an additional topic into an already crowded academic schedule.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Innovative approaches to encourage physicians to adopt clinical practice guidelines and other evidence into clinical practice: Barriers to adoption of clinical practice guidelines and other practice improvements are linked with physician behavior and willingness to change. Social marketing is a fresh approach to behavior modification in clinical practice if physicians are viewed as the primary consumers. Targeted social marketing campaigns have an established history of successful behavior modification. One contemporary example is the Image Gently<sup>SM</sup> campaign designed to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure in diagnostic pediatric imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524500412466074">Sidhu et al., 2009</xref>). The target audience for the campaign (consumer) is pediatricians and family physicians who care for the majority of American children. Another example is our study with EHR clinical documentation in medical students. These examples indicate that social marketing can be used to promote translation of evidence-based tools into clinical practice. Social marketing principles can also shape guideline <italic>promotion</italic>, including audience segmentation and enlisting opinion leaders as advocates for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412466074">Frank &amp; Danoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500412466074">Siriwardena, Middlemass, Ward, &amp; Wilkinson, 2008</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Expanded social accountability: There have been numerous calls to promote social accountability in the medical education community. Examples include the social contract inherent in medical practice, the need to promote professionalism, and the need to increase diversity in the medical workforce. Medical schools often struggle to design and deliver these curricular elements and could benefit from social marketing. New curricula are more likely to be embraced when oriented around the needs and wants of the students. Social marketing can be used to promote shared gains to promote core elements of accountability and public trust in medical education.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Innovative approaches to promote workforce distribution in primary care and other critical specialties: The medical education community has struggled to fill training positions in all physician specialties with U.S. medical school graduates. This shortage is particularly acute in primary care. Educators and administrators involved with diversity and recruiting efforts for medical schools could benefit from social marketing insights into audience segmentation, consumer orientation, and understanding the marketing mix (e.g., price, product, place, and promotion). Social marketing could help develop recruiting strategies and advise policy that shapes incentives and funding opportunities. For instance, social marketers could partner with medical educators in developing a targeted campaign to promote primary care opportunities. They could also advise policy by leveraging the principle of <italic>price</italic>. Specifically, social marketers could advise medical education policy makers on strategies for removing financial barriers (e.g., equitable pay during residency), aligning financial incentives with societal interests, and offering financial incentives for entry into priority specialties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466074">Dorsey et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Social marketing, social media and redesign of medical school curriculum: Social marketing offers an opportunity to reform traditional pedagogical approaches employed in undergraduate medical education. Lecture-based sessions are traditionally the most commonly used modality for the transfer of educational material in medical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466074">David &amp; Greer, 2001</xref>). While efficient for managing large group education, lectures are also felt to be less effective in terms of retention and educational effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500412466074">Stephens, McKenna, &amp; Carrington, 2011</xref>). Social media represent an interesting and evolving complement to traditional educational modalities. Social marketing techniques involving social media may help improve the understanding of needs, desires, and learning strategies of contemporary medical students. This may also help create a more supportive and nurturing learning environment that emphasizes student well-being. Social marketers may help (1) promote positive student emotions, (2) facilitate student engagement, (3) encourage development and maintenance of strong relationships, (4) aid students in their discovery of meaning in their work, and (5) encourage celebration of achievement. These five attributes have been tied to transforming medical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412466074">Slavin, Hatchett, Chibnall, Schindler, &amp; Fendell, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>The social marketing principle of <italic>product</italic> to meet audience needs can also be applied here. When redesigning educational programs, predesign formative research could be conducted to capture audience needs assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412466074">Davis et al., 1999</xref>) and feedback from pilot testing used to modify the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412466074">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). These strategies also apply to the principle of <italic>place</italic> as implementers choose where to deliver training, which could include computer-mediated options that can be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412466074">Maloney et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Practical Strategies for Engaging Medical Education Leadership</title>
<p>Medical schools, academic health centers (teaching hospitals), and community-based graduate medical education programs are often housed in large institutions with boundaries that can be difficult to penetrate. Thoughtful preparation for engagement of social marketing would likely enhance the odds of establishing meaningful collaborations with medical education professionals. We offer the following recommendations:</p>
<sec id="section9-1524500412466074">
<title>Recommendation #1</title>
<p>Seek out innovators and faculty who embrace multidisciplinary research. Certain disciplines and fields of science are more open and receptive to multidisciplinary research and contribution of novel approaches to tackling problems than others. When approaching medical education leadership and faculty members, one might identify innovators and those who embrace multidisciplinary research. Establishing individual faculty member collaborations can prove fruitful when approaching institutions and programs, regarding collaborative projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524500412466074">
<title>Recommendation #2</title>
<p>Begin dialogue with topics related to medical education needs or medical faculty member research (practicing consumer orientation) but also of mutual interest to you. If you act on recommendation #1 above, and engage with novel concepts and ideas likely of interest to the medical targeted faculty member, your conversation will likely prove useful. But do so only if you are interested and willing to follow up with action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524500412466074">
<title>Recommendation #3</title>
<p>Be prepared to present evidence on how social marketing applications have been efficacious in behavior modification. Social marketing, as a framework for behavior modification in health (individual and public), has matured over the last quarter century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412466074">Andreasen, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412466074">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500412466074">Maibach, Abroms, &amp; Marosits, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412466074">Walsh et al., 1993</xref>). In addition to refinement of early concepts, there has been mounting evidence that under certain conditions social marketing-based interventions can demonstrate significant positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466074">Gimbel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412466074">Ling et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412466074">Quinn, Ellery, Thomas, &amp; Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500412466074">Thackeray &amp; Neiger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412466074">Wilson, Petticrew, Calnan, &amp; Mazareth, 2010</xref>). When approaching medical education leaders and faculty, be prepared to cite evidence of conditions and applications where social marketing was effective in behavior modification. Evidence is likely to enhance your credibility in discussions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524500412466074">
<title>Recommendation #4</title>
<p>Consider an iterative approach to collaboration starting with small projects aimed at proof-of concept. As is the case with most scientific endeavors, success in collaborative research with members of the medical education community is more likely to be realized over time. Initial investment in small projects that can be completed in a relatively short period of time with positive outcomes will produce a firm foundation for larger scale projects and serve as proof-of-concept.</p>
<sec id="section13-1524500412466074">
<title>Implications for Broader Health Professions</title>
<p>While we do not offer evidence on the effectiveness of social marketing applications in education beyond medical education, it is possible they may have utility in broader health professions educational programs (e.g., nursing, pharmacy, and physical therapy), which face similar constraints and pressures. University-based social marketing experts should consider reaching across to the broader health professions where mutual interests may align.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1524500412466074">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>During the past quarter century, social marketing in the health domain has been leveraged in public health goals (e.g., cancer prevention and infection control) where the intervention has targeted patients or other consumers. We posit that social marketing could be an effective strategy if refocused inward where the physicians and their support staff become the consumers. Furthermore, the medical education environment is an opportune place to embrace social marketing strategies aimed at influencing the behavior of developing physicians before they become entrenched in their own clinical practice and workflow. There is substantial opportunity for the social marketing community to collaborate with colleagues in medical education. Together we can influence social change and advance science.</p>
