<body>
<p>People should read this book by Thomas Ogden when they are young. The drawback of reading it at my age is the gnawing feeling that for too many years one has been reading the psychoanalytic literature the wrong way. For Ogden, reading is anything but a passive act of absorbing an author’s ideas. Instead, reading is creatively interactive, so that germinal ideas in the text are able to sprout and grow in the reader’s mind. Atypically in our neophilic era, Ogden still values psychoanalytic classics written by our forebears. He sets a worthy model of returning to those classics again and again. Here he discusses classic papers by Freud, Isaacs, Fairbairn, Winnicott, Bion, Loewald, and Searles.</p>
<p>One of Ogden’s most illuminating chapters is devoted to Winnicott’s 1945 article “Primitive Emotional Development.” Ogden’s first paragraph captures a unique feature of his method of reading:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because style and content are so interdependent in his writing, [Winnicott’s] papers are not well served by a thematic reading aimed exclusively at gleaning what the paper is “about.” Such efforts often result in trivial aphorisms. Winnicott, for the most part, does not use language to arrive at conclusions; rather, he uses language to create experiences in reading which are inseparable from the ideas he is presenting—or, more accurately, the ideas he is playing with [p. 76].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ogden implies that Winnicott’s articles include a crucial feature of “ring composition” in literature—the central idea occurs in the middle of the article. He also finds in Winnicott’s writing a “speaking voice [that] gives itself permission to wander, and yet has the compactness of poetry. . . . it has a disarming intimacy” (p. 77). Startlingly, Ogden maintains that the impact of Winnicott’s writing arises from his capacity “to understand (to correctly interpret the unconscious of) the reader” (p. 82). This perspective complements Ogden’s bold project of interpreting the unconscious of Winnicott and the other analysts whose writings he discusses.</p>
<p>Ogden enters into fascinating conversations with his authors. He elaborates points he believes are implicit in the text, but possibly not fully conscious for its author. As he explains, “I am far more interested in what these authors knew, but did not know they knew—in how these texts are rich in ways their authors did not consciously intend or understand” (p. 3). A central example from Ogden’s reading of Fairbairn is his surmise that “the infant’s effort to transform unsatisfactory objects into satisfactory objects—thus reversing the imagined toxic effect on the mother of the infant’s love—is the single most important motivation sustaining the structure of the internal object world. And that structure, when externalized, underlies all pathological object relationships” (p. 63). Ogden is a gifted thinker who explicitly shares with us such examples of his side of the conversation with his texts. And he acknowledges that “you, the reader, will have to judge for yourself whether my extensions of Fairbairn’s ideas [and, presumably, of the ideas of the other analysts he discusses] are, indeed, consistent with Fairbairn’s thinking, and whether they enrich or detract from his contribution” (p. 5).</p>
<p>Searles is the only living writer to whom Ogden devotes a chapter. Knowing Searles (and having coauthored an article with him), I feel confident he would be deeply grateful to Ogden for his admiring engagement with this unique work. The chapter begins with the following praise: “No other analytic writer, to my mind, rivals Searles in his ability to capture in words his observations concerning his emotional response to what is occurring in the analytic relationship and his use of these observations in his effort to understand and interpret the transference-countertransference” (p. 157). Of Searles’s 1959 “Oedipal Love in the Countertransference,” Ogden writes, “Searles has a distinctive way of thinking and working analytically which might be thought of as a process of ‘turning experience inside out.’ By this I mean that Searles transforms what had been an invisible and yet felt presence, an emotional context, into psychological content about which the patient may be able to think and speak” (p. 158). Searles, in Ogden’s opinion, emphasizes the parent’s reciprocal romantic love for the oedipal child more than Freud did. Ogden notes that thirty-one years later, in the 1990 “Unconscious Identification,” Searles is “now wiser, more artful in his work, more keenly aware of his limitations. . . . The effect of Searles’ paring away of theory to its absolute minimum is the creation of an experience in reading that is akin to that of reading fine literature: emotional situations and the characters involved in these situations are allowed to speak for themselves” (p. 169). I was in supervision with Searles at the time he wrote that paper, so I can attest to how clinically useful its ideas were to me.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of Helen Vendler’s close reading of Shakespeare’s sonnets, Ogden’s close reading of Searles uncovers nuances of word choice and sequence of clinical description that allow the reader’s experience to mirror Searles’s experience with his patients. “Reading his work is not an experience of arriving at an understanding: it is an experience of being rudely woken up to disconcerting truths about one’s experience with one’s patients” (p. 164). Ogden plausibly speculates that Searles’s failure to protect the reader from the immediacy of such disconcerting truths helps explain “the intense anger Searles was notorious for eliciting from audiences” (p. 164).</p>
<p>Ogden finds a complementarity between Searles’s clinical work and Bion’s theoretical contributions. Ogden refers in passing to Bion’s personal reticence, which Ogden sees as “an effort to safeguard the sanctity of his privacy” (p. 135). This contrasts sharply with Ogden’s respect for Searles’s “unprecedented” (p. 159) self-disclosure (before it was in vogue, I might add)—his willingness to “[lay] bare his own unconscious experience” (p. 157) in the service of better understanding the patient’s unconscious communications.</p>
<p>Ogden makes intriguing points about what he calls Searles’s failure to integrate his clinical writing with more abstract theory. Ogden’s observations are plausible. They led me, though, to ponder another possibility—that the unique quality of Searles’s genius that Ogden so generously recognizes might depend on Searles’s capacity to free himself from a level of psychoanalytic theory whose very abstractness can deaden and defend against our receptivity to unconscious processes in the patient.</p>
<p>Ogden presents Freud’s 1917 “Mourning and Melancholia” as paradigmatic of Freud’s “new way of thinking about human experience that gave rise to nothing less than a new form of human subjectivity” (p. 11). Ogden sees Freud’s language in this paper as more revealing of his model of the mind than his “explicit theoretical statements” (p. 16)—Freud writes as though his understanding of the mind keeps expanding as he is in the process of writing the paper. Ogden believes that many commentators have missed the significance of Freud’s thesis that “what differentiates the melancholic from the mourner is the fact that the melancholic all along has been able to engage only in narcissistic forms of object relationship” (p. 24).</p>
<p>Ogden’s extraordinarily close readings generate many of his arresting insights. Thus, it is all the more surprising that, despite his cogent comments on the centrality of writing style (“I treat writing style and ideational content as two qualities of a single entity” [p. 7]), he writes that “it is beyond the scope of this paper to address questions relating to the quality of [Strachey’s] translation” (p. 13). There has been much debate about the shortcomings of Strachey’s translation of Freud, and Ogden is surely aware that even the best translation can never adequately duplicate an author’s style.</p>
<p>Ogden observes that “virtually every word in the opening sentence [of the 1917 paper] has acquired in Freud’s hands new meanings and a new set of relationships . . . to practically every other word in the sentence . . .” (p. 13). This observation is even more true than Ogden seems to realize. That opening sentence begins with “dreams” and ends with “mourning”—“<italic>Trau</italic>m” and “<italic>Trau</italic>er” in the original. Echoes of “Trauer” (“grief” is probably a better translation than “mourning”) resonate throughout Freud’s paper, perhaps reflecting unconscious priming, if not Freud’s conscious word choices. In the paper, Freud uses the verbs “trust” and “credit” (“ver<italic>trau</italic>en” and “zu<italic>trau</italic>en”). “Trauer” evokes not only “Traum” but “Trauma” (the latter is spelled the same in German as in English); Freud uses the adjective “traumatic” (“traumatischen”) in this paper. “Trauer” also evokes the verb “trauen,” meaning to trust; to dare; and to marry.</p>
<p>As Ogden might say, Freud enacts the way grief pervades the thoughts of the mourner in his word choices here. Since Ogden encourages us to observe Freud’s mind at work as he writes, we at least need to remind ourselves of the fascinating examples of Freud’s linguistic associations in German that we lose when we read Freud in translation.</p>
<p>One of Ogden’s brilliant discussions of “analytic style” is in the somewhat jarring context of his weakest chapter—his exegesis of Bion’s published comments at a clinical seminar. Jarring because instead of just speculating about what the writer really meant even if unaware of it, in this chapter Ogden speculates about what Bion may have been thinking about the minds of both the patient being presented to him and the presenter, whether or not either was aware of what Ogden believes he (or Bion) knows about them.</p>
<p>The more ambiguous the external stimulus, the more we learn about the mind of the commentator on the actual or figurative inkblot in question. This always constitutes an aspect of the text’s power to engage readers, and to enter into implicit dialogue with them. In the case of Ogden, what we can learn about <italic>his</italic> mind is always worth knowing. For example, Ogden comments in this chapter, “The analyst’s ability to speak with humility from the uniqueness of his personality . . . lies at the core of what I am calling the analyst’s style. . . . style is the opposite of fashion; it is also the opposite of narcissism” (pp. 128–129). That is a profound insight indeed, one that is much needed as an antidote to both excessive theoretical “fashions” and excessive narcissism in analytic work.</p>
<p>Ogden’s discussion of Loewald’s 1979 paper “The Waning of the Oedipus Complex” perceptively highlights the way in which the child figuratively does murder his parents; but then “he bestows upon them a form of immortality” (p. 150) by internalizing them into his superego. Ogden omits a feature of the Oedipus myth that Freud too neglected: the crime of pedophilia for which Laius was being punished by later fathering a son who would kill him. Ogden emphasizes that Loewald is referring “not to actual incest.” In fact, in a PEP-Web search for Ogden’s use of the term “sexual abuse,” I found but one instance. And that was in the context of his criticism of an analyst and his patient for being in the “the odd (but not at all uncommon) state of mind in which they seem to be hoping to unearth evidence of sexual abuse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113486293">Ogden 2002</xref>, p. 1009). That patient’s father was an alcoholic who squeezed the adult patient’s nipples in social situations. Ogden does refer to “the ferocious ties of the abused child and the battered spouse to their abusers” in the present book (p. 26). Still, I am disappointed that Ogden has no more to say (that I have found) about an etiological factor that has been shamefully avoided by all too many psychoanalysts.</p>
<p>Given Ogden’s immense reputation and wide influence in our field, every reader will wish that Ogden would have highlighted points of special meaning to that reader. I found myself wishing, for example, that Ogden had shown more interest in the topics of dissociation and self states. In his careful reading of Winnicott’s article, he fails to mention that Winnicott has an entire section with the subheading “Dissociation.” But in that same chapter, Ogden alludes in a footnote to what we might call a writing self state: “The act of writing seems to have a life of its own” (p. 87n). In his discussion of Fairbairn, Ogden does not tell us how influenced Fairbairn was by his clinical experience treating what we now call dissociative identity disorder, or that Fairbairn’s M.D. thesis was titled “The Relationship of Dissociation and Repression.”</p>
<p>I am delighted that Ogden often turns to creative literature for illustrations. So, as one possible instance of self states, we might think of Hamlet contradicting himself to Ophelia, telling her “I did love you once” (III.i.125) and then, in his next lines, “I loved you not.” If an actor believes Hamlet is expressing two conflicting self states in these lines, he might plausibly recite the second statement as “<bold><italic>I</italic></bold> loved you not.”</p>
<p>Ogden presents a fascinating case to illustrate Bion’s influence on his clinical work. Paradoxically, he underscores “the patient’s feeling that I could hurt him deeply by not being truthful with him, by playing the role of analyst . . .” (p. 111) when this unusual patient apparently never retracted his statement in the first telephone call that he did not want analysis. Could the patient, having nonetheless agreed to use the couch in the second or third session, and having accepted daily sessions after a few months, reflect a conflict between the self state that made the initial call, and other self states that emerged once treatment was under way? In any event, Ogden handled this case masterfully. Ogden comes close to acknowledging self states in referring to Bion’s concept of the nonpsychotic part of one patient as “an aspect of personality that is both unconscious and capable of thinking” (p. 130).</p>
<p>As Ogden closely examines articles by the seven analysts he has chosen to discuss, he also makes intriguing observations about their opinions of one another. So his dialogues with these authors become group conversations. For example, he shows how Isaacs’s earlier dismissive comment about Fairbairn evolved into a subsequent reference that, Ogden believes, may have been influenced by her reaction to a later article of Fairbairn’s. He also explores Fairbairn’s view of Freud’s “Mourning and Melancholia” (the subject of Ogden’s first chapter).</p>
<p>The book ends abruptly. It makes one ponder why Ogden did not write any summary or conclusion. Perhaps he meant to leave more space for readers to create their own synthesis. I am deeply appreciative of Ogden’s intellectually bracing book, which will enrich his readers’ clinical work, and help them read the psychoanalytic literature in new and more fruitful ways.</p>
