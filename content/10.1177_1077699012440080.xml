<abstract>
<p>This study examines the concepts of perceptual bias and willingness to self-censor (WTSC) to ascertain which factors would influence college newspaper editors’ comfort levels with controversial material. Data from 189 matched pairs of college newspaper editors revealed that editors underestimated advisers’ comfort levels and that those erroneous estimations were predictive of the editors’ comfort levels. In addition, while adviser WTSC was not predictive of editors’ comfort levels on several controversial topics, editors’ WTSC did predict the editors’ comfort with the material.</p>

<body>
<p>College newspaper editors often square off against administrators, faculty members, and other students regarding what a college newspaper should and should not cover. The results of publishing material deemed controversial can be problematic to those papers.</p>
<p>For example, editors at the <italic>Fairfield Mirror</italic> on the campus of Fairfield University were chastised by the administration for publishing a column regarding the <italic>walk of shame</italic>, a term used to describe an early morning walk home after sex at someone else’s residence. University officials said it was possible that the school would cancel the paper’s contract, essentially censoring the paper through financial means.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012440080">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the University of California, Riverside, almost twelve hundred copies of the <italic>Highlander</italic> disappeared from campus. The newspaper had reported that a student government official, who spent more than $5,000 to fly herself and an intern to a conference, was not authorized to attend the conference, nor was she authorized to make the expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012440080">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, while some student editors are cowed by retaliatory actions, others are emboldened by them. For example, in April 2008, almost eight thousand copies of the <italic>Ball State Daily News</italic> were stolen from the racks on the Muncie, Indiana, campus. Officials at the paper speculated that the theft was related to a story about the arrest of a women’s soccer player.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012440080">3</xref></sup> The editors at the paper reran the entire issue as an insert to the next day’s paper, complete with an editorial titled, “Nice try. We’re still here.”</p>
<p>Even in the face of heavy-handed administrative efforts, some student journalists continue to publish important material that is controversial. The staff of the <italic>Northwest Trail</italic> at Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, earned the 2010 College Press Freedom Award for pursuing controversial stories that mattered to their readers. The adviser of the paper, Ron Feemster, was fired after he encouraged students to pursue these types of stories. Even after Feemster was fired, the students continued their reporting on questionable sports recruiting practices and faculty pay equity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012440080">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question for this study was what makes some editors more comfortable in producing material that can stoke controversy and lead to dire consequences while other editors shy away from it. This study posits that a few key factors are likely at play when it comes to editors’ comfort level: their internal fear of what might happen to them, their perception of how the media outlet’s adviser might react, and the journalistic environment created by the adviser.</p>
<p>This study was conducted to ascertain which factors were the strongest predictors of the editors’ comfort levels with controversial material. First, the study examines the issue through the lens of self-censorship. Scholars have posited that an individual’s willingness to self-censor is an intrinsic trait that can be measured accurately and can adequately predict an individual’s comfort level when it comes to dealing with public disapproval.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012440080">5</xref></sup> Using this theory to guide this research, the analysis herein outlines to what degree an intrinsic self-censoring mechanism might limit an editor’s comfort level with controversial material.</p>
<p>Second, the study assessed to what degree perceptual bias plays a role in predicting an editor’s decision. In most research in this area, individuals perceive themselves to be in some way better than a nebulous group of “others.” To that end, they tend to skew the ratings of various outcomes based on that self-serving bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012440080">6</xref></sup> This study questioned to what degree an editor’s sense of how an adviser would feel about material could influence his or her own sense of comfort with the topic. This study helps codify research in this area and addresses the issue of how a “known” other might impact this bias.</p>
<p>This study is important from a theoretical standpoint because of its focus on both willingness to self-censor and on self-versus-others bias. By assessing which items might be more predictive, one can ascertain if both theories can adequately and simultaneously predict a specific outcome, namely, comfort with controversial material. While both theories have dealt with this possibility, they have not been tested in this way before.</p>
<p>In addition, while most of the third-person perception research uses a broad group of others as a point of comparison, this study focuses specifically on a known quantity (viz., the editors’ advisers) and presents data from them, too. Self-versus-other bias research has often been dependent on a sense that an individual is better than an unknown at-large population. With a more known group, the bias gap tends to shrink. In this instance, the known individual will likely be extremely familiar to the student editor and should likely have more journalistic experience and knowledge than the editor. The direct comparison of the adviser’s comfort level, the student’s comfort level, and the student’s perception of the adviser’s comfort level shows whether the bias gap remains high due to lack of interpersonal congruity or is diminished through high personal contact. In other words, while studies that examine bias of this kind often measure data from participants and their perceptions of others, very little if any research has actually measured the “others” for the sake of comparison.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-1077699012440080">
<title>Willingness to Self-Censor</title>
<p>For years, self-censorship was viewed as an extrinsic trait, in which the climate of public opinion determined to what degree an individual would speak out. Noelle-Neumann’s spiral of silence theory argued that individuals gain a “quasi-statistical sense” of the climate of public opinion before they speak out. If their position is perceived to be in the majority, they tend to speak out, while if they perceive their opinion to be in the minority, they remain silent. As a result, the theory states, a unified public opinion appears to emerge as minority opinions remain unexpressed. The underlying presumption of scholars is that fear of social isolation leads individuals in the minority to self-censor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012440080">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research has found qualified support for this position. In public opinion studies regarding national separatist groups,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012440080">8</xref></sup> gays in the military,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012440080">9</xref></sup> affirmative action,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012440080">10</xref></sup> media coverage of war,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012440080">11</xref></sup> and biotechnology,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012440080">12</xref></sup> researchers have demonstrated that some portions of the theory hold while others do not. A meta-analysis found weak support for the supposition that the perception of public opinion correlated with one’s own willingness to express an opinion on a given topic. The authors posited that the desire to speak out or remain silent was more likely to be an intrinsic trait than a reaction to public opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012440080">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a series of studies, Hayes and his colleagues developed a tool to measure an intrinsic form of self-censorship. The Willingness to Self-Censor (WTSC) scale is an eight-item index that captures an individual’s reticence to speak out on a topic. The authors found that individuals who scored higher on this scale were more likely to worry about communicating in a hostile climate, more concerned about what others thought about them, and lower in self-esteem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012440080">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In validating the scale, the authors found that participants in their study were more likely to speak out when facing those who held an opinion congruent with their own. However, they also found that those who scored higher on the WTSC scale were more likely to be limited by a hostile environment than those who scored lower on the scale, thus reinforcing the notion of this as an intrinsic trait. A follow-up study involving nonparticipation in a polarized political environment also supported this notion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012440080">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies have found this approach to self-censorship useful in examining issues of political correctness and individualized censoring behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012440080">16</xref></sup> covering controversial social issues within a classroom,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012440080">17</xref></sup> and discussing political issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012440080">18</xref></sup> In addition, researchers have begun to question the degree to which sanctions for speaking out and the issue of communication format can factor into a self-censoring decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012440080">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the realm of media, the premise of self-censorship has also been gaining ground. A study of high school newspaper advisers found that participants’ self-reported levels of comfort with controversial topics were significantly predicted by their ratings on the WTSC scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012440080">20</xref></sup> A follow-up study found that this pattern held true with college media advisers as well. What makes this significant is that college advisers are often given greater levels of support and freedom regarding the publication of material, while high school advisers are often forced to censor material. To that end, the environmental milieu appears to be less of a predictor than the internal need to self-censor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012440080">21</xref></sup> In addition, a study by Reineke found a significant correlation between an individual’s own self-censorship ratings and the individual’s desire to censor others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012440080">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Researchers have examined WTSC using various mitigating variables. For example, Hayes, Glynn, and Shanahan controlled for dispositional shyness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012440080">23</xref></sup> Filak and Reinardy controlled for the “quasi-statistical sense” of how a direct superior would feel about the coverage of a controversial topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012440080">24</xref></sup> Filak, Reinardy, and Maksl also controlled for job enjoyment and fear of reprisal when assessing the scale and its predictive ability for high school newspaper advisers feeling comfortable with the coverage of a controversial topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012440080">25</xref></sup> In the end, none of these control variables undermined the significant predictive power of the WTSC variable.</p>

<title>Self-versus-Others Perceptual Bias</title>
<p>The sense of an individual’s own values, fears, risks, and rewards being somehow different from how they believe others will address those topics has been at the core of media and social psychology literature for decades. This study focuses on two paradigms in addressing this issue: biased optimism and the third-person effect.</p>
<p>Weinstein has reported that self-serving evaluations tend to lead individuals to feel way superior to others and thus react out of concern for those unknown others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012440080">26</xref></sup> Others have noted that individuals derive self-worth from protecting their self-esteem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012440080">27</xref></sup> Thus, when faced with a situation in which they would be viewed negatively as “just like everyone else,” they would likely protect themselves by projecting a sense of inferiority onto a larger societal whole.</p>
<p>Research in the area of health and optimistic bias has shown that “others” were viewed to be at a greater risk than study participants in contracting AIDS,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012440080">28</xref></sup> developing cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012440080">29</xref></sup> and falling victim to substance abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012440080">30</xref></sup> From a social perspective, the bias has been shown to differentiate participants’ views on the harms associated with risky sexual behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012440080">31</xref></sup> patronizing adult entertainment clubs,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012440080">32</xref></sup> and criminal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012440080">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Davison’s seminal work on mass media influence gave rise to the third-person effect as a way to explain discrepancies in how people view themselves and others. The theory states that people have an inherent tendency to view themselves as different than others when examining the influence they believe a message will create. In most cases, the individual believes himself or herself to be less susceptible to messages, particularly those in the media, than are other people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012440080">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Davison’s 1983 discussion of this effect began with a notation that Japanese leaflets that told black soldiers not to risk their lives for the white man appeared to have little impact on the soldiers, but instead galvanized the white officers to substantially reshuffle personnel for fear that the leaflets <italic>would</italic> have an impact. The “four small experiments” Davison followed up with indicated that in terms of voting for a gubernatorial candidate, the impact of commercials on children, the influence the New Hampshire primary had on presidential preference, and the impact Ronald Reagan’s “hawkish” approach to foreign policy would have on their votes, participants consistently stated that they would be less influenced than a group of unknown others.</p>
<p>Work in this area has demonstrated that the third-person effect manifests itself in various formats and in various circumstances. In his examination of pornography, Gunther found that study participants saw themselves as less adversely impacted by indecent material than other people were.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012440080">35</xref></sup> The study also found that the larger the gap between self and other, the more support was shown for pornography restrictions.</p>
<p>Wei, Lo, and Lu examined the third-person effect and its impact during news coverage of a food recall scare. Individuals reported the influence of the news as greater on others than themselves but also found that the more credible the news source appeared to be, the smaller the self–other gap was. Furthermore, the researchers found a positive predictive outcome between perceived effect on one’s self and intention to take proactive behavior regarding the food recall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012440080">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chia noted in several studies of body image that individuals perceived that media portrayals of an idealized body would have a greater impact on their peers than themselves. However, in an examination of the impact of social distance, Chia and Wen noted that while the self–other gap was significant between male participants and generalized female peers, no significant differences were found between the male participants and their male peers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012440080">37</xref></sup> A previous study of women in Singapore yielded similar results, prompting Chia to note that friends of the same gender in these studies were helped by in-group bias and a narrowing social distance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012440080">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Huge, Glynn, and Jeong noted that the third-person effect often hypothesizes differences based on unknown or nebulous others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012440080">39</xref></sup> The authors argued that the use of general geographical (other Americans) or social (other students at this university) distinctions may inflate the gap between self and other, simply because the participant is viewing these others as vague and unknown, as opposed to specific and known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012440080">40</xref></sup> Additional work in regard to parent/child relationships has shown support for the third-person perception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012440080">41</xref></sup> Hoffner and Buchanan, for example, found parents’ responses regarding support for censorship of violent television programs was linked to the perceived effects of televised violence and concerns regarding their own and other children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012440080">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other researchers have used a two-stream approach, drawing literature from both theories to examine the issue of perceptual bias as it pertains to troublesome topics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012440080">43</xref></sup> Lo and Wei used biased optimism and third-person effect to predict a self–other gap regarding the impact that patronizing adult entertainment clubs would have on participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012440080">44</xref></sup> Chapin linked the perceptual aspects of the third-person effect and optimistic bias to predict the perceptions school children had regarding school violence risks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012440080">45</xref></sup> In his study, Chapin argued that optimistic bias is “a promising explanation” for third-person perceptions and that while third-person perception can be attributed to media usage, the underlying concept of self–other relationships within the third-person effect literature can be more broadly applied.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, these studies suggest that the self–other relationship leads to an overestimation of one’s own skills in dealing with difficult or problematic information while simultaneously leading that person to create restrictive or negative outcomes in hopes of “protecting” the disadvantaged “others.” Also, the familiarity an individual has with an “other” will lead to variations in self/other gap and subsequent actions the individual will take, although the direction of the action and the outcomes attained appear to be variable, based on several factors.</p>
<p>To that end, this study examines the degree to which each of the aforementioned approaches influences an important outcome, namely, a student editor’s comfort level in running controversial material. Editors who are compelled to act or not act based on their intrinsic WTSC will be unlikely to alter their approach to controversial material, thus leading to a news operation that is more or less intrinsically repressive when it comes to these topics. Conversely, editors behaving based on a self-versus-other perceptual bias will likely find themselves limiting coverage of important controversial topics based on fear of how an “other” might view their actions. In some cases, they might fear publishing content that would be counter to the values or comforts of an important other (the adviser). In some of the cases noted above, self-censorship and reticence to publish controversial material could be seen as a protective act; the editor might assume the adviser would be fearful of administrative repercussions as a result of the published material and thus curb his or her desire to run the material to shelter the adviser from the fallout. Unlike WTSC, perceptual bias can be situational or otherwise influenced by additional variables.</p>
<p>This study draws from both optimistic bias and third-person perception literature to examine perceptual bias. In using these two theories as a potential counterbalance to the willingness to self-censor, the following hypotheses and research question emerged:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were collected from a nationwide survey of college media advisers and editors garnered via a mass email in February 2010. The College Media Advisers’ home office provided a list of adviser names and email addresses. Each adviser on the list received a personalized email request to complete a survey. A direct mail approach through SurveyMonkey allowed for the creation of a key-code variable to help match editors and advisers. A follow-up email was sent to the participants after two weeks. Accounting for email bounce backs, retirements/firings, and other similar issues, 583 potential respondents were retained, a response rate of 31%. Traditionally, surveys of this kind have received a response rate of about 15% to 17%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012440080">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The advisers were asked to rate a series of controversial topics, garnered from previous studies in this area,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012440080">47</xref></sup> as well as a culling of the Student Press Law Center’s news bulletins for cases in which an adviser or editor was in some way punished for covering a specific topic.</p>
<p>The topics fit into four areas: sex (subset: “sexting,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012440080">48</xref></sup> oral sex, sexual intercourse, birth control, and homosexuality), substance use/abuse (drug use and alcohol use), misdeeds (in-school misdeeds and campus-related crime), and criticism related to the educational institution (criticism of athletics, criticism of the Greek system, criticism of administration, and criticism of curriculum).</p>
<p>Advisers were asked to rate each of these items on a Likert-like scale in which 1 indicated they were very uncomfortable with seeing material on this topic published in their student newspaper and 7 indicated complete comfort with the topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012440080">49</xref></sup> The advisers were then asked to repeat this process, this time noting the perceived level of comfort they believed their direct supervisor had with each topic.</p>
<p>Advisers were then asked to complete the WTSC scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012440080">50</xref></sup> The scale was also a 1–7 measure in which higher scores indicated a greater willingness to self-censor. This eight-item index demonstrates the degree to which an individual will withhold an opinion when faced with a fear of opposition (e.g., “When I disagree with others, I’d rather go along with them than argue about it”). Two of the eight items require a reversing of the scale. After reversing the items, Cronbach’s alpha = .86. The items were summed and averaged.</p>
<p>The participants also provided demographic information, including the state in which they live, age, gender, years spent in the current school, years spent as an adviser, years spent in the current position, and years spent teaching. They were asked if they taught at a public or private institution and if they had any professional journalism training.</p>
<p>The editors’ version also asked the participants to complete the WTSC scale and rate how comfortable they felt regarding the publication of stories on the aforementioned topics. However, for the third-person effect portion, instead of rating how an administrator might feel about the topics, the editors were asked to rate how they perceived the adviser would feel about these topics.</p>
<p>In an effort to simplify the analyses in this study, the four controversial topic areas were checked for scalability. Because the alpha for student editor responses on these four variables (.87) was acceptable, the four topics were combined into a single editor’s comfort level variable. A similar pattern followed in terms of the editor’s perceptions of the adviser’s comfort level (alpha = .89) and the adviser’s actual comfort level (alpha = .90). Thus, the four topics were combined into single variables in each area (editor’s comfort level, adviser’s comfort level, editor’s perception, the adviser’s comfort level). This allowed for the creation of “overall” variables based on the participants’ responses in these areas. However, to mirror previous studies examining these topic areas as individual variables, and to ensure that no inadvertent masking had occurred, the controversial topics were also examined individually, and data for these outcomes are reported in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>In addition, information regarding age, gender, year in school, professional journalism training, and whether they were an editor at a public or private institution was also collected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012440080">51</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><bold>H1</bold> stated that student editors would perceive their advisers as having a significantly lower level of comfort with controversial topics than they themselves have. To test this hypothesis, four sets of matched-pair <italic>t</italic>-tests were examined, coupling each student’s rating of his or her own comfort level with the perceived comfort of the adviser on that topic. In all four cases, significant differences existed (sex <italic>t</italic> = 5.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; substance use <italic>t</italic> = 3.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; misdeed <italic>t</italic> = 2.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; school criticism <italic>t</italic> = 4.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and in all four cases, the student reported feeling more comfortable with the topic than he or she perceived the adviser to be. <bold>H1</bold> was supported.

<p>To analyze this issue, a correlation matrix was used to assess the presence of any covariates. The student’s age and if he or she attended a public or private institution correlated significantly with the outcome variables and were thus retained for future analysis.</p>
<p>The editor’s comfort level variable served as the dependent variable, with the first block of the regression containing the two demographic variables (age and public/private), while the second block contained the adviser’s WTSC score, the editor’s WTSC score, the adviser’s self-reported comfort level variable, and the editor’s perception of the adviser’s comfort level variable.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine to what degree internally held and externally driven processes could explain the comfort or reticence college newspaper editors felt in publishing stories on controversial subjects. The outcomes have demonstrated that both the individual’s willingness to self-censor and the perceptual biases regarding the adviser’s comfort levels were simultaneously predictive in this area.</p>
<p>The perceptual bias theories, such as optimistic bias and the third-person effect, have long demonstrated that individuals exaggerate the way in which a nebulous group of others feels in regard to a controversial topic. The present study offers additional support and potential expansion for this idea by examining the theory in regard to a concrete “other” and by demonstrating incongruities between perception and reality. By matching the adviser scores with those of the editors, the study revealed to what degree of accuracy the editors were assessing their advisers’ feelings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the results indicated that the editors’ own scores on the WTSC scale, but not the advisers’ WTSC ratings, were predictive of their comfort levels with these controversial topics, supporting the notion that self-censorship is an intrinsic and individualized trait.</p>
<p>What the study revealed clearly is that the editors and the advisers differ on their perceptions of how the advisers view controversial material. Reasonable people could argue that the advisers are suffering from a self-serving bias, in which they do not want to be viewed as too controlling or unwilling to stand up for important, controversial stories. While it was not the main thrust of this study, a post hoc analysis of the data gathered from advisers regarding their perception of their bosses’ comfort levels with these topics revealed an interesting finding. A series of matched-pair <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed a clear third-person perception was present here, with the advisers projecting lower comfort levels for their bosses than they reported for themselves (sex <italic>t</italic> = 12.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; misdeed <italic>t</italic> = 9.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; substance use <italic>t</italic> = 8.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; school criticism <italic>t</italic> = 12.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, when these data compared the projected “boss” ratings from both the students and the advisers, they revealed only one significant difference (school criticism variable <italic>t</italic> = 4.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). To that end, it seems that while both groups are projecting much lower ratings for specific others than for themselves, they seemed to view others in a similar fashion. One could also argue that the editors are suffering from much of the same bias, in that the editors view themselves as more willing than their advisers to make a stand on a controversial topic.</p>
<p>In either case, the gap between how each group rates the advisers in regard to comfort level is a significant one. The findings seem to run counter to the work of Chia and others cited above, which showed that congruent others are often treated as being more similar to the participants during the rating process. This perceptual bias by the editors can have unintended and problematic consequences. Like the officers noted in Davison’s work on the third-person effect, the student editors who control the content at these publications may avoid controversial stories, based on what they perceive to be weak levels of comfort and support from their advisers. However, if both self-report measures are to be taken at face value, editors and advisers are at least equally comfortable with these topics, and, in some cases, the advisers rate higher than the editors. Thus, the editors’ perceptual bias may lead to the loss of important stories that their advisers might very well have supported.</p>
<p>A few issues limit this study. First, the individuals in this study tended to be comfortable with most of this material, as none of the mean scores fell on the “uncomfortable” side of the scale (see Table 1). This can limit the ability to properly project one’s willingness to self-censor, as the theory posits that discomfort is a galvanizing factor in self-censorship. Furthermore, the study did not involve additional forms of media, such as yearbooks (longer shelf life), websites (larger reach to a broader audience), or broadcast (FCC issues). These forms of media might have yielded substantially different results.</p>
<p>However, these outcomes offer a potentially important nuance to the two approaches utilized in this study: namely, that self-censoring traits did not appear to transfer from one individual to another, even in a superior–subordinate relationship. Also, the data suggest that the bias-based effect retains its value in predicting outcomes, even when the “third person” in question is not a broader societal unknown. Future research will help to codify these findings.</p>

<p>The individuals were told to rate their personal level of comfort in seeing their students cover a story on each topic. They were told to assume the stories were related to genuine issues on campus, were free of errors, and met the burden of being newsworthy. The topic itself, not any extraneous factors, was to drive the comfort or discomfort the adviser felt toward publication.</p>

<p>Because this study used the code key for the advisers and the editors, I was able to create matched-pair dyads that allowed us to complete direct comparisons across the data sets. In some cases, several editors responded to our survey, while in other cases, either no editor responded or the editor did not use the code. In addition, some advisers or students did not complete enough of the survey to make the instrument valid. To that end, when we completed the data cleaning, 189 matched pairs remained. While this does inflate the adviser total, research in this area has demonstrated this to be an effective and accurate approach to data of this kind. In addition, a statistical examination of the key variables of the study found no significant differences between the advisers who were included and those who were excluded. The same results held for the student editors who were included and excluded.</p>
