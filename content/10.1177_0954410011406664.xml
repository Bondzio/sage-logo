<p>Accurate and reliable fluid modelling is essential for any gas turbine performance simulation software as it provides a robust foundation for building advanced multi-disciplinary modelling capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011406664"><bold>1</bold></xref>]. Caloric properties for generic and semi generic gas turbine performance simulation codes can be calculated at various levels of fidelity; selection of the fidelity level is dependent upon the objectives of the simulation and execution time constraints. Rigorous fluid modelling, however, may not necessarily improve performance simulation accuracy unless all modelling assumptions and sources of uncertainty are aligned to the same level. Certain modelling aspects such as the introduction of chemical kinetics, and dissociation effects, may reduce computational speed significantly and this could be of significant importance for radical space exploration and novel propulsion cycle assessment.</p>
<p>A large number of technical models are currently available in the literature for calculating caloric properties of ideal gases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011406664"><bold>2</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011406664"><bold>13</bold></xref>]. Bücker <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011406664"><bold>2</bold></xref>] reviewed most of these models and argued that although some of them are accepted standards in various industrial sectors, their mutual consistency can be rather poor. Since this could result in significant discrepancies, and even in contradictory results, a new technical model was developed in that study to be used as a standard for the prediction of caloric properties of moist air and combustion gases based on consistent sets of data.</p>
<p>Some of the uncertainties of thermo-fluid modelling and the potential dangers induced by certain assumptions in gas turbine performance have been discussed in the gas turbine literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011406664"><bold>2</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011406664"><bold>14</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011406664"><bold>18</bold></xref>]. Nevertheless, the actual effects of error propagation still remain unclear with respect to gas turbine performance calculations and multi-disciplinary simulations at aircraft system level. Çengel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011406664"><bold>19</bold></xref>] argues that ‘the assumptions made while solving an engineering problem must be reasonable and justifiable’. The work presented in this article aims to fill this literature gap by: (a) investigating the common assumptions made in thermo-fluid modelling for gas turbines and their effect on caloric properties and (b) assessing the impact of uncertainties on performance calculations and emissions predictions at aircraft system level.</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, a comprehensive analysis of thermo-fluid modelling for gas turbines is presented and the thermo-fluid models developed for the TERA2020 (Techno-economic, Environmental and Risk Assessment for 2020) tool’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011406664"><bold>20</bold></xref>] engine performance rubber decks are discussed in detail. Common technical models, used for calculating caloric properties, are compared while typical assumptions made in fluid modelling, and the uncertainties induced, are examined. Several analyses, which demonstrate the effects of composition, temperature, and pressure on caloric properties of working mediums for gas turbines, are presented. The working mediums examined include dry air and combustion products for various fuels and hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratios. The errors induced by ignoring dissociation effects are also discussed.</p>
<p>In the second part of this article, the uncertainty induced in performance calculations by common technical models, used for calculating caloric properties, is discussed at engine level. The errors induced by ignoring dissociation are examined at three different levels: (a) component level, (b) engine level, and (c) aircraft system level. Essentially, an attempt is made to shed light on the trade-off between improving the accuracy of a fluid model and the accuracy of a multi-disciplinary simulation at aircraft system level, against computational time penalties. The accuracy/uncertainty of an overall engine model will always be better than the mean accuracy/uncertainty of the individual component estimates as long as systematic errors are carefully examined and reduced to acceptable levels to ensure error propagation does not cause significant discrepancies. The results obtained demonstrate that accurate modelling of the working fluid is essential, especially for assessing novel and/or aggressive cycles at aircraft system level. Computational time penalties induced by improving the accuracy of the fluid model as well as the validity of the ideal gas assumption for future turbofan engines and novel propulsion cycles are discussed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011406664"><title>2 FLUID MODELLING</title>
<p>The fluid model of a gas turbine simulation software generally consists of three types of fluids; the initial working fluid (typically air), the fuel, and the products of combustion. The chemical composition of atmospheric dry air that was assumed for the purpose of this study is highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011406664">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Conventionally, there are two approaches for implementing technical fluid models in gas turbine performance simulation software. Caloric properties may typically be obtained from: (a) linearly (or logarithmically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011406664"><bold>1</bold></xref>]) interpolated fluid tables or (b) from polynomial functions. Generating fluid model tables, either from polynomial relationships such as those described in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011406664"><bold>7</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954410011406664"><bold>21</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954410011406664"><bold>22</bold></xref>], and/or chemical equilibrium software such as CEA (chemical equilibrium with applications) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011406664"><bold>8</bold></xref>], Gaseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954410011406664"><bold>23</bold></xref>], and CEC (chemical equilibrium composition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954410011406664"><bold>24</bold></xref>], is far more laborious and time consuming than directly implementing polynomial functions. Nevertheless, fluid tabulations offer several key advantages that have been discussed extensively by Sethi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011406664"><bold>1</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954410011406664"><bold>25</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>Often the need for analysing the effects of different working media and alternative fuels on gas turbine performance arises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954410011406664"><bold>25</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954410011406664"><bold>27</bold></xref>]. The 0-D engine performance module developed for TERA2020 can utilize both fluid tables and CHEMKIN-II format libraries of polynomials to rigorously model these effects. The structure of the fluid model implemented in the performance code is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011406664">Fig. 1</xref>. The following types of technical fluid models can currently be used.

</list>
<fig id="fig1-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Fluid model structure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The Walsh and Fletcher technical model is based on 8th-order polynomial functions for combustion products of kerosene and diesel for temperatures ranging from 200 to 2000 K. Libraries in the CHEMKIN-II format, such as the ones used by the CEA code up to 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011406664"><bold>7</bold></xref>], and in GRI-Mech [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011406664"><bold>13</bold></xref>], consist of 4th-order polynomial coefficients for various species and are typically valid for temperatures ranging from 200 to 5000 K. In more recent versions of CEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011406664"><bold>8</bold></xref>], caloric properties are calculated with polynomial functions consisting of seven terms; these data have been utilized in the performance code <italic>via</italic> tables, and their range of validity is typically the same as with the CHEMKIN-II format polynomials.</p>
<p>For the ‘no dissociation’ option of the developed fluid model, a constant gaseous composition of the working medium has been assumed. Composition is only allowed to change when combustion or mixing takes place; no allowances for dissociation have been made. The products of combustion for any hydrocarbon will comprise only water vapour, carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen, and oxygen (if combustion is lean). Since there is no dissociation, the composition of the products does not change even with changes in temperature as the distributions of moles, and consequently, mole fractions remain the same at any temperature. This implies that the mean molecular weight of the gases in the products of combustion remains constant regardless of the temperature or pressure. The ‘no dissociation’ option is suitable for any hydrocarbon with the structure C<sub><italic>a</italic></sub>H<sub><italic>b</italic></sub> where lean and stoichiometric ideal combustion is concerned.</p>
<p>For the ‘complete dissociation’ option, the assumption has been made that full chemical equilibrium is reached by the working medium at every given temperature and pressure. This approach considers the complex series of reaction steps typically encounter in combustion, which can yield many major and minor constituents when the large number of potential reactions is considered. The extensive simulations carried out with the NASA CEA code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011406664"><bold>8</bold></xref>] that support the ‘complete dissociation’ option in the fluid model are described in detail in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954410011406664"><bold>25</bold></xref>]. Detailed descriptions of the definition of equilibrium constants as well as the calculation procedures are presented in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954410011406664"><bold>28</bold></xref>]. The composition of the main combustion products of Jet-A (i.e. the ones with mole fractions greater than 5·10<sup>−6</sup>) for a range of temperatures assuming chemical equilibrium is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011406664">Table 2</xref>. It can be observed that dissociation becomes first noticed at 1500 K, and increasingly important at higher temperatures.

<p>Theoretically, as the temperature of the combustion products reduces due to cooling in the burner and due to the expansion process in the turbine, dissociation should cease, and the mixture should return to the non-dissociated species composition. In practice however, fast local chilling of the reactions – for example due to contact with the cooler walls of the combustor or due to insufficient residence times in the turbine – will result in some dissociated species still being present in the final mixture (i.e. frozen composition). Generating an accurate fluid model to account for this phenomenon is considered to be highly complex since the composition of the mixture will need to be determined experimentally using techniques such as chemical absorption or adsorption, infrared radiation, or paramagnetism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954410011406664"><bold>28</bold></xref>]. The interested reader can also refer to reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954410011406664"><bold>29</bold></xref>] for more information on advanced non-equilibrium modelling for predicting the formation of various species in gas turbine combustors.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954410011406664"><title>3 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</title>
<sec id="sec4-0954410011406664"><title>3.1 Rationale for fully rigorous calculations</title>
<p>A comparison between various methodologies for thermodynamic calculations is presented in this section. Compressor performance was chosen here as an example for highlighting the effect that different modelling assumptions may have on gas turbine performance calculations. Nevertheless, these results are also equally (if not even more) applicable to turbine and nozzle performance estimations.</p>
<p>The most crude of assumptions that can be made is that of perfect gas, i.e. constant cold end gas properties with <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = 1004.7 J/(kg·K) and γ = 1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>], and can yield inaccuracies of more than a few K in temperature calculations.</p>
<p>A more accurate calculation is based again on the assumption of a constant value of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and γ, but evaluated at the mean component temperature. This calculation is generally easy to perform without a computer and will yield inaccuracies of just a few K in temperature calculations.</p>
<p>The fully rigorous calculations will involve the use of the fundamental definitions of specific enthalpy and entropy and will give results whose inaccuracy is primarily dependent on the uncertainty of the ideal gas assumption and the technical model used for calculating caloric properties. The authors of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>] state that the uncertainty level in calculations using the fully rigorous approach is approximately 0.25 per cent, for moderate pressures and temperatures, but give no explanation. This type of calculations is fundamental for gas turbine simulation software since errors of even a few K may be considered unacceptable during the conceptual design phase. As a calculation method, it is certainly more cumbersome and consequently, for educational purposes, a simpler method is often sought. Nevertheless, Kurzke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011406664"><bold>16</bold></xref>] provides a simple way of using rigorous calculation procedures, i.e. enthalpy and entropy instead of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and γ, for teaching students gas turbine theory.</p>
<p>A comparison of the constant <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and γ methods, relative to the fully rigorous approach, is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410011406664">Table 3</xref> for a compression calculation. The relatively small error in the calculation of compression power implies that the error propagation in the expansion calculations for a gas turbine system should also be small. Although, on one hand, this could be true (for the expansion process only), it tends to give the illusion that the overall system calculation will not be affected. In reality, however, the error in the prediction of the compressor delivery temperature will affect the accuracy of the fuel mass flow prediction – and therefore other important performance parameters such as specific fuel consumption (SFC) and block fuel estimations. For example, at a fixed combustor outlet temperature of 1400 K, the −15.8 K error in compressor delivery temperature will directly propagate to a roughly 2 per cent error in fuel mass flow since the required temperature rise in the combustor will be higher.

<p>Furthermore, Kurzke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011406664"><bold>15</bold></xref>] concludes that for achieving high temperatures, one needs over-proportional amounts of fuel, and that is the reason for the maximum thermal efficiency being at a temperature much lower than the stoichiometric limit. The fact that fuel mass flow, and subsequently fuel–air ratio (FAR), is not proportional to the combustor temperature increase can only be taken fully into account if rigorous fluid modelling is used in the combustor component calculations. Lee <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011406664"><bold>18</bold></xref>] also come to similar conclusions for gas turbine configurations with multiple combustors. It can therefore be concluded that the fully rigorous approach should be used in all performance calculations, even within the educational procedure.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954410011406664"><title>3.2 Computational cost</title>
<p>Estimating the performance of a gas turbine engine at aircraft system level, for a long range mission, requires a relatively small amount of computing power. However, the required computational time for design space exploration applications – through the use of multi-disciplinary tools such as TERA2020 – is not negligible and the fluid model must therefore be chosen carefully. Tables of caloric properties where seemingly found to be a good choice with respect to improving computational speed. Computational speed decreased by some 10 per cent when the Walsh and Fletcher 8th-order polynomials were used and by some 20 per cent when CHEMKIN-II type of libraries of 4th-order polynomials were used. For the latter choice, only five species were taken into account: N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, Ar, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub>. It can be argued however, with high confidence, that these benchmarking results are highly dependent on programming practices and as a result on the quality of the code produced. A conclusion therefore cannot be drawn on whether using fluid properties or polynomials is best practice with respect to computational speed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, following further analysis, it was safely concluded that when using a CHEMKIN-II type of library (or equivalent), the computational speed is inversely proportional to the number of species taken into consideration. As a rule of thumb, doubling the number of species taken into consideration will approximately double the required computational time. Using a fluid model that calculates thermodynamic properties at species level – rather than working medium level, as would be the typical case with fluid tables – can be considered a sensible choice if the effects of utilizing different working mediums and/or alternative fuels are to be taken into account rigorously. Potential computational time trade-offs should not be ignored, however, when considering radical design space exploration as simulations can last from a few hours to a few days.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec7-0954410011406664"><title>4.1 Comparison of common technical models</title>
<p>Various technical models used for calculating caloric properties based on the ideal gas assumption are compared, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011406664">Fig. 2</xref>. Many professional gas turbine performance simulation codes used in industry and research institutes have incorporated NASA’s CEA code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011406664"><bold>8</bold></xref>] for calculating thermodynamic properties. This model has therefore been set as the baseline for comparison with the other technical models. Four technical models have been used for the purpose of this comparison: the Walsh and Fletcher 8th-order polynomials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>], a special library developed for the TERA2020 engine performance module referred to here as EVA ThermoLib, the GRI-Mech [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011406664"><bold>13</bold></xref>] library, and an older set of 4th-order polynomials used with NASA’s CEA code up to 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011406664"><bold>7</bold></xref>].
<fig id="fig2-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Percentage deviation of isobaric heat capacity (left) and γ (right) calculated for dry air with commonly used technical models from CEA</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>An oscillating deviation from CEA calculated values can be observed for the models described in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011406664"><bold>7</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011406664"><bold>13</bold></xref>], as well as EVA ThermoLib. This is consistent with the fact that the later three are using 4th-order polynomials based on the CHEMKIN-II format while CEA is using more recent seven-term functions. The Walsh and Fletcher polynomials are only valid up to 2000 [K], for which range they show close agreement with CEA results. Caloric properties evaluated for temperatures beyond this threshold will deviate significantly and can be completely inconsistent with values calculated with the other models and the expected trends.</p>
<p>There is currently no conclusive study in the gas turbine literature, known to the author, that compares and ranks the various technical models discussed in this article in terms of accuracy. Therefore, the assumption shall be made that none of the presented models is any better than the rest, within their respected range of validity. Hence, the uncertainty in calculating the isobaric heat capacity – in the range of temperatures and pressures that the ideal gas assumption holds well – is 0.3 per cent while for γ it’s approximately 0.1 per cent i.e. nearly three times lower. Essentially, the uncertainty in calculating the isobaric heat capacity from the technical models is within the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty induced by not accounting for real gas effects (temperature and pressure dependence) when predicting the performance of modern gas turbine cycles (0.5 per cent for a cycle with an overall pressure ratio (OPR) of 50, as will be shown later in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011406664">Fig. 18</xref>).

<p>An interesting anomaly to observe is the unsmoothness of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011406664">Fig. 2</xref>. This is mainly attributed to the implicit low precision in the output values from the CEA code. The output values from the implementation of the other technical models within the fluid model, have a much higher number of significant digits. It is therefore expected that the curves showing the percentage deviations between these models and CEA will not be very smooth. According to Çengel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011406664"><bold>19</bold></xref>] ‘A result with more significant digits than that of given data falsely implies more accuracy. It is appropriate to retain all the digits during intermediate calculations and to do the rounding in the final step’. For graphical comparisons, the data would need to be produced with a good, and similar, number of significant digits – but that would require to access and modify the NASA proprietary CEA source code.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954410011406664"><title>4.2 Effect of different parameters and dissociation on caloric properties</title>
<p>In this section, an attempt has been made to study the effects of temperature, FAR and lambda (λ), water-to-air ratio (WAR), fuel and H/C ratio, and dissociation (including pressure effects) on the calculation of caloric properties using the ideal gas assumption. In some cases a comparison was made between the values calculated using rigorous ideal gas modelling and the values proposed in gas turbine textbooks to be used in ‘illustrative calculations for teaching purposes, or for crude ballpark estimates’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>], i.e. perfect gas assumption. Although, such simplifications are sometimes necessary within an educational framework, it is important for future engineers to understand the errors induced in their calculations. In reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011406664"><bold>16</bold></xref>], Kurzke clearly demonstrates how simplifications can be wrong not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively, and, hence, predict wrong trends.</p>
<p>Tables of caloric properties from CEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011406664"><bold>8</bold></xref>] have been used for producing figures illustrating the effects of dissociation and WAR. The no-dissociation and chemical equilibrium models have been discussed in earlier sections. Figures illustrating the effects of fuel chemistry have been produced using the simple no-dissociation chemistry model and a CHEMKIN-II type of library, EVA ThermoLib, discussed earlier in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954410011406664">section 2</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0954410011406664"><title>4.2.1 Effects of dissociation on C<sub>p</sub> and γ</title>
<p>The isobaric heat capacity will increase with FAR and temperature, while γ will decrease. Dissociation effects start becoming noticeable after 1500 K, and can induce increasingly significant deviations in <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and γ calculations for temperatures greater than 1800 K, as can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011406664">Fig. 3</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011406664">Table 2</xref>. To a first order, dissociation effects are highly sensitive to pressure; they are significantly less sensitive to FAR, however. The assumption of perfect gas can induce errors in the estimated values of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and γ of as much as 30 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, if dissociation effects are ignored. With dissociation effects taken into account the errors will increase even further. The discrepancies induced by such assumptions for compressor calculations, as well as a qualitative analysis of the effects of dissociation, were discussed earlier.
<fig id="fig3-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effects of FAR and dissociation on isobaric heat capacity (left) and γ (right) for combustion products of Jet-A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As stated, γ is highly sensitive to pressure and this can be observed more clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011406664">Fig. 4</xref>. In general, the higher the pressure the smaller the effects of dissociation on γ and on the rest of the caloric properties will be. For very high temperatures and extremely low pressures which are unlikely to occur in modern gas turbine applications - the deviation of the value of γ compared to values obtained from the no-dissociation model can be as much as 12 per cent. It can easily be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011406664">Fig. 4</xref> that for high temperatures the error in calculating γ will drop by 1 to 3 per cent for every order of magnitude increase in pressure. Modern gas turbine combustors typically function at relatively lower temperatures and significantly higher pressures and therefore the error in γ estimation is confined to 3 per cent, which is still significantly high and should not be ignored.
<fig id="fig4-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effect of pressure on percentage deviation of γ due to dissociation of combustion products for Jet-A (left) and effects of FAR, pressure and dissociation on γ for combustion products of Jet-A (right)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Dissociation effects are relatively insensitive to FAR for high pressures. It was mentioned earlier that increasing FAR will decrease γ and this is generally true whether dissociation is taken into account or not. This rule will not apply however at high temperatures and low pressures were γ tends to become less dependent on the value of FAR. This is mainly attributed to the substantially increased value of the gas constant which offsets the increase in isobaric heat capacity, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011406664">Fig. 5</xref>. No direct conclusion can be drawn with respect to the effect of FAR on the deviation of the chemical equilibrium value of γ compared to the value obtained from the no-dissociation model, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011406664">Fig. 5</xref>.

<p>The isobaric heat capacity will increase with WAR, while γ will decrease as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011406664">Fig. 6</xref>. The effect of WAR is more significant on the calculation of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, than on γ.

<p>For gas turbine performance calculations, it is important to study the effects of fuel chemistry in the evaluation of caloric properties for combustion products. The isobaric heat capacity will increase with H/C ratio as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011406664">Fig. 7</xref>. As expected, the effect of H/C ratio is more important as the mixture gets richer. Moreover, when moving from a weak mixture (λ = 3) to a stoichiometric one (λ = 1), <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> will not only become more sensitive to H/C ratio but also to temperature; it can be observed that the variation of the value of isobaric heat capacity, for the same range of temperatures (300 [K] to 3000 [K]), rises from 36 per cent for the weak mixture to as much as 44 per cent for the stoichiometric mixture.
<fig id="fig7-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Effect of H/C ratio on isobaric heat capacity for combustion products of a weak mixture (left) and a stoichiometric mixture (right)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Some fluid models, based either on tables or polynomials, can only account for combustion products of a particular fuel. For example, the propulsion object oriented simulation software (PROOSIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954410011406664"><bold>30</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954410011406664"><bold>32</bold></xref>] standard component fluid model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011406664"><bold>1</bold></xref>] uses caloric property tables for combustion products of Jet-A. Also, some of the polynomials in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>] are presented as being suitable for combustion products of kerosene and diesel. As discussed earlier, isobaric heat capacity for combustion products is dependent on the H/C ratio of the fuel used. For fuels with similar H/C ratio, minor deviations would be expected. For fuels with significantly different H/C ratios the errors should not be ignored, and therefore, for fully rigorous thermodynamic calculations, appropriate tables or polynomials should be used. High values of FAR will also increase deviations since the mixture tends to move further away for the original dry air composition; for FAR = 0 all deviations will be zero.</p>
<p>Isobaric heat capacities for combustion products of various fuels are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011406664">Fig. 8</xref>. As expected, using Jet-A tables for estimating the caloric properties of JP-4, JP-5, and Diesel combustion productions will yield results with relatively small and perhaps acceptable errors that are within the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty of the ideal-gas assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011406664"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. One should note however, that these errors are systematic and will essentially stack on top of the existing uncertainty in the system. For accurate gas turbine performance calculations sources of systematic errors such as these should be removed. Especially, for combustion products of natural gas, where deviations in isobaric heat capacity compared to Jet-A can be as much as 4 per cent, dedicated tables or polynomials should definitely be used.

<sec id="sec13-0954410011406664"><title>5.1 Flow area calculations</title>
<p>At each station of the engine the working fluid can typically be fully defined by a unique set of twelve fluid-thermodynamic parameters which comprise: mass flowrate (<italic>W</italic>), total and static temperature (<italic>T</italic>, and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>), total and static pressure (<italic>P</italic>, and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>), effective flow area (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub>), density (<italic>ρ</italic>), FAR, unburned fuel-to-air ratio (FAR<sub><italic>u</italic></sub>), WAR, Mach number (<italic>M</italic>), and velocity (<italic>V</italic>). A fluid model for an engine performance code comprises of thermodynamic functions to calculate the unknown local flow properties, at any point (inlet, outlet, or intermediate) of any gas turbine component provided one of a set of twelve compatible input options is satisfied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011406664"><bold>1</bold></xref>]. It should be noted here that previous studies have revealed that the impact of the FAR<sub><italic>u</italic></sub> parameter can be neglected for gas turbine applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954410011406664"><bold>33</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>In this section, the behaviour of one of such functions has been studied with respect to dissociation. The main inputs used were: mass flowrate, total temperature, total pressure, FAR and Mach number. The outputs studied were: total to static pressure ratio, velocity, effective flow area, and static temperature. This type of input and output would typically be used during design point performance calculations for determining the effective flow area at a given engine station.</p>
<p>The effects of dissociation in calculating the total to static pressure ratio and velocity are highly sensitive to total temperature and Mach number, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011406664">Fig. 9</xref>. For high total temperatures, the discrepancy in pressure ratio can be as much as 2 per cent for sonic conditions, and well over 4 per cent for supersonic conditions. Similarly, the discrepancy in velocity can be as much as 2 per cent for low subsonic conditions, and nearly 4 per cent for supersonic conditions. As Mach number increases in the supersonic range of values, dissociation effects become more and more sensitive to total temperature.
<fig id="fig9-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Percentage deviation of total to static pressure ratio (left) and velocity (right) for values calculated for chemical equilibrium from no dissociation values</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The effects of dissociation in calculating the static temperature are also highly sensitive to total temperature and Mach number, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011406664">Fig. 10</xref>. For high temperatures, the discrepancy can be as much as 5 per cent for subsonic conditions, and well over 9 per cent for supersonic conditions. It was concluded earlier in this work, that dissociation effects in evaluating caloric properties for relatively cold components (i.e. <italic>T</italic> ⩽ 1500 K) can be negligibly small. It can easily be observed in the same figure that the uncertainty in estimating the effective flow area for cold components of gas turbines, such as bypass ducts and compressors, is also negligibly small; and it is certainly smaller than the uncertainty induced by ignoring real gas effects. The same conclusion however cannot be drawn for relatively hot components. The errors induced by ignoring dissociation effects during the calculation of the effective flow area of a military afterburner running at nearly stoichiometric conditions as well as the exit area of the con-di nozzle downstream, can be more than 3 per cent and should not be ignored. Errors in velocity and effective flow area calculations for a high OPR gas turbine combustor can be as much as 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively, and should also not be ignored.

Their results were based on a simplified dissociation model that ignored NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and OH formation. It can be seen through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011406664">Fig. 11</xref> that when a more rigorous version of the reaction steps is considered, then the results are significantly different. The actual temperature difference for combustor outlet temperatures of 2100 K can be as much as 20 K, if full chemical equilibrium is considered. It can be concluded that dissociation effects in heat addition calculations become first noticed at 1500 K, and significant at 1800 K. Also, increasing pressure will tend to reduce the effects of dissociation for temperatures greater than 2300 K.</p>
<p>Ignoring dissociation effects in expansion calculations can also result in significant errors. Taking a work requirement (PW) of 36 MW and a FAR of 0.034, expansion calculations were performed for a range of turbine inlet temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>41</sub>), both with and without accounting for the effects of dissociation. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011406664">Fig. 12</xref>, dissociation effects in expansion calculations become first noticed at 1500 K, and significant at 1800 K. For example, the actual difference in turbine outlet temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>43</sub>) for inlet temperatures of 1800 K was found to be nearly 7 K. This is indeed a significant deviation if one considers that 1 per cent inefficiency in the expansion process will roughly result in 1.5 per cent reduction in turbine outlet pressure (at a constant power PW), or 4 K in <italic>T</italic><sub>43</sub> (at a constant expansion pressure ratio).
<fig id="fig12-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>Deviation of turbine outlet temperature for values calculated for chemical equilibrium from no dissociation values</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It must be noted that, when dissociation effects were taken into account, full chemical equilibrium was assumed as an ideal scenario, for both head addition and expansion calculations. In practice, however, insufficient residence times and fast local chilling of reactions – for example due to contact with the cooling air – will result in full chemical equilibrium not being reached in the combustor and dissociated species still being present in the final mixture in the turbine outlet (i.e. frozen composition). It can therefore be concluded that even when full chemical equilibrium is assumed, there is still significant thermo-fluid modelling induced uncertainty in the performance calculations; determining the level of this uncertainty experimentally for a particular engine design is not a trivial task, if possible at all.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec16-0954410011406664"><title>6.1 Design-point performance calculations</title>
<p>In this section, an attempt was made to study how the choice of the fluid model affects engine design point performance calculations. For the purpose of this study, various technical models were used – utilizing the flexibility of the developed fluid component for TERA2020. All engine technology parameters were kept constant including component efficiencies, pressure losses, and maximum permissible <italic>T</italic><sub>4</sub> levels. The differences encountered in the engine performance predictions are discussed.</p>
<p>If dissociation effects are ignored, variability in the calculated values of corrected mass flow, total pressure, and total temperature throughout the gas path is confined to 1 per cent, 1.3 per cent, and 2 K band, respectively. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011406664">Figs 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011406664">14</xref>. If dissociation effects are taken into account, then the calculated values of corrected mass flow, total pressure, and total temperature can vary from the ‘no dissociation’ values as much as 3 per cent, 4 per cent, and 12 K, respectively. These large deviations originate mainly from the performance calculations in the high pressure turbine and should not be ignored. They can be attributed to the different working medium composition (and hence, different caloric properties) when dissociation effects are taken into account.

<p>For major performance parameters in design-point calculations, the induced uncertainty from the various technical models is 0.4 per cent and is of the same order of magnitude as with the uncertainty in the calculation of isobaric heat capacity discussed earlier in this article. An exception to this is the hot nozzle effective area which can vary by as much as 1.5 per cent, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011406664">Fig. 14</xref>. If dissociation effects are taken into account, then the calculated values of fuel mass flow and net thrust can vary by more than 1 per cent, while the required hot nozzle effective area can vary by as much as 3 per cent. The deviations in net thrust and hot nozzle effective area can mainly be attributed to propagating errors originating from the high pressure turbine expansion calculations. The deviations in fuel mass flow are attributed to the errors generated in the combustor heat addition calculations when dissociation effects are ignored. The uncertainty in heat addition and expansion calculations at high temperatures was discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec14-0954410011406664">section 5.2</xref>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-0954410011406664"><title>6.2 Off-design performance calculations</title>
<p>The TERA2020 tool (described in more detail in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011406664"><bold>20</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954410011406664"><bold>35</bold></xref>]) has been utilized here for analysing the variability induced in gas turbine calculations at aircraft system level by fluid modelling choices alone. First, the performance of an intercooled turbofan engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011406664"><bold>20</bold></xref>] was estimated using different technical models for caloric properties. These results were fed sequentially into the engine weight and dimensions, aircraft design and performance, emissions predictions, and environmental impact modules of TERA2020.</p>
<p>While switching from one fluid model to another, the same design values were used for predicting the engine performance at top of climb conditions including fan and core mass flow, fan tip and hub pressure ratio, intermediate pressure compressor (IPC) and HPC pressure ratios, component efficiencies and/or pressure loss levels, intercooler effectiveness, and combustor outlet temperature and cooling flow levels. For all fluid models, the engine was run at the same combustor outlet temperatures for the major engine operating points such as end of runway hot day take-off conditions, climb and descent ratings as well as for the mid-cruise point. To derive the engine sea-level static (SLS) take-off thrust a flat rating was assumed; engine performance levels for the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) emissions certification points were derived in accordance with ICAO Annex 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954410011406664"><bold>36</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>In this respect, the analysis carried out essentially starts by assuming that the engine performance levels have been determined and frozen (i.e. ratings, cooling flow assumptions, etc.); the use of the CEA fluid model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011406664"><bold>8</bold></xref>] serves herein as datum reference. The results presented therefore aim to provide an estimate of the uncertainty that may be induced at aircraft system level, for a given parameter selection, as a result of thermo-fluid modelling choices alone.</p>
<p>In general, the accuracy/uncertainty of an overall engine model will always be better than the mean accuracy/uncertainty of the individual component estimates as long as systematic errors are carefully examined and reduced to acceptable levels to ensure error propagation does not cause significant discrepancies. In cases where dissociation is not important (i.e. for engine designs with relatively low combustor outlet temperatures), the uncertainty of the various technical models used for gas turbine thermo-fluid modelling may be ignored for multi-disciplinary simulations at aircraft system level. This is due to the fact that the overall level of confidence may be considerably low in highly conceptual studies; many assumptions will need to be made at this stage of the design process and it may very well be argued that it is the overall trends that are important rather than the absolute values.</p>
<p>At the later stages of the preliminary design process, however, the accuracy level of major engine performance estimates (engine thrust and fuel mass flow) is usually assumed to be within 1 per cent. This estimate assumes that component efficiencies and pressure loss levels chosen by the preliminary design team have been well consolidated, and agreed as achievable with high probability with the appropriate company component specialists. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011406664">Fig. 15</xref> indicate a general uncertainty level of 0.5 per cent between fluid models that do not consider dissociation effects; when dissociation is taken into account major performance estimates can vary more than 1.5 per cent at high power conditions such as take-off. It is important to note here that the combustor outlet temperature levels chosen are for a year 2020 entry into service intercooled turbofan engine for long range applications and are assumed to be well above 1800 K for both top of climb and end of runway hot day take-off conditions.
<fig id="fig15-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption><p>Percentage deviation of major performance parameter predictions at end of runway hot day take-off condtions (left) and mid-cruise conditions (right) for an intercooled engine for different fluid models used</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission index predictions for the ICAO and mid-cruise points were found to vary by less than 1 per cent, as can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011406664">Fig. 16</xref>. Accounting for dissociation is essentially more important for take-off and climb out conditions where combustor outlet temperatures are higher; some off-design performance effects, however, do kick in at low power conditions as a result of the core nozzle area being determined at a high power condition (top of climb). Typical parameters calculated for the ICAO LTO cycle, with and without accounting for dissociation effects, can vary as much as 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The error in calculating the D<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/F<sub><italic>oo</italic></sub> parameter can be considered negligible since the uncertainty of the emissions model can be as much as 30 per cent when extrapolating at the high OPR values expected for an intercooled cycle (typically much higher than 50). It should be noted that a semi empirical correlation for a conventional rich-burn combustor has been used for predicting NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. The emissions model results therefore depend on combustor inlet temperature and pressure which, in principal, will uniquely define the primary zone stoichiometric conditions (i.e. main NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> producing zone and conditions), irrespective of actual fuel to air ratio and hence combustor outlet temperature.

<p>The total mass of each gaseous pollutant calculated for an aircraft long range mission and its assorted global warming potential (GWP) can vary as much as 1 per cent, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011406664">Fig. 17</xref>. It can be argued that taking into account dissociation effects reduces systematic errors in the calculation of pollutant mass and GWP. Nevertheless, these errors are also well within the uncertainty of the environmental impact model and can therefore be considered negligible.
<fig id="fig17-0954410011406664" position="float"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption><p>Percentage deviation of pollutant mass and GWP (left) and segment time and fuel burn (right) predictions for different fluid models used</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011406664-fig17.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The predicted climb time and corresponding fuel burn reduces by 2 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, when dissociation effects are taken into account. These differences are attributed to the increased thrust being predicted for the same combustor outlet temperature; they are averaged out though by the cruise segment having to last just a little bit longer to achieve a given range. Although the variability in calculating the total mission time and fuel burn was found to be less than 0.25 per cent, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011406664">Fig. 17</xref>, it should be noted that ignoring dissociation effects will essentially introduce a systematic error in the predictions; for accurate block fuel predictions dissociation effects should not be ignored.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that accurate modelling of the working fluid is essential when assessing novel and/or aggressive cycles at aircraft system level; the systematic errors induced in the predictions by not accounting for dissociation effects should not be ignored. For conventional cycles running at relatively low combustor outlet temperatures (i.e. less than 1800 K) a complicated fluid model that accounts for dissociation effects may not be necessary.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec18-0954410011406664"><title>7 VALIDITY OF THE IDEAL GAS ASSUMPTION</title>
<p>The assumption of real gas is rarely used for aero engine calculations, i.e. <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> being a function of temperature and pressure. In gas turbine performance codes, the assumption of ideal gas (sometimes also referred to as half-ideal) is typically used, i.e. <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> being only a function of temperature. Temperatures and pressures in the gas path will typically be calculated using the enthalpy and entropy relations presented in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011406664"><bold>11</bold></xref>]. For teaching purposes often the assumption of perfect gas will be made, i.e. <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> being constant.</p>
<p>A comparison of the calculated values of isobaric heat capacity assuming a real gas from values obtained considering an ideal gas – performed for a range of temperatures and pressure of dry air – is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011406664">Fig. 18</xref> (continuous black lines). Compression lines for normal and intercooled cycles have been plotted for International Standard Atmosphere SLS conditions; the ideal isothermal compression line has also been included. The plotted dashed lines in this chart are compression lines of dry air for a polytropic efficiency of 90 per cent and various ambient temperatures.</p>
<p>For current and future novel propulsion cycles, the following trends are illustrated in this chart.</p>
<p><list id="list2-0954410011406664" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It is only within a small region of low temperatures and high pressures (upper left corner) that the discrepancies are seriously high. The ideal gas law holds well for aero-engines currently in service.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For an intercooled cycle with a high OPR, the discrepancies cannot be ignored for rigorous performance calculations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing OPR – which is the current technological trend in aero engine design – diminishes the validity of the ideal gas assumption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing the compression polytropic efficiency – which is the current technological trend in component design – diminishes the validity of the ideal gas assumption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An increase in intercooler hot stream temperature drop (i.e. effectiveness) will diminish the validity of the ideal gas assumption. This is especially true at lower IPC pressure ratios if an intercooled turbofan design is considered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the ideal isothermal compression process is to be considered – perhaps within a novel cycle assessment –then the ideal gas assumption will not hold and significant calculation errors will be induced.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Finally, if dissociation effects are considered, the errors induced by assuming an ideal gas instead of a real gas are still negligible for turbine calculations since expansion is done at generally high temperatures. It can be concluded that real gas behaviour is not negligible at high pressures and low temperatures and particularly when approaching the condensation point of water.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec19-0954410011406664" sec-type="conclusions"><title>8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The research effort presented in this article mainly focused on a comprehensive analysis of typical thermo-fluid modelling for gas turbine performance codes and the potential induced uncertainty in the calculations. The fluid model developed for the engine performance module of TERA2020 was described and the assumptions made and the uncertainties induced were examined. Several analyses, which demonstrate the effects of composition, temperature, and pressure on caloric properties of working mediums for gas turbines, have been presented. The working mediums examined include dry air and combustion products for various fuels and H/C ratios. The errors induced by ignoring dissociation effects have also been discussed. The uncertainty induced in calculations by (a) using common technical models for evaluating fluid caloric properties and (b) ignoring dissociation effects was examined at three different levels: (i) component level, (ii) engine level, and (iii) aircraft system level. Essentially, an attempt was made to shed light on the trade-off between improving the accuracy of a fluid model and the accuracy of a multi-disciplinary simulation at aircraft system level, against computational time penalties. The validity of the ideal gas assumption for future turbofan engines and novel propulsion cycles was discussed.</p>
<p>The main findings can be summarized as follows.</p>
<p><list id="list3-0954410011406664" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In general, dissociation becomes first noticed at 1500 K, and significant at 1800 K.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using constant values of isobaric heat capacity and γ, instead of fully rigorous calculations, can result in large calculation errors, and even in the prediction of wrong trends. It should therefore be avoided even for crude estimates within the educational procedure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The uncertainty of various technical models for evaluating the isobaric heat capacity was found to be considerably high (0.3 per cent). This uncertainty is within the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty induced by not modelling real gas effects in modern gas turbine engines.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For combustion products of natural gas dedicated tables or polynomials should be used. Errors in evaluating the isobaric heat capacity can be as much as 4 per cent, if the tables or polynomials used were originally produced for combustion products of Jet-A.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Errors induced by not accounting for dissociation effects in velocity and effective flow area calculations, for military afterburners or high OPR combustors, are significant. For heat addition and expansion calculations, the errors are also significant at temperatures greater than 1800 K.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effects of dissociation on major performance parameters during design-point and off-design performance calculations are significant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dissociation effects can generally be ignored for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions predictions and perhaps NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> environmental impact assessments; the errors induced are more than an order of magnitude smaller compared to the uncertainty of the prediction methods that are typically used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Accurate fluid modelling of the working fluid is essential when assessing novel and/or aggressive cycles at aircraft system level; the systematic errors induced in the predictions by not accounting for dissociation effects should not be ignored. For conventional cycles running at relatively low combustor outlet temperatures (i.e. less than 1800 K), a complicated fluid model that accounts for dissociation effects may not be necessary.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For an intercooled cycle with a high OPR the ideal gas assumption does not hold very well and if the ideal isothermal compression process is to be considered significant calculation errors should be expected.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The main conclusion coming out of this study is that the uncertainties in gas turbine thermo-fluid modelling are not negligible, and should not be ignored in neither analytical gas turbine studies or within the educational procedure. Future engineers need to be well aware of the induced uncertainty in their calculations and treat their assumptions and results accordingly. Although, some of the simplifications made were certainly justifiable for the first turbofan engine designs – if one considers the computational means available during that period – performance engineers should use them nowadays under caution for conceptual design of future propulsion systems.</p>
<p>The accuracy/uncertainty of an overall engine model will always be better than the mean accuracy/uncertainty of the individual component estimates as long as systematic errors are carefully examined and reduced to acceptable levels to ensure error propagation does not cause significant discrepancies. The results obtained demonstrated that accurate modelling of the working fluid is essential, especially for assessing novel and/or aggressive cycles at aircraft system level. Where radical design space exploration is concerned, improving the accuracy of the fluid model will need to be carefully balanced with the computational time penalties involved.</p>
<p>A strong theoretical foundation was produced in this study but additional effort still needs to be taken to address further issues including empirical estimation of fluid composition following fast chilling of products of dissociation, using simple but robust models. Future research activities could address further issues including an analysis of the trade-off between improving the accuracy of multi-disciplinary simulations at aircraft system level – by accounting for real gas effects – against computational time penalties induced by the increased modelling complexity.</p></sec>
