<abstract>
<p>More attention must be given to the performance of interlocal agreements (ILAs) as they continue to grow in popularity as a mode of service provision in U.S. cities. This study scrutinizes the democratic performance of ILAs, drawing theoretical insights from the literature on network governance. Because ILAs shift service responsibility from individual cities to multijurisdictional arrangements, these tools may lead to complaints about the responsiveness of the service to the public in the individual units served by the multijurisdictional arrangement. Thus, democratic anchorage is central to assessments of ILA performance. This study evaluates democratic anchorage by identifying concerns with ILAs in interviews with a sample of local elected officials in Michigan. The concerns then are discussed in the context of the institutional collective action framework, a theoretical foundation that has become popular for explaining the emergence of ILAs and regional cooperation.</p>

<p>Interlocal agreements (ILAs) for the delivery of public goods and services are growing in popularity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074010397532">Warner and Hefetz (2009)</xref> report that intergovernmental contracting for municipal services is now more widespread than contracting with private sector firms. They explain local governments hope to save money, create economies of scale, and strengthen collaboration and regional service integration through contracting relationships with neighboring governments. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074010397532">Chen and Thurmaier (2009)</xref> find local governments turn to interlocal models of service delivery to bolster the efficiency and effectiveness of city services. ILAs are of both practical and theoretical use. ILAs have intrigued scholars for many years because they represent conscious efforts to organize public goods and services on a scale that is different than traditional lines of local government incorporation and jurisdiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074010397532">Friesema, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074010397532">Marando, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074010397532">McGinnis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074010397532">Morgan &amp; Hirlinger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074010397532">Oakerson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0275074010397532">Smith, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074010397532">Stewart &amp; Ketcham, 1941</xref>). Recently, new energies have been devoted to explaining the adoption of ILAs as a local government service production choice, as well as their patterns of use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074010397532">Andrew, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074010397532">Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074010397532">Carr, Gerber, &amp; Lupher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074010397532">Carr, LeRoux, &amp; Shrestha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074010397532">Lackowiska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074010397532">LeRoux &amp; Carr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074010397532">LeSage, McMillan, &amp; Hepburn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074010397532">Matkin &amp; Frederickson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074010397532">Steiner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074010397532">Thurmaier &amp; Wood, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074010397532">Visser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074010397532">Wood, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074010397532">2008</xref>). Despite popularity and increased attention, we remain uncertain about the performance and benefits of ILAs for local government. As we begin to evaluate the performance of ILAs, we must ask if these tools for service delivery perform as expected by those who agreed to the joint service production relationship. In other words, we must investigate the democratic anchorage and performance of ILAs.</p>
<p>This study borrows theoretical insights from the study of network governance to evaluate how local elected officials discuss the democratic anchorage and performance of ILAs. ILAs are one small part of a larger trend toward service provision through contract and network relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074010397532">Frederickson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074010397532">Peters &amp; Pierre, 1998</xref>). As more public goods and services are provided through hybrid arrangements that involve multiple public and private organizations, scholars concerned with the legitimacy and accountability of these arrangements have begun to ask more focused questions about their <italic>democratic performance</italic> (Compare (cf.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074010397532">Bogason &amp; Musso, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074010397532">Considine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074010397532">Heikkila &amp; Isett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074010397532">Koppell, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074010397532">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074010397532">Mathur &amp; Skelcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074010397532">Mullin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074010397532">Papadopoulos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074010397532">Skelcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074010397532">Sørensen, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074010397532">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074010397532">Sørensen &amp; Torfing, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074010397532">1</xref></sup> At the center of these discussions, one can identify a normative concern—complex governance arrangements should not only provide service effectively, but also in a manner that is responsive and accountable to the demands and interests of a democratic polity. Increasingly, the term <italic>democratic anchorage</italic> is used in the governance literature to describe the institutions developed to link the problem solving in multiorganizational settings to the public and to democratic processes to enhance accountability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074010397532">Skelcher, Mathur, &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074010397532">Sørensen &amp; Torfing, 2003</xref>). Although the term <italic>democratic anchorage</italic> is emergent, the underlying problem of democratic accountability has prompted ongoing debate in the field of public administration (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074010397532">Behn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074010397532">Bellone &amp; Goerl, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074010397532">Bryer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074010397532">Finer, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074010397532">Kirlin, 1996</xref>). The topic takes on new urgency as public managers find themselves pushing responsibilities out of traditional public organizations and into networked or multiorganizational settings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074010397532">2</xref></sup> For local government managers, ILAs may be viewed as an innovative strategy to redesign services to meet local needs. Yet savvy managers are aware that these innovations might only be deemed successful if they have the support of local elected officials and the public.</p>
<p>The pages ahead explain why the debate about democratic anchorage and performance in the literature on governance networks should be taken seriously by scholars and practitioners of local government. The primary goal of this study is to begin to measure local government officials’ democratic anchorage concerns about ILAs. As such, a sample of interviews with local elected officials in Michigan is used to construct a measure of concern about the democratic anchorage of ILAs. After the concerns are identified, they will be discussed in the context of the institutional collective action (ICA) framework developed by Richard Feiock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074010397532">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010397532">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010397532">2009</xref>) and his research collaborators. The ICA framework has become a popular foundation for studying why local governments turn to ILAs and other cooperative mechanisms. The argument and evidence sketched here should prompt further consideration of the outcomes of ILAs for the public served by these innovative arrangements.</p>

<title>Interlocal Agreements and the Democratic Anchorage of Governance Arrangements</title>
<p>Local governments in the United States have a variety of choices available when providing public goods and services to their residents. Historically, ILAs have been studied alongside other production choices, such as contracts with private sector firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074010397532">Ferris &amp; Graddy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074010397532">Joassart-Marcelli &amp; Musso, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074010397532">Lamothe, Lamothe, &amp; Feiock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074010397532">Stein, 1990</xref>). Yet because of their growing popularity and utility to local governments, ILAs have been getting more attention in their own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074010397532">Andrew, 2009a</xref>). ILAs, or what some label “government-to-government contracts,” have features that might be more appealing to local governments than other contract relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074010397532">Marvel and Marvel (2008)</xref> suggest governments may trust other governments more than private contractors for the delivery of important services. Local officials may feel that neighboring governments have congruent policy interests, and that congruence reduces the likelihood of the contract partner acting opportunistically, creating problems for service delivery and the contract relationship. Their argument is consistent with evidence that suggests interlocal contracts are bolstered by social ties within metropolitan communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074010397532">Andrew, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074010397532">Carr, LeRoux, &amp; Shrestha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074010397532">Feiock, Tao, &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074010397532">LeRoux, Brandenburger, &amp; Pandey, 2010</xref>). Patterns of social interaction among local governments have the potential to yield a cooperative web of service relationships within a metropolitan area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074010397532">Oakerson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, we must be aware of the limits to this argument. Vincent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074010397532">Ostrom (1983)</xref> offers an important point of caution, writing, “Contractual arrangements are meaningful only where instrumentalities are independent or autonomous, capable of saying no, maintaining an arm’s-length relationship when necessary, and undertaking cooperative arrangements when mutual advantage can be gained” (p. 144). For local governments to benefit from ILAs, they must evaluate how these service relationships with other governments contribute to the well-being of their own jurisdiction. The efficacy and performance of an ILA should be scrutinized, just as a contract with a private sector firm would be scrutinized, to ensure the parties are receiving mutual advantage. Honadle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074010397532">1984</xref>, p. 306) argues local governments may have difficulty equitably dividing the costs of interlocal cooperation, and may also fear a loss of local control. These concerns highlight a need for both city governments and public administration researchers to assess the performance of ILAs.</p>
<p>In his review of the recent literature, Andrew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074010397532">2009a</xref>, p. 140) notes few scholars have examined the benefits of ILAs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074010397532">Chen and Thurmaier (2009)</xref> offer one of the few studies assessing ILA performance. They argue ILAs should be evaluated in the context of the strategic goals originally stated for the ILA by the participant communities. Using survey evidence about ILAs in Iowa, they find managers are more satisfied with goal achievement when the participants equitably share the costs and benefits of the ILA. Although this initial evidence is reassuring, there is reason to give more attention to ILA performance. Some city officials remain concerned that ILAs cannot live up to their promises. Warner and Hefetz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074010397532">2009</xref>, p. 19) report that 32.4% of respondents to an International City/County Management Association survey express concern about the difficulty of monitoring intergovernmental agreements, and 64.1% express concern about loss of community control. Both of these sources highlight that understanding officials’ perceptions of performance and expectations for performance are critical to ILA evaluation.</p>
<p>Democratic anchorage is one important dimension of performance, and is the focus of this study. Theoretical insights can be borrowed from the network governance literature to help analyze the democratic anchorage of ILAs. New governance arrangements, like networks and ILAs, remove some policymaking, implementation, and oversight activities from their traditional homes in formal government jurisdictions and move them to a multiorganizational setting. Although the network arrangement may allow public officials the flexibility to rethink the design of public services and propose innovative solutions, multiorganizational workspaces are said to lack the procedural norms of policymaking found in traditional government bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074010397532">Considine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074010397532">Skelcher, 2005</xref>). Thus, when policy responsibilities shift to networks, citizens and administrators must proactively assess how the network is being held accountable to the polity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0275074010397532">Sørensen and Torfing (2005)</xref> explain “governance networks are democratically anchored to the extent that they are properly linked to different political constituencies and to a relevant set of democratic norms that are part of the democratic ethos of society” (p. 201). The anchoring of governance networks is often achieved through the careful incorporation of citizens and community organizations in the process of network governance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074010397532">Bogason &amp; Musso, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074010397532">Munro, Roberts, &amp; Skelcher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074010397532">Sørensen, 2002</xref>). By incorporating a broader scope of actors in policy development and decision making, citizens and community organizations anchor complex network arrangements with their ongoing participation and direct oversight.</p>
<p>Networks can also be anchored to the public through traditional institutions of representative democracy like legislatures or city councils. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0275074010397532">Sørensen and Torfing (2005)</xref> argue elected politicians can play an active role in the democratic anchorage of networks:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The basic rationale for aiming to anchor governance networks in democratically elected politicians is that government control of governance networks helps to make sure that the public policy and governance produced by these networks is in line with the popular will expressed by the political majority of the elected assemblies. Hence, elected politicians can lend democratic legitimacy to governance networks in so far as they are capable of controlling the formation, functioning and development of governance networks. (p. 202)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They suggest elected politicians may be active in the <italic>metagovernance</italic> of networks through network design, framing, and direct participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074010397532">Sørensen (2006)</xref> argues further that elected officials should play a “dominating role in the exercise of metagovernance” (p. 104). However, her empirical findings highlight a more limited role. Sørensen’s research on the role perceptions of Danish local politicians shows that elected politicians do not focus on promoting democracy in the process of network governance, and focus instead on promoting efficiency. Still, great potential exists for elected officials to engage in metagovernance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074010397532">O’Toole (2007)</xref> explains public authorities can guide networks by changing the rules and incentives under which a network operates, by providing assistance, or by segmenting network goals or operations over time. Although governments may have limited control over some networks, O’Toole’s observations help clarify the relevance of this literature for the study of ILAs.</p>
<p>The theoretical concerns exhibited in discussions about the democratic performance of network governance can be extended to ILAs and other forms of interlocal cooperation. ILAs are distinct from networks because networks are often considered to be self-regulating groups. In contrast, ILAs tend to be bilateral or multilateral contracts among governments, simplifying the scope of actors involved and the challenges of negotiation. Also, because ILAs are often formal contract arrangements, elected officials find themselves in a stronger position to participate in governance than the metagovernance discussed in the network literature. The elected officials may have had a role in deciding to enter the ILA, may monitor and offer feedback on the relationship over time, and may pressure their jurisdiction to change the terms of participation or exit the agreement. Still, the multiorganizational context of the ILA, like the network, attenuates the control of the elected officials. No one jurisdiction is in full control of budgets, service levels, or the response to public complaints about service quality. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074010397532">O’Toole’s (2007)</xref> observations, the elected officials may advocate for new terms to govern the ILA relationship, or may encourage their jurisdiction to contribute more resources or professional support to the joint venture. However, no one jurisdiction is in full control. At the same time, city council members, as elected representatives in individual jurisdictions, may be called on by the public to address problems with the service provided through the ILA. The extent to which the elected officials believe they are in a position to influence the performance of the ILA is an empirical question. The elected officials’ perceptions of problems with ILA-service responsiveness to the demands of their individual jurisdiction and constituency are one measure of the democratic anchorage of the ILA. For this study, the concerns of city council members about ILA performance will be identified through narrative analysis by evaluating a random sample of semistructured elite interviews, as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0275074010397532">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074010397532">Sørensen (2006)</xref>, this study relies on interviews with local elected officials for data. The data come from 47 semistructured interviews conducted with city council members and mayors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074010397532">3</xref></sup> in Michigan during the year 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074010397532">4</xref></sup> The interview participants come from a random sample of fifty local elected officials, stratified by city population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074010397532">5</xref></sup> Forty-seven of the 50 interviews were recorded with a digital audio recorder, and the recorded interviews provide the data for analysis in this study. Elite interviews are not an uncommon source of data for research on bureaucracy and governance, but different methods for gleaning data from interviews have been incorporated into the field over time. In the interviews used here, elected officials were queried about their experiences with ILAs in two specific service areas (policing and land use) and were offered the opportunity to speak further about an ILA in a service area of their choice. For each service area, respondents were given the opportunity to answer five questions that might elicit concerns about the democratic anchorage of the ILA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0275074010397532">6</xref></sup> These questions might elicit zero, one, or multiple concerns illuminating the democratic anchorage of an ILA. This provides an opportunity for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074010397532">Aberbach, Chesney, and Rockman (1975)</xref> label <italic>global coding</italic>. Global coding is based on the coder’s judgments from the interview transcript about general traits or styles, and these codes are based on some level of interpretation by the researcher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0275074010397532">7</xref></sup> In this investigation, the researcher must interpret how the concerns about the use of ILAs articulated by the elected officials are indicative of broader themes about how ILAs are linked to individual units of local government and the citizens in those units.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this approach to analyzing the interviews rests on two important assumptions. First, the stories that elected officials tell about their experiences with ILAs are a useful form of data. Narratives can provide insight into public administration as experienced by those involved in the daily operations of governing. Narratives have the potential to reveal underlying logics of action by public officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074010397532">Ospina &amp; Dodge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0275074010397532">White, 1999</xref>). The examples from the elected officials in the pages ahead provide a nuanced picture of how elected representatives scrutinize the links between ILAs and their own units of local government. The narratives have been coded into categories and will be discussed later in the context of an existing theoretical framework; but individual readers have the potential to derive their own unique understanding from the elected officials’ words by reflecting on the officials’ interests and potential courses of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074010397532">Hummel, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the form and content of the data have utility for public officials. Public administration research has been critiqued for its lack of relevance to practitioners in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074010397532">Streib, Slotkin, &amp; Rivera, 2001</xref>). Although the primary goal of this research is to draw links between theories of democratic network governance and alternative service delivery in local government, the research should also make a relevant contribution to the practice of governance. This research has potential for practical relevance because the thick descriptions from the interviews provide a level of detail about elected officials’ logic and motivations that cannot be found in a large-<italic>N</italic> data set or survey data. Awareness of the concerns from elected officials may help public managers as they design and manage ILAs. The scope of ILA concerns reported here might prompt attention to aspects of interlocal cooperation that local officials might have otherwise neglected. As such, this study is a useful complement to ongoing developments in ILA research.</p>
<p>In contrast to the research on local politicians by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074010397532">Sørensen (2006)</xref>, this analysis does not seek to determine local elected officials’ perceptions of their <italic>roles</italic> in the process of ILA adoption and oversight. This is an important distinction. The assumption is made that local elected officials may have concerns about the democratic anchorage of ILAs and be able to articulate those concerns, but not take direct action or intervention in the ILA relationship themselves. Councils may view the adoption of ILAs as a policy question for their city, whereas implementation of the ILA and day-to-day management in the service area may be viewed as the responsibility of the city manager. This assumption is consistent with the practice of council-manager government in which city council members focus on their policymaking and oversight responsibilities, but norms emanating from the politics-administration dichotomy restrain their involvement in direct administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0275074010397532">8</xref></sup> Thus, the focus of analysis is the <italic>content</italic> of expressed concerns about ILAs, not <italic>how</italic> the officials participate in the process of ILA adoption or oversight. Measuring the content of council members’ concerns is critical to our understanding of their expectations for the democratic performance of ILAs.</p>

<title>Findings: A Measure of Democratic Anchorage for ILAs</title>
<p>From the interviews, 12 themes are identified in the concerns elected officials express about the use of ILAs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074010397532">Table 1</xref> presents a summary of these concerns, including a label for the concern, a representative statement from the interviews, and the number of officials who articulated the concern at least once in the interview.

<fn id="table-fn1-0275074010397532">
<p>Note: Frequency refers to the number of local elected officials who mentioned the concern. A concern might be mentioned more than once within an interview, but would only be reported as one observation for the interview as a whole.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The most frequently referenced concern, mentioned by 15 officials, is the cost formula or the distribution of the costs for shared services. As one elected official shared, “Rationality reigns supreme, and in the end, it was the numbers that really counted.” The official explained his community left an ILA for waste incineration because the joint effort was no longer as economical as providing waste disposal alone. “I think what’s fair to say is it’s a majoritarian process, and a majority just finally recognized that there was no future in incineration . . . No cost-effective future,” the official concluded. Here, democratic anchorage is provided by elected officials monitoring the financial bottom line for individual jurisdictions, and using their jurisdiction’s financial interest to argue for an end to an ILA with costs exceeding benefits. Elected officials exercise their oversight responsibilities by asking for cost formulae that are transparent and understandable. A different council member noted, “I said, you know there ought to be a way to establish these rates that’s based on some sort of foundation that’s really not questionable. That [way] nobody can say we’re just trying to stick the townships.” Elected officials may ask for more specific line item accounting for a clear understanding of how costs are being shared. Elected officials can also represent the interests of their jurisdiction’s taxpayers by asking for adjustments to cost sharing when necessary. An elected official shared:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess I’m the bean counter on the city commission . . . and the rates were fixed and the cost was becoming greater to the city than the benefits or the rates being paid by the township, so we did a recalculation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Careful monitoring of costs is the most widespread way in which elected officials seek to determine if an ILA is anchored to the interests of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Employment policy, employee interests, and control of personnel is a second area in which elected officials express concern about ILAs, with 13 officials identifying challenges in this area. Some elected officials view city employees as a group of stakeholders whose interests must be considered for an ILA to be a success. One elected official expressed regret about a new ILA shifting service provision responsibility to a neighboring jurisdiction. “That hurt me because I like to see local people. We would like to keep our people in the city but we just couldn’t do it anymore.” Other officials are concerned that multijurisdictional arrangements will not provide sufficient staffing to allow for appropriate levels of service. “They tried to approach it like instead of two people doing two different jobs, one [person] doing two jobs. So that wasn’t an efficient way to do things,” explained a council member. In this category, another concern articulated by elected officials involves the reluctance of a department head to implement an ILA supported by the city council. One council member explained that policymakers had to discount the opinion of a department head when determining whether or not an ILA was right for their community. The council member stated, “He’s a very excitable and vehement individual with strong opinions and gave us lots of dire predictions that the sky would fall down. Over time, we’ve just learned to ignore most of what he says and move forward.” Public administrators and employee groups help shape the dialogue about interlocal cooperation, and elected officials appear to consider employment policies and employee interests in their calculations. Elected officials can also be critical, serving as a democratic check on the city bureaucracy, when they perceive employee interests to be out of line with the best course of action for the city.</p>
<p>A more direct democratic anchorage link is evident with the third concern, community opinion or preferences, mentioned by 12 elected officials. First, elected officials may encourage democratic anchorage of ILAs by developing venues for direct public participation in discussions about ILA adoption. One council member explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We held a lot of public forums before they even decided. Number one [the public] defined the problem and let people design their options to fix the problem, and then we brought in the experts to help us along, fix the problem.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The public may also provide the pressure needed for government to adopt an ILA. A council member explained a partner’s motivations in this way: “No, they ended up participating because their constituents kicked their butts and said you get in there and you participate.” Second, elected officials may feel they have a responsibility to educate the public about how an ILA would affect services in their community. Discussing police dispatch, one elected official explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Part of the problem you’ve got is that the public doesn’t understand, and so they perceive that for somebody to dispatch a car to them, they’ve got to be sitting in the office here in [this city] . . . So we didn’t do as good a job on educating the public about it as we probably should have.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>City residents may also be reluctant to accept the changes that come along with an ILA. A council member in another city explained that a police dispatch counter in city hall was closed when an ILA was adopted. The council member noted, “We have a number of citizens that were very concerned about that, and I will still on a rare occasion get a senior citizen who says well I still wish we had our own dispatch.” Elected officials play the role of democratic intermediaries between government and citizens within their jurisdictions, both translating public demands into policy and informing the public about government action.</p>
<p>Concern about maintaining control over the quality of services was mentioned by seven elected officials in this sample. Elected officials may feel that they have an ongoing responsibility to monitor the quality of shared services. One city council member suggested, “Of course the city always feels that we’re providing adequate service for the money and the townships always feel it could be better, but it’s just [the] nature of the beast.” Elected officials have the responsibility of understanding the needs and interests of their individual city, and translating these needs into service priorities. This form of democratic anchorage is evident in a debate over priorities for ambulance service. A city involved in an ILA for ambulance service debated whether speed of service to the hospital or advanced training for ambulance staff was a greater priority. The council member explained that the presence of a hospital in the city made the priority clear for his city. He explained, “Debate raged about what’s the best service that we can render to our residents, and it was our decision that speed was of the essence and get them to a hospital.” Quality concerns also help elected officials draw lines around which services are and are not appropriate for multijurisdictional arrangements. One elected official articulated support for shared dispatch services, but would not support shared police patrol. The official explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>As long as our police department is going to take it from this end, that would be my only concern . . . [The neighboring township] can wait anywhere from a half hour to an hour and a half for a police officer to show up. I don’t ever want our citizens to be in that position.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Quality control is one additional way in which elected officials attempt to anchor ILAs to their individual jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Less frequent, but of interest to those who study collaboration, is concern about the distribution of benefit for residents, which was mentioned by six officials. Elected representatives might anchor ILAs to their jurisdiction when they advocate for their jurisdiction’s fair share of services, or pursue ILAs with clear benefits for their city. This concern was articulated by some officials, including the city council member who commented on a cooperative agreement for land transfer to allow the development of a retirement community. The council member explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the major drawbacks was that the [institution conducting the development] is tax free . . . and a lot of our citizens are concerned about whether it’s going to be tax free or whether the city’s going to derive some taxes from it, and we don’t know that at this point in time.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The logic for collective action might be weakened if the official cannot demonstrate financial gain for his jurisdiction and constituents. However, some officials are not concerned about gain for their jurisdiction alone, and express interest in the gains for all parties to the agreement. This sentiment is consistent with the literature on collaboration, which suggests reciprocity is critical to collaborative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074010397532">Bingham, O’Leary, &amp; Carlson, 2008</xref>). One elected official recognized this need for reciprocity, stating, “We have to work with the townships, so we have to make sure that they do get something out of it as well.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074010397532">Matkin and Frederickson (2009)</xref> make a similar distinction in their analysis of perceptions of benefit for individual jurisdictions versus the larger regional community, but these findings point to the need for continued scrutiny of how officials understand the distribution of benefits of ILAs.</p>
<p>Some of the concerns expressed by elected officials are not extensively considered in the existing literature on ILAs. Scholars have identified that the transaction cost characteristics of public goods, including asset specificity and service measurability, make some services more amenable to provision through ILA than other services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074010397532">Brown &amp; Potoski, 2003</xref>). Yet we do not know how these characteristics enter into the decision-making calculations of officials. Several elected officials in this research express concerns related to the technology of service provision, and these concerns help illustrate how technical considerations related to service provision may shape policymakers’ understanding of whether an ILA is right for their community. A city’s choices about ILA participation may be limited by other governments’ choices about the adoption of a specific technology, as the example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074010397532">Table 1</xref> illustrates. Technology also shapes the capacity of a city to maintain a successful cooperative relationship with another jurisdiction. A council member explained a technical problem with a shared service partner:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>They owed a huge amount of money, and they simply hadn’t paid it. Evidently, the city didn’t have a mechanism for billing them monthly or for however they are supposed to do it. It is just one of those things that slipped through the cracks . . . I mean it was a little bit of an embarrassment to the city, too, that they didn’t keep track well enough to know that they hadn’t been paid.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Technology offers another area in which city councils might exercise their responsibilities in government oversight on behalf of the public. A council member indicated her city’s shared dispatch and 911 center was “moving along at a turtle’s pace” with the integration of new geographic information system (GIS) technology. The council member noted:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>But the public doesn’t really look into the thing that deep to know whether we have it or not. We did talk about that at the last council meeting, trying to get a little fire built under the folks that are responsible for bringing it up.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, although technology may limit choices about service provision, technological concerns offer council members another dimension of shared service to scrutinize.</p>
<p>Six additional concerns are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074010397532">Table 1</xref>, including service capacity, the mechanisms used for cooperation, ownership and control of assets, the need for meetings and communication, generic disagreements among jurisdictions, and uncertainty about the future of joint activity. In nine of the 47 interviews, no concerns about ILAs were expressed. Officials in these cities may be completely satisfied with their ILA relationships, or may lack a detailed knowledge of how ILAs are being used to provide city services. This research cannot tell us about the extent of elected officials’ efforts to provide democratic anchorage for ILAs, but the categories in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074010397532">Table 1</xref> provide a clearer picture of the content of elected officials’ concerns about ILA anchorage, an important step for future research assessing ILA performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0275074010397532">
<title>Implications: Why Does Democratic Anchorage Matter for the Study and Use of ILAs?</title>
<p>So far, the concept of <italic>democratic anchorage</italic> has been introduced from the literature on network governance and applied to the study of ILAs. The interview data demonstrates how democratic anchorage might be practiced by elected officials in local government. The theoretical argument and qualitative data outlined in this article can serve as a springboard for the measurement of democratic anchorage of ILAs, and for hypothesis testing. To make the concept of democratic anchorage more useful for the study of ILAs, one can reflect on anchorage in the context of existing theory. The suggestion of some possible hypotheses should help make the case that our understanding of interlocal cooperation will be advanced if researchers systematically account for democratic anchorage in future research.</p>
<p>One of the most comprehensive frameworks for explaining ILA use, and other forms of interlocal cooperation, is Richard Feiock’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074010397532">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010397532">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010397532">2009</xref>) Institutional Collective Action (ICA) framework. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010397532">Feiock (2008)</xref>, “ICA focuses on how local government officials perceive and weigh the various costs and benefits of joint action as they contemplate interlocal service agreements and other forms of intergovernmental collaboration” (p. 196). Collective action is pursued by local governments when joint action satisfactorily addresses the externalities of problems that single units cannot address alone, when joint gains can be made from cooperation, and when the benefits of collective action outweigh the transaction costs associated with organizing the ILA or some other mechanism of cooperation. A variety of transaction cost barriers must be overcome for local governments to undertake collective action, including bargaining and negotiation costs, costs related to monitoring, heterogeneity of preferences within the community, and existing social and policy relationships with neighboring governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074010397532">Feiock, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074010397532">2009</xref>, pp. 369-370).</p>
<p>Using the ICA framework as a theoretical foundation, future studies might investigate how democratic anchorage raises or lowers the transaction costs associated with institutional collective action. Given the anchorage concerns outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074010397532">Table 1</xref>, one may hypothesize that incorporating democratic anchorage in ILA governance could produce either result. For example, elected officials may request periodic meetings and reports to assess whether shared services are providing the desired results for their city. Monitoring and performance reporting might increase the administrative costs of shared service provision, demanding staff time to prepare and report performance data. At the same time, providing performance data to elected officials may decrease the probability of future information asymmetries about service performance, reducing future negotiating costs when ILAs are renegotiated or renewed. These hypotheses could be tested if future research focuses attention on ILA performance and democratic anchorage.</p>
<p>The interviews with local elected officials in Michigan provide insight into how democratic anchorage can exacerbate some of the transaction costs identified in the ICA framework. For example, local government jurisdictions may have distinct preferences for public goods and services based in part on the opinions and preferences of their residents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010397532">Feiock (2008)</xref> argues “Social and economic homogeneity places cities in similar bargaining positions and thus makes an equal sharing of costs a workable solution” (p. 201). Elected officials were able to identify instances in which differences in community preferences increased the barriers to cooperation. One elected official explained that his neighboring township contained “some very hard core agricultural interests” that “didn’t quite understand the reasoning” behind a shared land use agreement. In the negotiation of cooperative agreements, elected officials might feel significant pressure from constituents not to compromise on their jurisdiction’s service values or preferences. Differences in community preferences may reduce the probability of adopting an ILA, or might produce challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of ILAs that have been adopted despite differences in opinion.</p>
<p>The interviews also reveal that democratic anchorage and the participation of elected officials may help mitigate transaction costs identified in the ICA framework. For example, Feiock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074010397532">2008</xref>, p. 199) explains that barriers to cooperation may increase if future enforcement costs are perceived to be high. Elected officials may help their communities anticipate points of disagreement and build enforcement mechanisms into ILAs when agreements are first negotiated and adopted. A city council member shared that he anticipated disagreements on appropriate staffing for a jointly operated police department, especially if the cities experienced turnover in the positions of police chief or city manager. The council member explained, “we put benchmarks in there as to when we would add staff or cut staff on call volumes, and a matrix of different things that would say we need to put another officer on.” By addressing future staffing-level decisions in the initial contract, the council member believed the cities created “a real model of sharing a department between two communities.” In the context of the ICA framework, democratic anchorage in this example increases initial bargaining costs by making the initial contract more complex, but reduces future enforcement costs and enhances credible commitments.</p>
<p>The ICA framework also directs attention to the different tools or mechanisms that may be used to organize collective action. Feiock and Scholz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074010397532">2010</xref>, p. 16) argue that the mechanisms available for ICA vary in the degree to which they preserve autonomy for the participants. For example, ILAs allow the participant governments to preserve more autonomy than the establishment of a special district. Different mechanisms might also allow different levels of democratic anchorage, requiring different levels of involvement by elected officials, stakeholder groups, and citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0275074010397532">10</xref></sup> The interviews with city council members in Michigan suggest that elected officials are aware that different mechanisms for cooperation provide different levels of anchorage and service control. A council member explained that his city formed an ILA with a neighboring city to obtain wastewater service, even though the cities had initially considered forming an independent authority. He noted, “They said they wanted to own [the wastewater treatment plant] and that’s the way it ended up . . . they weren’t going to do an authority.” A council member in a different city with a wastewater treatment contract expressed a desire “to have actually a representative of our city on an independent board” to oversee the wastewater service, so that the city would have “someone on a position over there that would have some oversight as a responsible accountable method back to our residents.” Because of the diversity of mechanisms used for ICA in U.S. metropolitan areas, we have an ideal laboratory for investigating variations in the form and use of democratic anchorage, and the implications of that anchorage for the performance of shared local government services (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074010397532">Musso, Weare, Oztas, &amp; Loges, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This research also has practical implications for local government officials. Many of the council members interviewed express conceptual support for interlocal cooperation. As one council member explained, “Anything can be done if you put your mind to it. Anything’s workable with a little flexibility.” Still, council members perceive challenges in working out terms of cooperation that will provide service results as good as, if not better than, providing the service alone. The literatures on institutional collective action and the democratic performance of networks can help alert local government officials to the challenges associated with successful interlocal cooperation. The concerns of elected officials outlined in this research indicate that elected officials are interested in the benefits of cooperation for their own jurisdiction, but also understand the need for mutual advantage or reciprocity. Elected officials may call for mechanisms of cooperation and cost formulas that are transparent to the public and easy to understand. In the areas of service quality and capacity, elected officials might keenly monitor new ILAs to ensure their jurisdiction is receiving all promised benefits. When considering ILAs for service provision, local government managers should take time to consider how elected officials might provide a link of democratic accountability between the citizens within their city and the service provided through the ILA.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Assessing the performance of ILAs and other mechanisms for shared service provision in local government will be a critical task for public administration researchers in the years ahead. We know ILAs are frequently used, but have only just begun to assess if they deliver the promised results. Studying performance will direct some researchers’ attention to financial outcomes and service efficiencies. The democratic anchorage and performance of ILAs must also be part of the discussion and research agenda. This investigation draws on theoretical insights about the democratic performance of networks to scrutinize how ILAs are linked to the expectations of the public in the individual cities participating in service sharing. Narrative analysis helped identify 12 distinct concerns that city council members expressed about the use of ILAs. This evidence begins to establish some connection between elected officials’ concerns about ILAs and barriers to institutional collective action hypothesized in existing literature. This study provides evidence to support the claim that elected officials play a role in the democratic anchorage of ILAs, and points to areas in which more specific hypotheses can be tested in the future. The investigation points to opportunities for fruitful integration of the research on democratic network governance, ILAs, and institutional collective action. Integrating these literatures further will aid public administration scholars and practitioners as they assess ILA performance. Furthermore, the research offers an example of how positivist and interpretive research paradigms can produce complementary knowledge. The study of ILAs and mechanisms for cooperative governance will require multiple research methods, including interviews and narrative analysis to uncover the complex interests, concerns, and strategies of the actors involved in decision making and service evaluation.</p>

<p>As noted, the reader should compare the referenced works. Concern about the democratic anchorage, performance, and accountability of new governance arrangements is not isolated to networks arrangements. Recent studies have scrutinized the democratic anchorage of a variety of governance arrangements, including special district governments and quasi-autonomous nongovernmental organizations. The reader should also be aware of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074010397532">Catlaw’s (2009)</xref> thoughtful critique which challenges us to reconsider our understanding of the representation of the people or the public interest in the networked setting. Collectively, these references should illustrate public administration’s broad interest in the relationship between governance arrangements and democratic anchorage, the same concern that animates this study of ILAs.</p>

<p>In Michigan, several different models are used for the organization of local government. In some cities, mayors are elected independently, and in other cities, the mayor is selected from the city council. Michigan has both strong-mayor and council-manager systems of government. Forty-one of the interviews completed for this project involved officials serving in a city with the council-manager form, with the remaining nine from strong-mayor cities.</p>

<p>A reviewer offered the observation that this research was completed before the start of a major economic recession in late 2007. We cannot say with certainty how the recent economic stress might change elected officials’ perceptions about ILA use in their communities; however, the underlying assumption that elected officials may harbor and express concerns about the use of ILAs, and that these concerns constitute a form of anchorage, has not changed. The intent of this article is not to posit or illuminate any connection between the reasons for ILA adoption and democratic anchorage concerns.</p>

<p>One hundred forty-eight local elected officials were contacted with a letter of invitation to participate in the study. With 50 participants, the response rate was 33.78%. Although not ideal, this is consistent with studies that attempt to contact part-time local elected officials. Invited officials were contacted by telephone through their city hall, and nonrespondents received one additional follow-up letter. The final sample includes 24 interviews with officials from cities with a population from 2,500 to 9,999, 21 interviews with officials in cities with a population from 10,000 to 99,999, and five interviews with officials in cities with a population over 100,000. A stratified sample is called for when the distribution of preferences within a population may be heterogeneous, and when a logical basis exists for delineating groups predicted to have distinct views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074010397532">Babbie, 1990</xref>, pp. 85-87). Small and large cities may have different perspectives on the use of ILAs. Stratification was used for this research to obtain a representative sample that conveys a more complete range of elected officials’ experiences with ILAs. As noted later in this article, a different research design is necessary to analyze systematically which types of cities (based on population or other characteristics) are more likely to express any given anchorage concern.</p>

<p>The questions are as follows: (a) “As a policymaker, are you satisfied with the benefits associated with the project?” (b) “As a policymaker, are you satisfied with the costs associated with the project?” (c) As a policymaker, are you satisfied with the amount of input you have on this joint project?” (d) “If you made decisions on this program again with the information you have now, would you still support working with another jurisdiction?”</p>

<p>This assumption does not suggest that city council members have no role in the oversight of administration and management, but only that norms within the U.S. council-manager system might prompt them to express their concerns in terms of their policy responsibilities, allowing city managers to take action on ILA service management and modification. Regarding these important distinctions, see Svara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074010397532">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074010397532">1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074010397532">Montjoy and Watson (1995)</xref>.</p>
