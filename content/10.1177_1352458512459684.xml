<sec id="section1-1352458512459684">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The use of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters are established in the diagnosis of MS, but poorly as markers of disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512459684">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To investigate the role of OCBs in disease course and progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512459684">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>CSF data for 1120 patients with MS were analyzed for associations between OCBs and CSF parameters and clinical data (disease course [relapsing-onset MS (ROMS) vs primary-progressive MS (PPMS)]), disability progression (proportion reaching Expanded Disability Status Scale 6 within 10 years of onset and progression index) and ethnicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512459684">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of patients with MS, 72.5% had detectable OCBs. For patients with detectable OCBs, 84.6% had ROMS and 15.4% PPMS versus 89.7% and 10.3%, respectively for those without detectable OCBs (<italic>p</italic>=0.04). Total CSF IgG and protein levels were higher in PPMS compared with ROMS (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Disease progression appeared independent of OCB status. Patients with CSF (vs without) data were more likely to be male, older at onset, have PPMS and lack optic neuropathy at onset (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458512459684">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>OCB positivity and elevated total CSF IgG and protein were moderately associated with a PPMS disease course, but not disease progression. Patients with atypical clinical presentations were more likely to have had CSF work-up, suggesting a testing bias.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of disability in young adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512459684">1</xref></sup> yet has an uncertain and largely unpredictable disease course. Both cell-mediated and humoral immunity have been implicated in MS pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512459684">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512459684">3</xref></sup> Intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is associated with oligoclonal banding (OCB), discrete IgG bands detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are not present in the patient’s serum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512459684">4</xref></sup> The presence of two bands unique to the CSF indicates that the patient is OCB positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512459684">5</xref></sup> and is used in the diagnosis of MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512459684">6</xref></sup> being included in the Poser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512459684">7</xref></sup> and both the original and revised McDonald<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512459684">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512459684">9</xref></sup> diagnostic criteria for MS. CSF markers, such as IgG index and synthesis rate, have also been associated with a diagnosis of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512459684">4</xref></sup> OCBs have been detected in up to 90–95% of patients with MS in western countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512459684">10</xref></sup> This appears to vary with ethnicity or geographical location, as only 20–56% of patients with MS in Asian countries, for example, were reported to be OCB positive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512459684">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512459684">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the presence of OCBs in the CSF can be supportive of a diagnosis of MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512459684">6</xref></sup> there is conflicting literature to support the use of CSF markers as predictors of disease course or progression. Primary-progressive MS (PPMS) has been associated with an OCB-positive status in some studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512459684">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512459684"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512459684"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512459684">15</xref></sup> though findings have been inconsistent, and others have shown that OCB-positive patients are more likely to have relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512459684">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512459684">17</xref></sup> In terms of disease progression, patients with MS who are OCB negative appear to have a milder disease course than OCB-positive patients with MS in some studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512459684">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512459684">19</xref></sup> but not all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512459684">20</xref></sup> While these studies have provided important insights, they have had limitations, including having a cross-sectional study design, small sample sizes and an inability to consider extraneous confounders, such as ethnicity. Therefore, there is a need for a controlled, large-scale, longitudinal study to further explore the relationship between OCBs and CSF markers and disease course and progression in patients with MS. We assessed the association of OCB status (the primary focus), as well as IgG fraction, IgG index, IgG synthesis rate and total CSF IgG and protein (secondary focus) with disease course (relapsing-onset MS (ROMS) vs PPMS) and OCB status with progression in patients with definite MS.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1352458512459684">
<title>Patients and study design</title>
<p>This was a retrospective cohort study (based on prospectively collected data) of patients with definite MS (Poser or McDonald criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512459684">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512459684">9</xref></sup> diagnosed by an MS specialist neurologist) registered at one of the four MS clinics in British Columbia (BC), Canada, who had undergone a lumbar puncture (LP) between August 1982 and April 2010 and whose CSF analysis was performed at a Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) institution. VCH serves approximately 25% of BC’s 4 million population, and readily accommodates many patients within BC who reside outside of its geographical boundaries (which typically span the ‘Lower Mainland’ region around Vancouver in the southern, most populated area of BC). The vast majority of CSF samples from across BC are processed by a central VCH clinical chemistry laboratory at Vancouver General Hospital, specialized in CSF analysis and OCB detection (WS, personal communication 2010). All 6935 patients with definite MS as of April 2010 were extracted from the British Columbia Multiple Sclerosis (BCMS) database and linked their electronic laboratory data stored at VCH.</p>
<p>For patients who had undergone multiple LPs, only the earliest was considered. Disease course was classified into either ROMS or PPMS by the MS neurologist. The ROMS group included patients with RRMS and those who progressed to secondary-progressive MS. Maternal and paternal ethnicity were recorded by genetic counsellors and were extracted from the University of British Columbia (UBC) MS Clinic Genetic database and classified into four groups (based on Statistics Canada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512459684">21</xref></sup> and previous similar studies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512459684">6</xref></sup>: (1) Caucasian (European [excluding South European], British Isles, Russian, Scandinavian, Slavic and Ashkenazi Jewish); (2) North American Aboriginals; (3) Asian (Chinese, South East Asian, Japanese, Korean and Filipino); and (4) others (South and West Asian, Black, Latin American and South European). Where ethnicity was heterogeneous, the dominant ethnicity (≥50% of a given ethnic background) was considered. The following patient characteristics were examined for the association with OCB status and CSF markers: sex, ethnicity, age at symptom onset and at the time of LP, onset symptoms (motor, sensory, optic neuropathy and cerebellar/ataxia/brainstem), disease course and time from symptom onset to LP. The possible presence of a ‘testing bias’ was examined by comparing the characteristics of patients who underwent an LP with OCB and/or CSF analysis (<italic>n</italic>=1120) versus those who did not have the procedure/test done or did not have the data available (<italic>n</italic>=5815). Disability progression was examined using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) with two outcomes considered: (1) the progression index, calculated as EDSS divided by disease duration at the time of the last clinical visit, in patients followed for 1 year or more, and (2) proportion of patients with sustained and confirmed EDSS 6 (‘requiring a cane’) within 10 years of symptom onset, defined as reached when all subsequent EDSS scores were ≥6, with at least one score being &gt;150 days later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512459684">
<title>CSF analysis</title>
<p>LPs were performed at the discretion of the attending MS neurologist. OCBs were detected by three different techniques depending on the time period: high resolution agarose gels (1982–1994), isoelectric focusing with silver staining (1995–2003), and isoelectric focusing with immunostaining for IgG (2004–2010). The latter techniques consisted of a commercial kit produced by Sebia: samples were subjected to isoelectric focusing and treated with anti-human IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for OCB detection. All laboratory data were pooled, as there were no significant differences in OCB detection rates for the three techniques used (Table e-1). We were unable to find any differences in patient characteristics between those with one versus two or more unique bands (data not shown), so for the purpose of this study, we included patients with either one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512459684">5</xref></sup> or two OCBs unique to the CSF and defined both as being ‘OCB positive’. CSF and serum IgG and CSF albumin were determined using nephelometric methods. Serum albumin and total protein were measured by dye-binding methods on automated chemistry analyzers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458512459684">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The association between OCBs (primary focus) and other CSF markers (secondary focus) and patient characteristics were analyzed using the student’s <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables, and the Pearson’s chi-square test for categorical variables. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between CSF markers and disease course (ROMS vs PPMS). Adjustment for onset age was specifically made to account for the documented age-associated loss of blood–brain–barrier (BBB) integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512459684">22</xref></sup> and the differing onset ages between the two groups.</p>
<p>Disability progression between those who were OCB positive versus negative was examined in all patients, irrespective of disease course, and separately for patients with PPMS and ROMS and expressed as the progression index (mean±SD, with the student’s <italic>t</italic>-test used to compare the OCB-positive vs OCB-negative groups) and the proportion of patients reaching a sustained and confirmed EDSS 6 within 10 years of symptom onset (derived from Kaplan–Meier survival analysis). The proportions of patients who progressed to EDSS 6 within 10 years of onset were compared using a <italic>Z</italic> statistic: <italic>Z</italic>=|P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>2</sub>| /√ (SE<sup>2</sup>
<sub>1</sub>(P<sub>1</sub>) + SE<sup>2</sup>
<sub>2</sub>(P<sub>2</sub>)) where P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> are the Kaplan–Meier estimates of the progression rate for OCB-positive and OCB-negative patients, respectively, and SE<sub>1</sub> and SE<sub>2</sub> are the corresponding standard errors. <italic>P</italic>-values were subsequently computed based on normal distribution curves. Both approaches ensured inclusion of as many patients as possible; the progression index only required one EDSS score and although the Kaplan–Meier analysis required two or more EDSS scores, the approach used allowed patients already reaching EDSS 6 by the first clinic visit (left-censored) to be included by assuming they had reached EDSS 6 halfway between onset and their first clinic assessment. As our comparison focused on the progression rate at year 10, the actual time of reaching EDSS 6 for these left-censored patients would have no or little effect on the estimated rates. Patients were included in the disease progression analysis, regardless of immunomodulatory drug (IMD) exposure. To examine whether inclusion of these patients impacted findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby EDSS scores recorded after exposure to an IMD were excluded and the two disability progression outcomes were re-examined, as described above.</p>
<p>A <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant. No adjustments were made for multiple testing. All analyses were performed using PASW Statistics (version 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). The Clinical Research Ethics board at the UBC approved the study.</p>

Of those 957 patients, 694 (72.5%) were OCB positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512459684">Table 1</xref>).

Overall, the characteristics of OCB-positive versus OCB-negative patients differed little by sex, onset age, onset symptoms and time from onset to LP or age at LP, although a higher proportion of OCB-positive patients had PPMS relative to OCB-negative patients (<italic>p</italic>=0.040; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512459684">Table 1</xref>).

<p>In this cohort, patients with PPMS were moderately more likely to be OCB positive compared with those with ROMS; this was most striking in the Caucasian patients.

<p>Consistent with the association of OCB positivity and PPMS, we also found evidence of elevations in other CSF markers, with total CSF IgG and protein levels being higher in patients with PPMS than in patients with ROMS. While these formed a secondary aim of the study, these findings are consistent with the pathological data indicating that PPMS is characterized by a more generalized degenerative process in relation to ROMS, which results in diffuse axonal demyelination and injury, suggestive of antibody-mediated injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512459684">23</xref></sup> In addition, CSF oligoclonal IgMs appear to be associated with RRMS, but are rarely found in patients with PPMS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512459684">24</xref></sup> implicating complement-mediated neural injury in RRMS. Our observations indicate heterogeneity in the MS immunopathogenesis and are suggestive of an age-independent process in PPMS, over and above the recognized age-related degenerative damage to the integrity of the BBB, which increases the exudation of serum proteins into the intrathecal space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512459684">22</xref></sup> The direction of our findings remained the same even after adjusting for the patients’ age in both the patients with RRMS and PPMS analyzed for associations between CSF markers and disease course. Caution is advised when interpreting these findings given the interdependence between parameters, for instance, the IgG fraction and the total CSF IgG depend on the serum IgG levels, and it is important to stress that quantitative IgG levels should complement, but not substitute qualitative IgG assessments, as per recommended standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512459684">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>OCB and disease progression</title>
<p>We did not find a measurable relationship between OCB status and disease progression.

This is also in keeping with a recently published study from our group in which we were unable to demonstrate a strong associated between IMD exposure and disease progression in patients with relapsing–remitting MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512459684">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Prevalence of OCB positivity</title>

Whether genetic variation contributed to findings could not be considered, although the prevalence of HLA-DRB1*15 allele subtype which is associated with OCB positivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458512459684">35</xref></sup> has been reported as lower than expected in patients with BC MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458512459684">36</xref></sup> However, given the lower prevalence of MS in Asian countries, the use of less sensitive detection techniques and the occurrence of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) could also contribute to the decreased prevalence of OCBs in these patients. There were three OCB detection assays utilized during the study period and, as expected, the prevalence rates were lower when older techniques were utilized: 72.1% and 70.2% for high-resolution agarose and isoelectric focusing with silver staining, respectively. There was an increase to 79.5% when isoelectric focusing with immunostaining was introduced. The lower sensitivity of the older techniques is likely one of the factors contributing to the overall OCB prevalence rate in our cohort. A ‘testing bias’ could also impact findings and comparability between studies. We are not aware of any similar study examining this issue; however, we observed that patients known to be subject to LP and CSF analyses differed from those who were not. Those tested were more likely to be male, older at onset, have PPMS and lack optic neuropathy at MS onset than those not tested. Our findings suggest that LPs were preferentially used for diagnostically challenging patients, with less common clinical presentations. How this might affect our findings is difficult to predict, but may account for some of the heterogeneity between studies.</p>

<sec id="section21-1352458512459684">
<title>Study limitations and strengths</title>
<p>While the identification of a testing bias is important, it limits the generalizability of our findings. Nonetheless, future studies examining OCB results in patients with MS must consider findings in the context of those tested and those not. Another limitation included the data linkage strategy: first, only approximately 80% of the BC MS population are represented in the BCMS database; second, laboratory data were only obtained for patients who received or had their CSF samples sent to a VCH institution for analysis. Combined, these two factors may introduce another level of selection bias. However, the majority of CSF samples collected in BC were analyzed at Vancouver General Hospital, the central institution in the VCH authority, allowing for increased standardization and reduced interpreter variability. It is worthwhile nothing that we had one of the largest sample sizes relative to other papers on the topic, and that our data were longitudinal in nature, making our study unique.</p>
<p>Over the 28-year study period, OCB detection and MS diagnostic criteria changed; three different OCB detection assays were used and MRI was introduced into clinical practice. The interplay between these factors and the impact on our findings is challenging to predict (we were also unable to determine which version(s) of the diagnostic criteria were used for individual patients). Consistent with the expected increased sensitivity of the isoelectric focusing with immunostaining for IgG assay introduced in 2004, we found a slight increase in OCB positivity during this period. However, MS diagnostic criteria were also modified in 2001 and again in 2005 with the introduction of the McDonald and revised McDonald criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512459684">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512459684">9</xref></sup> Compared with the Poser criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512459684">7</xref></sup> a greater reliance is placed on MRI with the McDonald criteria. These changes likely result in an increased sensitivity, but decreased specificity in the diagnosis of MS. However, under the Poser criteria, patients with clinical signs of MS who would have lacked MRI evidence of MS-specific lesions, now dubbed as MS ‘spectrum’ disorders, including those with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), could have been more likely to be diagnosed with ‘clinically definite’ MS and included in our study. Today, NMO is recognized as a distinct disease state from MS and has been associated with lower OCB-positive prevalence rate of 36%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458512459684">37</xref></sup> In the past some patients with NMO may have been incorrectly diagnosed with MS; given the rarity of NMO, this was unlikely to impact our findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although the role of OCBs and CSF markers in establishing the diagnosis of MS is well studied, relatively little is known about the effects of such parameters on disease outcomes. Here, we showed that OCBs and CSF markers provide limited, albeit important information regarding disease course in MS, but do not appear involved in disease progression.</p>
