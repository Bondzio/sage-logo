<p><italic>Background</italic>: Accurate knowledge of stoma tract length is important to prevent gastric ulcer formation, buried bumper syndrome, and peristomal leakage/infection.

The mean ± SD stoma length was 3.6 ± 0.9 cm in the supine position and 4.9 ± 1.4 cm in the sitting position. The mean ± SD stoma length change from supine to sitting position was 1.53 ± 0.9 cm. Mean ± SD BMI was 21.2 ± 4.5 (range, 14.9–33.8). Stoma length in the supine position (<italic>r</italic> = 0.65, <italic>P</italic> = .0002) and sitting position (<italic>r</italic> = 0.6, <italic>P</italic> = .0009) was strongly correlated with BMI.

<title>Background</title>
<p>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the most common method of long-term enteral feeding. Safe and effective PEG tube placement is not without risk, however, with overall complication rates between 4% and 24%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612438406">1</xref></sup> One important factor in the prevention of stomal complications of percutaneous feeding tubes is accurate knowledge of stoma tract length, defined as the distance between the internal opening in the gastric mucosa and the external opening of the stoma tract at skin surface. When internal and external PEG bolsters are approximated too tightly, decreased blood flow can lead to tissue ischemia and necrosis, placing the patient at risk for leakage, ulceration, hemorrhage, buried bumper syndrome, peristomal infections, and even necrotizing fasciitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612438406">2</xref></sup> Current guidelines and manufacturers’ package inserts recommend 0.5–1 cm of play between the skin and external bumper at initial placement and the same distance when replacing PEGs after measuring stoma tract length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612438406">3</xref></sup> However, this distance is based on expert opinion with little or no animal or clinical data to support this recommendation.</p>
<p>Stoma tract length is largely determined by abdominal wall thickness and thus may increase when patients change from supine to seated or upright positions. Placement of percutaneous feeding tubes, setting of the external bolster, and measurement of stoma tract length are typically done with the patient supine. However, if abdominal wall thickness and stoma tract length increase from the supine to sitting position, patients are potentially at risk if this change is significant and the external bolster is placed inappropriately tight. This is even more important when placing low-profile devices where the distance between the internal and external bolsters is fixed. Currently, there are no data regarding stoma length in the supine position or changes in this length as patients move from supine to sitting positions.</p>
<p>Our primary aim was to determine the change in PEG stoma tract length from supine and sitting positions. We also hypothesized that changes in stoma length from supine to sitting would be greater the more obese the patient is and therefore determined whether the change in stoma tract length is greater in overweight/obese patients compared with normal/underweight patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>After protocol review and approval by the University of Utah institutional review board (IRB), the records for 28 adult (&gt;18 years old) patients who underwent percutaneous feeding tube changes from November 2006 to September 2009 were reviewed. Prospectively collected data included gender, indication for feeding tube, sitting and supine stoma length (cm), type of feeding tube, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Stoma tract length was measured with an AMT Balloon Stoma Measuring Device (Cleveland, OH) with the patient in the supine and sitting positions. This was done by passing the device directly through the mature tract with subsequent inflation of the internal balloon and adjustment of the external measuring disc per directions for use. After measuring the patient’s stoma tract length in the supine position, the process was then repeated in the sitting position. This often required the assistance of an endoscopic assistant to raise the head of the stretcher to 90 degrees. The size and length of the initial and replacement feeding tube as well as any complications associated with the feeding tube change were also collected. Percutaneous feeding tubes included PEGs, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies with jejunal extension (PEGJs), and direct percutaneous jejunal feeding tubes (DPEJs).</p>
<p>A statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 8 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Presentation of summary statistics for continuous variables included number, mean, median, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values. For categorical variables, the number and percentage under each category within a parameter for nonmissing data were presented. All statistical tests were one-sided unless otherwise stated, employing a significance level of .05. Correlations were made between BMI and tract length in both sitting and supine positions with Spearman’s rank test. Correlations 0.0–0.2 were considered very weak to negligible; 0.2–0.4, a weak, low correlation; 0.4–0.7, a moderate correlation; 0.7–0.9, a strong, high correlation; and 0.9–1.0, a very strong correlation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-eight patients who underwent percutaneous feeding tube change (24 PEG, 4 DPEJ) were included; 19 (68%) were female. All stoma measurement procedures were performed on patients receiving replacement feeding tubes. The mean ± SD stoma length was 3.6 ± 0.9 (range, 1.5–5.0) cm in the supine position and 4.9 ± 1.4 (range, 2.0–7.0) cm in the sitting position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612438406">Table 1</xref>). Mean ± SD BMI was 21.2 ± 4.5 (range, 14.9–33.8). Complications included leakage (2/28; 7%) and infection (2/28; 7%). Stoma length in the supine position was moderately correlated with BMI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.65, <italic>P</italic> = .0002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612438406">Figure 1</xref>). Stoma length in the sitting position was also moderately correlated with BMI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.6, <italic>P</italic> = .0009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612438406">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accurate knowledge of stoma tract length is critical to prevent complications related to excessive tissue compression between the inner and outer bolsters of percutaneous feeding tubes. Most if not all patients who have percutaneous feeding tubes have them placed and replaced in the supine position. In patients who are then upright for significant time periods and/or gain significant weight during the life of the feeding tube, this may result in tissue ischemia between the now too tightly placed inner and outer bolsters due to an increase in stoma tract length. This places the patients at risk for developing complications, including leakage, ulceration, hemorrhage, buried bumper syndrome, peristomal infections, and necrotizing fasciitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612438406">4</xref></sup> Prior to this study, there were no data on whether the stoma tract length changes from the supine to sitting position. Our data demonstrate that stoma tract length changes significantly between supine and sitting position and that the change correlates with BMI.</p>
<p>There are little previous data related to setting the external bumper on percutaneous feeding tubes. In 1990, Chung and Schertzer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612438406">5</xref></sup> compared patients with external bolsters set at 3 cm from the skin with patients with external bolsters set with “judicious traction.” Eleven of the 48 patients in the judicious traction group had complications, whereas only 1 of 67 nontraction patients suffered a complication. Nine of the 11 complications in the judicious traction group were infective complications, including cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, and sepsis leading to death, whereas the single complication in the nontraction group was peristomal leakage. In an effort to evaluate tract formation, Mellinger et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612438406">6</xref></sup> devised a similar laboratory model in mongrel dogs. In this model, a fixed distance between internal bolsters of 6 cm was employed, allowing 3 cm of internal play in the catheter. Tract formation was complete at 1 week, differing only in histologic collagen deposition when compared with tract allowed to heal for 2 weeks. In a small subset of dogs, the catheter was not secured to the abdominal wall, and although tract formation was retarded when compared with the other dogs, no complications occurred. DeLegge and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612438406">7</xref></sup> who compared PEG external bolsters set at 0 cm, 1 cm, and 4 cm in dogs, noted early inflammatory changes in animals with bolsters set at 0 cm and 1 cm. The authors recommended placement of external bolsters in humans at 1–2 cm from the skin.</p>
<p>Directions for use in the package inserts of percutaneous feeding tube initial placement and replacement kits recommend either 0.5–1 cm of play between skin and external bolster or choosing the “next larger size” if the stoma tract measurement appears to be between 2 sizes of low-profile PEGs. No mention is made of the patient position when measuring the stoma tract length or when setting the external bolster. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has stated the following with regard to buried bumper syndrome: “Some have advocated avoiding direct contact between the internal bolsters and gastric mucosa.”<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612438406">4</xref> It is important, however, to maintain apposition of the gastric wall to the anterior abdominal wall until the stoma tract is mature, which usually requires 7–14 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612438406">8</xref></sup> After tract maturation, the external bumper can be loosened in an attempt to avoid this buried bumper. This also should be performed at the time of feeding tube replacement, allowing for additional distance for patients who will be upright and/or according to BMI (ie, up to 1–2 cm more than the measured stoma tract length). The optimal distance between internal and external bolsters that is long enough to prevent complications of being overly tight and short enough to prevent excess movement and leakage likely varies from patient to patient and is dependent on other factors in addition to BMI and position change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612438406">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>One limitation of our study is its relatively small number of patients. Because PEGs are largely placed in the malnourished, there were also very few overweight and obese individuals included in the study. We were unable to devise a formula for calculating the increase in stoma tract length based on BMI. Perhaps with a greater sample size, a formula could have been created. In addition, we did not measure waist circumference in the supine and sitting positions. Although BMI and waist circumference are interrelated, waist circumference may have been a better marker for risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612438406">10</xref></sup> We did not randomize patients to determine if length of PEG chosen by measurement of stoma tract length in both supine and sitting positions would result in fewer complications than present standard recommendations. The attending physician chose the length of the replacement feeding tube based on estimating whether the patient assumed the upright position, the measured change in stoma tract length on position change, and any potential weight gain. Despite these limitations, the study is strengthened by prospectively collected data with all measurements made by a single investigator. All measurements were made using the same type of measurement device, and all patients were raised to the same degree to measure sitting tract length.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study highlights the variability in stoma tract length as it relates to patient position and may help to further define appropriate positioning of the external bolster in patients who are upright for significant portions of the day. Percutaneous feeding tube stoma tract length changes significantly from supine and sitting position, and stoma tract length and the change in the stoma tract length are correlated with BMI. This change in tract length may be particularly important when using low-profile PEG replacement tubes where the bolster distance is fixed. To prevent complications, many patients should have the distance between internal and external bolsters set at 1–2 cm greater than the measured stoma tract length, with the greater length for patients who have higher BMIs or who spend significant amounts of time sitting. This additional distance can be added after stoma tract maturation (ie, after 7–14 days with initial placement or at the time of replacement with a low-profile device). Further studies are needed to determine if this strategy will reduce the complications from too tight placement of percutaneous feeding tubes.</p>
