<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A primary goal of many educational systems in different countries of the world is the offering of equal opportunities in education. The strategy of the United Nations for ‘Education for All’ supports these initiatives, and the declaration of Salamanca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420614">UNESCO, 1994</xref>) argues that the best way to achieve ‘Education for All’ is to give mainstream schools an inclusive orientation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420614">Booth and Ainscow (1998</xref>) inclusive education is related to the effort of overcoming barriers that prevent the participation and learning of all children, regardless of their race, gender, social background, sexuality, disability or attainment in schools. Inclusive education does not only focus on the barriers that students face but also, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420614">Booth and Ainscow (2002</xref>) suggest, focuses on the development of cultures, policies and practices in educational systems and institutions, in order for them to be able to respond to the diversity of their students and to treat them equally. In inclusive schools diversity is welcomed and is considered to be a source of learning rather than a problem. The most important fact is that inclusive education is an ongoing process and not a stage we can reach at a specific moment.</p>
<p>Generally, inclusive education is a complex and controversial issue, a topic that often creates intense debate among the different stakeholders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143211420614">Ainscow et al. (2000</xref>) state that there is an indefiniteness and confusion surrounding the meaning of ‘inclusive education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143211420614">Angelides, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143211420614">Angelides et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Many efforts to promote inclusive education are almost exclusively focused on the activities of schools and how they could be reformed in order to become more inclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420614">Ainscow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143211420614">Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420614">Clark et al., 1995</xref>). Despite the fact that these efforts are being made and are constantly becoming more intense, it seems that there is dissatisfaction concerning their success. In parallel to that, the literature that deals with educational leadership underlines the big changes that are taking place in the world today and the need for different forms of leadership that can help schools to respond to the needs of the modern world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143211420614">Hargreaves and Fink, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143211420614">Harris, 2008</xref>). My engagement with the literature that relates to inclusive education as well as the literature that relates to educational leadership leads to the conclusion that if we are interested in moving towards more inclusive practices one of the factors that has to be studied in depth is leadership and the its role in the development of these practices. So, this article will be guided by the following research questions:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Which forms of leadership promote inclusive education in Cyprus?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do these forms of leadership appear in the practices, activities and behaviours of the school headteachers?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The purpose of the article is to study the school leaders in four schools in Cyprus and spot those practices that promote inclusive education. In this way we will draw out specific lessons for developments in Cyprus as well as commenting on the implications for international readers. Leadership is briefly discussed in relevance to inclusive education, the context of the Cypriot educational system is presented and following that the methodology used is analysed. Next, the four case study schools from which data were collected are presented and then the themes that arose through the data analysis are developed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and the consequences of this research for the better understanding of the leadership needed in modern schools are recorded.</p>

<sec id="section2-1741143211420614">
<title>Leadership and Inclusive Education</title>
<p>The world changes and with it the role of leadership, which in the recent past has been differentiated in a grade degree. There is a call for transformational models of leadership that distribute power and empower teachers, in contrast to the transactional models, which sustain traditional and bureaucratic concepts of hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143211420614">Leithwood et al., 1999</xref>). Transformational leaders focus on the people around them. They also focus on their relationships, their values, beliefs, feelings and attitudes. Transformational leaders manage structures but, at the same time, they seek to impact upon the school cultures in order to change them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143211420614">Leithwood and Jantzi, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, transformational models of leadership have significant effects on organizational conditions and on student engagement with schools (Leithwood and Jantzi, 1999). </p>
<p>In recent years leaders are not any longer just the headteachers of schools but there is a tendency for leadership to be distributed to as many people as possible, including students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143211420614">Gronn, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143211420614">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143211420614">Spillane et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143211420614">Harris et al. (2007</xref>) argue that when leadership is distributed then there is a positive impact on school improvement and on educational change. In this sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143211420614">Ryan (2006</xref>: 17) sees inclusive leadership ‘not in terms of positions or individuals who perform certain tasks but as a collective process in which everyone is included or fairly represented’.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a number of authors consider the role of leaders to be significant in developing inclusive education (Baily and du Plessis, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143211420614">Guzman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143211420614">Guzman and Schofield, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420614">Ingram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143211420614">Kugelmass and Ainscow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420614">Praisner, 2003</xref>). In an effort to understand the role of leaders in this area some researches study the attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143211420614">Bailey and du Plessis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420614">Praisner, 2003</xref>) and the behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143211420614">Guzman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420614">Ingram, 1997</xref>) of leaders towards inclusive education, others compare national practices (Kugelmass andAinscow, 2004), and others come to conclusions through the review of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143211420614">Riehl, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>According to some researchers, inclusive education is a key to school improvement and something that should be cultivated by school leaders in order to increase learning opportunities for all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420614">Angelides and Leigh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143211420614">Avissar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143211420614">Burello, Lashley and Beatty, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143211420614">Male, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143211420614">Powers et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420614">Praisner (2003</xref>) claims that in order to establish the success of inclusion, it is important for leaders to be committed to the philosophy of inclusive education and to develop attitudes and behaviours that promote the inclusion of students who experience difficulties in learning. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420614">Attfieid and Williams (2003)</xref> state that leaders should develop in the minds of teachers a clear picture of what inclusion is. Leaders should support school staff with regard to their responsibilities and the teaching of children who, for various reasons, are marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143211420614">Freeman and Grey, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143211420614">Kugelmass and Ainscow (2004</xref>) go a step further in suggesting that one of the duties of leaders is to foster new meanings of diversity so as not to isolate individuals who for some reason are marginalized. Such leaders might also try to build bridges between the schools of a community.</p>
<p>Most of the above studies were mainly conducted in English-speaking western countries (for example, Australia, Canada, the USA, the UK). The context of the Cypriot educational system is much different to the educational systems of these countries, and as a result, the status of school leaders is different. In the following section the context of the Cypriot educational system, which is the context in which Cypriot school leaders work, is presented. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1741143211420614">
<title>The Cypriot Context</title>
<p>Cyprus is a small Mediterranean island and its educational system has many distinct features compared to western educational systems. The Cypriot educational system is highly centralized. In this context, the Ministry of Education controls the curriculum, the textbooks and the other resources needed to deliver it. Local school boards are funded by the Ministry and their role is restricted to matters of building, maintenance and supplies. Schools are directly controlled by the Ministry via the inspectorate and the school headteachers, the latter having less devolved responsibility than in many other educational systems. Headteachers (and teachers) in Cyprus are rotated from school to school every 2–3 years by the Educational Service Committee, which is responsible for appointing, transferring and promoting teachers.</p>
<p>Research on school leadership in Cyprus criticizes the educational system for the obstacles faced by schools and their leaders in their efforts to improve the quality of education and to bring the system up to the standards of other western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143211420614">Michaelidou and Pashiardis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143211420614">Pashiardis, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143211420614">1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143211420614">Pashiardis (2005</xref>) discusses democracy and leadership in Cyprus, in particular, describing the efforts made by the Ministry of Education for democracy in relation to personnel management, the power of the centre and the curriculum. He reaches the conclusion that the Cypriot educational system needs to take gigantic steps towards democracy in order to reach the level of other western countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143211420614">Angelides et al. (2010)</xref>, who studied the particular leadership practices that promoted inclusive education in one school in Cyprus, argues that these practices are related to (1) the involvement of teachers, parents and the community, (2) the promotion of co-teaching, (3) the construction of collaborative cultures and (4) the treatment of all children with love and care. In this sense, this article studies in more depth the forms of leadership that provide inclusive education. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741143211420614">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The research data were gathered from four schools considered to have inclusive practices. The schools were selected for the following reasons: (1) I already knew them through their involvement in other research projects; (2) they were willing to participate in the research; and (3) the schools had inclusive practices. With the term ‘inclusive practices’ is meant that lessons were responsive to student diversity and they were accessible to all students, teachers planned, taught and reviewed in partnership, teachers were concerned to support the learning and participation of all students, and parents and the community were used as a source of support in the classrooms. (4) The schools had inclusive leadership. The headteachers of all four schools had inclusive values and promoted social justice and inclusive practices. </p>
<p>These schools are referred to by the pseudonyms of Nefelio, Iolio, Aikaterinio and Dionysio. The data were collected using qualitative research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143211420614">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420614">Patton, 2002</xref>). In each school, participant observation took place, which lasted 4 weeks and following that, the school headteachers and three teachers (who appeared to lead their schools in different areas) from each school were interviewed. All interviews were conducted in the schools. The observation was focused on subjects relating to leadership and inclusive education. Initially, people who led the schools were identified and the forms of leadership which promoted inclusive education were observed. The interviews were based on themes that emerged from the observation and were related to the ways these individuals promoted inclusive education. The interviews lasted between 1 and 2 hours. The purpose of the interviews was to discuss in depth and to clarify the themes related to leadership and inclusion that emerged from the observations.</p>
<p>For the data analysis the two stages proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143211420614">Erickson (1986</xref>) were followed: the inductive and the deductive. During the first phase, the data were organized based on each school separately. Thus the various data sources (observation notes, interviews, documents) were examined, analysed and categorized according to each school. First, the interviews were analysed in order to track dominating issues that kept reappearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420614">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>). Then the observation notes were studied in order to identify relationships between attitudes in school and the comments made during the interviews. For reliability purposes, an outside researcher with a doctorate in education and experience in analysing quality data, was asked to read and encode data from the interviews and the observation notes. The differences found, were discussed with this researcher until we reached an agreed framework. Then a back-to-forward process followed, in all the data, so as to clarify the various events that surrounded the leadership practices. In some cases, the interviews had to be consulted in order to clarify some of the remarks in the notes. At this point the patterns of leadership that promoted inclusive education began to emerge.</p>
<p>As it has already been mentioned, in the first phase, the data was analysed based on each school separately. Then, similar ideas were put into some broad categories, making a mark next to each idea from which source of data it was taken (observation, interview and documents). Then, by analysing the data from all schools, certain categories were found and through them, all the data were reorganized.</p>
<p>In an effort to develop the plausibility and trustworthiness of the data two forms of triangulation were used. In the first, the data were compared horizontally in order to confirm the different themes emerging from data that came from different research methods (observation, interview, documents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420614">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>). In the second, the findings were examined from multiple perspectives, looking for alternative explanations and different possibilities in order to develop a richer understanding of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143211420614">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethical problems arose from the very beginning of this research. The present study poses a number of questions in this respect, such as ‘if it is ethical to discuss with teachers feelings and attitudes towards their pupils, towards their headteacher or their colleagues in their absence’. In addition, the teachers were fully informed about the purposes of the research and the participation was voluntary. Privacy, as well as confidentiality, was closely safeguarded. All the disclosed information remained confidential.</p>

<title>The Schools</title>
<sec id="section6-1741143211420614">
<title>Aikaterinio Elementary School</title>
<p>Aikaterinio Elementary School is located in a village in the Larnaca district. The school had 129 students and 11 teachers. The headteacher of the school changed in the middle of the academic year due to the retirement of the existing headteacher and so the teacher with the longest teaching experience took over. The new headteacher had a different vision and he proceeded to many changes in the school. For example, he ordered several books for the classroom libraries, in each class a library corner was created, all the rooms were painted, he involved parents in the school decision making, and he gave teachers the freedom to involve themselves in subjects they were interested in regardless the fact that they would loose track from the curriculum. One of the innovations, was that once a month, school classes took place in the outdoors. The headteacher, in consultation with his staff, decided that on the last Friday of each month, lessons would not be held in classrooms, but in the school yard instead, and that the whole school should have a common teaching subject. The necessary preparatory work was performed in class from previous days, and on that day, the desks and chairs required were taken outside where the class was held. Usually, students were divided into groups according to their class, but because the teaching subject was the same for everyone, often teams from different classes worked together. During the break, the teachers in collaboration with a group of pupils, prepared snacks and offered them to the children (for example, fruit salad, honey-donuts and halva). Furthermore, the new headteacher held strong beliefs in democracy and gave teachers the freedom to act.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741143211420614">
<title>Iolio Elementary School</title>
<p>Iolio Elementary School is located in a Nicosia suburb and is housed in a 1960s building. The school serves an area in which families of middle to lower social classes live. In recent years many foreign workers settled in the area and for this reason the school has obtained a multicultural character. The school has 16 teachers, three of whom, only teach 2 days a week. A hundred and eighty-four students attend the school, 42 of whom are non-Cypriot. The school headteacher was 55-years’ old and was serving in this school for the third year. His teachers considered him a democrat and he tried to apply a collaborative model in his decision-making process. He described himself as a decent human being because as he said, his priorities lay in the fact that everyone is a human being and that he wants to treat everyone in a humane way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741143211420614">
<title>Nefelio Elementary School</title>
<p>Nefelio Elementary School is located in the centre of Nicosia and is considered to be one of the most traditional schools of the city. It is housed in a traditional building of the 1920s. In recent years it standards have slipped and is it considered by many a marginalized school with several problems. The main reason for this is that a large number of its students are non-Cypriot children from other countries and the majority do not speak Greek. Moreover, many of these students come from poor families and families with problems. There are 96 students attending the school and 11 teachers, three of whom work twice a week.</p>
<p>Although the school made many efforts to address the situation and the Ministry of Education supported these efforts, many of the school’s teachers seem disappointed with the situation but little to try to improve it. They feel that the situation is out of control and that they lack the necessary support from the Ministry of Education. However, there is a number of teachers who see these school conditions as a challenge, and are trying, either individually or in collaboration with other colleagues, to respond in the best possible way. The headteacher of this school was serving for the fourth year. He was on good terms with his teachers because he used to facilitate them with their timetable. However, some teachers expressed a few complaints and said that sometimes he was not fair to all teachers and favoured some. Conversely, as far as students were concerned, it was generally accepted that he was fair to children and especially sensitive to children with learning difficulties, which in the case of the school, was the majority of children. He claimed that his main priority was his philosophy on social justice.</p>

<title>Dionysio Elementary School</title>
<p>Dionysio Elementary School is a frontier school of Famagusta District with 164 students and 16 teachers. Children from other countries attend the school and during the 2 years previous to the study a research plan had been developed for developing inclusive practices. The programme began with the cooperation of two teachers and with others then getting involved. In the beginning the headteacher approached this programme with hesitation but in the process she became very positive, and showed this by supporting the teachers. It was the headteacher’s third year in office and, as she claimed, she was especially directed by the principles of equality and justice.</p>

<title>Forms of Leadership that Promote Inclusive Education</title>
<p>The data analysis indicates specific interconnecting and overlapping themes related to patterns of leadership that promote inclusive education in Cyprus. By studying the four schools it became apparent that the forms of leadership that supported inclusion, constantly changed and that they were not static. Leaders were trying to understand the local context and then develop their own strategies. They also supported learning in informal learning environments and took into consideration children’s voices. These matters are developed below and supported by data.</p>
<sec id="section11-1741143211420614">
<title>Understanding the Local Context</title>
<p>The first theme that emerged was that the forms of leadership that promoted inclusion were those that changed and were not static. By observing the leaders of the four schools it became clear that they all shaped leadership strategies depending on the circumstances prevailing in their school. They tried to understand the local context and accordingly made the necessary organizational arrangements to make their school more inclusive. The local context essentially functioned as a stimulus; allowing them to think in different ways and to deal with situations more inclusively.</p>
<p>For example, the headteacher of Nefelio said in response to a related question:<disp-quote>
<p>When I first came to this school, I firstly had to understand the local context, especially at this school which has many particularities. There were many children who needed help but we had to prioritize the problems and start from the most serious ones. The community and the parents are difficult, unusual. Each person has its peculiarities. I had to fully understand all these ... Even today I must constantly be vigilant because conditions change and I should be able to adjust accordingly, to tailor my decisions and how the school operates. Changes also occur in Ministry policies which affect us. They especially affect us as we are a school with many particularities. So we must adapt accordingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The headteacher of Aikaterinio made the following comments:<disp-quote>
<p>We can not operate independently regardless of what is happening around us. The previous headteacher saw things happening in the village and did not take them in to consideration ... When I took over the school I tried to pulse rate the community, the parents, the teachers and act accordingly ... For example, I noticed that there were some very willing parents. I encouraged them to become more involved in school activities ... They undertook the organization of a feast at the school which was something original and had great success ... When Peter first came to the school [a teacher that was assigned to the school in the middle of the year and had a degree in directing] and I became aware of his qualifications, I asked him to undertake the organization of the school’s final celebration and he did it with great pleasure.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Also, the headteacher of Iolio describes how he dealt with the changing conditions he encountered at his school:<disp-quote>
<p>When I first came to the school I had an excellent cooperation with the Parents committee. We swapped opinions on almost all issues. They made suggestions and together we tried to promote them. The following year the committee changed and some provocative people took over who wanted to intervene in all of the school’s proceedings, they wanted to intervene in their children’s classes, they harassed the teachers with interventions, a fact which seemed to create a climate of aggression and surveillance within the school When this became too intense I had to change my approach. I invited the parents to a staff meeting and informed them that I would not tolerate their interference in my teachers work or my school without my permission. My statement caused tension and the members of the Parents committee became very aggressive during the session and this aggressiveness continued during the following days as well. However, I remained adamant, I insisted, I was accused of being autocratic, but in the end I managed to isolate the parents committee from the school.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And the headteacher of Dionysio said:<disp-quote>
<p>When I first came to school I wanted to control everything. When I became acquainted with the school teachers, I became more relaxed; I appointed tasks to teachers ... I distributed my power to my teachers, I occasionally appointed them with different responsibilities depending on their interests.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of course, this change in leader’s strategies happened because of the experience they acquired and because they changed their leadership styles evolutionarily. This was evident in what they said:<disp-quote>
<p>The first year I became a headteacher I dealt with things in a very different way than now. (Headteacher, Nefelio)</p>
<p>Now I see things in a different way … Five years ago I had other views … now I want all children to have equal opportunities in learning. (Headteacher, Iolio)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When you are new in the area you are more autocratic because you are insecure. But when you gain experience you become more democratic. (Headteacher, Dionysio)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What headteachers said was in agreement with teachers’ comments. A teacher from the Iolio said: ‘Our headteacher has a gift. He can read the local conditions of the school and act accordingly ... This helps everyone.’ A teacher from the Nefelio elementary school stressed that:<disp-quote>
<p>Our headteacher acts depending on the circumstances. One can accuse him of not being stable in his actions but I think that the way he acts makes his decisions timely.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While a teacher from Aikaterinio elementary school stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>If I compare the current headteacher with the previous one the difference lays in the current headteacher’s ability to see things, his ability to listen and to take in to consideration the things that happen around him and take decisions accordingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In many cases, in the schools studied, leadership practices were observed that were not static, but constantly changing and promoted inclusion. Headteachers were ‘inventive' in their leadership practices and shaped them according to the prevailing conditions as well as with the comfort they felt with these conditions. For example, in Aikaterinio, some children coming from very poor families experienced difficulties in learning. The previous headteacher had said that she could not do anything to help these children because they did not study as hard as they should at home. The new headteacher asked teachers to pay more attention to these children; he took upon himself to prepare extra work to for them, he taught in teachers classes in order to release teachers from their teaching responsibilities, so that they had time to prepare lessons of a more inclusive nature. Also, the head of Dionysio, when she realized that the school had several children that did not speak the Greek language and experienced difficulties in learning, decided to ask teachers with free teaching time, to teach exclusively those children. Furthermore, the headteacher of Dionysio, in the beginning of the year, acted in an autocratic way (she wanted to know and control everything). When she became acquainted with the teachers, especially those who had just came to the school, she started to give them more freedom in their actions and delegated responsibilities.</p>
<p>The above data show that leaders who appeared to have inclusive practices were those who did not have fixed leadership strategies, but leadership strategies that changed and were adjusted to the prevailing circumstances in their schools. Those leaders also had the ability to understand the local context and shaped their strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143211420614">Chapman et al. (2008</xref>) reach a similar conclusion in research conducted in England and argue that successful leaders change their approaches and use traditional and innovative approaches in combination. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143211420614">Day (2007</xref>) presents the case of a headteacher that tries to understand the local context, changes her leadership strategies and evolutionary becomes more inclusive. Of course, these studies took place in a different context where headteachers have ‘permanent’ positions in schools and their purpose is to improve their schools. In Cyprus, headteachers are often obliged to understand the local context because they are transferred from school to school, so they try to understand what is going on in their new school. Their purpose, at least at the beginning is not to improve their schools but to be able to manage the new situation. In addition, all the leaders’ strategies are developed in the knowledge that in 2 or 3 years they will moved again from their school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741143211420614">
<title>They Support Teaching in Informal Learning Environments</title>
<p>The second theme that emerged from the data was that the school leaders supported teaching in informal learning environments. The term ‘informal learning environments' often means learning environments outside the traditional area of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143211420614">Dierking et al., 2003</xref>). Previous studies have shown that teaching in informal learning environments promotes inclusive education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143211420614">Angelides and Karras, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143211420614">Angelides and Avraamidou, 2010</xref>). All four schools’ headteachers supported teachers in their efforts to promote learning with alternative ways of teaching. Teachers from all four schools, taught in informal learning environments. More specifically, teachers organized their teaching process around school visits, for example, visits to archaeological sites, museums, parks, churches and lakes. When discussing with headteachers their support for this, they, first, emphasized the freedom they gave to their teachers to choose how their teaching would be carried out:<disp-quote>
<p>When a teacher asks to perform a school visit with his students, I am always positive ... children get tired in the classroom, they want something different ... but from the moment my teacher decides that he/she wants to perform a lesson outside the school, I would never interfere. (Headteacher, Nefelio)</p>
<p>I support my teachers when they undertake initiatives ... [and] especially when those initiatives have to do with innovative ways of teaching ... teachers have the freedom to decide for themselves how to teach a subject. (Headteacher, Iolio)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The headteachers’ comments were also supported by what was said by teachers during the interviews. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>Our headteacher is very democratic and gives opportunities to school teachers ... he always supports my efforts on new ways of teaching ... My previous headteacher, when I performed several educational visits with my students, believed that I used school visits as an excuse to stroll around, so I was told to stay in school and teach for a change. (Teacher, Dionysio)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One of the objectives of teaching in informal learning environments is to provide equal educational opportunities to all students. When discussing this issue with headteachers it became apparent that they linked the issue of teaching in informal learning environments to inclusive education despite the fact that they seemed to confuse the meaning of the word ‘inclusive education’. For example, the headteacher of Aikaterinio stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>It is important to digress a little from the traditional ways of teaching because there are children who benefit from alternative ways of teaching ... The lessons we performed outside the classroom managed to get more students involved in them and this involved the active participation of children that rarely participate in classes.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The headteacher of Nefelio stressed the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Especially in our school, as we have many children who do not speak the Greek language well, teaching in environments outside the school, helps these children a lot, because out of school, children deal with real life problems and the language does not have a dominant role as it has in teaching in school.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The statements made by headteachers and teachers are supported by the data collected through observation. In particular, several teachers were noticed taking initiatives and teaching in informal learning environments, while the school headteachers supported these efforts. In one case, Iolio, the first grade primary teacher, had organized several of her teaching sessions based on visits to parents’ work places. For example, they visited the airport control tower, the university and a building construction site. When organizing the airport visit, which was in another town, the issue of cost arose, due to the high cost of transportation, so the headteacher decided to cover the cost from school funds, because he considered this activity to be important for both the students and the school.</p>
<p>Headteachers’ supporting informal learning environments also emerged as an important issue in a research conducted in Cyprus by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143211420614">Angelides and Avraamidou (2010)</xref>. They argue that when the school leaders support learning in informal learning environments then inclusive education is promoted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1741143211420614">
<title>Paying Attention to Children’s Voices</title>
<p>The last issue that emerged from the data, and indicates a form of leadership that promotes inclusive education, was the attention that school leaders paid to their students views. In all four schools, leaders listened carefully to their students and often took into account their students views while taking their decisions. On this issue, the headteacher of Dionysio said:<disp-quote>
<p>I always try to talk with students and to listen carefully to their problems and concerns ... I then pass the information to other teachers during our teachers meetings, and we take children’s views in to account, before taking any decisions. Recently I visited all the school classes and talked with all the students about their problems ...</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similar comments were made by the Iolio headteacher:<disp-quote>
<p>Once a month I meet with the students’ council in my office and listen to their views on various topics ... I try to convey children’s views during staff meetings, as during these meetings we try to solve the problems posed by children.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These comments were also supported by teachers. A teacher from the Dionysio said:<disp-quote>
<p>The school headteacher is very democratic and listens to everyone before taking a decision, including the children ... A few weeks ago, with the help of my students, we performed an evaluation of our school, using photos. The results were also reported to the school headteacher. A few situations in school were criticized and talked about. As soon as the headteacher became aware of these issues, she visited all classes and had discussions with the students about the problems they themselves thought the school had, and asked for suggestions for improvement ... She took notes, and all these ideas were transferred to a staff meeting during which we started to implement them.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>During observation, the headteachers were observed several times moving around their schools: in the school yard, visiting classrooms, having conversations with the children and taking steps to resolve issues raised by the children. For example, in Dionysio, the children, while having a conversation with the headteacher, asked her if they could take a school field trip to the mountains. The headteacher then passed the children’s views during a staff meeting, and school staff decided that the next field trip would be to the mountains. Furthermore, in Iolio, two children complained to their headteacher that their teacher did not perform gymnastics classes because the weather was not good. The headteacher then had a word with the teacher and the following week the children had an extra gym class. At the same school, on the headteacher’s initiative, twice a week, all the children gathered in the school yard and some children were rewarded for their contribution to the school. All children were entitled to propose a classmate for an award (giving the justification for the award).</p>
<p>Furthermore, paying attention to children’s voices as a form of leadership that promotes inclusive education is supported by the following vignette.<disp-quote>
<p>During the final school celebration of Aikaterinio elementary the headteacher took over the coordination. The celebration was attended by the Minister of Education, who was invited by the authorities of the community. Also attending the school celebrations were several senior ministry officials and many parents. During the celebration a second grade student was not able to narrate her poem and made many mistakes while trying. When she finished she could not get of the stage, but stayed in front of the microphone and started crying. While her teacher kept waving at her to leave the stage, the school headteacher immediately stood up and went near her, talked to her, and the student confessed that she knew her poem, but became confused. The school headteacher then announced from the microphone that she should try once again. The student then tried for a second time and was successful. The audience then gave her a warm applause. In my later conversations with the school teachers, they seemed very impressed with the way the headteacher handled the incident because the Minister of Education was present and everything was expect to be perfect. However, the headteacher did not hesitate to interrupt the celebration, go near the student, listen and encourage her to repeat the poem. While discussing this with the school headteacher he said that his aim, was not to show off to his superiors, but that his students enjoy the celebration.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We see the headteacher diverging from the stereotypes that usually suggest that the final celebration, attended by the Minister of Education and several senior officials of the Ministry, should be ‘perfect’. He takes the initiative to interrupt and listen to the student who failed to perform her poem. After listening to the student he encourages her to perform it again and she receives the public’s applause. Evident that the headteacher has a form of leadership that promotes inclusion. He listened to the student; he encouraged her and gave her a second chance which was successful.</p>
<p>The literature from English-speaking countries supports the progress made in the treatment of students as serious members of the school, is very small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143211420614">Fullan, 2007</xref>) and that in general, today’s students do not have an ‘official’ voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143211420614">Smyth, 2006</xref>) in educational policy and in the administration of their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143211420614">Osberg et al., 2006</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143211420614">Muijs et al. (2007</xref>) note that one of the forms of leadership that promotes inclusion is leadership that pays attention to students’ voices. If we are interested in inclusive leadership in the Cypriot school system, or in that of other countries, it is imperative to give children a voice and to take this voice into account in decision making. Schools should ‘listen’ to the ‘deafening silence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143211420614">Angelides and Michaelidou, 2009</xref>), to listen to the ‘hidden voices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143211420614">Ainscow et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I tried to study through four schools case studies, which forms of leadership promote inclusive education and how these patterns of leadership appeared in the practices, activities and attitudes of the school leaders. Through the investigation, it has become apparent that the forms of leadership that appeared in these four schools, which promoted inclusive education, were the patterns of leadership that understood the local context and subsequently shaped their strategies in patterns of leadership that supported teaching in informal learning environments and forms of leadership that took into account children’s voices.</p>
<p>The above findings contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of the leader that modern Cypriot schools need at this time. It seems that what is required is transformational leaders; leaders who are able to influence and change the culture of their school. Currently, we are going through a period of continuous change, a fact that affects schools and the way they are managed, and the characteristics that people who lead schools have to possess. Also, most educational systems around the world, set inclusive education very high in their list of priorities and research suggests that one way to develop inclusive education in schools, is through the creation of leaders who promote social justice and inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143211420614">Cambron-McCabe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143211420614">Marshall and Oliva, 2006</xref>). Therefore, the findings of this research, may have implications for preparation programmes and professional development of school leaders in Cyprus and perhaps internationally. These consequences are discussed further down.</p>
<p>In particular, it would be good for leaders, particularly in Cyprus where they have to change school every 2 or 3 years, to understand their school context first and then to adjust their strategies accordingly. It is important that these strategies change on the basis of the prevailing conditions, and that they are not static and permanent. The understanding of the internal conditions of their schools, not only in Cyprus but also in other countries, can help leaders to become more inclusive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143211420614">Brown (2004</xref>) suggests specific strategies for the preparation programmes for school leaders so that they become socially fair. She specifically recommends the strategies of critical reflection, rational discourse and policy praxis.</p>
<p>In addition, leaders of contemporary schools that should promote inclusive education should also support teaching in informal learning environments, because research supports that teaching in informal learning environments promotes equal opportunities for all students. The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143211420614">Angelides and Avraamidou (2010)</xref>, showed that the role of school leaders is important in supporting teachers in their teaching in informal learning environments, and where leaders were negative in teaching in informal settings, inclusion practices were reduced and were not as effective. Although the existing literature and research in this area is quite limited, however, there are indications that informal learning environments can contribute to social justice education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143211420614">Dillon and Brant, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, leadership in today's schools in Cyprus but also internationally owes to ‘listen’ and take into account the views of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420614">Angus, 2006</xref>). Literature and research supports that today, decision making in schools does not listen or takes in to consideration children’s voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420614">Fielding, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143211420614">Smyth, 2006</xref>). So, to promote inclusion, a form of leadership that should characterize schools leaders, is the ability to listen and take into account their students views in their decision making. The preparation programmes for school leaders should prepare leaders to be able to listen and to take into account student views. This can be achieved with the cultivation of techniques as indicated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143211420614">Holsten Leren (2006)</xref>: (1) the involvement of students in organizing the activities of the course; (2) to give the right to students to participate in the evaluation of school work; and (3) to generally be able to organize the ways in which leaders will listen to student voices.</p>
<p>Of course, this research suggests some patterns of leadership that promote inclusive education, without in any way implying that these are the only patterns present or presented in the schools studied. The data come from only four schools which had experience in working inclusively because they were involved in different related research project. This piece of evidence points to the fact that not too many schools in Cyprus have such opportunities; therefore, these forms of leadership might not be the case in other schools. As it is already stated, this study relies on only four cases, and therefore, the results cannot be generalized. Surely, there are other patterns of leadership that promote inclusion and it is important to identify and describe them in future investigations, in order to assist school leaders to understand their roles in a better way. At least, however, this research provides some guidance to those who prepare future school leaders, and provides them with a way to adjust their programmes accordingly, but also it may contribute to interested school leaders, in Cyprus and elsewhere in order to critically think and reflect on their own practices for the purpose of improvement.</p>
