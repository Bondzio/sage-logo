<abstract>
<p>A micro-turbine can offer a high availability, a compact design, a reliable operation, an easy maintenance, great fuel flexibility, low dynamic forces and fewer moving parts (usually only one moving assembly). The old-fashion emergency diesel engine generators and battery systems have been used for decades in critical emergency units such as nuclear emergency cooling systems. They seem unreliable and unsuitable for modern facilities. The modern micro-turbine technology is proposed as a reliable, lightweight and compact solution for emergency power supply applications. New application of the micro-turbines for the nuclear facility emergency cooling system is explained.</p>

<p>Micro-turbines are small gas turbines with output power of around 30–800 kW.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459009">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912459009">3</xref></sup> They usually use the foil bearings (the air bearings). A typical micro-turbine consists of followings four main components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912459009">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912459009">6</xref></sup>

</list></p>
<p>The generated high-temperature gas expanded in the turbine stage(s) and the gas energy converted to the mechanical energy to drive the air-compressor and the driven equipment (usually a generator). Single shaft models are designed for the high-speed operation (sometimes more than 70,000 r/min). Usually, a direct-drive high-speed generator is used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912459009">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912459009">8</xref></sup> The power turbine on a two-shaft machine can be designed to run at a lower speed still maintaining a high efficiency. Sometimes, a conventional AC generator is connected to the power turbine through a single-stage gear-box (the power loss could be in order of 2%–3%). Frequently, micro-turbines are employed to generate heat as the second product.</p>
<p>Large simple-cycle gas turbines approach 40% and 47% efficiencies for the heavy-duty designs and the aero-derivative models, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912459009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912459009">13</xref></sup> Typical micro-turbine efficiencies are around 25%–35%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912459009">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912459009">17</xref></sup> Great overall efficiencies (even 45% or more) could be achieved if the micro-turbines are used in the combined heat and power cogeneration systems.</p>
<p>Micro-turbines have extensively been used in auxiliary power systems and auxiliary power units on air-planes for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459009">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912459009">3</xref></sup> Micro-turbines are increasingly used in modern applications particularly for the emergency power supply systems, the offshore applications, and generally compact and light-weight power generation applications. The micro-turbine’s power-to-weight and power-to-footprint are very high and its reliability and availability are more than piston engines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912459009"><title>Design and main components</title>
<p>The rotational speed of a micro-turbine usually increases as the physical size decreases. For example, the shaft turns at around 100,000 r/min in a typical 30 kW micro-turbine and about 70,000 r/min in a 100 kW micro-turbine.</p>
<p>For recuperated micro-turbines, the optimum pressure ratio for the best efficiency is usually around ‘4:1’. The turbine section inlet temperatures are generally limited to around 1000 °C (within the capabilities of available turbine blade alloys) to avoid use of very expensive turbine materials and very special recuperators. The modern large gas turbines are currently designed with temperatures in range of about 1400 °C–1600 °C<sup>2–4,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912459009">8</xref></sup> (there are studies and researches for beyond 1600 °C). The nature of the turbine section design (usually a radial type) and the turbine small physical size in micro-turbines have not yet allowed for the internal cooling. This is the primary driver for the ceramic technology developments for future micro-turbines. Currently, there are some development projects for micro-turbine ceramic components with the firing temperature in range of 1200 °C–1400 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459009">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912459009">3</xref></sup> (with the expected efficiency around 40%). Move to above 1400 °C could be likely after the micro-turbines with 1200 °C–1400 °C will prove themselves in service.</p>
<p>The most common micro-turbine design is the single-shaft arrangement. Because this design has only one moving shaft, it offers a high reliability and a low maintenance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912459009">Figure 1</xref> shows an example of an advanced micro-turbine.

</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0957650912459009"><title>Recuperator</title>
<p>Most micro-turbines to be economically viable should have a recuperator (to recover the waste heat).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459009">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912459009">3</xref></sup> Without recuperator, the micro-turbine efficiency is very low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650912459009">16</xref></sup> Recuperators should have high effectiveness (the target is beyond 90%). A properly-designed recuperator increases the efficiency of a micro-turbine from below 25% to above 33%.</p>
<p>Incorporation of a recuperator could result in some pressure losses which can essentially reduce the pressure ratio available to the turbine section. The micro-turbine performance can be enhanced by using a recuperator with a high effectiveness and a low pressure drop; such a recuperator would be large and expensive. The effective optimization of the recuperator design should balance the performance, the weight, the size, the cost and the reliability. The recuperator durability is also important. Some recuperators developed leaks due to the differential thermal expansion accompanying the thermal transient. Modern recuperator designs have an inherent large heat transfer area to the volume ratio that allows for high efficiency in a relatively compact design in addition of low thermal stresses and a long service life.</p>
<p>The first type of recuperator design is known as the folded primary surface recuperator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912459009">17</xref></sup> In this design, folded thin plates are used to form side by side channels for the hot gas (the turbine exhaust) and the compressed air (the air compressor discharge) to pass through and transfer heat.</p>
<p>In the second design type, pairs of corrugated thin sheets are used to form an ‘air-cell’, the basic building blocks of this recuperator design. The compressed air (the air compressor discharge) and the hot gas (the turbine exhaust) pass through air-cells in different directions. Use of thin sheets enhances the flexibility of the air-cell core.</p>
<p>The third design type uses the tubing material instead of the thin foils. The basic concept is a specially-designed shell-and-tube type heat exchanger for high temperatures. Thin foil designs usually limit operating temperature to around 650 °C. The proposed shell-and-tube design enhances the creep resistance and the long life at elevated temperatures up to about 850 °C.</p>
<p>The material selection for a recuperator is also important. There are some reports about degradations and problems of some materials (such as the type 347 stainless steel). The primary damage mechanisms are the creep and the oxidation. Severe creep can restrict the gas flow, increase the turbine back pressure, decrease the overall efficiency and sometimes result in a leakage or a failure. The presence of water vapor can increase the degradation (particularly rapid oxidation at elevated temperatures) of many alloys. It can lead to the formation of layered scales and could increase the amount of chromium required to form a protective oxide film. The amount of chromium included in the type 347 austenitic stainless steel may not be enough to result in a proper protection in some elevated temperatures and harsh recuperator conditions. Generally a suitable grade of stainless steel or alloy steel, with excellent resistance to oxidation, creep, degradation and fatigue (considering operating temperatures and thermal cycles) should be used for the recuperator.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0957650912459009"><title>Air bearing (foil bearing)</title>
<p>Three types of bearings are used for the micro-turbines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459009">1</xref></sup>

<list-item><p>The foil bearings (the air bearings).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ceramic surface bearings.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>About 60%–70% of all rotating machine fire incidents are related to the lubrication oil systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912459009">18</xref></sup> The elimination of the lubricated bearings and the lubrication oil system can considerably increase the safety. The air bearing offers the simplicity of operation, a low operating cost, a good reliability, a low maintenance, low power consumptions and the maximum safety. The air bearing reliability and performance depend to a large extent on the specific design, the material selection and individual manufacturer’s quality control methodology. Careful and detailed reviews of the air bearing manufacturer’s references and application histories are always required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0957650912459009"><title>Fuel and emissions</title>
<p>Micro-turbines accept wide range of fuels, such as most fuel gases (natural gas, propane, butane, or similar), sour and difficult gases (high sulphur gases, low British thermal unit gases, a gas comes directly from wells, or similar), waste gases (flare gases, process off-gases, or similar), liquid fuels (diesel, kerosene, heating oil, gasoline, or similar) and many more. Micro-turbines have the potential for extremely low emissions. Most current micro-turbines feature lean pre-mixed (dry low NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> (DLN)) combustor technologies. In modern micro-turbines, sophisticated combustion schemes combined with relatively low temperatures of the combustion section (a low temperature compared to the large gas turbines). The NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission lower than 10 ppm and low CO and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions can commonly be achieved. Because micro-turbines are able to meet the key emission requirements, the post combustion emission control (known as ‘after-treatment’) techniques are usually not required. There are manufacturers, which can offer the catalytic combustor with ultra low NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> (ULN) technologies for micro-turbines with less than 3 ppm NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> guaranteed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459009">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912459009">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0957650912459009"><title>Future technologies</title>
<p>There are great expectations in industry to develop new micro-turbines with an efficient part-load operation, a faster start-up, a quicker response to changes in power requirements, longer operation periods before a shutdown as well as to mitigate the various reliability weaknesses such as various fatigues, fuel quality effects, and creeps.</p>
<p>The ceramic material temperature capabilities are much higher than those of un-cooled metallic components. The components fabricated from ceramics have the potential for a significant performance gain in terms of efficiency, reliability and specific power. Increasing the firing temperature by using ceramic materials would increase the turbine exhaust temperature. It could result in change of recuperator material/design to a higher temperature level. Many institutes and companies have begun advanced material programs to develop ceramic turbines, combustors, and recuperators for micro-turbines. Continued improvements in the powder synthesis, processing and densification have resulted in the development of a modern generation of ceramics (such as the modern silicon nitride ceramics) having controlled micro-structures consisting of elongated grains. Progresses should be made in following four areas.
<list id="list3-0957650912459009" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The ceramic component design and fabrication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Modern methods for predicting the ceramic component life.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-destructive test methods to evaluate complex shaped ceramic components.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Advanced coatings for ceramics.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Despite many successful results and developments, a number of challenges remain before the monolithic or composite ceramics exhibit the long lifetime required for micro-turbine applications. The main challenge is the degradation. Another challenge is the impact resistance. Further improvements in the fracture toughness of ceramics are required to ensure a high reliability in the event of the foreign object damage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0957650912459009"><title>Case study: nuclear emergency cooling system</title>
<p>The ‘Fukushima Daiichi’ nuclear power plant seriously damaged due to the earthquake (and the Tsunami) in March 2011. The nuclear power plant cooling systems were destroyed that resulted in a nuclear disaster. Because of many technical reasons such as heavy weight, large size, considerable shaking forces, the emergency diesel generators were not included in a watertight building or at an elevation high enough to protect them from the flood or the tsunami. The tsunami affected these piston engine driven generators and disabled them. After the diesel generators failed, the emergency power was supplied by batteries, which were designed to last about 8 h. All power for the emergency cooling system was lost after 8 h and the reactor started to overheat.</p>
<p>Micro-turbines are very reliable, compact and light-weight compared to diesel engine drivers. They generate very low dynamic forces compared to large shaking forces produced by diesel engines. They are far more superior options for critical emergency power systems compared to piston engines. They can easily be included in a watertight building or other suitable places to obtain the maximum possible protection. They could be used for direct drive of emergency cooling water pumps and emergency power generators.</p>
<p>Because of a higher energy density, the liquid fuelled micro-turbine driven emergency cooling system could offer 30 times more operation time (the duration) within the same space limits compared to advanced batteries used in many nuclear facilities. It can offer more than 10-days cooling system circulation compared to conventional 8-h batteries.</p>
<p>In terms of the start-up, the micro-turbines require some time for the start-up. This start-up time is relatively more than the start-up time of the piston-engines and could be a disadvantage in some applications (such as applications of micro-turbines in small vehicles). However, this start-up time cannot cause any problem in the emergency power or cooling system applications. The efficiency of the micro-turbines at partial-load operation is low. The drop of the efficiency at the part-load operation is more compared to the piston-engines. However, the emergency cooling system is usually worked at the full load. For the emergency cooling system, the reliability, availability and compactness are more important than the efficiency at the part-load. The micro-turbines and medium-size gas turbines cover a wide range of the sizes, speeds and power ratings. The power and capacity should be sufficient for any emergency system application. Current technologies of the micro-turbines could be adequate for any emergency power generation or cooling system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0957650912459009" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Micro-turbines are small gas turbines (below 800 kW), which usually have an integral heat-recovery heat exchanger (the recuperator) to improve the efficiency. The most current micro-turbines are based on the single-stage radial flow compressor and either the single-stage or the double-stage radial turbine. They offer simple construction and more robust and reliable operation compared to the axial-flow components (employed in the large gas turbines). There are two key components of micro-turbines which vary from the large gas turbines: the ‘recuperator’ and the ‘foil bearings’ (air bearings). Careful studies, reviews and reference checks are required for these two components. A bright future is expected for the micro-turbines because of new applications in various emergency units (including nuclear facility emergency cooling systems), offshore applications and miniature generators.</p>
