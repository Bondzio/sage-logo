<p>This policy addresses how to respond to incidents of academic misconduct related to the Society’s journals, publications, and abstract review process. The Society takes seriously its role in safeguarding the research record and ensuring the reliability of our publications. A.S.P.E.N.’s approach to academic misconduct is primarily preventive, asking authors to provide information about prior or concurrent submission of their work and to use citations to traceable sources as well as conducting our internal refereeing and double-blind review processes. This policy addresses the Society’s approach when academic misconduct is suspected.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533613475670">
<title>Academic Misconduct Related to Publications</title>
<p>Academic misconduct relating to the journals and publications is defined as any instance that results in the publication of information that:</p>
<list id="list1-0884533613475670" list-type="order"><list-item><p>is intentionally erroneous;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>has been published elsewhere by a different author and not acknowledged (plagiarism);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>has been published elsewhere by the same author without acknowledgment (duplicate publishing, or self-plagiarism);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improperly assigns credit as an author or other improprieties of authorship;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>misappropriates ideas of others; or</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>fails to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements affecting research.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Intentionally erroneous information primarily involves research data that have been purposefully manipulated to provide misleading results that would not have otherwise been borne out—for example, inaccurately recording data to elicit the desired results, selectively reporting findings, or manipulating digital images.</p>
<p>Incidents of plagiarism occur when an author publishing in one of A.S.P.E.N.’s journals or publications includes published or unpublished information by a different author and does not acknowledge the original source or author. According to the World Association of Medical Editors, “Plagiarism is the use of others’ published and unpublished ideas or words (or other intellectual property) without attribution or permission, and presenting them as new and original rather than derived from an existing source. The intent and effect of plagiarism is to mislead the reader as to the contributions of the plagiarizer. This applies whether the ideas or words are taken from abstracts, research grant applications, Institutional Review Board applications, or unpublished or published manuscripts in an publication format (print or electronic).”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613475670">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Duplicate publishing occurs when an author publishing in one of A.S.P.E.N.’s journals or publications includes information he or she has already published in a different publication without acknowledging or explaining the rationale for the duplication to the Editor of the A.S.P.E.N. journal or publication. If the author discloses that the material has been previously published in another form, publication of the material in an A.S.P.E.N. journal is left to the Editor in Chief’s discretion and no disciplinary action is warranted.</p>
<p>Authorship improprieties include improper assignment of credit, such as excluding contributors or including those who have not made a contribution; misrepresentation of material as original in more than one publication; and submission of coauthored articles without the concurrence of all authors listed.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of scholarly activity is idea exchange among colleagues. Scholars are exposed to new ideas from others as they review manuscripts, abstracts, and grant applications. Improper use of such material may be considered fraud. Wholesale appropriation of such information constitutes misconduct.</p>
<p>Misconduct also occurs when authors seriously or willfully violate regulations and laws regarding such issues as use of funds, human subjects, care of animals, investigational drugs, new devices, or radioactive, biologic, or chemical materials.</p>
<p>All types of academic misconduct should be considered serious breaches in professionalism and, especially in cases of types 1 and 6 above, may result in patient care that is inappropriate or dangerous. In addition, such incidents may expose the Society to possible litigation. Therefore, each instance must be addressed thoroughly and promptly. Any investigation should remain confidential until it is completed, and discretion should be used to protect the integrity of the process and the individuals involved, should the allegation prove false.</p>
<p>Both of A.S.P.E.N.’s journals—the <italic>Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</italic> (<italic>JPEN</italic>) and <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> (<italic>NCP</italic>)—are members of COPE, the Committee on Publication Ethics, an international organization that provides advice to editors and publishers on all aspects of publication ethics and, in particular, how to handle cases of research and publication misconduct. A.S.P.E.N.’s policy is based in large part on COPE’s recommendations as well as those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors.</p>
<p>The Editor in Chief of the journal or publication in which the incident occurs should take the lead in resolving the matter, using COPE’s flowcharts for guidance. The Editor should take the following steps when addressing incidents of possible academic misconduct:</p>
<list id="list2-0884533613475670" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Immediately thank the reader, reviewer, or other interested party who brought the possible academic misconduct (hereafter referred to as the “Allegation”) to the journal’s attention and inform him or her of the Editor’s plan to investigate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Notify the Managing Editor, who will notify the Executive Director of the Allegation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the Allegation has not been made in writing, request that this be done.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On receiving the written Allegation, determine if the Allegation has merit. If it is found not to have merit, notify in writing the individuals who have brought the Allegation that a decision has been made not to investigate further and briefly describe the reasons for that decision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the Allegation is found to have merit, communicate with the author or authors involved and provide them with the opportunity to explain the incident. Also communicate with the individuals who brought the Allegation to let them know that a review is in process. The individuals who brought the claim may be questioned to provide more information, but the Editor should not otherwise provide information to them, to minimize the risk of defamation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine the extent and significance of the misconduct and notify the Managing Editor, who should notify the Executive Director before any other action is taken. If appropriate, the Executive Director shall notify the Society’s attorney.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In collaboration with the Managing Editor and the Executive Director, choose one or more of the following actions depending on the determination made in step 6:
<list id="list3-0884533613475670" list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Request that the author(s) write a letter of acknowledgment and apology to be published in a subsequent issue of the journal. In a publication, it may be issued as an erratum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Publish a statement of concern explaining the allegation to the public in a future issue of the journal. In a publication, it may be issued as an erratum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the express approval of the Society’s corporate counsel, notify in writing the department heads of all the authors’ academic institutions that the incident has occurred. This should be an objective, concise description of the incident.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Publish a retraction of the article in the journal. In a publication, it may be issued as an erratum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ban the author(s) from publishing in future A.S.P.E.N. journals and other publications.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Notify the author(s) in writing of the action proposed to be taken under section 7 and offer the author(s) the opportunity of a hearing within the next 60 days before a special committee appointed by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. At such a hearing, the Editor shall support his or her recommendation and the author(s) involved shall be given the opportunity to respond. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply and the Special Committee of the Board may consider any evidence it deems relevant. Within 1 week of the conclusion of such hearing, the committee shall notify the Editor and the involved author(s) of the action to be taken, which in no event may be more severe than that recommended by the Editor.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The Editor should make the final decision if there is disagreement about the appropriate course of action. The Editor may choose to consult the Associate Editors or members of the Editorial Board before making the decision.</p>
<p>According to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, editors have a responsibility to pursue possible scientific misconduct. However, editors are not responsible for conducting a full investigation or deciding whether scientific misconduct occurred. Those responsibilities rest with the institution where the work was conducted or with the funding agency.</p>

<title>Academic Misconduct Related to the Abstract Review Process</title>
<p>Academic misconduct relating to the abstract review process is defined as submission of an abstract that involves the 6 issues described under “Academic Misconduct Related to Publications” above or as a submission made by a member of the A.S.P.E.N. Abstract Review Committee and/or his or her department in which he or she does not declare a conflict of interest and recuses himself or herself from the review process. Abstract Review Committee and A.S.P.E.N. Research Committee members are asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and to pledge that they will not use research ideas or innovative approaches that they review in their own research efforts. Violation of the confidentiality agreement may also constitute academic misconduct.</p>
<p>In the abstract review process, duplicate submission occurs when the individual submitting an abstract for presentation at an A.S.P.E.N. meeting includes information he or she has already presented at another meeting without acknowledging or explaining the rationale for the duplication to the chair of the A.S.P.E.N. Abstract Review Committee. If the individual acknowledges that the material has been previously presented in another forum, acceptance of the material for A.S.P.E.N. is left to the committee’s discretion and no disciplinary action is warranted.</p>
<p>Each instance of misconduct must be addressed thoroughly and promptly. Any investigation should remain confidential until it is completed, and discretion should be used to protect the integrity of the process and the individuals involved, should the allegation prove false.</p>
<p>The Chair of the Abstract Review Committee should take the lead in resolving the matter. The Chair should take the following steps when addressing incidents of possible academic misconduct:</p>
<list id="list4-0884533613475670" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Immediately notify the Director of Research, who will notify the Executive Director of the possible academic misconduct (hereafter referred to as the “Allegation”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the Allegation has not been made in writing, request that this be done.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On receiving the written Allegation, determine if the Allegation has merit. If it is found not to have merit, notify in writing the individuals who have brought the Allegation that a decision has been made not to investigate further and briefly describe the reasons for that decision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the Allegation is found to have merit, communicate with the individuals who brought the Allegation; also communicate with the individual or individuals who submitted the abstract and provide them with the opportunity to explain the incident. The individuals who brought the claim may be questioned to provide more information, but the Editor should not otherwise provide information to them, to minimize the risk of defamation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine the extent and significance of the misconduct and notify the Program Director for Research, who should notify the Executive Director before any other action is taken. If appropriate, the Executive Director shall notify the Society’s attorney.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In collaboration with the Director of Research and the Executive Director, choose one or more of the following actions depending on the determination made in step 5:
<list id="list5-0884533613475670" list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Request that the individual(s) write a letter of acknowledgment and apology. If this occurs after the abstract has been presented at an A.S.P.E.N. meeting, the letter must be published in an appropriate A.S.P.E.N. communication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the express approval of the Society’s corporate counsel, notify in writing the department heads of all the authors’ academic institutions that the incident has occurred. This should be an objective, concise description of the incident.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ban the individuals(s) from submitting abstracts in the future.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of a committee member, the committee member may also be removed from the committee and banned from serving on future A.S.P.E.N. committees.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Notify the individual(s) in writing of the action proposed to be taken under section 6 and offer the individual(s) the opportunity of a hearing within the next 60 days before a special committee appointed by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. At such a hearing, the Chair shall support his or her recommendation and the individual(s) involved shall be given the opportunity to respond. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply and the Special Committee of the Board may consider any evidence it deems relevant. Within 1 week of the conclusion of such hearing, the committee shall notify the Chair and the involved individuals (s) of the action to be taken, which in no event may be more severe than that recommended by the Chair.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The Chair should make the final decision if there is disagreement about the appropriate course of action. The Chair may choose to consult the members of the Abstract Review Committee before making the decision.</p>

<sec id="section3-0884533613475670">
<title>The Role of the National Office</title>
<p>The national office—primarily the Executive Director and Publications and/or Research staff, as appropriate—should serve as advisers to the Editor or Chair in determining an appropriate course of action. They may be asked to consult with the journals’ publishing partner and gather informal information regarding how other societies have approached similar incidents. They will serve as the liaisons with the Society’s corporate counsel and the publishing partner. The national office should retain copies of all correspondence related to an investigation of potential academic misconduct.</p>
