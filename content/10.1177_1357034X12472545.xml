<abstract>
<p>Using the Online Library of Liberty database, which is sponsored by the Liberty Fund, I explore the role played by the word <italic>habit</italic> in the history of classical liberalism. At the same time, I interrogate the usefulness of the Search function, the digital finding tool provided by the website. Simultaneously a survey of the changing uses of habit and a meditation on our scholarly research habits, this article investigates the intersections between ideas about free agency and habitual behaviors. It also tests the possibilities and limitations of digital archives, the increasing availability of which threatens to make conventional scholarly habits obsolete.</p>

<body>
<p>In this article, I conduct two kinds of inquiry. The first is conventional—one might even say habitual—in both form and content: it takes the form of an argument and appears in the body of this article. The second disrupts traditional habits of scholarship by both using and interrogating a research strategy that has become the method of choice for students raised in the digital age: the use of the Search function to mine data from a digital archive. The results of this interrogation, as well as the meditations it has provoked, appear in the notes appended to the end of this article. Taken together, the two inquiries are designed to prompt further meditations, some of which appear in my conclusion, on the implications of the strategies scholars use to generate what counts as knowledge now.</p>
<p>A brief account of the archive I used for this article needs to appear before the notes because this archive has shaped the argument that unfolds in the main part of the essay. The archive consists of the approximately 1200 books contained in the Online Library of Liberty database. This database is sponsored and maintained by the Liberty Fund, which represents itself as a ‘private educational foundation established [in 1960] to encourage the study of the ideal of a society of free and responsible individuals’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1357034X12472545">1</xref>
</sup> In addition to maintaining the Online Library, the Foundation also sponsors conferences, publishes about 10 books a year, and produces video and audiotapes of conversations with ‘some of the most significant thinkers of our time’. As a tax-exempt educational institution, the Foundation does not engage in any explicit political action, and, although the addition of from 30 to 35 books a year suggests that some underlying principles inform the selection process, the Foundation’s librarian insists that no ‘ideological agenda’ is involved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1357034X12472545">2</xref>
</sup> The texts in the database cover roughly 5000 years, and include works, mostly in English translation, by Aristotle, Sophocles, Gaius, Cicero, Erasmus, and Plutarch, as well as American, British, German, and French authors from the middle ages to the present. There are a few selections from the Koran, but the collection overwhelmingly favors western writers, with a chronological bias towards the 18th and 19th centuries, and a generic bias towards prose, especially philosophy and the social sciences, over poetry or literature of any kind.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1357034X12472545">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The founders and custodians of the Library of Liberty represent the collection as an authoritative source for understanding the two ideals that come together in liberalism: liberty and equality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1357034X12472545">4</xref>
</sup> Deciding at the outset to limit my sources to the materials contained in this database has thus bound me to the invisible principles that inform the Library of Liberty’s texts. Rather than interrogate those principles or the selection that followed from them, I have embraced the delimitation of the archive because this has allowed me to bracket the question of what would otherwise have informed my own selection criteria and to focus instead on both what the database tells me about someone else’s ideas about how the word <italic>habit</italic> figures in the history of liberalism and the method by which I could find this out.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1357034X12472545">5</xref>
</sup> That the archive is digital is essential to both of these enterprises, for the twin features of a digital archive—its expansive scope and its searchable nature—have informed at every level the nature of the observations I offer here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1357034X12472545">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>If one takes the Library of Liberty’s collection as an authoritative source for understanding liberalism, then it becomes clear that<italic> habit</italic> plays a complex role in the history of this concept. While some authors write about habit as a mechanism for self-discipline or social improvement, others associate habit with enslaving self-indulgence, dehumanizing or mechanical activity, and mindless subservience to tyrannical rules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1357034X12472545">7</xref>
</sup> The etymology of the word provides one kind of explanation for this apparent contradiction. The OED presents a history in which the ancient Latin <italic>habitus</italic> or <italic>habere</italic> entered the English language without a distinction that was preserved in the French vernacular. In Latin, the counterparts of the English word <italic>habit</italic> could refer either to an external quality (‘outward appearance’, ‘fashion of body’) or to an internal disposition (‘mental constitution, character’). Thus, in English, the same word can refer to clothing or bodily comportment and to the innermost nature of one’s subjective being.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1357034X12472545">8</xref>
</sup> For that matter, whether ‘habit’ is an ‘art’, or a learned behavior, or somehow part of nature (or, as a compromise, a ‘second nature’) remains one site of chronic disagreement in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1357034X12472545">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the OED’s etymology provides one kind of explanation for the complex position <italic>habit</italic> occupies in the history of liberalism, another can be derived from the function this word plays in several of the texts that feature it. Some writers use the prevalence of habitual behaviors in a group of people, as opposed to exercises of consciousness, will, or reason, to explain why these groups remained in a state of ‘barbarism’ while other groups ‘progressed’. This is clearest in the work of Herbert Spencer, who, as we will see in a moment, yoked his treatment of habit to the newly scientific concepts of instinct and evolution, each of which was thought to follow determinate laws.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1357034X12472545">10</xref>
</sup> But it also appears in the late 18th century, when Sir William Jones used the Indian proclivity for habitual behaviors, which one might also call rituals, to justify what he considered to be their ineligibility for freedom or self-rule.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1357034X12472545">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet another perspective on the complex position <italic>habit</italic> occupies in liberalism comes from a historical analysis of changes within the problematic that (arguably) lies at the heart of liberalism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1357034X12472545">12</xref>
</sup> While liberalism might be said to be both a theory about individuals, which postulates an innate proclivity on the part of the individual to avoid pain and enhance pleasure, for example, and a theory about how individuals, living and working together, create supra-individual systems that acquire their own autonomous dynamics (like a rational market), the fact that these two theories are yoked together raises the question of how individuals relate to larger social units. For many of the late 19th-century scientists and philosophers who were interested in this question, and especially for the 20th-century sociologists who followed them, <italic>habit</italic> functioned as a switchpoint between individuals and the social. Habit (both the word and the concept) constituted one explanation for why—and how—individuals behaving in apparent isolation from each other could generate or participate in larger social dispositions. But it is also the case that changes in the way the concept of habit was framed reveal the scaling up of analysis within the social science disciplines—the shift of focus, as the social sciences more closely approximated the natural sciences and mathematics, away from individuals and toward the nature of sociality itself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1357034X12472545">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We can identify two significant shifts in the frames within which <italic>habit</italic> has been discussed. In the first, we see what might be called a metaphysical treatment of habit replaced by a moral-psychological treatment, and, in the second, this moral-psychological focus on the individual is supplanted by, or gradually metamorphoses into, a focus on the dynamics by which individuals generate—and interact with—collective social processes. In the passages represented in the Library of Liberty database, the metaphysical frame is best exemplified by St Thomas Aquinas’s work, although we also see it in Plato’s <italic>Dialogues</italic>, Pufendorf’s <italic>The Whole Duty of Man</italic>, and, somewhat anachronistically, Kant’s <italic>Critique of Practical Reason</italic>. These writers seek to understand the unchanging ontology of habit, its universal place in nature, especially human nature, and its definitive operations. A characteristic example is Plato’s definition-by-opposition: ‘Consciousness is opposed to habit, inattention, sleep, and death.’ The moral-psychological frame becomes clear in John Locke’s writing, especially <italic>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</italic>. For Locke, who was interested in the individual <italic>as an instance of</italic>  human nature rather than in human nature in the abstract, habit was the mechanism that could lead the innately blank individual to virtuous behavior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1357034X12472545">14</xref>
</sup> Locke’s interest in inculcating moral behavior in individuals was linked to his interest in education, and it was his attempt to understand the mechanisms inherent in the educational process that began to open his moral-psychological frame to the interests in collective or social behavior that would eventually yield what I will call the frame of sociality.</p>
<p>This frame gradually emerged from the moral-psychological frame that dominated writing about habit in the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries by way of the associationist philosophy developed by David Hartley and elaborated, in subsequent decades, by Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, and John Stuart Mill (among others). Associationism supplied Locke’s sketchy description of the relationship between the child’s innate preference for pleasure over pain and moral growth through an internal mechanism: according to this theory, the recurrence of a link between one idea and another, or between a sensation and an idea, gradually teaches the child to associate the two, then to expect one when the other occurs. In this mechanistic psychology, habit can generate either beneficial or deleterious results and its operations become so routinized over time that they can eventually render the affect that once cemented the link superfluous. ‘As we proceed in the formation of habits’, John Stuart Mill writes, ‘and become accustomed to will a particular course of conduct because it is pleasurable, we at last continue to will it without any reference to its being pleasurable.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1357034X12472545">15</xref>
</sup> By the end of the 19th century, in the work of social theorists like Herbert Spencer and Thorstein Veblen, the operations of habit that could be observed in individuals were being identified in larger-scale social units—like ‘races’, nations, and even the human race. In such accounts, ‘habits of life’ could be transmitted across generations, and, in the ‘progress’ of the human race toward adaptation to the social state, resulted in the transformation of human nature itself. The mechanism that underwrote such changes was natural selection—the principle of evolution that had been articulated by Darwin’s <italic>Origin of Species</italic>. By the 20th century, most social scientists who investigated habit did so within the frame of sociality, rather than those of metaphysics or moral philosophy. For writers like Max Weber and Pierre Bourdieu (whose works do not appear in the Library of Liberty), <italic>habit</italic> was less important than <italic>habitus</italic>, for the latter constituted a collective disposition that could indicate (if it could not precisely explain) the individual’s absorption into the greater whole.</p>
<p>As the English descendant of a Latin word that once looked two ways at once (inward, toward an individual’s disposition or the qualities of human nature, and outward, toward the body’s surface or clothing), <italic>habit</italic> generally lost its outward-oriented trajectory during the 18th century—the century that also gave birth to classical liberalism. During the following centuries, as liberalism was clarified and complicated, <italic>habit</italic> turned outward in a new way: no longer used to designate the outward clothing or deportment of the body, <italic>habit</italic> became part of an explanation of how individuals, living together in collective sociality, came to share certain identifiable traits, or dispositions. When Bourdieu used the Latin <italic>habitus</italic> to invoke this collective, but group-specific disposition, he was not simply returning to the Latin root of <italic>habit</italic> but giving a name to what seems like the endpoint of one teleological trajectory: a journey from the interior of the individual (whether as human nature or moral psychology) to interiors and behaviors that are somehow simultaneously individual and collective. As I have already said, the conjunction of the individual and the collective, which is implied by the word <italic>habitus</italic>, constitutes both the heart of classical liberalism and its definitive problematic. How can individuals be free and self-determining if they are also part of larger, autonomous collectives that are also (in many accounts) both rule-governed and rational? What if the wishes of a particular individual conflict with the wishes—or needs—of the collective (as they arguably do in matters like taxation, public health, and national security)? How do individual experiences, especially educational experiences, bring particular people into the collective sociality—and how do we account for educational institutions’ failure to bring everyone into collective agreement? If the word <italic>habit</italic> helps to address some of these issues, in other words, it fails to answer all of the questions that writers who have used it—in the name of liberal values—supposedly endorse.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Meditation on Scholarly Habits</title>
<p>Even though I have differentiated spatially between the two parts of this essay, I intend for them to interact with and comment upon each other. What we think of as the body of the text does contain an argument, but, as I attempt to make clear in my notes, the method by which I generated that argument raises more questions than the summary narrative I provide could answer. At the very least, the two narrative drives generated by the two sections—the one, a drive toward argumentative coherence and closure; the other, a drive that is episodic and occasional—conflict with each other so as to fracture the experience of reading. The fractured reading experience, in turn, makes me think about how carefully constructed—how artificial—narrative coherence is in any scholarly argument, and how many of the observations one makes while engaged with the archive never make it into the finished essay because they do not support the argument one has chosen to make. The logic of the selection process behind such omissions is not visible in the finished product, just as the logic behind the texts included in the Library of Liberty is invisible. The tension I felt while writing the article—between the desire to create a coherent argument and an irritated sensitivity to the process in which Search had engaged me—made me acutely aware of the interplay between the drive for narrative coherence and this other drive, which goes off in all directions and seems to obey a logic all its own.</p>
<p>The methodological self-consciousness that using Search produced in me has also made me think about the assumptions implicit in using chronology or an author’s name to organize a scholarly argument. As Search guided me through the archive, in what seemed to me to be a random fashion, I found myself grouping the passages by period and by author so that I would be able to produce the kinds of arguments I am used to constructing. But Search is indifferent to time and authorship. The order in which it produces results, which presumably obeys some logic I could not see, would have supported some other kind of argument, which does not privilege authors or the periods in which texts were published. This other argument, which does not appear in my article, might have revealed something about uses of the word <italic>habit</italic> that is obscured by the more conventional emphasis on chronological change and authorial coherence. I could not understand or write that other argument, but, as I worked on the article, I was dimly aware of its presence, as a silent rebuke to my assumption that what matters most about quotations is who said them and when they appeared.</p>
<p>Finally, the tension between the body of my article and its abjected other part has made me wonder what kinds of questions Search could have helped me answer better than the questions to which I implicitly asked it to respond. If I had been less fixated on producing a chronological narrative, organized by familiar authorial names, could I have seen in the Search results patterns that I did not see? Could I have learned from its logic another way of looking at the archive? If I had really let Search guide me, instead of shaping the results it produced to fit the categories I brought to it, could I have more effectively interrogated arguments that link paraphrased sets of ideas to the proper names of authors? If I had really focused on the use of a single word, instead of trying to place that word back in the context of paragraphs that state ideas, could I have discovered the questions that drive Search? I cannot answer these questions because I still languish in the throes of my own scholarly habits, which generate results that I do consider valuable. I think I have to leave it to younger scholars, who use and understand Search so much better than I do, to find the questions Search can answer and explain why the arguments Search supports are valuable too.</p>

<p>Private conversation with David Hart, librarian for the Liberty Fund (27 April 2010). For the purposes of this article, I accepted Hart’s statement that selection of the books follows no ideological agenda, but the omission of two of the sociologists that many left-leaning scholars associate with habit and liberalism more generally—Max Weber and Pierre Bourdieu—raises questions. I should also note that Pierre F. Goodrich, the founder of the collection that became the heart of the Liberty Fund library, split from Mortimer Adler over a disagreement about how to define ‘great books’. The substance of this disagreement is lost but may persist in the agenda implicit in the current selection of books.</p>
</fn>

<p>The Liberty Fund library originated in the private book collection of Pierre F. Goodrich, who briefly collaborated with Mortimer Adler in planning the Great Books curriculum at the University of Chicago. Part of Goodrich’s collection is now housed at the Lily Library at Wabash College (conversation with David Hart, 27 April 2010).</p>

<p>The Liberty Fund states that its mission is ‘to encourage the study of the ideal of a society of free and responsible individuals’ (accessed from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/index">http://oll.libertyfund.org/index</ext-link> on 30 May 2010). For the definition I cite, see Roger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12472545">Scruton, ‘Rousseau and the origins of liberalism’ (1999</xref>: 21).</p>

<p>My primary method was to use the Search function to find instances of the word <italic>habit</italic> in the database. Because the items in the database are not linked, as pages on the worldwide web are, the search engine the site uses must be one designed for traditional information retrieval, not a link analysis engine. Since there are thousands of different search engines, it is not obvious which engine—or even what exact type—the Online Library of Liberty uses. One of the constraints imposed by the site’s Search engine is that only the word <italic>habit</italic> figures in its results. Concepts and words related to the ideas associated with habit (routine, repetition, and so on) fall outside the purview of Search, which I capitalize in order to distinguish the digital operation from my own research activity. The spokesperson for the Liberty Library did not know what kind of search engine the archive uses.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1357034X12472545">
<label>6.</label>
<p>I decided at the outset to search the entire database for the word <italic>habit</italic>—that is, not to use any of the filters the site provides to delimit a search by time or author. The search returned 7094 results, each of which produced an excerpt from a text with the word <italic>habit</italic>(or <italic>inhabitants</italic> or any other variant of the word) highlighted in yellow. Over the course of several months, during which the total of passages increased to 7105, I ‘read’ every excerpt (more on the quotation marks around that word in note 13), Should be full out passages that seemed interesting, relevant, or, in some other way, ‘important’. I copied these passages, along with the identifying source information that dropped down from a box entitled ‘citation’, into a Word file. After using Search to create this file, I read through the passages and numbered them, so that I could make another, smaller file. The 74 passages in this smaller file I grouped and ordered according to an index I made based on what I had learned from ‘reading’ everything in the original search. This smaller file became my primary archive for the argument that unfolds above. Deciding to limit myself to the results returned by Search excluded the traditional methods by which I would ordinarily have conducted research for this article. These methods include extensive and intensive reading of a relatively small number of primary sources in their entirety; consulting scholarly bibliographies to identify secondary sources; then developing an argument that engaged the secondary scholarship in order to illuminate hitherto unexamined aspects of one or more of the primary sources.</p>
<p>It is important to note that using Search in this manner makes one acutely aware that the features of the technology impose themselves on the process of research. I registered four senses in which Search made itself felt in my research. (1) Because Search makes mistakes, sometimes presenting the same passage twice, it led me to wonder whether it also omits passages that contain the word <italic>habit</italic>. There is no way to check for such omissions, so I had no way to test my conclusions. (2) While Search allows one to process enormous numbers of texts relatively efficiently, the resulting scale sacrifices other kinds of coherence, which might have been produced by including longer textual passages or reading the excerpted sentences in the context of historical or biographical material. Search also fails to sort by relevance in linked sites or pages, as does Google’s ranking algorithm. (3) Using Search is tedious. Granted that the volume of works one might consult if one were addressing this topic without the Library of Liberty database is potentially even more unmanageable than the one included in this database, it is nevertheless my experience that the scale and the targeted searchability of texts that digitalization facilitates deprive one of many of the pleasures that make scholarly research interesting: the happy discoveries that research serendipity sometimes yields; understanding the progressive logic of a writer’s developing argument; appreciating the collective authority of assembled examples. The iterative logic of Search forced me to supplement its sheer repetition with my judgment about what constitutes an ‘important’ passage. This judgment was inevitably based on my familiarity with the history of liberalism. It is possible—and desirable—that the extensive use of Search will eventually generate new research questions better suited to the methodological tool. If, for example, I had been investigating the relative frequency of the topics with which the word <italic>habit</italic> was associated instead of trying to reconstruct a history of the uses of the word, I would have remarked on the reappearance of education, monetary topics, and law. Any question that privileges quantification or patterning seems more suited to use of the Search function than do questions that focus on change. (4) Search privileges the vertical experience of texts conceptually laid one on top of one another. This challenged my habit of reading in a linear manner, which privileges the horizontal experience of arguments that unfold in time.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1357034X12472545">
<label>7.</label>
<p>The numerous champions of habit include Hugo Grotius, Benjamin Constant, Viscount James Bryce, Adam Smith, William Paley, and Friedrich von Hayek. The smaller number of critics includes Thomas Paine, Thomas Hodgskin, and Immanuel Kant. Using Search tended to undermine my confidence in using proper names even in this customary way because, even though each passage is preceded by the phrase ‘found in’ followed by an author’s (sometimes, in what seems to be one of Search’s glitches, a translator’s) name, the passages are so brief that I began to distrust their ‘representativeness’. What could it mean to be ‘representative’ when the same writer might say exactly the opposite in another passage? Stripped of context, what could a single passage be said to represent—other than an instance of the writer’s use of the word? Such questions led me to try not to link anything I gleaned from this exercise to any claims about what particular individuals thought or believed.</p>

<p>Earlier English writers in the collection, like Shakespeare and Chaucer, use the word <italic>habit</italic> in both senses; early 18th-century writers, like Locke and Addison, also invoke both senses; but it is my sense that, even though a mid-18th-century writer like Hume could still draw on both sets of meanings, he more clearly distinguished between them than earlier writers did. I hesitate to make even this rough generalization because Search’s complete disrespect for chronology made drawing any kind of conclusions about change extremely difficult. Only when I supplemented my use of Search with a narrative gleaned from a work of critical scholarship (see note 12) could I offer even the tentative conclusions about the history of <italic>habit</italic>’s place in liberalism that appear in the body of my article. Without access to the mathematical algorithm that informs this particular search protocol, moreover, I could not determine the logic by which the Library of Liberty’s Search orders its presentation of returns. Unlike Google’s PageRank, which ranks web pages by a complex proprietary formula based on the frequency of citations or ‘hits’, the search engine of this database appeared to me to present the passages randomly.</p>

<p>The debate about whether habit belongs to nature or art goes back at least to Thomas Aquinas (<italic>Summa Theologica</italic>), but it was also taken up by writers like Richard Cumberland (<italic>A Treatise of the Laws of Nature</italic>), George Turnbull (<italic>Principles of Moral and Christian Philosophy</italic>), and Lord Kames (<italic>Principles of Criticism</italic>). This debate culminated in the late 19th-century attempt to link habit to evolution and brain function (see Herbert Spencer, <italic>The Principles of Ethics</italic> and Thorstein Veblen, <italic>The Theory of the Leisure Class</italic>).</p>

<p>“In conformity with the biological law that the higher the organisms the longer they take to evolve, members of the inferior human races may be expected to complete their mental evolution sooner than members of the superior races; and we have evidence that they do this. Travelers from many regions comment, now on the great precocity of children among savage and semi-civilized peoples, and now on the early arrest of their mental progress. Though we scarcely need more proofs that this general contrast exists, there remains to be asked the question, whether it is consistently maintained throughout all groups of races, from the lowest to the highest—whether, say, the Australian differs in this respect from the Hindu, as much as the Hindu does from the European.” (<italic>Essays: Scientific, Political, and Speculative.

<p>One of my sources for this historical narrative is John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12472545">Passmore, <italic>The Perfectibility of Man</italic> (1970)</xref>. Without this source, and my own prior knowledge, I would have been hard pressed to come up with any argument at all. While consulting this source deviated from my initial plan to limit my method to reading what Search returned, I justify my turn to Passmore both by the frustration that Search provoked and by the fact that Search included a few passages from Passmore’s book in its results. I have no idea why Passmore’s scholarly study of perfectibility is included in the database, because the vast majority of its texts are primary sources.</p>

<p>The scaling up that I am identifying in the historical framing of <italic>habit</italic> repeats, at the level of my argument’s content, one effect that Search yields when used as a methodological tool. That is, because Search can cover such an enormous database and because its operation is not directed by any rationale other than the logic mathematically coded into its algorithm, it directs attention to the patterns in the database as a whole rather than to the complexities of the individual text. Thus, the historical trajectory visible in the changing ways that <italic>habit</italic> has been framed in the liberal tradition, as manifest in this database, not only reflects the increasingly scientific nature of the social sciences but also anticipates the methodological changes enabled by digitalization. This shift is epitomized by the move from close textual analysis, whether for argument or style, to quantification. Perhaps this is the place for me to comment on the different protocols of reading I used in this inquiry. The ‘reading’ I performed on the 7094 passages that Search returned might better be called ‘skimming’, since I did not read every passage carefully or more than once. I confined my intensive, linear reading to the two files I constructed from the passages that Search returned. Finally, reading and writing this article have taken their own forms, for moving between the argument conducted in the body of the text and the more random meditations in the footnotes has required an entirely different kind of concentration—or tolerance for distraction. I should note that the creed set out by Wabash College, which was presumably influenced by Goodrich’s own preferred reading practice, endorses the middle form of reading, which privileges concentration, persistence, and discipline over inclusiveness or speed of consumption. Wabash’s creed states: <disp-quote>
<p>The patience to be thorough, the concentration to understand and the persistence to grasp and to apply, are traits that most clearly mark off the truly educated and disciplined fellows; and they are precisely the three traits which are most overlooked and neglected in the modern school and college curriculum. When discipline is withdrawn, dawdling quickly enters and the habit of dawdling is as corrupting to the intellect as it is to the morals (‘Creed’, <italic>Wabash College: Pure American</italic> [Crawfordsville, IN: Wabash College, 1918], p. 4; quoted in Dane Starbuck, <italic>The Goodriches: An American Family</italic>[Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2001].

<p>Passmore notes that Locke’s understanding of the relationship between habit and virtue differed from Plato’s: whereas Plato insisted that ‘<italic>true</italic> virtue, “philosophical” goodness, must rest on knowledge, not on habit’, for Locke, ‘virtue … consists in having good habits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12472545">1970</xref>: 162, 161)</p>
