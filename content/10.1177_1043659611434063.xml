<p>In this innovative text, Dr. Ray presents her four-dimensional model of Transcultural Caring Dynamics. Dr. Ray’s purpose is to teach and provide a discussion forum for student nurses, nurses, and other health care providers about the dimensions of transcultural caring so that they may better understand and care for people of different cultures. The book is designed to be used by students at undergraduate and graduate levels, from a variety of health care disciplines, as well as health care professionals desiring to provide more transculturally congruent care in their practices. Dr. Ray has done a superb job of speaking to health care providers at all educational and experience levels.</p>
<p>The major concepts of the model are the four caring dynamics: the <italic>essence of caring</italic>, <italic>transcultural caring ethics</italic>, <italic>transcultural context</italic>, and <italic>universal sources</italic>. Together they provide the basis for <italic>understanding</italic> and <italic>awareness</italic> of diverse cultures, communities, and nations and promote <italic>choice</italic> in providing and receiving culturally congruent care within the context of the model. Ray uses the constructs of love, empathy, authenticity, compassion, copresence, availability, attendance, and communication to define the <italic>essence of a caring dynamic</italic>. She further describes love as the mediating force to guide moral caring and behavior and to facilitate fairness within the cultural context. The good, commitment, trust, respect, fidelity, beneficence, justice, autonomy, human, cultural, and natural rights are constructs for the <italic>transcultural caring ethics dynamic</italic>, which is defined as the knowledge shaping the moral caring experience that facilitates transcultural ethical caring. <italic>Transcultural context</italic> is described as the diverse identity and personal/ethnic/ cultural values, beliefs, and attitudes about relationships, symbols, rituals guiding transcultural experience in social, communal, health care, and global cultural systems. The theoretical construct underlying this definition is the person within the family, society, cultural-political, economical, technological, ecological, and health care systems. Finally, <italic>universal sources</italic> are the standards of spiritual/religious traditions shaping transcultural caring experiences. They are constructed on religion/spirituality albeit God, Christ, Buddha, The Absolute, Allah, Power, Force Energy, Creativity, Healing, and Mythology. The four dynamics converge at the center of the model, which leads to transcultural caring awareness, understanding, and choice and thus forms the foundation of caring for people transculturally.</p>
<p>The first chapter provides an overview of the model. Then each dynamic of the model is discussed in depth. At the end of each chapter are several case studies and questions specific to the dynamic discussed, as well as reflective questions related to personal thoughts about the clinical situation, including pathology and resulting nursing care modalities. Ray presents a variety of tools for a transcultural inquiry, assessment, planning, and evaluation. These tools include the following: the <italic>Transcultural Caring Dynamics Assessment Tool</italic>, <italic>Ray’s Transcultural Spiritual-Ethical Communicative Caring Tool</italic>, <italic>Transcultural Caring Culture Value Conflict Assessment Tool</italic>, and the <italic>Dynamics Assessment of Transcultural Nursing Negotiation Tool.</italic> The purpose, development, and use of each tool are described in depth. The second section of the book offers a variety of transcultural patient care situations where the tools mentioned above may be used for discussion and analysis of the clinical situations. This opportunity to discuss and analyze multiple case studies using the tools and guided by the model is a major strength of the book as it guides both students and professionals in developing culturally sensitive, creative transcultural caring practice skills when working with individuals and families from diverse cultures, communities, and nations.</p>
<p>The text is data based and well researched, as is evidenced by the many current and classic references from the fields of nursing, anthropology, theology, political science, economics, and philosophy. Philosophies and research were analyzed rigorously in the development of this unique and original model that reflects Dr. Ray’s belief about the importance of caring within the context of cultural diversity. Additionally, the assessment tools and the case studies reflect the use of careful analysis and reflection to make them parsimonious and practical. Each case study carefully highlights the points that emphasize particular elements of the model and how the tools may be used. The author has extensive background in nursing and anthropology, and as an experienced researcher and teacher, infuses this book with a richness of knowledge from a variety of disciplines and experience.</p>
<p>Dr. Anne Vitale from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://DavisPlus.com">DavisPlus.com</ext-link> assisted with the online book, instructor guides and student activities which are accessible through <italic>Davis Plus Online Instructor and Student Resource Center</italic> (F. A. Davis Publishers) to further enhance learning and discussion. Student resources may be accessed free of charge and include copies of each of the tools and the study guide questions that are available at the end of each chapter. The questions may be answered by the students online through the F. A. Davis website and emailed to the course instructor, making this text ideal for distance learning and online courses. Instructor resources are available with course adoption of the text and include PowerPoint slides and an instructor’s guide. The text is also in digital format for cost savings to students of about half the price of the printed text.</p>
<p><italic>Transcultural Caring Dynamics in Nursing and Health Care</italic> is a first-class text for teaching transcultural care concepts, as well as a solid resource for those wanting to implement transcultural concepts into their practice area. Additionally, it is written by a transcultural nurse, as well as an anthropologist who is an expert in transcultural health, holistic caring, and in nursing. The resources provided in the book and online are invaluable to teachers and students alike.</p>
