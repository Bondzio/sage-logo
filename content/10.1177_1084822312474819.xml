<abstract>
<p>When home health agencies employ supply chain practices that require nurses to order, handle, and deliver patient supplies, critical nursing resources are diverted from patient care. A model that enables full assessment of the nursing resources associated with a set of supply chain practices is presented. In this model, nurse involvement is measured in hours per nurse per year. The current state of nurse involvement in home health supply chains in the United States is quantified by considering survey data in the model. Results suggest the average amount of nurse involvement time per year is 170 hr. Stated another way, typical nurse involvement in supply chain functions is time that could have been spent conducting an additional 120 patient visits per nurse per year.</p>

<body>
<p>In home health care, supplies are needed in the home when health care professionals perform patient visits. The specific supplies required for each patient visit depend on, among other things, the patient diagnosis and care plan. The set of activities associated with the management of the sourcing, procuring, storing, and delivering of supplies is referred to as the Home Health Supply Chain. Ensuring the right supplies are available in the right place (the home) at the right time (the visit start time) is a complex logistical challenge, especially considering that care is provided across geographically distributed patient locations.</p>
<p>Results of a 2010 survey of home care agencies aimed at characterizing the Home Health Supply Chain revealed that despite their complexity, home health supply chains are performing effectively according to common supply chain metrics. Lead times between order placement and receipt of supplies in the home are low, and stockouts—not having the right supplies available at the time of the patient visit—occur infrequently. However, survey results also revealed that home health supply chains may be performing inefficiently, with high indirect costs stemming from nurse involvement in nonclinical supply chain duties such as order placement, supply retrieval, and supply delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312474819">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nurse time spent performing supply chain duties is time spent away from patient care. However, home care managers may not think of nurse involvement in supply chain duties as a primary cost driver in the home health supply chain. When asked about supply chain costs during interviews conducted by our research team, most home care managers referred only to the <italic>direct cost</italic> of supplies. In an industry where the demand for home care services exceeds the supply of nurses, and considering the fact that this gap is increasing, supply chain practices must be examined to determine whether indirect costs associated with nurse involvement levels are acceptable.</p>
<p>In this research, we develop a Home Health Nurse Supply Chain Involvement Model that can be used to quantify the time a nurse spends annually on supply chain duties, given those duties the nurse is required to perform. Involvement is measured in hours per nurse per year. This model enables home care managers to fully assess the nurse staffing resources required by a particular supply chain configuration. It can be used to quickly diagnose the current state of an agency’s supply chain. It can also be used to estimate the impact of changing one or more of an agency’s supply chain practices. Thus it is a tool to analyze and improve home health supply chains.</p>
<p>We use data from multiple sources to populate the Home Health Nurse Supply Chain Involvement Model to quantify the current state of nurse involvement in home health supply chains in the United States. While the model can be used to obtain simple estimates of the average level of nurse involvement per year in supply chain practices, we go a step further and use the model in combination with Monte Carlo simulation to determine the full distribution of annual nurse involvement. We do so because certain practices will require significantly more than average and others will require significantly less than average levels of nurse involvement. Determining the full distribution of nurse involvement provides information regarding the variation in nurse involvement in supply chain practices and allows answering questions such as (a) How much time per year is spent by the top 10% of performers (as identified by low levels of involvement), (b) how much time per year is spent by the bottom 10% of performers, and (c) what supply chain practices are employed by these two groups, respectively? Our research suggests the average amount of nurse involvement time per year is 170 hr—this equates to 4.3 weeks of time spent on supply chain–related tasks. Stated another way, typical nurse involvement in supply chain functions is time that could have been spent conducting an additional 120 patient visits per year.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. First, we describe how the Home Health Nurse Involvement Model was developed and disclose data sources used to populate the model. We additionally describe the simulation methods used in conjunction with the model to determine the full distribution of nurse involvement in home health supply chains in the United States. Next, we give both the model and the distributions used to populate it. Model results are presented, and finally, conclusions and suggestions regarding future research are discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822312474819" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The methodology employed in this research includes model development, data analysis to determine input parameter distributions for the model, and simulation to use the model to estimate total annual nurse involvement in supply chain functions.</p>
<sec id="section2-1084822312474819">
<title>Model Development</title>
<p>Supply chain processes that require home health nurse involvement were identified from responses to the Home Health Supply Chain Survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312474819">1</xref></sup> Order placement, supply retrieval, and supply delivery processes comprise the key elements of the Home Health Supply Chain Nurse Involvement model. Mathematical modeling was used to combine these elements into an expression for total annual supply chain involvement per nurse, measured in hours per nurse per year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1084822312474819">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was used to determine an input distribution for each element of the model. Data sources included the Healthcare Cost Report Information System for Home Health Agencies (HCRIS for HHAs) database from 2009, responses to the 2010 Home Health Supply Chain Survey, and expert interviews with home care executives conducted in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312474819">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312474819">2</xref></sup> The HCRIS for HHAs database includes information such as cost, utilization, and agency characteristics for each Medicare-certified home health agency in the United States. Home health agencies are required to report this information to CMS each year. Data from HCRIS was used to populate model elements for the facility characteristics of service region size and nurse staffing levels. Due to published concerns regarding the quality of data corresponding to hospital-affiliated agencies in HCRIS, the database was filtered to include data corresponding only to freestanding agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312474819">3</xref></sup> Using the almost 6,000 observations that remained, statistical methods were employed to determine distributions of best fit for facility characteristic model elements, but no statistically significant distributions were identified at a level of significance of 0.10. Therefore, discrete probability distributions were manually derived for facility characteristic input parameters using the available data.</p>
<p>Several model elements were populated with data from the Home Health Supply Chain Survey. For these items, discrete probability distributions were derived using response frequency analysis. In some cases, the data available through the Home Health Supply Chain was not sufficient to quantify the time nurses spend engaging in a particular activity. Additional information was sought via expert interviews. These interviews were conducted in 2012 via email with executives of home care agencies who had responded to the Home Health Supply Chain Survey, provided contact information, and indicated their agency employed a particular supply chain process of interest. These individuals were asked to estimate the time each nurse spends engaging in the process of interest. Discrete probability distributions for nurse time spent on various processes were developed manually from the responses received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1084822312474819">
<title>Simulation</title>
<p>Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to determine the distribution of home health nurse supply chain involvement. In the Home Health Supply Chain Nurse Involvement model, uncertain elements are treated as random variables that are distributed as determined via data analysis. When a single observation is sampled from each input parameter distribution, those observations together represent a single hypothetical home health agency nurse and describe the supply chain processes in which the nurse is involved. The observations can be substituted in place of the uncertain elements in the model to estimate the total annual time this nurse will spend performing supply chain duties. As this process is replicated, many different estimates of annual nurse involvement result, each representing a different nurse. Finally, the bootstrapping method is used to determine a distribution for the resulting observations.</p>
<p>An inherent assumption in the modeling process should be noted. As mentioned, when a single observation is randomly sampled from an input parameter distribution, that observation represents one nurse and describes a supply chain process in which the nurse is involved. The input parameter distributions were determined from a response set that contained only a single response for each included agency. These responses were not weighted by the number of nurses employed by each included agency. Thus the response from an agency employing many nurses influenced the distributions that were developed no more than an agency employing fewer nurses. While this could bias estimates of time spent per nurse per year, previous research determined that agency patient volume, which is correlated with agency staffing levels, was independent from many supply chain practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312474819">1</xref></sup> That is, agency staffing levels did not make an agency more or less likely to employ a particular supply chain practice. Exceptions include the following, where an agency employing more staff results in an increased likelihood of (a) nurses placing orders more frequently, (b) the agency employing the direct shipment method for patient supplies, and (c) nurses visiting the inventory room less often. Because one of these factors results in increased levels of nurse involvement in the supply chain (a), and two result in decreased levels of nurse involvement (b-c), these factors mitigate opposing impacts, to some degree. Thus overall impact of this assumption on our model results is believed to be minimal.</p>

<sec id="section5-1084822312474819">
<title>Model Development</title>
<p>The model is comprised of three key elements: supply order placement, retrieval, and delivery. For each element, the amount of time a nurse spends for a particular home health agency on each of these tasks will depend on processes employed by the agency. Each task is described below and then an example is provided.</p>
<sec id="section6-1084822312474819">
<title>Order Placement</title>
<p>A common practice among home health agencies is to allocate the responsibility of monitoring patient supply needs and ordering those supplies to home health nurses. The time spent per nurse per year placing orders for supplies depends on the method of order placement used at a particular agency. For example, some agencies ask nurses to monitor supply needs but do not ask them to place individual orders for each patient. Instead, nurses carry supplies in their vehicles and visit an inventory room located in the home health agency office periodically to restock their vehicles. In this case, nurses spend no time placing orders but will spend time restocking their vehicles. Other methods of order placement also relieve nurses from involvement in this function, such as orders that are transmitted electronically via an automated ordering system integrated with the electronic health record. However, methods such as placing phone calls or sending emails between nurses and a supply manager or supplier do require nurse time.</p>

<title>Supply Retrieval</title>
<p>Many home health agencies store supplies in an inventory room in the main home health agency office that nurses must periodically visit to retrieve supplies. The time a nurse spends per trip to the inventory room retrieving supplies will depend on how those supplies are stored. For example, are they stored in ready-to-go patient bundles, or are they stored in bulk by type, such that the nurse must individually pick each needed supply? Additionally, the time a nurse spends per year retrieving supplies will depend on the number of trips made to the inventory room each year. This in turn depends on the supply delivery method employed by the agency. For example, if a home health agency arranges for supplies to be shipped directly to patient homes from a supplier, then nurses may only visit the inventory room infrequently to obtain a supply for which the need was unanticipated. However, if a home health agency has supplies shipped to the agency prior to delivery to the patient, nurses are more likely to visit the inventory room more often to obtain the supplies needed for each visit. Thus the time spent per nurse per year retrieving supplies depends primarily on supply delivery method and supply storage method.</p>

<title>Supply Delivery</title>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, the number of trips a nurse makes to the inventory room each year depends on the supply delivery method employed by the home health agency. In addition to supply retrieval time, driving time that the nurse would not otherwise encounter is also incurred during each of these trips. In many home health agencies, nurses have the option to begin their day at their own homes, travel to the home of their first scheduled patient, and proceed in this manner until returning to their own home at the end of the day. Requiring a trip to the inventory room to retrieve supplies before the first patient can be visited results in an extra leg of travel. Of course, some agencies ask their nurses to regularly visit the agency main office for other reasons, such as team meetings. These trips and the associated driving time should not be included in models discussed here.</p>
<p>The duration of travel between a nurse’s home and the inventory room where supplies are stored cannot be known with certainty without knowing the address of each home health nurse and home health agency inventory room. It is not reasonable to expect this information to be available. Thus we provide an approximation for the duration of this leg of travel using information about the size of the region being served by a home health agency. According to Finch (2010), the length <italic>L</italic> of a line connecting two points randomly selected from a circle of area <italic>A</italic> can be approximated as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312474819">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>This can be used to approximate the duration of the leg of travel by assuming the two randomly selected points represent the nurse’s home and the location of the inventory room and by also assuming the home health agency service region can be modeled as a circle. Realistically, home health agency service regions are not perfectly circular in nature, but practically, this model allows for a reasonable approximation of travel duration without requiring detailed knowledge of nurse and inventory room locations. Let <italic>A</italic> be the area of the home health agency service region in square miles and let <italic>v</italic> be the vehicle speed in miles per hour.

<title>Example</title>
<p>Consider the following example to demonstrate the nurse involvement model. Suppose a home health agency employs an order placement method that requires nurses to place phone calls to a supply manager when patient supplies are needed. According to their experience placing orders, nurses working for the home health agency have estimated they spend 30 min per week on this task (<inline-formula id="inline-formula7-1084822312474819">

<p>Suppose also that the agency in this example reports using a supply delivery method that requires nurses to visit the inventory room three times per week to retrieve supplies (<inline-formula id="inline-formula8-1084822312474819">

<p>Finally, the home health agency in this example indicates that supplies are stored in patient-specific bundles in the inventory room and estimates that a total of 5 min is required to retrieve supplies each time the nurse visits the inventory room (<inline-formula id="inline-formula9-1084822312474819">

<title>Model Parameters</title>
<p>Individual home health agencies can use the model described above to estimate the time each of their nurses spend annually on supply chain duties by populating the model with data describing their own operations. In this research, we use the model to approximate the distribution of total annual supply chain involvement per nurse across all home health agencies in the United States. To do so, we treat each element of the model as an independent random variable. For example, by letting <italic>A</italic> denote a random variable representing home health agency service region size, the distribution of service region size across all home health agencies is derived from available data. In this section, the distribution of each random variable is specified and methods used to determine each distribution are described.</p>

First the nurse must drive to the home health agency, park his or her vehicle and walk to the inventory room, then pick or retrieve supplies from the inventory room, and finally return to the parked vehicle. Driving time is addressed in the Supply Delivery portion of the model and thus is not included here. Only parking, walking, and retrieving tasks are included.</p>
<p>A reasonable estimate of 5 min per trip is assumed for the time required to park and travel between the vehicle and inventory room. The time required to pick or retrieve supplies from the inventory room varies depending on whether patient-specific bundles (<italic>j</italic> = <italic>1</italic>) or bulk (<italic>j</italic> = <italic>2</italic>) storage methods are used. If supplies are stored in patient-specific bundles, a nominal duration of 1 min is assumed for the retrieval function. This is because nurses are assumed to be selecting patient bundles for no more than 5 to 6 patients per trip to the inventory room, and if bundles are labeled appropriately, the nurse should be able to quickly find and select them. Thus the total time required for supply retrieval when supplies are stored in patient specific bundles is 6 min (<inline-formula id="inline-formula25-1084822312474819">

<title>Supply Delivery</title>
<p>In this model section we quantify the time nurses spend driving per year to retrieve supplies. This depends on the number of trips to the inventory room made per year—discussed in the previous section and described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1084822312474819">Table 4</xref>—and the duration of each trip. The duration of each trip is approximated using knowledge only of the size of the service region and an estimate of vehicle speed. In our experiments, average vehicle speed is assumed as 35 mph, to allow for both highway and city driving. The distribution of home health agency service region size is determined as follows. First, we obtain data regarding the service area of each agency, in square miles, from HCRIS for HHAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312474819">2</xref></sup> We filter the data set to remove hospital-affiliated agencies. Using the remaining 5,851 observations, a histogram is developed and is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1084822312474819">Figure 1</xref>. The horizontal axis specifies a range for service region size in square miles, and the vertical axis specifies the proportion of home health agencies in HCRIS having an observed service region size within each range. For example, approximately 14% of home health agencies included in the analysis have service regions varying between 0 and 165 square miles in area. A discrete probability distribution was derived for service area size by using the midpoint of each histogram bucket as an element of the range and assigning the relative frequency of the corresponding bucket as its probability.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Monte Carlo simulation was used in conjunction with the Home Health Supply Chain Nurse Involvement model to develop the distribution of time spent per nurse per year on supply chain duties. In the simulation, 1,000 replicates were generated. Each replicate represents one nurse and specifies the amount of time that nurse spends placing orders, retrieving supplies, and delivering supplies over a period of 1 year by sampling from distributions described in the previous section to determine supply chain processes the nurse performs. Histograms representing the distributions of supply chain process times across all nurses were developed and are included with the discussion of each process below.</p>
<sec id="section16-1084822312474819">
<title>Order Placement</title>
<p>The distribution of time spent per nurse per year placing orders for supplies is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1084822312474819">Figure 2</xref>. This time varies between 0 and 260 hr. The average time spent is 100 hr per year (1.92 hr per week) with a standard deviation of 89 hr per year. The proportion of nurses who spend no time placing orders each year is 34.1%. This result is intuitive when recalling that 34.1% of home health agencies report using an order placement method that does not require nurses to place orders at all. At the opposite extreme, 2.2% of nurses spend 260 hr per year placing orders for supplies. This occurs when nurses communicate orders to a supply manager, and require 5 hr each week—the maximum value allowed by the Uniform distribution with parameters (1.5, 5) hr—to do so. The majority of observations (60%) indicate that nurses spend at least 72 hr per year placing orders.</p>

<title>Supply Retrieval</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1084822312474819">Figure 3</xref> depicts the distribution of time spent per nurse per year retrieving supplies. The range of hours spent in this manner is 0 to 395. The average time spent per nurse per year retrieving supplies is 36.6 hr with a standard deviation of 53.7 hr per year. The most frequently observed response range is (0, 14) hr, representing more than one third of all observations. Nurses who spend more than 0 but less than 14 hr per year work for agencies that require infrequent trips to the inventory room to obtain supplies and store supplies in patient-specific bundles such that each trip to the inventory room is expedient. An additional 12.9% of observations indicate no time spent per year retrieving supplies. This is possible when agencies employ the direct ship to patient method and require no trips to the inventory room per week.</p>

</fig>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, 15% of observations indicate that nurses spend more than 1 hr per week (52 hr per year) retrieving supplies. While the majority of these observations indicate 1 to 2 hr spent per week, there are 5% of total observations that indicate much more time is spent. For example, in one case, 395 hr per year are spent retrieving supplies. This can occur when very frequent trips to the inventory room are required and supplies are stored in bulk by type, requiring up to an hour for sorting and picking during each trip.</p>

<title>Supply Delivery</title>
<p>The distribution of time spent driving per year to deliver supplies is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1084822312474819">Figure 4</xref>. This time ranges between 0 and 359 hr per year. The average number of hours spent per year is 44.3 with a standard deviation of 52.5 hours. Nurses who work for agencies employing the direct ship method make zero trips to the inventory room per week and spend zero hours per year driving to deliver supplies; 12.9% of observations are in this category. At the opposite extreme, nurses who spend 359 hr per year driving to deliver supplies visit the inventory room every day (7 times per week) and must travel within a large service region (4,565 square miles), such that 1 hr drive time results from each trip to the inventory room.</p>

<p>More than half of the observations (50.5%) indicate that nurses spend between 0 and 24 hr per year driving to deliver supplies. More than three quarters of observations (79.6%) indicate nurses spend less than 72 hr per year, or 1.4 hr per week, driving to deliver supplies. Of course this implies the remaining 20.4% spend more than 72 hr per year; the top 10% of observations indicate driving more than 120 hr per year, and the top 5% of observations indicate driving more than 156 hr per year.</p>

<title>Total Annual Nurse Involvement</title>
<p>The distribution of total home health nurse involvement in supply chain functions measured by hours per nurse per year is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1084822312474819">Figure 5</xref>. The time spent per nurse per year ranges between 0 and 810 hr. A small number of observations (14%) indicate that nurses spend approximately half an hour per week or less; 4.4% of observations indicate that nurses spend no time per year on supply chain duties. However, almost one half of observations (48.1%) indicate that nurses spend at least 3 hr per week (156 hr per year).</p>

<p>The box plot depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1084822312474819">Figure 6</xref> summarizes the time spent per nurse per year on each supply chain process and in total. The figure enables easy comparison of the time required for each process and how each contributes to the total. Order placement is the process with the largest interquartile range, with the lowest 25% of observations requiring zero hours per year annually and the lowest 75% of observations requiring 176 hr annually. Order placement is also the process with the highest median—104 hr per year. The interquartile ranges for supply delivery and supply retrieval are [10, 60] and [4, 30] hr per year, respectively. While these interquartile ranges are smaller than that of order placement, the maximum values observed for supply delivery and supply retrieval are 359 and 394 hr per year, respectively. Finally, the total time associated with all processes has an interquartile range of [65, 243] with a median of 161 hr per year. In other words, the middle 50% of observations indicate that nurses spend between 65 and 243 hr per year performing supply chain processes. The top 25% of observations indicate that nurses spend more than 243 hr—up to 810 hr—and the bottom 25% of observations indicate that nurses spend less than 65 hr—as low as 0 hr per year.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results presented in this research reveal that the amount of time nurses spend engaging in nonclinical duties each year is not trivial. On average, each nurse spends 172 hr per year performing supply chain duties. This is the equivalent of 4.3 full-time work weeks, or the time required to perform an additional 123 patient visits. The middle 50% of observations indicate nurses spend between [65, 243] hr per year, the equivalent of 1.6 to 6 full-time work weeks, or the time required to perform between 44 and 165 additional patient visits per year. The worst-performing 25% of nurses require even more time annually. When considering approximately 130,000 home health nurses in the United States, the total time being spent on supply chain duties each year is staggering—More than 22 million hours. In this amount of time, more than 15 million additional patient visits could be performed. In an industry where demand for home care services exceeds the supply of nurses, and considering the fact that this gap is increasing, home health agency managers must begin scrutinizing supply chain practices to determine whether current or planned nurse involvement levels are acceptable.</p>
<p>The good news is that there is evidence that improvement is possible. There are 4.4% of nurses who do not spend any time on supply chain duties. There are 25% of nurses who spend less than 65 hr per year (just above 1 hr per week) on supply chain duties. This occurs when supply chain practices such as integrated order placement within the electronic health record and direct shipment of supplies to patients’ homes are employed. Of course, these practices may not be possible for all home health agencies. For example, in some rural areas, the direct ship option may not be available. For agencies that do not have an electronic health record, integrated order placement will not be possible. However, agencies faced with these limitations should consider opportunities to reduce the number of times nurses must visit an inventory room and reduce the amount of time nurses must spend retrieving supplies from the inventory room by implementing practices such as storing supplies in patient-specific bundles.</p>
<p>The methodology presented in this article was focused on developing the full distribution of home health nurse involvement in supply chain practices. While estimates of the expected time per nurse per year would be possible without the Monte Carlo simulation conducted here, the range of variation in nurse time spent per year would not be assessed. It is essential to bring light to the range of this variation to see the impact best and worst practices can have.</p>
<p>Additional indirect supply chain costs, such as order placement technologies and supply storage space, exist in home health supply chains. Currently, they are not captured by the Home Health Nurse Supply Chain Involvement Model. Data required to include these costs was not available at the time of this study. Uncovering and estimating these additional types of indirect costs is an area for future work. With a full Home Health Supply Chain Cost Model, it could be determined whether the staffing resources required by a particular supply chain configuration are justified by the cost savings associated with it.</p>
