<p>How do ideas “work” in policymaking? In exploring this question, this compilation offers a major contribution to political sociology and political science. Bringing together an impressive group of multidisciplinary scholars whose substantive work covers a plethora of policy areas, it provides a stimulating account of the major debates in the literature on the causal role of ideas in policymaking. The book’s arguments are loosely organized around three central questions. First, what is the relationship between ideas and interests? Second, how do ideas and institutions interact? Third, how do ideas affect political and policy change? A fourth and implicit methodological question runs through these three themes: can ideas be analyzed in isolation from other social factors, such as material interests and institutions; or are ideas constitutive of interests and institutions, and if so, how can their impact be measured? Though these questions are not definitely answered, they are plumbed by contributors in intelligent and often provocative ways. The book is a must-read for any scholar interested in explaining policymaking and policy outcomes.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge facing those interested in the relationship between ideas and politics is pinning down the rather slippery notion of “idea.” What are policy-relevant “ideas”? Daniel Béland and Robert Henry Cox’s introduction borrows the following definition from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477381">Emmerij, Jolly, and Weiss (2005)</xref>: “ideas are causal ‘beliefs held by individuals or adopted by institutions that influence their attitudes and actions’” (p. 6). This may seem straightforward, but in practice an “idea” is a meta-concept concretized by the contributors in a dizzying variety of ways, from policy solutions, problem definitions, public philosophies and Zeitgeist outlined by Jal Mehta, to internalized institutions (Vivien A. Schmidt); understandings of interests (Colin Hay); and ideologies (Sheri Berman), to name a few. This conceptual and semantic diversity provides readers with many useful analytic tools, but readers should not expect to come away from the book with a single, coherent understanding of how policy-relevant ideas affect politics.</p>
<p>Now, to return to the book’s three main themes. Perhaps the question which has been most fully settled in ideational scholarship is how ideas interact with interests. There is broad agreement that <italic>understandings</italic> of interests, not “objective” interests themselves, drive political action; and that therefore, (perceived) interests are a type of idea. Going further, Hay forcefully challenges the notion that objective interests exist at all. In response to those who contend that they must, since similarly situated actors tend to perceive their interests similarly, Hay astutely argues that it is much more likely that this consistency is not because these actors have calculated their interests correctly, but rather because they have been socialized to share the same <italic>conventions</italic> for evaluating their interests. In this view, context no longer determines interest, a relationship distorted only by imperfect information. Instead, agentic actors construct their subjective interests in interaction with their context. Hay stops short, however, of addressing the question which necessarily follows from this constructivist stance: if there is no such thing as false consciousness, how do we evaluate situations in which actors are complicit in their own oppression?</p>
<p>Mark Blyth takes Hay’s insight about the role of convention in helping actors construct interests one step further. He argues that humans live in a world governed not by equilibrium and risk (which lend themselves to prediction and the calculation of probabilities to guide action) but by a more fundamental uncertainty. In this uncertain world, causality is non-linear (i.e., the same causes can produce different outcomes) and the generators of reality can neither be observed nor their potential impacts known in advance. In response, humans develop conventions (e.g., norms, institutions, even “cultures”) to evaluate their interests, and also to bring stability to their world. Such ideas are not simply tools used by agents to assess risks under conditions of incomplete information; they are <italic>fundamental</italic> to human action and causation in social systems (p. 83). Ideas “are simultaneously the media through which agents understand the world and the material that constitutes it” (p. 84). Hence, ideas matter <italic>all</italic> the time; they constitute the social world; they <italic>are</italic> the social world. Blyth’s argument, though highly intriguing, is problematic for two reasons. First, if the social world is made up of ideas about reality rather than reality itself, then the notion of an ontologically unstable world is not reconcilable with an ideationally stabilized one. Second, though it may be correct, the notion that the social world is reducible to ideas—that all institutions and social structures are, at bottom, ideas—makes it hard to know how to study the role of ideas in social life, since they cannot be isolated from other elements.</p>
<p>The book’s second theme is the interaction between ideas and institutions, a relationship that is conceptualized in several different ways by the contributors. For some, like Béland and Cox, ideas are “embedded” in institutions (p. 8). In Robert C. Lieberman’s chapter on race politics, by contrast, ideas and institutions are conceptualized as two distinct causal variables that interact in shaping political action at particular historical moments. In John L. Campbell and Ove K. Pedersen’s chapter, government and market institutions shape idea production by structuring the organization of knowledge regimes. Finally, for Schmidt, ideas are a type of institution. She points to a new variety of institutionalism, discursive institutionalism, which concerns itself with the ideational constructs (institutions) internal to individual agents that both constrain their actions and enable them to effect change. This intriguing conceptual diversity is useful for those looking for applications to their own research—but again, it means that the reader does not come away from the book with a unified understanding of how ideas work in policymaking.</p>
<p>The book’s third theme is the causal role of ideas in policy change. As several of the book’s contributors point out, institutionalist and rationalist scholarship tends to see radical change as driven by exogenous forces. They argue that bringing in ideationally-motivated agents allows for endogenous accounts of path-departing policy change. The challenge here is to <italic>demonstrate</italic>, rather than simply <italic>assert</italic>, that actors are motivated by ideas and that ideationally-motivated actors are the true drivers of change. If the independent causal significance of ideas cannot be demonstrated, then they must be reducible to more fundamental factors, and their social scientific importance is greatly diminished. Thus, the heart of the issue is method.</p>
<p>The chapter by Craig Parsons provides a particularly convincing demonstration of idea-driven policy change. By showing that similarly-positioned French political elites had very different ideas about how European integration should be carried out, he convincingly argues that their ideas cannot be reduced to environmental pressures or positionally-determined objective interests. The positionally cross-cutting nature of elites’ ideas gave French leaders the political autonomy to pursue their own ideational preferences, which is why the “community” model favored by Mollet and Mitterand won out over other possible models of EU organization. By showing that actors’ ideas were decoupled from their positions, Parsons avoids the methodological weaknesses of simple process-tracing, which has a harder time demonstrating that actors’ goals can be traced to ideas rather than position, and that a variety of outcomes are possible.</p>
<p>The problem of course, is that not all cases lend themselves to such clean within-position comparison. Furthermore, to use Mehta’s terms, public philosophies and Zeitgeist operate at deeper and broader <italic>cultural</italic> levels and are therefore less easy to observe than the relatively straightforward EU policy solutions debated by French elites. The problem becomes even thornier if we accept Blyth’s contention that ideas are constitutive of social reality. It would be unfortunate if these more fundamental and fuzzy ideas were to be jettisoned from social-scientific analysis simply because they do not lend themselves as easily to quasi-experimental design. It seems that we have no choice but to study the effects of these types of ideas through the process-tracing and interpretive methods of history and ethnography (e.g., Weberian <italic>Verstehen</italic> or Geertzian thick description). A discussion of how to improve the methodological rigor of interpretive ideational analysis is missing from this volume, however. A useful next step for ideational scholars might be to turn to cultural sociology and anthropology, and glean from these disciplines new methods for analyzing the role of ideas in political life.</p>
