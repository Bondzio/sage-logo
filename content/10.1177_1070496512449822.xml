<abstract>
<p>Certification initiatives are an innovative response to both a perceived governance gap in industry regulation and the demands made on industry by civil society groups. They develop criteria for sustainable practices along supply chains, monitor compliance, and reward acquiescent firms by mitigating reputational risks and differentiating products for environmentally conscious consumers. They seek to accomplish this with minimal cost to taxpayers, nominal disruption to trade, and trivial cost to the private sector in terms of fees or inefficiencies. This article examines the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification scheme as an example of the move toward nonstate, market-driven environmentalism. By utilizing a critical, Gramscian approach, it finds that while the FSC can be seen as embedded in, and furthering the agenda of, the neoliberal political economy, a close comparison to rival, producer-backed schemes exposes its antihegemonic underpinnings.</p>

<body>
<p>On June 22nd, 1969, Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River caught fire. The cause was pollution and the effect was the passage of federal legislation, namely, the <italic>Clean Water Act</italic> of 1972. While dramatic episodes such as this continue to keep environmental concerns near the forefront of mainstream politics, the de facto political response has changed. While legislation may have been the default reaction in the past, both the global political economy and environmental politics have subsequently undergone fundamental changes. While environmental concerns have continued to garner support, deregulating the economy has been the order of the day. Environmentalists have followed suit, increasingly relying on market mechanisms to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification scheme was the first global, nongovernmental initiative certifying forest products. While observers have expressed concern over its ability to effect substantial change to current practices using a voluntary, market-based approach, it has seemingly posed enough of a challenge to industry interests for many domestic industry groups and state agencies to form their own competing certification schemes. This article applies a critical lens—utilizing the thinking of Antonio Gramsci—to better understand the influence of the FSC on global forestry practices. It finds that while the FSC is limited in its ability to change forestry practices in some areas due to its embeddedness in conventional market structures, it has managed to pose a significant threat to the monopoly in rule-setting authority previously enjoyed by coalitions of national industry groups and state agencies. This reading reveals the struggle between the FSC and competing initiatives to be less about differences in present policy preferences and more about control over the governing process. In other words, it is a power struggle over agenda-setting and rule-making authority between entrenched interests and this new challenger.</p>
<p>Increasingly, critical political economy scholars have advocated for such an approach to the study of International Relations (IR) in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1070496512449822">Cox, 1981</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512449822">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1070496512449822">Gill 2010</xref>) and global environmental politics in particular (Ford, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1070496512449822">Levy &amp; Egan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1070496512449822">Levy &amp; Newell, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1070496512449822">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1070496512449822">Okereke, Bulkeley, &amp; Schroeder, 2009</xref>) and this article seeks to make a modest contribution to this undertaking. The benefits of critically reflecting on forest certification include both recognizing the substantial contributions such initiatives makes toward protecting the natural and social structures of the world’s forests and also recognizing the inherent limitations of such a market-driven approach. Additionally, a critical approach is well suited to identify the interests advanced by existing social structures and seeks to expose the power invested in maintaining these arrangements.</p>
<p>The article begins with the political thinking of Gramsci, defining his concept of hegemony and noting how strong environmental critiques challenge the underlying tenets of the neoliberal political economy. It then turns to Gramsci’s concept of <italic>trasformismo</italic> as a mechanism of hegemony, describing the role that intellectuals and international institutions play in hegemonic maintenance. Forest certification is then explored in its historical context so as to better understand why it shares some of the fundamental characteristics of the current order before focusing on the FSC and its main challenger, the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). By applying Gramsci’s concepts, it finds that while both certifications conform to the requisites of the neoliberal global economy in a number of ways, the FSC has in fact shown antihegemonic qualities by challenging the rule-making authority of neoliberal state agencies and their domestic industry benefactors.</p>

<title>Hegemony in the International Political Economy</title>
<p>This section begins by defining Gramsci’s concept of hegemony before applying it to environmental politics. It argues that environmentalism has the potential to pose a serious challenge to the hegemonic order. By taking a critical approach to environmental governance, we can describe the process by which international organizations neutralize the threat while the dominant discourse naturalizes the process. We then see the movement toward market-based solutions to environmental problems as the product of this process, satisfying environmental concerns while seemingly conforming to the fundamental principles of the hegemonic order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1070496512449822">
<title>Gramsci’s Concept</title>
<p>It is generally agreed that Gramsci’s concept of hegemony was derived from its widespread, although slightly different, use within the debates that surrounded the Russian Social Democratic movement from the late 19th century until the October Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512449822">Cox, 1983</xref>, p. 126). This familiar notion within the Russian labor movement referred to the idea of a working class hegemony over allied classes in the revolt against the feudal order of the day. The concept of hegemony can be understood here as synonymous with <italic>direction</italic> in which the proletariat provides leadership for the allied classes while offering concessions to maintain their consent. In contrast, the proletariat would utilize coercive methods to maintain its <italic>domination</italic>, or dictatorship, over enemy classes. In the context of a bourgeois revolution aimed at overthrowing the Tsarist regime, the enemy classes were the aristocracy, the landed peasantry, and the bourgeoisie. Naturally, when the October Revolution resulted in a socialist state and not the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat within a capitalist order, the notion of hegemony disappeared from socialist discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1070496512449822">Anderson, 1979</xref>, p. 17).</p>
<p>The concept resurfaced when Gramsci expanded the idea by applying it to the bourgeois mechanism of control within a capitalist order. Gramsci draws on the thought of Machiavelli to clarify his understanding of hegemony. Machiavelli likened power to the image of a centaur, half-animal and half-human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1070496512449822">Machiavelli, 1981</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">Gramsci 1971</xref>, p. 170). This “dual perspective” in political action captures “the levels of force and consent, authority and hegemony, violence and civilization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">Gramsci, 1971</xref>, p. 170). Perry Anderson rightly points to Gramsci’s inconsistent use of the term hegemony as well as the distinction between, and at other times fusion of, civil society and the state (Anderson, 1971). However, for our purposes here it will suffice to consider two dichotomous categories: hegemony and consent as belonging to one, with domination and coercion as the contrasting. Thus hegemony is leadership by consent. Gramsci explains that “[h]egemony presupposes that account be taken of the interests and the tendencies of the groups over which hegemony is to be exercised, and that certain compromise equilibrium should be formed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">Gramsci, 1971</xref>, p. 161). So we can conceptualize hegemony in practice as the constant negotiating and renegotiating of the ideational, material, and institutional underpinnings of the dominant hegemonic order.</p>

<sec id="section3-1070496512449822">
<title>A Challenge to the Hegemonic Order</title>
<p>This order is maintained by assimilating antisystemic forces through the granting of concessions. In other words, radical opposition is absorbed through reformist strategies. From an uncompromising environmentalist perspective, the neoliberal global political economy, as the contemporary hegemonic order, is inherently incompatible with the maintenance of large-scale ecological and social integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1070496512449822">1</xref></sup> Neoliberalism refers here to the drive toward a minimalist state with markets largely free from regulation, the facilitation of free trade, and the free flow of global capital. The production, consumption, and distribution of goods within such an expansionist global economy are fundamentally unsustainable in a world of finite resources and the continuing concentration of wealth into the hands of the privileged few. Thus environmentalism poses a serious challenge to the hegemonic order in its call for systemwide structural reorganization. Through this lens, market-friendly approaches to environmentalism appear as marginal concessions aimed at neutralizing a potentially fundamental challenge in the name of hegemonic maintenance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1070496512449822">
<title>Trasformismo as a Mechanism of Hegemonic Control</title>
<p><italic>Trasformismo</italic> is a term that was commonly used in Italian politics from the 1890s onward to describe the process whereby the parties of the Left and the Right converged until there ceased to be any substantive difference between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">Gramsci, 1971</xref>, p. 58). Gramsci applied this idea to describe his observation of moderate parties recruiting elites from the more radical camps in Italy. He further abstracted and developed this concept into the idea of the hegemonic bloc working toward the co-optation of potential leaders of subaltern groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">Gramsci, 1971</xref>, p. 157). In the context of global environmental politics, this is most readily seen in both the dominant academic discourse within orthodox International Relations (IR) theory and the involvement of mainstream, environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) in both international organizations and markets.</p>
<p>Both intellectuals and institutions play vital roles in the maintenance of the hegemonic order. Neither theory nor policy is neutral. Theoretical assumptions and political institutions advantage some while disadvantaging others. From the perspective of orthodox IR theory, market-based approaches based on economistic reasoning are relatively benign as they have a limited capacity to challenge the core assumptions of the hegemonic model. While rationalist models predominate, theory and practice have forwarded the myth of the powerless state in a global economy, naturalizing a deliberate policy of nonintervention in markets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1070496512449822">
<title>The Role of the Intellectual</title>
<p>Gramsci envisaged a key role being played by the intellectual in the maintenance of hegemony. Academics engaged in mainstream IR theory can be seen as providing this service through the limited scope of managerial, problem-solving approaches that take the current system of social organization as given and, in effect, preserve this fixed order by working within its parameters. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1070496512449822">Cox (1981</xref>, p. 87) argues, “[t]heory is always <italic>for</italic> someone and <italic>for</italic> some purpose.” The purpose of conventional IR theory is the smooth functioning of the existing political-economic framework and mainstream studies of regimes and civil society at the global level fulfill this role.</p>
<p>Regime theory is often mobilized by analysts studying global environmental governance with the vast majority of approaches adhering to the hegemonic IR narrative of state-centrism and rationalist decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1070496512449822">Strange, 1983</xref>). While some students of regime theory have expanded its scope to include alternative forms of global governance (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1070496512449822">Cutler, Haufler, &amp; Porter, 1999</xref>; Haufler, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1070496512449822">Vogler, 2003</xref>; Webb, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1070496512449822">Young, 1999</xref>), the majority remains content to rehash the arguments fought out by their elders’ generation, to paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1070496512449822">Susan Strange (1983</xref>, p. 337). Strange is referring to the battles fought within regime theory between realists and liberals who continue to argue over “relative versus absolute gains” while both remain attached to rational choice assumptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1070496512449822">Vogler (2003</xref>, p. 27) points out that rational choice assumptions cannot encompass the full range of motivations and do not have room for concepts of “justice” and “equity.” Moreover, he argues that treating actors as self-interest maximizers does not allow for true sustainability, as this would entail accepting less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1070496512449822">Vogler, 2003</xref>, p. 37).</p>
<p>While mainstream IR continues to advance from purely state-centric understandings of global politics, the narratives emphasizing the decline of the state in the face of new global forces perform their own policy-validating roles. For example, much has been written on the proliferation of NGOs seeking to mitigate the negative effects of global market forces in the wake of the retreating state (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1070496512449822">Gereffi, Garcia-Johnson, &amp; Sasser, 2001</xref>). While some notable scholars have convincingly argued that the rise in global civil society actively challenges the dominant state-centric models of global politics (see, for example, Lipschutz, 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1070496512449822">Ruggie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1070496512449822">Wapner, 1996</xref>), the literature also plays a large role in the discourse of globalization by emphasizing the inability of the state to effectively govern global economic flows. The globalization dialogue, in turn, continues to be an invaluable ideological tool in the neoliberal toolbox as it eternalizes unmitigated global capitalism and the minimalist state.</p>
<p>The key point here is the distinction between the state and civil society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1070496512449822">2</xref></sup> Gramsci sees this as merely a methodological distinction that leads to the assertion that economic activity takes place in the realm of civil society and the state should not intervene to regulate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">1971</xref>, p. 160) . However, if we begin to view the state/civil society complex as a basic unit of international relations, then <italic>laissez-faire</italic> economics can be seen as a form of state regulation. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449822">Gramsci’s (1971</xref>, p. 160) words, “[i]t is a deliberate policy, conscious of its own ends, and not the spontaneous, automatic expression of economic facts.” Therefore, we can see that the literature on global civil society and the decline of the state obscures the political decisions that further the neoliberal agenda. It naturalizes and legitimizes the hegemonic neoliberal political economy and obscures the ideologically driven policies that have shaped it. Thus orthodox IR theory plays a leading role in the neoliberal epic by denying any notion of an alternative order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1070496512449822">
<title>The Role of Institutions</title>
<p>Robert Cox applies Gramsci’s concepts to international relations and concludes that international organizations can be seen as mechanisms of hegemony as they help to develop and stabilize the dominant order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512449822">1983</xref>, p. 137). From this perspective, international organizations act as forums to discuss matters of international concern, yet ultimately end up forwarding the agenda of their most powerful member states and the most powerful actors within them.</p>
<p>The increasing involvement of ENGOs in the negotiations taking place within international organizations is usually portrayed as a democratizing force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1070496512449822">Ford, 2003</xref>, p. 120). However, a critical analysis views this effort to effect positive change from the inside as most likely futile and perhaps even acting to fortify the hegemonic order. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512449822">Cox (1983</xref>, p. 139) points out that elite talent from oppositional social movements “may come to international institutions with the idea of working from within to change the system,” but effective change will not come from such a top-down approach. As he so articulately states, “Hegemony is like a pillow: it absorbs blows and sooner or later the would-be assailant will find it comfortable to rest upon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512449822">Cox, 1983</xref>, p. 139). In other words, international organizations incorporate potentially counterhegemonic ideas. By working within this institutionalized framework, mainstream ENGOs risk reproducing the core formation of global hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1070496512449822">Ford, 2003</xref>, p. 125).</p>
<p>The advancement of the concept of “sustainable development” can be easily understood in this light. Sensing the growing support for placing environmental concerns front and center on the political agenda, the corporate community accepted and then domesticated this potentially radical shift in values. Corporations identified the threat and, through the participation of corporate coalitions such as the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the International Chamber of Commerce, managed to shape the agenda at the 1992 UNCED “Earth Summit” in Rio de Janeiro. This was a follow-up to the now famous <italic>Brundtland Report</italic> on sustainable development published in 1987. Sustainable development was conceived as a result of the marrying of economic growth and environmental concern. While the academic and policy-making communities busied themselves with defining this new and decidedly vague concept, the fundamental problems involved with this new idea were largely ignored. The business community and policy-making elites had finally acknowledged the link between environmental degradation and economic practice. In return, the environmental community accepted the compatibility of environmentalism and capitalism. Within this model of sustainable development, environmental governance takes on a business-friendly approach in which the integrity of free markets and free trade is privileged. While forest certification was created to escape the institutional inertia at the international level, in some ways, its very existence reinforces the claims of the dominant neoliberal discourse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1070496512449822">
<title>Forest Certification in Historical Context</title>
<p>In his seminal 1981 article appearing in the <italic>Millennium: Journal of International Studies</italic>, Robert Cox argues that problem-solving theory’s assumption of a fixed reality gives it some precision, but it is ultimately based on a false reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1070496512449822">1981</xref>, p. 87). In other words, this ahistorical approach presumes a continuing present and the maintenance of the status quo. In contrast, critical theory is concerned with the continuing process of historical change, which allows one to question the present order itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1070496512449822">Cox, 1981</xref>, p. 88). With this in mind, we turn to the emergence of forest certification in its historical context.</p>
<p>Neoliberal reforms have elevated the market and devalued the utility of state intervention in the economy. The loosening of restrictions on capital mobility along with the freeing of global trade have increased the options for global production and investment while creating new challenges for regulating industry. These policy changes have facilitated an exponential rise in the power of transnational finance as evidenced by the increase in daily foreign exchange trading from USD 15 billion in 1973 to almost USD 1,900 billion in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1070496512449822">Helleiner, 2008</xref>, p. 225). They have also led to a proliferation of transnational corporations (TNCs) and foreign subsidiaries, which are approximated to be in the range of 82,000 TNCs, 820,000 subsidiaries, with millions of suppliers and distributors worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1070496512449822">UNCTAD, 2008</xref>, p. xvi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1070496512449822">UNCTAD, 2010</xref>, p. xviii). These market actors have organized production on a truly global scale, disaggregating the production process between multiple firms operating in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>This restructuring of institutional frameworks has led to a <italic>post-Fordist</italic> global economy based on <italic>flexible specialization</italic> in which economic power has moved both upstream and downstream from the traditional means of production, further decreasing the capacity of the state to impose effective regulation utilizing a traditional top-down approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1070496512449822">Conca, 2002</xref>, p. 142). Increasingly complex and transborder commodity chains have the effect of <italic>distancing</italic> the participants in the economy from the ecological and social feedback mechanisms that would otherwise limit degrading activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1070496512449822">Princen, 2002</xref>, p. 116). With the increasing unwillingness and seeming inability of the state to intervene, civil society has taken up the task of reconciling the market with the public interest (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1070496512449822">Wapner, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This rise in nonstate governance is driven by innovative market-based approaches to environmental regulation, one example of which is forest certification. ENGOs have played an instrumental role in the creation and enforcement of certification institutions, which are ostensibly “private,” voluntary programs that set environmental standards for firms and monitor their adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1070496512449822">3</xref></sup> To some degree, firms have embraced forest certification as a way to avoid state regulation, which they view as a consistently “heavy handed <italic>command-and-control</italic> approach that sets impossibly lofty environmental goals and requires needlessly expensive responses or rigid technological fixes” (“Economic Man,” September 27, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1070496512449822">2001</xref>). Political scientists and strategic management scholars have effectively illustrated that firms often engage with social and environmental issues in response to a combination of market and political drivers, which include but are not limited to escaping regulatory pressures. Some market factors appear to be a desire to escape competition, improve recruitment prospects, and reduce internal inefficiencies, while an additional political factor is the desire to dispel the pressure emanating from ENGO campaigns (see, for example, Lyon &amp; Maxwell, 2008).</p>
<p>Numerous scholars have noted that there have been parallel processes at work in the interactions between globalization and environmentalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449822">Cashore, Auld, and Newsom (2004</xref>, p. 12) note that, on one hand, there has been downward pressure applied to environmental regulatory standards due to constrained domestic policy from capital mobility, free trade, and foreign direct investment (although, see Mosley, 2005, for an important critique of this perspective). On the other hand, there has been upward pressure applied to environmental standards from the increased scrutiny by transnational advocacy networks, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1070496512449822">Bernstein and Cashore (2000</xref>, p. 67) have termed <italic>internationalization</italic>. The method of choice for these transnational activists has been the use of market-based boycott campaigns.</p>
<p>The 1980s saw an influx of boycott campaigns aimed at the tropical timber industry. These campaigns quickly became the scourge of those involved in the tropical timber trade, from landowners to producers to retailers. Because most timber producers’ names remain relatively unknown to the general public, these shame campaigns targeted the large retailers downstream whose business was based in large part on reputation. Giant home improvement chains, such as Home Depot in North America and B&amp;Q in the United Kingdom, became the primary recipients of this unwanted attention. This led these retailers to begin demanding sustainably harvested timber and their suppliers responded with claims to this effect. One example comes from a Malaysian timber company that created its own <italic>Certificate of Products from Sustained Yield Management</italic>, which states, “The hardwood rainforest products supplied come from well-managed production forests in accordance with the principle of sustained yield management thus safeguarding the environment and the ecological balance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449822">Bartley, 2003</xref>, p. 443). A claim such as this is impossible to verify because, quite obviously, it means very little. ENGOs responded to these claims by attacking their credibility with the result being a proliferation of claims and counterclaims that left everybody confused and nobody pleased.</p>
<p>Additionally, boycotting campaigns were also beginning to be contested on the grounds that they were failing to slow deforestation while hurting forest-dependent communities and devaluing forested land, which was alleged to have the perverse effect of hastening its conversion to agricultural land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449822">Bartley, 2003</xref>, p. 444; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449822">Klooster, 2010</xref>, p. 120).</p>
<p>Friends of the Earth, a U.K.-based ENGO, first proposed forest certification under the preexisting International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), which is a trade organization with states as members. They submitted the proposal through the British delegation in 1989 and timber-exporting countries denounced it without delay. They argued that because it did not exist for nontropical forests, it constituted a discriminatory trade barrier and a violation of sovereignty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449822">Bartley, 2003</xref>, p. 442). This struggle over the constraints of free trade and North-South politics was an early taste of what was to come for the environmental community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449822">Tim Bartley (2003</xref>, p. 442) argues that this was the main catalyst for the creation of the FSC in 1993, an argument echoed by one of the regime’s employees:
<disp-quote>
<p>FSC was a response to the failure of international organizations that ought to have had the remit to enforce, to implement, and develop good forestry standards—ITTO in particular . . . and FSC was set up to correct that failure.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An additional incentive to pursue private regulation was the failure to create an overarching global forestry regime at the 1992 United Nations Commission on Environment and Development (UNCED) “Earth Summit” in Rio de Janeiro. Instead of developing a strong, legally binding institution to protect forests as many hoped (perhaps naively), the summit produced some ambiguously worded promises to work toward some ill-defined goals. The acceptance of the concept of <italic>sustainable development</italic> and the subsequent turn toward private governance regimes based on voluntary compliance and market mechanisms constitute what Michael Maniates decries as the construction of an “individualized politics” around global environmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1070496512449822">Maniates, 2002</xref>, p. 43).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1070496512449822">Stephen Gill’s (2004)</xref> concept of <italic>market civilization</italic> is helpful in explaining the popularity of market-based approaches to environmental protection that seemingly cuts across the political spectrum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1070496512449822">Gill (2004</xref>, p. 117) suggests that we are living in a market civilization, which he defines as a “cultural transformation toward a structure and language of social relations which is more marketized, individualized, and linked to commodity logic.” In other words, every facet of life is pervaded by capitalist norms and practices, resulting in a shared vision of the world that is cast by the commodity logic of capital. Furthermore, Gill argues that we are experiencing a spatial expansion and social deepening of economic liberal ideas of social purpose leading to individualist patterns of action and politics. New technologies and information flows have succeeded in commercializing all aspects of social life in the developed world and capital mobility should ensure its spread to those places not yet encompassed.</p>

He argues that the norms of liberal environmentalism are an attempt to reconcile global environmental protection and the promotion of the liberal economic order and its tenets of economic growth, efficiency, and corporate freedom. While the acceptance of neoliberalism has been one of the causes of this transformation in the goals of environmentalism, he argues, it has not consumed them. In fact, liberal environmentalism has allowed environmental policies to gain widespread acceptance through its ability to fit with existing norms at the policy-making level. The conclusions he draws from this are equally pertinent to our discussion. Liberal environmentalism enables responses to environmental issues that fit its normative basis, but it makes any trade-off between economic and environmental goals more difficult because it denies that trade-offs are necessary. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1070496512449822">Steven Bernstein (2002</xref>, p. 14), “Liberal environmentalism risks justifying inaction if tough regulatory choices, which imply trade-offs with market values, are necessary to get the desired ecological effects.” Therefore, it suggests that solutions to environmental problems must take place within the parameters defined by the liberal economic order.</p>

<title>The Emergence of the FSC and Its Competitors</title>
<p>The FSC was officially launched in 1993, in large part the creation of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). To be awarded the FSC stamp of approval, timber companies must abide by its 10 principles and 56 performance-based criteria (FSC, 2012). They address wide-ranging issues, such as, tenure and resource use rights, community relations, workers’ rights, environmental impact, management plans, monitoring and conservation of old growth forests, and plantation management (FSC, 2012; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449822">Cashore et al., 2004</xref>, p. 12). The principles and criteria are customized to meet local conditions through a process by which stakeholders from the ecological, social, and economic realms can collaborate on a level playing field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449822">Auld, Gulbrandsen, &amp; McDermott, 2008</xref>, p. 190).</p>
<p>The FSC is comprehensive in its coverage of management practices and is accepted as a legitimate form of governance by some in industry and by the majority of environmental groups. It boasts a very powerful clientele at the retail end of the forestry commodity chain, including Home Depot, Staples, Lowes, and B&amp;Q to name just a few of the companies that have pledged to buy and sell only products made with FSC certified fibers. It is truly a multistakeholder institution, established with the participation of 130 participants from 26 countries, representing wood users, retailers, forest management companies, forest workers’ groups, indigenous peoples’ groups, and various other social and environmental interests groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449822">Auld et al., 2008</xref>, p. 189; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449822">Klooster, 2010</xref>, p. 120).</p>
<p>While the FSC was accepted by many, it certainly was not welcomed by all. Producer-backed schemes began arising, seemingly in response to concerns over the role of the WWF and other NGOs in the FSC’s establishment, the ability for ecological and social interests to outweigh economic interests in its governance structure, and the stringency and intrusiveness of its criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449822">Auld et al., 2008</xref>, p. 191; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449822">Cashore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1070496512449822">Gulbrandsen, 2004</xref>). In 1999, the PEFC was established as an alternative to FSC certification. The PEFC is an umbrella organization representing over 30 national forestry certification schemes. It assesses its members against its global standards, providing assessment and mutual recognition of these nationally devised schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1070496512449822">Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification [PEFC], 2012</xref>). It was originally launched in Europe, with the goal of providing more localized control over standards development, including those of small landowners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1070496512449822">PEFC, 2012</xref>). In 2004, the PEFC expanded to include the first non-European country initiatives in Chile and Australia. In 2005, it added vast tracts of Canadian forests through it national program and, in 2009, it added tropical timber producing members in Gabon and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Although the PEFC is also a registered nonprofit organization providing third-party assurance, it differs from the FSC in that its membership of national certifications were largely created by industry groups and backed by state agencies (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512449822">Cadman, 2011</xref>). For example, the Australian Forest Certification Scheme (AFSC) grew from the Australian Forestry Standard Steering Committee, which was a partnership of the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments, National Association of Forest Industries, Plantation Timber Association of Australia, Australian Forest Growers, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1070496512449822">AFSC, 2012</xref>). The Canadian member of the PEFC—the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Sustainable Forest Management System (SFM)—is the country’s official national standard for forest management and helped make the PEFC the world’s largest certification scheme by acreage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1070496512449822">Canadian Standards Association [CSA], 2012</xref>). Similar schemes were developed through industry state partnerships in the developing world with the Malaysian Timber Certification Council being one such example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1070496512449822">MTCC, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Forest Certification and the Requisites of the Hegemonic Order</title>
<p>Conca, Maniates, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1070496512449822">Princen (2002</xref>, p. 5) explain that “economistic reasoning” and a “politics of growth” are so prevalent in contemporary politics that “[e]conomic growth, facilitated at every turn by public policy, becomes the lubricant for civic processes of democratic planning and compromise.” Therefore, policies that do not threaten these fundamental beliefs and structures carry “a much lower political price tag” (Conca et al. 2002, p. 5). The following section discusses how environmental certification initiatives conform to the requisites of neoliberal hegemony before returning to the specific cases of the FSC and its competitors.</p>
<p>Forest certification is a natural fit with the dominant discourse of “public-private partnerships” and “environmentalism through market mechanisms.” In the absence of state coercion, private regulation must be based on the consent of the major stakeholders. This consent is based on the perceived legitimacy of its criteria that, in mainstream policy circles, depends on its fit with the hegemonic political economy. The movement toward certification has been able to gain the necessary legitimacy for widespread consent based on its conformity with the neoliberal institutional agenda of unregulated markets and free trade.</p>
<p>It is difficult to quantify the actual financial benefits accrued by firms that have been granted the right to use any particular environmental label. This is partly because industry data is not openly shared, but is also due to the difficulty in separating the effects of certification from other factors, which may also influence the market share of products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1070496512449822">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 1997</xref>, p. 5). Despite surveys demonstrating that customers are willing to pay a premium for eco-labeled goods (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1070496512449822">Forsyth, Haley, &amp; Kozak, 1999</xref>), there is little evidence of certification providing this price premium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449822">Klooster, 2010</xref>, p. 124). Past attempts to decipher the elasticity of demand for the “green market” have led most analysts to conclude that these goods continue to constitute a small share of the market and fetch only a small price premium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1070496512449822">Markandya, 1997</xref>, p. 7). Empirical analysis has shown that under strict conditions there may be a price premium for producers of certified wood products, but it appears just as likely that producers would lose profits as prices of certified and noncertified wood remain the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1070496512449822">Sedjo &amp; Swallow, 2002</xref>). Self-reporting by certified firms shows most have not realized significant market benefits from certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1070496512449822">Overdevest &amp; Rickenbach, 2006</xref>). However, the fact that firms are applying for certification and paying the fees associated with these regimes indicates some market value, even if it is driven by nonmonetary benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1070496512449822">Klooster, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The cost of implementation varies, but in many cases this becomes an enormous obstacle for small firms. This favors larger firms that have the capacity to meet the requirements of certification schemes. Indeed, smaller firms have reported being generally less satisfied with certification than their larger competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1070496512449822">Overdevest &amp; Rickenbach, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with the opportunity to add value to their products, firms may seek certification to enhance the marketability and overall image of the company. A certification initiative stamp distinguishes the firm’s product from uniform competition while improving the reputation of the firm itself. This can be especially important to large firms whose success ultimately depends on consumers identifying with their brand. This is a form of signaling and has been reported through industry surveys as the leading incentive for firms to seek certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1070496512449822">Overdevest &amp; Rickenbach, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also many studies emerging that link strong social and environmental policies of firms to efficiency and innovation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1070496512449822">Esty &amp; Winston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1070496512449822">Heal, 2008</xref>; Porter &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1070496512449822">Esty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1070496512449822">Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>). Pollution and other forms of production wastes are associated with outdated technologies and inefficient processes. Furthermore, many economists have concluded that environmental regulation can lead to innovation by overcoming bureaucratic inertia and stimulating investment in forward thinking production methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1070496512449822">Porter &amp; van der Linde, 1995</xref>). In other words, the initial investment can lead to a reduction in operating costs down the road and lead to what is commonly referred to as a “win-win” situation for business and the environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, forest certification also conforms to the neoliberal ideal of free trade by seeking to treat domestic and foreign firms equally and involve developing countries when composing the criteria. While technical standards can actually enhance the opportunities for trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512449822">Overdevest, 2010</xref>), it is especially paramount that certification regimes are not seen as discriminatory. They must be consistent with the WTO’s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) to avoid being seen as illegal nontariff barriers.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fact that the FSC is a nonstate, voluntary initiative that is relatively immune to charges of discrimination seems to have been a major catalyst for its creation as would-be regulators struggled to enact legally binding rules under the free trade regime. In 1992, the Austrian parliament voted to ban imports of tropical timber that could not be confirmed as sustainably produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449822">Bartley, 2003</xref>, p. 447). Indonesia and Malaysia responded immediately by threatening to challenge the law under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and when Austria backed down, an important precedent was set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449822">Bartley, 2003</xref>, p. 447). The rules and norms of free trade would be privileged over environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The FSC has gone to great lengths to conform to the requisites of international trade regimes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449822">Auld et al. (2008</xref>, p. 203) discuss, the FSC was a key founder of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling (ISEAL) alliance in 1999, which strives to enhance the reputation of its members’ schemes as facilitators and not barriers to trade. This certifier of certification schemes is founded on the principles of the ISO/IEC Guide 59 “Code of Good Practice for Standardization” and the “WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement Annex 3 Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption, and Application of Standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1070496512449822">ISEAL, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Trasformismo and the “Certification Wars”</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1070496512449822">David Humphreys (2006</xref>, p. 116) has referred to the emergence of national certification schemes to challenge the FSC and the concomitant race for acreage and legitimacy as the “certification wars.” What can a critical reading of this unfolding competition tell us? On one hand, the FSC has adapted to the context of the neoliberal political economy and is attempting to promote higher standards and more equitable practices from within the conventional market structures of the hegemonic order. This could even be viewed as a co-optation of neoliberal values by an antihegemonic force promoting a reregulation of a global industry. On the other hand, the PEFC has emerged to challenge the legitimacy of the FSC and can quite readily be understood as an attempt by hegemonic interests—here personified by the neoliberal state/industry complex—as co-opting the methods and rationale of the FSC in an attempt to sideline this potential challenger and reassert its authority and policy preferences. Clearly, this development resonates with the <italic>trasformismo</italic> concept.</p>
<p>Indeed, the result of this process has been a marginalization of more radical ideas and institutions from either side—strong, proregulatory environmentalists on the one hand and fervent, free-market industrialists on the other. There has been significant convergence between the FSC and producer-backed standards in many technical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449822">Auld et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449822">Cashore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1070496512449822">Overdevest, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512449822">2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512449822">Overdevest (2010)</xref> has found evidence that the FSC is providing a service by simply setting an example and forcing rival initiatives, through public comparisons, to ratchet-up their own standards. In fact, the “certification war” is looking to be less and less about particular policy disagreements. This gives rise to an important question: If the FSC is a benign force from the perspective of entrenched interests, why has it faced such opposition from rival certification initiatives representing national industries and state agencies? If it did not challenge the hegemonic underpinnings of these established interests, one would expect it to have been accepted with open arms. This implies that the FSC has indeed found a way to “push-back” against neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1070496512449822">Peck &amp; Tickell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449822">Klooster, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Reinforcing or Resisting Hegemony?</title>
<p>Forest certification has been shown to be a product of its historical context, demonstrating its fit with the current hegemonic order. However, we have witnessed the emergence of two competing manifestations of certification within the forestry industry. If the FSC, as the original global certification, was such a good fit, why then have we seen the emergence of competitors certification put forward by national coalitions of industry and state actors?</p>
<p>The following section offers a systematic investigation into the antihegemonic aspects of the FSC that have given rise to the PEFC challenge. It argues that while the FSC does not effectively challenge the core tenets of sustainable development and is complicit in the promotion of sustainable development, the FSC represents a significant “push-back” against the hegemonic order by wrestling rule-making authority from national industry and state (de-)regulatory coalitions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1070496512449822">
<title>Reinforcing Unsustainable Practices?</title>
<p>Some scholars have expressed concern over the ability of an initiative working within markets to transform practices in a meaningful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1070496512449822">Klooster 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449822">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1070496512449822">Mutersbaugh, Klooster, Renard, &amp; Taylor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1070496512449822">Taylor, 2005</xref>). An additional worry is that instead of challenging the underlying political and systemic causes of environmental issues, certification may simply be shifting these concerns to a technical arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1070496512449822">Stringer, 2006</xref>, p. 702). Furthermore, efforts to expand their clientele and certified acreage may expose these initiatives to increasing pressures by powerful actors that will further challenge their ability to maintain their “alternative character” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449822">Klooster, 2010</xref>, p. 118) or “alternative orientations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1070496512449822">Taylor, 2005</xref>, p. 136). The fear is that instead of effectively pushing for positive social and environmental change from the inside, these initiatives may inadvertently reinforce unsustainable practices and further entrench the neoliberal political economy.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the major ways in which market-based initiatives achieve popular support is that they tend to not tackle the tough issues, such as, overconsumption and inequality. This is because, unlike the market-friendly attributes listed above, tackling overconsumption and inequality demands that people accept less. For example, while the eradication of poverty is a goal that finds few dissenters, reducing inequality is a much tougher sell. In fact, there are potentially perverse effects to market-based approaches. It is at least theoretically possible that certification could increase the use of forestland as those who already consume ecologically friendly products substitute less ecologically friendly versions for these as the price increases with labeling (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1070496512449822">Swallow &amp; Sedjo, 2000</xref>). Another possibility is that the standardization inherent in certification may increase trade and, therefore, consumption. However, these admonitions remain theoretical at this point. Arguably, the main issue the FSC is currently struggling with is to ensure any benefit from certification is shared with producers in the developing world.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts thus far, the FSC can be seen as reproducing global inequalities by disproportionately benefitting large-scale, industrial forestry and Northern stakeholders. With the largest markets for certified products resting firmly in the global North, consumer voting is skewed to reflect global economic inequalities. Redistributing the benefits of certification is a considerable challenge that is taken very seriously by the FSC; however, to date, it cannot claim to have significantly impacted livelihoods in the developing world and, therefore, is not yet challenging entrenched interests to the point that would trigger hegemonic “push-back.” This stems from the difficulty in developing a more critical discourse of fairness while working within conventional market institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1070496512449822">Taylor, 2005</xref>, p. 144).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1070496512449822">Mustapha Pasha and David Blaney (1998)</xref> have argued that we must pay attention to the mutually constitutive relationship between civil society, the state, and capitalism when assessing the role of globally active NGOs. When civil society is viewed as embedded in its political-economic context, its emancipatory potential becomes rather ambiguous.</p>
<p>Civil society is proficient at imposing the values of capitalism and the liberal state, acting to depoliticize the economy and posing particular problems for developing countries. Overreliance on market institutions could further subordinate citizens of developing countries or, as the authors describe them, “those that were excluded from the advantages of the market mechanism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1070496512449822">Pasha &amp; Blaney, 1998</xref>, p. 9). Furthermore, global civil society activists often reenact the disproportionate control of decision makers located in North America and Europe compared to the decision takers in the developing world, reinforcing the power discrepancies between the rich and poor.</p>
<p>The main point to take from this is that if due care is not taken, global activist groups can obscure the inequalities inherent in the political-economic context in which they are implicated. When civil society actors bring liberal, capitalist values to developing countries in the form of market-driven environmental institutions, there is a risk of relegating the issues they seek to redress to a nonpolitical, “private” sphere. Without “romanticizing the state,” the authors argue that “[i]n the absence of an effective and democratic state, the citizens of the Third World have little capacity to control their own destiny” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1070496512449822">Pasha &amp; Blaney, 1998</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>Despite considerable efforts by the FSC to bridge the North-South divide, there remains much work to be done on this front. As Axel Marx and Dieter Cuypers (2010) have concluded from their recent large-N study, there appears to be a strong link between level of development and certification uptake, which seems to indicate obstacles for developing countries in the form of cost and technical barriers to implementation. The authors also confirm the strong link between the presence of a strong export market to North America and Europe and the uptake of certification, posited in earlier investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1070496512449822">Marx &amp; Cuypers, 2010</xref>, p. 427). While it appears that there have been some benefits in the form of international environmental norm diffusion and considerable learning opportunities for local organizations, there remain considerable costs for producers with no real price premiums gained downstream, leaving little incentive with which to woo industry laggards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1070496512449822">Pattberg, 2006</xref>, pp. 591-592). This stems from the inherent problem in voluntary initiatives; those that meet the standards opt into the program while those that do not opt out. These factors combine to leave many developing countries to suffer from severe deforestation outside of the FSC catchment, which constitutes a major limitation to the effectiveness of the scheme.</p>
<p>It seems that there is still a major danger that the FSC, not unlike other certification initiatives in forestry as well as in other commodity chains, may end up reproducing global inequalities by working within the conventional market. This very preliminary analysis suggests that this is already happening as the costs of certification appear to have fallen largely on the producers, not the much more powerful retail or consumption nodes in the commodity chain. The apparent lack of a price premium for producers is a major limiting factor to the effectiveness of the scheme. However, the FSC’s governance structure does in fact empower many stakeholders who have tended to be marginalized in national debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1070496512449822">Pattberg, 2006</xref>, p. 592) and it is this inclusive governance structure that may prove to be the “push-back” against entrenched interests that the FSC offers.</p>

<title>“Push-Back”</title>
<p>Although the FSC was originally formulated with the trade in tropical timber in mind, it has gained wider support in the developed world. It must negotiate its way through these North-South issues if it is ever to take hold in the developing world. The FSC is very aware of these challenges and its governance structure was designed to accommodate diverse interests. It recognizes the differing priorities and needs of varied ecosystems and the societies they support. Its criteria for sustainable forestry conform to the perceived needs of the specific region in which the logging takes place. For example, it has mandated the creation of regional working groups for the development of specific standards for each respective region based on the FSC’s broad principles and criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449822">Cashore et al., 2004</xref>, p. 12). It also utilizes a three-chamber format of environmental, social, and economic actors with equal voting rights as well as equal representation for Northern and Southern stakeholders (FSC, 2012; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512449822">Cadman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1070496512449822">Domask, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>When setting and enforcing rules for a broad array of interests, the governance mechanisms implemented to manage these diverse interests and establish rule-making powers are key to gaining widespread legitimacy for the scheme. This is where the FSC differs drastically from its competitors. The FSC’s institutional framework attempts to distribute power amongst its constituents through its multistakeholder format and, as previously mentioned, this strips power from the industry groups and state agencies that felt that those who actually implement the standards, meaning the landowners and forestry companies themselves, should be the ones to develop them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449822">Auld et al., 2008</xref>, p. 191; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449822">Cashore et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the PEFC’s national certifications were devised largely by industry groups and government agencies—and power remains firmly in the hands of these state-industry coalitions. While the FSC pushed ahead with its multistakeholder model from the beginning, including ecological, social, and economic interests from developed and developing countries, the PEFC decided that social and environmental NGOs would not be invited to participate until after the standards had been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512449822">Cadman, 2011</xref>, p. 110). Additionally, by certifying national industry initiatives, they granted forest owners the responsibility for developing their own forest management criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512449822">Cadman, 2011</xref>, p. 111). Despite signs of convergence between the organizations, the process of standards development through their differing governance structures is the key sticking point between the two schemes.</p>
<p>The FSC became an antihegemonic challenge when it sought to redistribute decision-making power and attempted to break the monopoly in rule-making authority held by the neoliberal state and privileging economic interests. Once this challenge was issued through the nonstate and multistakeholder governance structure of the FSC, the PEFC was created to claw-back this power for state agencies and, ultimately, national industrial interests. It suggests that the neoliberal state has maintained control of the deregulatory process and the real challenge it has faced has not come from deregulated and globe-spanning commodity chains but, rather, the efforts of some civil society groups to reregulate these chains while weakening the state’s monopoly in agenda-setting and rule-making authority.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While neoliberal institutional reforms enhance the authority of the market in all spheres of social life, the environmental movement has responded with market-based initiatives in an attempt to compel industry toward social and ecological sustainability. In general, forest certification has become an accepted form of environmental governance through the legitimacy it has gained in government, business, and environmental circles.</p>
<p>Forest certification can only be understood in its historical context of a neoliberal global economy. It represents a compromise from the more radical environmentalism that used to dominate activist circles, trading in a strong conservationist stand in exchange for pragmatic results achieved through mainstream channels. There are limitations to this market-based approach, but the FSC has achieved some concrete results in reregulating portions of the forestry commodity chain. It has also managed to cut-out some national industry and state agency interests from the policy-making process. Now, with the emergence of the PEFC, the forestry sector is witnessing a claw-back of this lost power as hegemonic forces attempt to appropriate the certification model to regain control of the policy process and pull the agenda back toward the status quo.</p>
<p>Competition between certifications is leading to new compromises and a process analogous to <italic>trasformismo</italic> is leading to a convergence in approaches as these initiatives race to certify acreage and gain legitimacy at the expense of the other. The movement toward convergence in many technical areas of policy suggests that these competitions are not simply disagreements over the fine details of regulation, but they are in fact power struggles. This is not to say there are not specific policy disagreements over what constitutes good forestry practices, but the core of the conflict appears to be over who controls the agenda and maintains the rule-setting authority in the industry. This is a power the FSC has wrestled from the grasp of hegemony and it is a power the domestic industry/state agency complex will not give up easily.</p>
<p>Applying a Gramscian lens exposes the power-based dimension of these “certification wars.” This critical reading of the emergence and subsequent challenge of the FSC offers an understanding of the opportunities and limitations of attempting to govern through conventional markets. Arguably more importantly, it reminds us that neither theory nor institutions are neutral. The neoliberal state has found an effective approach to regulating forestry by co-opting and domesticating the antihegemonic attempts at regulation, but in so doing, has shown its deep affiliation with industrial interests and its concomitant preference for weaker regulation.</p>
<p>While both initiatives conform to the requisites of the hegemonic order, the FSC challenges the sometimes hidden element in the neoliberal political economy—the neoliberal state. This becomes apparent through the certification contest. National industry interests and state regulatory agencies will not quietly relinquish their authority to a third-party, nonstate actor. Thus, while there are similarities between these initiatives, the key point of contention seems to implicate the neoliberal state as the architect of the de-regulated economy. So while there is a façade of a global economy, unfettered by regulation and beyond control of the state, a critical lens suggests that the state has maintained significant control. It suggests that from the perspective of the neoliberal state, the real challengers are not the economic forces it has unleashed, but the civil society initiatives that have emerged to reregulate them.</p>
<p>While this is only a preliminary analysis, this critical reading of the FSC and its competitors does suggest some general policy implications.</p>
<p>First, this analysis indicates that states and firms will not readily relinquish their rule-making authority to the FSC regardless of the particular standards it maintains. The message for the FSC is that lowering standards may gain some more adherents, but it will not persuade many states or national industry groups to drop their opposition to the scheme.</p>
<p>Second, and related, is that the FSC need not race against the PEFC to certify acreage. It should instead focus on creating benefits for sustainable producers in the South while keeping its standards as the gold standard in the industry, especially as previous studies have shown it to have a ratcheting-up effect on rival certifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512449822">Overdevest, 2010</xref>). The FSC’s legitimacy is not based on the share of the world’s forests certified under its label relative to those certified by its rivals; the FSC’s legitimacy stems from its institutional structure. The multistakeholder forum through which it was developed and through which it makes decisions is what sets the initiative apart and will continue to be its competitive advantage moving forward.</p>
<p>And finally, these findings constitute a further warning against simply reinvesting our energies into “reestablishing” state control. Despite the short-comings of approaches that seemingly conform to the requisites of deregulation, the state is not necessarily a reliable alternative. After all, it is not only vital to ask who regulates, but for whom they are regulating.</p>
