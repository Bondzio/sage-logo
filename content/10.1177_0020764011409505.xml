<p>The editors and authors of this book were part of the Social Inclusion Scoping Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, set up to ‘examine the nature and extent of social exclusion in people with mental health problems and … learning disabilities, the implications for the future organization, structure and culture of mental health services … and for the practice and training of psychiatrists’ (p. xiii). The group was chaired by Jed Boardman, a consultant psychiatrist in south London, and contained psychiatrists, psychologists, academics, service users and carers. This book has been produced from their findings and deliberations.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections, with much overlap: the first examines theoretical concepts underlying social exclusion, the second looks at evidence of the degree of exclusion in the UK, particularly focusing on those with mental health problems, and the last section, entitled ‘Working towards inclusive psychiatry’, spells out practical implications of the group’s work.</p>
<p>Boardman usefully defines social exclusion as an inability to participate fully in society (chapter 2). Barriers to participation can be material, particularly poverty and ill health, or less tangible, such as stigma and discrimination. The central tenet of the book is that social exclusion is both ‘a cause and consequence’ of mental health problems, and that ‘mentally ill people are the most excluded in society’. Individuals with mental health difficulties may be excluded in myriad ways: they have ‘less income, more debt and financial hardship’ (p. 136), are less likely to be employed (p. 145) or to have secure housing (p. 142), and are more likely to be socially isolated, living alone or in supported housing rather than with family (p. 148).</p>
<p>In chapter 7, Boardman and Kwame McKenzie look more broadly at the extent of poverty and inequality in the UK, where income inequality has risen dramatically in the last 30 years. Children in the UK are the group most at risk of being poor: only three EU countries have higher rates of child poverty. It is also striking that poverty seems to have more social consequences in this generation than previously: so ‘the relative impact on adult outcomes of experiencing poverty as a teenager doubled between the cohort who were children in the 1970s … and those ten years younger.’ And associated with poverty are health problems, both physical and mental. Among many examples cited is the differing infant death rate between children of manual workers (5.4/10,000) and non-manual workers (3.8/10,000). Importantly, the authors point out that not only poverty but also the experience of living within an unequal society generates mental health problems (p. 123).</p>
<p>As an antidote to exclusion and inequality, the authors describe the concept of capabilities. The capability approach to equality focuses on ‘substantive freedoms … what people are able to do, or be, in their lives’ (p. 34). This model has several benefits for those with mental health problems. Differing individual goals can be incorporated, and assistance from the state to reach one’s goals (e.g. welfare benefits) is seen as a necessary provision rather than a charitable gesture.</p>
<p>Related to this approach is the recovery model of care, where individuals are supported to recover not just from the symptoms of mental illness but also towards a ‘social recovery, the idea of building a life beyond illness, of recovering one’s life without necessarily achieving a clinical recovery.’ The authors describe recovery as ‘the bridge between the literature on social exclusion and that on mental health problems.’ As they point out, ‘many of the “markers of recovery” are, in reality, markers of social inclusion: working, studying and participating in leisure activities … good family relationships; living independently … having a social life’ (p. 41).</p>
<p>The recovery model is referenced throughout the book and is well described in a chapter by Alan Currie, a practising psychiatrist in the northwest of England. I liked his rejection of the caricature of the medical model as ‘reductionist, mechanistic and disability-enhancing’. As he points out, ‘current psychiatric practice … contains much that will support the practice of social inclusion’ (p. 305). Practical examples are provided in chapter 13 on evidence-based practice, for example the successful ‘individual placement and support’ technique developed in the USA to help people regain stable employment.</p>
<p>The book provides a wealth of detail and description, both about the theoretical and practical aspects of social exclusion. It is obvious from the start that the authors are passionate about their subject, and this comes across in the depth of their research and the evidence presented. In fact I felt that some of the writing, particularly in the first two sections, was a little too dense and detailed for the intended audience of clinicians and could have been usefully simplified for greater clarity.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, this book feels a little unbalanced in terms of solutions offered for the problems the authors identify. Although the recovery model provides room for optimism and hope on an individual level, many of the injustices the authors identify are simply not amenable to intervention by mental health services but require broader political solutions. As Boardman says: ‘Remedies cannot be found solely at the level of the individual – for psychiatry as a whole this means setting our sights widely’ (p. 75). In today’s economic climate, the struggle for equity and compassion for those on the margins of society will be tougher than ever.</p>
