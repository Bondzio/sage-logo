<title>Introduction: The Contemporary Issues</title>
<p>Alternative pathways to prepare teachers have emerged throughout the years as a response to the real and perceived economic, educational, social, and political needs and goals of academics, policy makers, and professional educators. Fast-track degree, certification, and/or license programs conducted at universities and colleges in isolation or in tandem with other agencies as well as residence, induction, and internship programs represent some of the alternative routes designed and implemented to respond to the multiple voices stating that education demands “better” prepared teachers. The literature reports that several issues contributed to the proliferation of alternative routes to teacher preparation: defined shortages of teachers due to retirement; the shift of subject matter emphasis to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; recognized differentiated needs of students of academic, linguistic, economic, and cultural diversity; and specified geographically determined areas of need. In addition, statistical evidence reporting insufficient attainment of academic goals by subgroups of students coupled with low achievement in fundamental areas of study such as reading and mathematics within and across national regions has been used to underscore the concept that teacher education programs have not been as successful as they could or should be in preparing competent professionals or, as No Child Left Behind Act states, “highly qualified teachers.”</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>“Can we help policy makers . . . supporting alternative routes . . . recognize how gifted education can facilitate the attainment of their stated goals?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the most recognized alternative teacher preparation programs is Teach for America (TFA) highlighted by its recruitment of academically successful graduates from well-noted universities for placement in classrooms and schools identified as “high need” and schools that have reported to have had difficulty filling positions due to the population they serve and/or their location. TFA’s program includes a summer 5-week training program accompanied by specific coursework and support offered to teachers during the school year. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511427510">Hellig and Jez (2010)</xref> analyzed the evidence related to TFA graduates and concluded that TFA teachers showed a positive impact on achievement in some subjects, and, similar to most teachers, their proficiencies improved with experience. TFA has shaped much of the conversation about reform in teacher education by addressing the issues of recruitment, assignment, support, and assessment.</p>
<p>Basically, TFA also has provided the impetus to confront many of the concerns that have been used to question the nature and type of teacher education programs in existence and has stimulated debate about whether typically structured teacher education programs should be discontinued and/or how they could be revamped. Additional concerns are the relationship between content and pedagogy or the importance of the practicum experience in coursework designed for teacher education programs, the purposes and structures of professional development or support for graduates from teacher education programs in their first years as novice teachers, the costs for educating individuals to become a teacher, and the expectations for attrition versus sustained involvement in teaching as a profession.</p>

<title>Alternative Routes to Educate: The Usual Route for Gifted Education</title>
<p>Educators of the gifted have applied continually and consistently the concept of alternative pathways or routes to educate teachers to meet the needs of gifted students. Issues of recruitment, assignment, support, and assessment typical of the discussions of today’s reformers have dominated the discussions, policies, and programs that have been developed to prepare teachers to teach the gifted over the years. In many cases, the design and implementation of these alternative routes to prepare teachers to educate gifted students have been situational, fiscally dependent on “regular or basic” teacher education programs, and less integrated into entire teacher education programs. Consequently, the alternative routes to prepare teachers of the gifted have been less formalized, and in some instances, they have lacked sustainability. Current policies and publications such as the Higher Education Act, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education teacher preparation standards, and the National Association for Gifted Children programming standards have facilitated greater clarity for action regarding the dimensions of teacher preparation for the gifted. Still, an analysis of the contemporary emphasis on alternative routes in general education make available new opportunities or provide the “educational leverage” to initiate teacher preparation options to educate teachers of the gifted. This “educational leverage” is contingent on two factors: understanding the relationships between general and gifted educational issues pertaining to alternative routes to prepare teachers and recognizing, and using the features touted as vital to successful alternatives in general educational programs for inclusion in gifted education preparation programs.</p>
<p>Recognizing that current educational discussions describe alternative routes to prepare general education teachers is a prime opportunity to simultaneously discuss options for alternative pathways to prepare teachers of the gifted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217511427510">Table 1</xref> illustrates how contemporary issues and practices that are fundamental to defend in developing alternative routes to prepare general education teachers can be applied to justify and design alternative pathways to prepare teachers of the gifted.</p>

<td>Recruitment is defined by specific academic and personal qualities, strict screening activities, and commitment to understanding the area of “high need” populations and schools. Importantly, many alternative programs are prideful of the value they place on recruiting individuals with high academic status as a significant indicator of what constitutes a good teacher.</td>
<td>While the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC)/Council for Exceptional Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427510">NAGC; 2006</xref>) teacher preparation standards articulate clearly the characteristics correlated with the competencies required of a teacher of the gifted, school districts and schools often obliterate the specificity of such characteristics and rely on qualities such as seniority, union or district restrictions, and/or teacher popularity as indicators for recruitment. In some instances, academic prowess in a given subject without concern for pedagogy or understanding of the nature of giftedness is given ultimate consideration to identify a candidate. References to the value of selecting teachers with a specialization in one or more subject areas needs to be juxtaposed with the importance of a teacher of the gifted having the pedagogical skills such as logical reasoning and creative thinking associated with gifted education.</td>

<tr>
<td>Emphasis on specific types of classroom or school assignments related to perceived teaching job shortages aligned to present conditions and projected for the future are important variables to designing alternative pathways to educate teachers.</td>
<td>Contemporary emphasis on the need to teach critical and creative thinking as depicted in the Common Core Standards is aligned with content and instructional needs stressed in standards for gifted education. It is possible that gifted education can be the source to facilitate the teaching of the newly stated Common Core Standards and 21st-century skills for all students, thus aligning gifted and alterative educational programs.</td>

<td>Provisions for training include preteaching and on-job training that is augmented by ongoing coursework culminating in a degree and/or certificate or license.</td>
<td>Acknowledgment of the stipulated important consideration of the needs, interests, and abilities of gifted students in preservice coursework has been deemed insufficient, and, in many cases, references to the gifted are not sustained in coursework throughout a degree or certification program. The currently published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427510">NAGC/CEC (2006)</xref> teacher preparation standards articulate the importance of consistently integrating information regarding gifted learners and their needs throughout the coursework in a viable teacher preparation program.</td>

<tr>
<td>Assignments are made to a designated school with clear expectations of the expected areas of high need.</td>
<td>Although consistent efforts have been defined to identify and include students of diversity and underrepresented areas in gifted programs, there is still a recognized need to make these efforts more public and consistent throughout schools, districts, and states. Numerous innovative programs have been designed and implemented with evidence to warrant their successes in defining giftedness among students of diversity, reaching high outcomes for students of diversity, lowering the attrition rate of students of diversity from gifted and general education programs, and involving more students of diversity in college-bound programs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Membership in a specific cohort establishes a collaborative and cooperative means to gain support and develop camaraderie to develop and maintain competencies.</td>
<td>It is noted that cohorts of teachers of the gifted are often viewed as professionals that isolate themselves from their peers and subsequently are deemed as being elitist. Such accusations usually are not valid; however, perceptions can and do shape reactions among professionals and the programs to which they are affiliated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provisions for support are defined by consistent mentoring.</td>
<td>Historically, most mentoring within the gifted program is facilitated by other professionals of the gifted. A consideration is to solicit general education teachers and teachers of the gifted to form mentor teams to exchange the knowledge and skills that facilitate the education of the diverse students each teaches. Mentorship teams also should comprise administrators such as the principal and instructional supervisor and specialists in the discipline working outside of the school. Too often mentoring reinforces rather than extends the teachers’ competencies by representing a narrow rather than wide range of perspectives. Many of the articles about the concepts of global education address the issue of mentoring represented by multiple and varied professionals within and outside of the school boundaries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assessments are related to specific observations and instruments required to acknowledge the attainment of competencies required to receive a degree and/or certification/license.</td>
<td>The successful teacher of the gifted is often equated with the successful performance of the gifted student. Scores on standardized tests that do not measure what is included as fundamental outcomes derived from a differentiated curriculum often are used to determine the efficacy of the teacher of the gifted. Specific assessments related to the competencies articulated for teachers of the gifted are not usually assessed by observations and/or instruments. This has been an issue that prevails when discussing the answer to the question: How do we discern that this teacher is a successful teacher of the gifted?</td>

<title>Gifted Education as an Alternative Route to General Education Teacher Preparation</title>
<p>The current political climate favors alternative routes to teacher education and provides gifted educators with an opportunity to infuse general teacher preparation with the tenets of gifted education. Throughout the years, gifted education has gained some of its credibility and importance by seizing the opportunities that are etched by general education. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427510">Darling-Hammond and Berry (2000)</xref> discussed the need for schools to teach the sophisticated skills needed to participate in a knowledge-based society. Such rhetoric provides educators of the gifted to seize the opportunity to introduce the content and skills labeled as differentiated for the gifted as an academic alternative pathway to educate all teachers. What benefits might accrue if an alternative route to teacher preparation immersed individuals in an educational program focused on the gifted and their differential characteristics and needs as a prerequisite to teach all students? Is it possible that such a study could enhance the level of teaching and learning for all students?</p>
<p>Reliance on field-based teaching as the practicum in alternative teacher preparation programs could include observations of teachers of the gifted and coteaching situations that allow side-by-side teaching of the general and gifted teachers to learn from each other as colleagues. The ability of novice teachers to observe and participate with gifted students allows for the spillover effect of gifted education to general education to affect all students. However, most significantly, it will diffuse the mysticism of the gifted to general education teachers and dispel some of the myths that form false barriers between novice teachers and gifted students and teachers of the gifted. Ironically, alternative educational programs adamantly advocate to provide highly qualified teachers to teach students of diversity; gifted students should and do represent a diverse population.</p>
<p>Regardless of the variety of alternative programs that emerge in the era of reform, gifted educators need to be vigilant of the means by which such programs can become an alternative to educate teachers to teach the gifted. There are many paradoxical educational comments that are inherent in the current political environment. One such paradox is the discrepancy between what is professed that the nation needs for its students and the types of training advocated to resolve these needs: the need for innovative thinkers and problem solvers, for example. Can we help policy makers who are supporting alternative routes for general education recognize how gifted education can facilitate the attainment of their stated goals? Can we facilitate policy makers to comprehend that alternative routes for teacher preparation should not create separate pools of educators but rather contribute to the development of a comprehensive and distinguished concept of professionalism—a teacher who can better serve the needs of all students?</p>
