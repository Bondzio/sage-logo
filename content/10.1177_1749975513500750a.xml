<p>Cities are not the same. Daniel A. Bell and Avner de Shalet identify the particular character of nine different cities, cities that one or both have lived in, visited, absorbed, and perhaps loved. Each chapter takes the reader to a new city, and conveys a sense of life in that place. Every reader is likely to get a new take on a city they know, and to become intrigued by places they may never visit.</p>
<p>The cities are Montreal, Jerusalem, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, New York, Oxford, Berlin and Paris. Bell grew up in Montreal and de Shalet in Jerusalem. Both lived in Oxford as students and have returned. Their knowledge of other cities comes through multiple visits or from living in the city for some years.</p>
<p>Each of these cities, they believe, has an ethos or spirit. By this they mean ‘a set of values and outlooks generally acknowledged by people living in the city’ (p. 2). The ethos provides a loose organization for each essay, as they illustrate the ethos and, at times, question the ethos. Each essay is a mix of city history, observations, conversations with others about the city, descriptions of architecture, personal experience and meditations.</p>
<p>Both authors are political scientists, and they address the idea that globalization is making cities increasingly alike. They see a city ethos as a way its residents can ‘oppose globalization and its tendency to flatten culture into sameness’ (p. 5). Further, as a set of widely-shared ideas, the ethos contributes to what they call civicism or ‘urban pride’ (p. 4). It is not a brand. An ethos can be relatively new, as in Singapore; but it also can go back through centuries, as in Jerusalem. Thus peculiarity can remain at the local level, even though not every city develops an ethos.</p>
<p>After the introduction, the chapters can be read in any order. Here I can only provide brief descriptions of selected chapters. In Montreal, the theme is language, and the chapter is especially historical. Montreal was Canada’s urban centre in 1931. At that time Montreal was over 60 percent Francophone and French was the language of government. Anglophones dominated the economy, however, and social mobility required English. Language became more political in the 1960s, and French residents saw language as a sign of continuity. Toronto, however, was becoming the major Canadian city. In 1977 French became the legal language of Montreal’s large private companies. Now both French- and English-speaking residents take pride in the city’s bilingualism.</p>
<p>Political themes predominate in the chapter on Singapore. The authors discuss Confucian ideas, as well as newer political ideas. The authoritarian and paternalistic government of Singapore wants to create ‘patriotic citizens willing to sacrifice for the common good’ (p. 80), but it has done so while promoting the values of material well-being, multiracialism, and meritocracy. These values promote individualism and thus make the first goal difficult. Bell originally believed that civicism would increase with democracy. Singapore appears to be an exception. It is not a democracy, but, he finds, it is developing civicism. Thus there seem to be multiple routes to civicism.</p>
<p>Materialism is the ethos of Hong Kong, but the materialism of Hong Kong involves helping others, starting with one’s family and moving out to the neighborhood and beyond. The authors also describe the ‘structured turbulence’ of Hong Kong’s streetscapes, giving the reader a sense of being in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Discussing Oxford, the City of Learning, they consider, more explicitly than in other chapters, the extent to which residents share the ethos. Early in the chapter Oxford the university seems much the same as Oxford the city. As the authors explored the city, however, they found that a low percentage of the children growing up there go to college. Thus they talked with residents of a public housing project who told them they felt unwelcome in the city, and local public schools were poor.</p>
<p>Each city, and its ethos, provides an opportunity to discuss more abstract ideas, usually ideas closely related to the authors’ concerns with political theory. This is especially true of the essay on Berlin, City of Tolerance. Here new buildings symbolize intent, as many built after 1990 are transparent, at least in part, suggesting ‘I have nothing to hide’. Is it tolerance, the authors ask themselves repeatedly, or is it indifference to others, or a desire to avoid feelings of guilt? They also question the ways in which Berliners are coming to terms with the city’s past, both its Nazi past and its post-war split past. Through its long history, they note, Berlin has changed between tolerance and intolerance repeatedly. How can tolerance, then, be made permanent?</p>
<p>Whether or not the authors have each ethos right is unimportant. They bring out the peculiarities of each city, and various contradictions, while providing fascinating running arguments about basic political ideas. It is difficult to say who will most enjoy the book, as it deals with so many issues. Reading the chapter on a city before a visit certainly will enhance the visit. Those interested in political theory or in the implications of globalization will find much to think about. The more general ideas of materialism, individualism, and tolerance also run through many of the chapters.</p>
