<abstract>
<p>Research that attempts to identify characteristic features of multiple perpetrator sexual assault (MPSA) is limited. This study compared demographic and assault related characteristics of 135 cases of MPSA with 139 cases of single perpetrator sexual assault (SPSA) reported to the Haven sexual assault referral centre, Camberwell, London, over a 4-year period, and aimed to identify any unique features of MPSA victims, perpetrators and assault type. Victims of MPSA were younger, less likely to be White, more likely to report previous self-harm and more likely to sustain injuries than victims of SPSA. Multiple perpetrators were younger, less likely to be White and more likely to be strangers to the victim than single perpetrators. The nature of the assault was different in single and multiple perpetrator cases; in MPSA, there were more completed rapes and more multiple rapes, and perpetrators were more likely to meet the victim in an outside location before carrying out the assault in a place of residence that was not the victim’s. These findings add to a scant but growing evidence base.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual assaults can be committed by a single offender or groups of offenders, and it is likely that these two types of offence involve quite different processes on the part of the perpetrators. In single perpetrator assaults, one person has the idea to carry it out and does so; multiple perpetrator assaults rely on a number of people working together. Sexual assaults carried out by more than one person would undoubtedly influence the victim, both physically (e.g., there is a higher risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections) and psychologically. It is thus important to study multiple perpetrator sexual assault as distinct from other sex crimes to isolate any characteristic features and build up a picture of the perpetrators, the victims, and the nature of the assaults. This in turn will lead to a better understanding of how to target crime prevention and education programs and also of how to help individuals following a multiple perpetrator sexual assault.</p>
<sec id="section2-0886260511433514">
<title>Group Offending and Sexual Assault</title>
<p>It has long been recognized that the presence of others is a major component of group delinquency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511433514">Eynon &amp; Reckless, 1961</xref>), and research suggests that a number of mechanisms exist within juvenile groups that may influence members’ activities, including the fear of being ridiculed by other group members, the anonymity and shared responsibility offered by the group, and the development of alternative moral codes, which can result in young people breaking the law, something they would not necessarily do individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260511433514">Warr, 1996</xref>). The most common size of group tends to be two or three people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511433514">Reiss &amp; Farrington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511433514">Sarnecki, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511433514">Weerman, 2003</xref>) and perpetrators tend to be young. As they grow older, they commit fewer and fewer offences in a group context. There is, however, a limited evidence base on sexual assaults involving more than one perpetrator and researchers have used a variety of terms for the offence, including gang rape and group rape, which has led to some confusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> suggest the term <italic>multiple perpetrator rape</italic> to refer to rapes carried out by more than one perpetrator. In line with this, we have chosen multiple perpetrator sexual assault (MPSA), as we are looking at all cases of sexual assault and not just rape. For a full discussion of the issues around the terminology, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>Social-psychological theories suggest that multiple perpetrator rape has a different motivation from that of single perpetrator rape. Single perpetrator rapes are thought to reflect “personal psychopathology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>, p. 30) where individuals are driven by their own urges. In contrast, group assaults may be bound in such processes as developing social identity, deindividuation and diffusion of responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511433514">Krahe, 2001</xref>), peer pressure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511433514">Porter &amp; Alison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511433514">Woodhams, Gillett, &amp; Grant, 2007</xref>), the development of comradeship and camaraderie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511433514">Groth &amp; Birnbaum, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511433514">Holmstrom &amp; Burgess, 1980</xref>) and has an element of excitement or adventure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511433514">Scully &amp; Marolla, 1985</xref>). The public humiliation of women is an important objective, a way for men to demonstrate their shared dominance, and the sexual element becomes a way of forming relationships and establishing competition. Multiple perpetrator rapes are often extremely violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511433514">De Wree, 2004</xref>). The presence of others can cause an escalation in violence through processes such as diffusion of responsibility, feelings of relative anonymity, and individuals modeling the aggressive behavior of others “to impress their companions with their virility and toughness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260511433514">West, 1987</xref>, p. 157).</p>

<title>Victims of Multiple Perpetrator Sexual Assault</title>
<p>Recent U.K. Home Office research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511433514">Kelly, Lovett, &amp; Regan, 2005</xref>) suggests that around 11% of rape cases involve more than one perpetrator; however, estimates of prevalence vary considerably, mainly due to the underreporting of such crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511433514">Fisher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511433514">Percy &amp; Mayhew, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511433514">Russell, 1982</xref>), and it is estimated that 75% to 95% of all rapes are not reported to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511433514">Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate &amp; Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, 2007</xref>). With this in mind, research into sexual assault will always have its limitations but can offer some useful insights. Research into MPSA has pointed toward increased vulnerability of victims. First, victims tend to be younger in cases of MPSA than in cases of single perpetrator sexual assault (SPSA). In a study carried out in the Netherlands, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld, Weerman, Looije, and Hendriks (2007)</xref> found the average age of MPSA victims was 13 and ranged from 8 to 20 years, and in a study of data obtained from a U.K. police force over a 6-month period, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> found the mean victim age was 21 and ranged from 5 to 51 years. In a comparison of single and multiple perpetrator assaults, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref> found that the proportion of victims below 21 years of age was significantly greater in MPSA than SPSA. In addition to younger age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref> found that MPSA victims were more likely than SPSA victims to have been drinking alcohol beforehand and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> found a significant proportion of MPSA victims had mental health problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511433514">Chambers, Horvath, and Kelly (2010)</xref> developed a typology of multiple perpetrator rape that showed how perpetrators often capitalized on victim vulnerability, which was then further increased by the perpetrator(s) (e.g., through increasing victim intoxication) or was achieved by taking advantage of a vulnerable situation (such as the victim missing the last train home) to facilitate the offence.</p>

<title>Perpetrators of Multiple Perpetrator Sexual Assault</title>
<p>In line with research into group offending in general, perpetrators of MPSA tend to be younger than in cases of SPSA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al. (2007)</xref> found the average age was 14 and ranged from age 9 to 36 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> found the mean perpetrator age to be 23 years; however, the mode was 15 years and perpetrators ranged from age 10 to 70 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref> found that the proportion of perpetrators below 21 years of age was significantly greater in MPSA than SPSA and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath (in press)</xref> also found a significant difference in the age of single and multiple perpetrators. Half of the single perpetrators were aged above 30 years, compared with 22% of multiple perpetrators and conversely multiple perpetrator rape cases were significantly more likely to involve perpetrators below age 21.</p>
<p>A confusing picture is painted with regard to the ethnicity of single and multiple perpetrators of sexual assault, with some studies reporting an overrepresentation of ethnic minorities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511433514">De Wree, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>) and others not (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511433514">Bijleveld &amp; Hendricks, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> found that whereas the majority of MPSA victims were White, the most frequent ethnicity of perpetrators was Afro-Caribbean; however, it is important to note that this represented only a third of cases and that more than a fifth of perpetrators were White European. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath (in press)</xref> found that cases of SPSA were more likely to involve White perpetrators and victims, and cases of MPSA were more likely to involve Asian perpetrators and White victims. Studies suggest that groups of offenders tend to be made up of people of the same ethnicity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research suggests that the most frequent size of group is 2 or 3 perpetrators (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath &amp; Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511433514">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511433514">Vetten &amp; Haffejee, 2005</xref>) or 4 perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al., 2007</xref>), which is similar to published figures for group delinquency in general, where groups tend to be made up of 2 or 3 people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511433514">Reiss &amp; Farrington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511433514">Sarnecki, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511433514">Weerman, 2003</xref>). Studies suggest that the majority of SPSAs are carried out by perpetrators known to the victim (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511433514">Jones, Wynn, Kroeze, Dunnuck, &amp; Rossman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511433514">McCall-Hosenfeld, Freund, &amp; Liebschutz, 2009</xref>), and some research suggests that this is similar in cases of MPSA. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West’s (1981)</xref> study of MPSA, offenders and victims knew each other “fairly closely” in two thirds of cases and casually in one third (supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511433514">Lloyd &amp; Walmsley, 1989</xref>) and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al.’s (2007)</xref> research with juvenile offenders, in all but two cases the victim knew the perpetrators. Similar findings are reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511433514">Kelly et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511433514">De Wree (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511433514">Philip (1962)</xref>. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> found that almost a quarter of group assaults were carried out by groups of complete strangers and in an American study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511433514">Greenfeld (1997)</xref> reported that the majority of group rapes were carried out by strangers to the victim, in contrast to a minority of single rapists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath (in press)</xref> found that more than half of the cases of MPSA (52%) involved total strangers, compared with 29% of SPSA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886260511433514">
<title>Nature of the Assault</title>
<p>The most frequent type of assault carried out by multiple perpetrators is vaginal rape (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511433514">De Wree, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511433514">Lees, 1996</xref>); however, group rapes tend to involve a number of other sexual acts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511433514">Bijleveld and Hendricks (2003)</xref> found that 88% of the group offences consisted of at least one rape, compared with 55% of sex offences committed by a single perpetrator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref> found that 8% of their MPSA group reported anal rape and 8% reported oral rape. Research into group behavior in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511433514">Smith &amp; Mackie, 2007</xref>) suggests that violence and aggression are common in group interaction and that group norms often promote aggressive behavior. The findings with regard to violence in sexual assault vary, with some studies reporting more violence in MPSA than SPSA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511433514">Gidycz &amp; Koss, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>) and others reporting less (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511433514">Boelrijk, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511433514">Lloyd &amp; Walmsley, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511433514">Amir (1971)</xref> found that MPSA is more likely to involve verbal insults, beating, sexual humiliation, and threats, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al. (2007)</xref> found that the victim was usually threatened more during MPSA, but physical violence was rare. In the United States, weapon use is frequently reported during MPSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511433514">Porter &amp; Alison, 2006</xref>) but less frequently or rarely everywhere else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511433514">Porter &amp; Alison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511433514">Van Wijk, Doreleijers, Bullens, &amp; Ferwerda, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West’s (1981)</xref> U.K. data show that a fifth of MPSA victims were threatened with a weapon, with knives being the most common. In a further U.K. study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath (in press)</xref> found no significant difference in rates of weapon use in MPSA (13%) and SPSA (11%).</p>
<p>With multiple rapes and possible increased levels of violence, it might be expected that rates of injury would be higher in MPSA victims than SPSA victims. The literature on injuries following SPSA estimates injury prevalence between 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511433514">Massey, Garcia, &amp; Emich, 1971</xref>) and 87% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511433514">Slaughter &amp; Brown, 1992</xref>) due to various methodological inconsistencies across the studies (for a full discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511433514">Sommers, Schafer, Zink, Hutson, &amp; Hillard, 2001</xref>). Forty-eight percent of MPSA victims studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> sustained an injury. The authors suggest that this low level of injury might relate to previous research that shows injuries are more likely following assault by current and ex-partners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511433514">Easteal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511433514">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511433514">Myhill &amp; Allen, 2002</xref>) and a large number of perpetrators in their study were strangers to the victim. In a comparison of rates of injury following SPSA and MPSA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath (in press)</xref> found no significant difference between the two groups.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref> report that most offences occurred at night and toward the end of the week; however, the location of approach by the perpetrator(s) and location of the assault appears to be different in MPSA and SPSA. Single perpetrator approach and assault is more likely to be inside the victim’s or perpetrator’s home, whereas an outdoor location is a more common approach site in MPSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511433514">Porter &amp; Alison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref> noted that MPSA in their sample typically began as a friendly encounter at an outdoor location, usually the street, then victims go, or are taken, somewhere else. Most of the assaults happened inside at either the victim’s or assailant’s home. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath and Kelly (2009)</xref> found the most common approach location in MPSA was outside and the most common assault location was in a private dwelling. Also in line with Wright and West, Horvath and Kelly found that approach and assault locations did not always correlate and some cases suggested an entrapment strategy, where the victim agreed to meet someone but was then lured to where the other perpetrators were waiting.</p>

<title>Limitations of Past Research and Aims of the Present Research</title>
<p>Research into multiple perpetrator sexual assault is scarce, and from the research that does exist, it is difficult to build up a coherent picture. Data have been collected from a variety of sources (including police records, patient notes from acute sexual assault referral centers, interviews with convicted group sex offenders, legal reports, and media reports) from different countries (including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States of America) and from different times (from the 1970s to the present day). In addition to multiple data sources, variable definitions are often vague or differ across the studies. For example, when looking at victim alcohol and drug use around the time of the assault, some studies show rates of alcohol <italic>or</italic> drug use whereas others separate the two. Some have used blood alcohol levels to obtain an objective measure of alcohol consumption, whereas others use self-reported measures, both of which have their limitations. When looking at the extent of violence during the assault, different studies have reported the presence of a weapon, the use of a weapon, or threats with a weapon, all of which are quite different from each other. When trying to establish the rates of injury sustained during the assault, some class “redness” as an injury whereas others do not. Some state the rate of genital injury but do not clarify if this is simply genital or if it includes the anal area. One study has reported the rate of “physical injury,” and it is not clear whether this includes the anogenital area at all.</p>
<p>All of this makes any comparisons, extrapolations, and generalizations extremely difficult, and it is therefore crucial that we begin to build up much clearer and more consistent definitions of the variables we are researching. The inherent difficulty with this type of retrospective research is that we are reliant on how different organizations (e.g., the police, sexual assault referral centers) record information, and we are studying data that have been recorded for purposes other than research. Data obtained from sexual assault referral centers can, however, offer a broader range of information than police records or legal reports, as we see cases that are unreported to the police and cases that do not make it to court. The present study compared demographic and assault related characteristics of cases of multiple and single perpetrator sexual assaults reported to the Haven Sexual Assault Referral Centre, Camberwell, London, over a 4-year period. The aim was to identify any unique features of MPSA victims, perpetrators, and assault type to add to the existing, rather limited, evidence base.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This was a retrospective review of patient notes. Participants were drawn from the Haven Camberwell from July 1, 2005 to July 31, 2009.</p>
<sec id="section8-0886260511433514">
<title>The Havens Sexual Assault Referral Centers</title>
<p>The Havens are London-based sexual assault referral centers that were set up as a joint initiative between the Metropolitan Police Service and the National Health Service. Three Havens provide a 24/7 service to any adult or child, male or female, in greater London who has been sexually assaulted. The first Haven opened in Camberwell in 2000, followed by the Havens in Paddington and Whitechapel in 2004. The Havens provide comprehensive services; clients can receive a forensic examination, emergency contraception, and drugs to prevent infections, including HIV, follow-up care including sexual health screening, psychosocial support, and practical advice. There is also the opportunity for them to meet a specially trained police officer who will obtain more information about the assault and help the client make a decision about whether to formally report the incident to the police. The Havens see people of any age and accept police referrals, self-referrals, or third-party referrals.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Haven forensic sexual assault examination is to collect evidence of what happened during the assault and about the assailant(s). All Haven sexual offences examiners (SOE) are highly trained and examine clients and record information in a standardized way, and the entire process takes around 3 hours. SOEs first obtain a full medical history and details of the alleged assault from the client before carrying out the forensic examination, which involves a top-to-toe physical examination. Any injuries are established through visual inspection and the type, size, and location of each is recorded on body diagrams. Swabs are taken from the skin and areas involved in the assault, such as the vagina, anus, or mouth, and blood and urine samples are also taken. Treatment of any injuries and other medical care is provided at the initial visit, and clients are offered a follow-up appointment 10 to 14 days later where they can access further services, such as counseling, and have tests for sexually transmitted infections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260511433514">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All participants had come to the Haven following an alleged sexual assault within the previous 7 days and had a forensic examination by a doctor. Rape is defined as penetration by the penis of somebody’s vagina, anus or mouth without their consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511433514">The Sexual Offences Act, 2003</xref>). Assault by penetration is the offence of penetrating the anus or vagina of someone else with any part of the body or with an object if the penetration is sexual and if the person does not consent, and sexual assault is any kind of intentional sexual touching of somebody else without their consent.</p>
<p>When a client comes to the Haven, they are asked to sign a consent form before their forensic examination. Everything that is about to happen to them is explained in detail, including the issue of using their anonymized information for medical research. They are given the option to cross out anything on the list that they are not happy with before they sign and for the present study, anyone who did not sign consent to their information being used for research was not included.</p>
<p>During the study period (July 1, 2005-July 31, 2009), 2,966 clients were seen at the Haven Camberwell, of whom 177 reported that the assault was carried out by two or more perpetrators (5.97%). Of these 177, 31 did not have a forensic examination (so information was very limited), 7 notes were missing, and 3 clients did not consent to their information being used for research. Thus a total of 136 cases of multiple perpetrator sexual assault were included in the study. A comparison group of 139 cases of single perpetrator sexual assault (SPSA) was identified using a random number generator to select a group from all SPSA cases seen at the Haven during this time period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260511433514">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>As this study involved a retrospective review of existing patient notes, all notes for eligible MPSA Haven clients, and notes for a random sample of SPSA clients, were retrieved. The information collected fell into the following categories: participant details (age at the time of Haven forensic examination, gender, ethnicity, any injuries, alcohol or drugs around the time of the assault, and psychiatric history), perpetrator details (number of perpetrators, relationship with victim, ethnic appearance, and age) and assault details (nature of assault, violence, initial meeting place, and place of assault).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886260511433514">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>All information collected for the study was taken from the standardized Haven forensic proforma, a detailed form that is completed by sexual offences examiners at the time of the client’s appointment. For the present study, data were extracted from each client’s proforma by two of the investigators (LM &amp; BB): a research fellow and a counselor. The majority of information in the forensic proforma is recorded by way of “tick boxes” in previously established categories, and thus there was no interpretation necessary on the part of the investigators but simply the extraction of information. Data were entered in SPSS (version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and descriptive statistics were used to illustrate the areas of interest. A Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and chi square were used to compare means and proportions, respectively.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511433514">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics of study participants. Victims of MPSA were significantly younger than victims of SPSA (<italic>t</italic> = 2.29, <italic>df</italic> = 273, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and this trend is consistent across all three measures of central tendency, that is, the mean, median, and mode. The mean age of MPSA victims was 21.35 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.05), and the mean of SPSA victims was 23.96 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.70). There was, however, more age variability within the single perpetrator group, as shown by the larger standard deviation, and the minimum age was younger than in the multiple perpetrator group (age 2 years in the SPSA group and age 13 years in the MPSA group). The majority of victims in both groups were female. There was a significant difference in the ethnicity of the two groups, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05: Victims of MPSA were less likely to be White than victims of SPSA. Prevalence of injury (body or anogenital) was 75.5% for the whole sample and significantly higher for MPSA victims than SPSA victims, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Significantly, more victims of MPSA were likely to sustain body injuries, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and anogenital injuries, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 8.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. They were also significantly more likely to report that they had harmed themselves deliberately at some point in their lifetime, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 8.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>

<p>In the MPSA group, the ethnic appearance categories “White,” “Black,” and “Asian” are used when all members of the group are one of these (i.e., all White, all Black, or all Asian). Where the group consisted of a mixture of ethnicities, this was coded “mixed group.” A similar approach was taken to grouping the age of the perpetrators: 30 and below was used when all group members were aged 30 years and below, and 31+ was used when all group members were aged 31 years and above. The category “mixed group of ages” was used for those groups that consisted of members below and above age 30. Due to this method of coding and the resulting empty cells (i.e. mixed race category in SPSA and mixed group of races and ages in MPSA), significance tests were not run for these two variables.</p>
<p>The mean number of perpetrators in the MPSA group was 3.24, with a median of 3 and a mode of 2. The maximum number of reported perpetrators was 22. The most frequent group size was 2 (46.3%), followed by 3 (31.6%), 4 (8.1%), 5 (5.1%), 7 (3.7%), 6 (2.2%), and 8 (1.5%). The remaining 2 cases (1.4%) included one case each involving 16 and 22 perpetrators. All perpetrators were male except in one case of MPSA carried out by a male and a female, and one case of SPSA, which was carried out by a lone female. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the relationships between perpetrators and victims, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 28.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. While the majority of perpetrators in both groups were known casually to the victim (Stranger 2 or acquaintances), almost a third (33.1%) of assaults by multiple perpetrators were carried out by complete strangers (Stranger 1) compared with 18.8% of single perpetrator assaults. In contrast, a quarter (25.4%) of single perpetrators had a close relationship with their victims compared with just 3.7% of multiple perpetrators. Just more than half of the MPSA were carried out by groups of Black males (51.5%), a proportion that is similar to SPSA (46.8%). Perpetrators in single perpetrator cases were older than in multiple perpetrator cases, with 36.7% of single perpetrators aged 31 and older compared with just 8.1% of multiple perpetrators.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511433514">Table 3</xref> shows details of the assault. Four percent of MPSA victims and 9% of SPSA victims reported having no clear recollection of what happened to them. It was decided to include these cases in our analysis to provide a full picture of the types of cases reported to the Haven. Completed rapes were significantly more common in MPSA (vaginal rape, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 19.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; anal rape, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 7.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; oral rape, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 33.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; and MPSA victims reported significantly more multiple rapes, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 108.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In contrast, sexual assault not rape (including attempted rape and digital penetration) was significantly more common in SPSA, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 21.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and victims were more likely to be assaulted once or at one anatomical site, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 50.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. No significant differences were found between the two groups in violence, presence and use of weapons, or verbal threats.</p>

<p>The initial meeting place between perpetrators and victims was significantly different in MPSA and SPSA, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 38.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, as was the place of assault, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 36.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Just more than half (51.9%) of MPSA victims met their perpetrator(s) outside compared with 28.5% of SPSA victims. Almost a third (32.1%) of SPSA victims met their perpetrator at their own home compared with just 4.4% of MPSA victims. Place of assault is interesting in two ways. First, there is a difference between the two groups, in that 50% of MPSAs took place in a residence that was not the victims compared with 31.7% of SPSAs. Second, within the MPSA group, 51.9% met the perpetrator(s) outside but the assault was outside in just 29.4% of cases suggesting movement from meeting place to assault location, either willingly or by force. Significantly more victims of SPSA were assaulted in the same place that they met their perpetrator, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 16.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The differences between the two groups may be related to the fact that victims of SPSA were more likely to be assaulted by a current or ex-partner and thus they would meet the perpetrator at their home and the assault would take place there.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study took place at the Haven Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Camberwell, London, and compared demographic and assault related characteristics of single and multiple perpetrator sexual assaults. There were some notable similarities and differences between the two groups.</p>
<sec id="section14-0886260511433514">
<title>Victims</title>
<p>In line with past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath &amp; Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>), in the present study victims of multiple perpetrator sexual assaults (MPSA) were significantly younger than victims of single perpetrator sexual assaults (SPSA). However, past research suggests that MPSA victims may be more vulnerable in other ways, such as through increased use of alcohol and drugs and higher rates of mental health problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>). In the present study, significantly more MPSA victims reported that they had intentionally harmed themselves at some point in their lives than victims of SPSA, but no significant differences were found between the two groups in rates of other mental health problems or in the use of alcohol and drugs around the time of the assault. Fifty-seven percent of all participants had consumed alcohol, which is in line with previous research suggesting that alcohol is present in one half to two thirds of sexual assault incidents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511433514">Abbey, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511433514">Pernanen, 1991</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0886260511433514">
<title>Perpetrators</title>
<p>In the present study, perpetrators of MPSA were significantly younger than perpetrators of SPSA, with 37% of SPSA perpetrators aged above 30 years compared with just 8% of MPSA perpetrators. This supports previous research on group offending in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511433514">Reiss, 1986</xref>) and multiple perpetrator sexual assault in particular (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath, in press</xref>) that suggests that criminal activity carried out in groups might be part of a social developmental process that diminishes with increasing age. Although the majority of victims in both groups were White, the majority of perpetrators were not, suggesting an overrepresentation of ethnic minority perpetrators in line with that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511433514">De Wree (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al. (2007)</xref>. It is important to note that in the present study comparing victim and perpetrator ethnicity is not comparing like with like. Victim ethnicity refers to how the victim classed themselves, whereas perpetrator ethnicity refers to how the perpetrator appeared to the victim. Furthermore, while 52% of MPSA were carried out by groups of all Black males, 48% were not. Much more research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn about how rape and ethnicity may or may not be connected.</p>
<p>The mean group size was 3.24 and the most frequent was 2 perpetrators, which is similar to previous research into group delinquency in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511433514">Reiss &amp; Farrington, 1991</xref>) and sexual assault specifically (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511433514">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511433514">Vetten &amp; Haffejee, 2005</xref>). Past research is contradictory with regard to the relationship between the perpetrator(s) and victim(s), with some studies finding that they are known to each other in the majority of cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511433514">Bijleveld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>) and others finding a higher rate of assaults by total strangers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath &amp; Kelly, 2009</xref>). The present study found that while perpetrators were known casually to victims in the majority of cases of MPSA and SPSA a relatively high rate of assaults by groups of complete strangers (33%) was found in the MPSA group compared with 19% of stranger assaults in the SPSA group. Furthermore, assaults by perpetrators with a close relationship with the victim were much more common in the SPSA group (25%) than the MPSA group (4%). It is possible that victims of MPSA may be less likely to report the assault if they know one or more of the perpetrators, as they may have to see them at school or where they live and may fear reprisals such as further attacks to themselves or members of their family. Of course, this is also true for victims of SPSA who know the perpetrator, but it might be more threatening when there is a group of perpetrators.</p>

<sec id="section16-0886260511433514">
<title>Nature of the Assault</title>
<p>In support of findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511433514">Lees (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511433514">De Wree (2004)</xref>, the most frequent type of assault carried out by multiple perpetrators in the present study was vaginal rape. This was also the most frequent type of assault carried out by single perpetrators but occurred at a significantly lower rate (82% of MPSA cases and 57% of SPSA cases). Significantly more oral and anal rapes were reported by victims of MPSA (52% and 23%, respectively) than SPSA (18% and 10%, respectively), and MPSA victims were significantly more likely to report rapes at multiple anatomical sites or multiple rapes (80% of MPSA and 17% of SPSA victims). Conversely, significantly more SPSA victims (20%) than MPSA victims (2%) reported sexual assault not rape, which included attempted rape and digital penetration. The present study found a very high rate of oral rape reported by MPSA victims (52%) compared with that found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright and West (1981</xref>; 8%). This is possibly because oral rape was not legally defined as rape until the Sexual Offences Act of 2003, and so before then forced intercourse could only be vaginal or anal. However, our study found a much higher rate of anal rape (23%) than Wright and West (8%) so this change in the law does not account fully for the difference. More recent research shows findings that are similar to ours: for example, 43% of MPSA victims in Chambers et al.’s (2010) study reported oral rape and 13% reported anal rape.</p>
<p>The present study did not find a significant difference between the two groups in rates of violence, presence of a weapon or verbal threats, which is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511433514">Horvath (in press)</xref> but contradicts theories suggesting group processes lead to an escalation in violence. However, high rates of violence were observed in both groups, with 77% of MPSA victims and 64% of SPSA reporting at least one act of violence. There are a number of possible explanations for this; first, it could be that victims in both groups were more likely to report an assault if it was violent. A second explanation relates to research suggesting that violence is more likely in current or previous partner rape (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511433514">Amir, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511433514">Whatley, 1993</xref>). Our victims of SPSA were more likely to be assaulted by a current or previous partner, which might explain the high level of violence observed in this group, and theories of violence escalation in groups might explain high levels of violence observed in our MPSA victims. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511433514">Jones et al. (2004)</xref> found higher rates of physical force in stranger assaults rather than assaults when perpetrators were known to the victim. This might also explain a high rate of violence in our MPSA group, as we observed a relatively high rate of stranger assaults (33%). Unfortunately, neither do we have any access to the dynamics among the perpetrators that brought about the levels of violence observed in the present study nor do we have an understanding of the motivations behind single perpetrator assaults, so this requires further research.</p>
<p>Significantly more victims of MPSA were found to have an injury at the time of the forensic examination (82% and 70% for MPSA and SPSA, respectively), and this was also the case when injuries were separated into body (74% of MPSA victims and 62% of SPSA victims) and anogenital (39% of MPSA victims and 22% of SPSA victims) injuries. This can possibly be explained by the aforementioned higher rate of completed rapes, more multiple rapes, and a high rate of violence in the MPSA group. However, the rate of body injury in SPSA victims is high compared with that found in a number of other studies (e.g., 40% found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511433514">Cartwright, 1986</xref>; 52% found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511433514">Sugar, Fine, &amp; Eckert, 2004</xref>), which might be explained by a relatively high level of violence reported by this group or that victims who have a body injury might be more likely to report the assault.</p>
<p>Our findings support previous research that found approach and assault locations to be different in MPSA and SPSA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511433514">Porter &amp; Alison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>). More than half (52%) of victims of MPSA were approached outside compared with 29% of SPSA victims, whereas 32% of SPSA victims met the perpetrator at their own home compared with just 4% of MPSA victims. The most common assault location in the MPSA group was a place of residence that was not the victim’s (50%) compared with 32% of the SPSA group, whereas the most common assault location in the SPSA group was the victim’s home, reported by 36% compared with just 9% of MPSA victims. Although a large number (52%) of MPSA victims were initially approached outside, just 29% of the assaults took place outside, supporting previous research that suggests in MPSA there is an initial encounter outside then the victims go or are taken elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511433514">Horvath &amp; Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511433514">Wright &amp; West, 1981</xref>). Further supporting this, the approach and assault locations did not correlate for 56% of MPSA victims, which was significantly different from SPSA victims (32%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0886260511433514">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>It is important to note the limitations to the present study. The majority of participants lived in southeast London, and it is not clear how the findings will generalize to all victims of multiple perpetrator sexual assaults. First, the local area is ethnically diverse. The London Borough of Southwark (where the Haven Camberwell is situated) is made up of 63% White and 24% Black (African or Caribbean) residents, compared with 11% of Black residents in the whole of London and 2% in the whole of England. Second, the population is young, with 41% of local residents aged 20 to 39 years compared with 28% for England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511433514">Office for National Statistics, 2001</xref>). It is thus important that further research is carried out across different parts of the United Kingdom if we are to understand fully any distinct characteristics of MPSA.</p>
<p>The study’s design as a retrospective case-note analysis introduces a certain level of error as the data were originally collected for clinical and legal practice. Furthermore, a number of different forensic medical examiners recorded information on the Haven clients included in this study, and although all had a similar high level of training and complete a standardized proforma for each client, there will be a certain degree of variability in examination and recording practices. It is not clear exactly how this would influence the way information is recorded for each client, as we were only able to find one research article that looks at this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511433514">Eckert, Sugar, &amp; Fine, 2004</xref>), where it was found that less experienced examiners documented significantly more genital trauma. This study, like all studies of people who have been sexually assaulted, is open to sample bias in that it is only possible to include people who have reported an assault. Also, running a large number of univariate significance tests increases the likelihood of type 1 errors, that is that some of the significant differences found are in fact false. In spite of these limitations, valid conclusions can still be drawn from the research.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Victims of multiple perpetrator sexual assault were younger, less likely to be White, more likely to report self-harm, and more likely to sustain body and anogenital injuries than victims of single perpetrator sexual assault. Multiple perpetrators were younger, less likely to be White, and more likely to be strangers to the victim than single perpetrators. The nature of the assault was different in single and multiple perpetrator cases; in multiple perpetrator sexual assault, there were more completed rapes and more multiple rapes and perpetrators were more likely to meet victim in an outside location before carrying out the assault in a place of residence that was not the victim’s.</p>
