<abstract>
<p>This is a survey of nurses’ and nursing students’ knowledge about hepatitis A and B and the results are compared with a similar survey of 25 years ago. Questionnaires were given to registered nurses, healthcare assistants and first and third year student nurses during May 2009. In 2009, more participants knew about the transmission of hepatitis B compared with those in 1984. However, in 1984 and 2009, there was ignorance about hepatitis B’s long incubation period and faecal-oral transmission of hepatitis A. Third year students demonstrated better understanding than first years in their knowledge of hepatitis A, B and C. It is encouraging that there has been an increase in the knowledge about hepatitis B transmission. Knowledge about hepatitis A remains poor and it is still being confused with hepatitis B. The overall knowledge about the hepatic viruses remains low and highlights an educational need among today’s nurses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viral hepatitis occurs worldwide. The various forms of viral hepatitis may be sporadic, endemic or epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411427480">Curry and Chopra, 2009</xref>). It is a significant public health problem and it can be a serious infection control concern for hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411427480">Curry and Chopra, 2009</xref>). A study 25 years ago has shown that nurses did not understand the different routes of transmission of hepatitis B (bloodborne) and hepatitis A (faecal–oral) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411427480">Ho-Yen et al, 1985</xref>). Such confusion can have obvious adverse consequences for patient management. More recently, it was shown that nurses’ poor knowledge about hepatitis C could reduce opportunities for caring and information giving to patients (Frazer et al, 2010).</p>
<p>The development of routine diagnostic tests for hepatitis C occurred in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411427480">Curry and Chopra, 2009</xref>) after a study of nursing knowledge of viral hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411427480">Ho-Yen et al, 1985</xref>); in this study, most hepatitis C patients were regarded as having non-A, non-B hepatitis. Since the 1980s, much has changed in nurse education and the general public’s access to information via the internet. The objectives of this survey were to assess the knowledge about hepatitis A and hepatitis B among today’s nurses, nursing students and healthcare assistants and compare it with those of their predecessors from 25 years ago; and to extend the earlier study by including hepatitis C, less well defined in 1984 and previously referred to as non-A, non-B hepatitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757177411427480" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An 18 item questionnaire was divided into four subsections: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and hepatitis A, B and C combined. The hepatitis A, B and C viruses combined section asked infection prevention related questions. Participants were asked to respond either ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘do not know’ to a number of statements in each subsection. The age of the participant was recorded on the questionnaire. Participants were asked not to confer and given as much time as they required to answer the questions. A copy of the questionnaire can be obtained from the corresponding author.</p>
<p>There were two separate groups of participants. The first group included 85 registered nurses and nine healthcare assistants from various wards and departments of local hospitals. The second group included 92 first year and 78 third year student nurses from a School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health in the north of Scotland. Participants in the first group were selected randomly throughout the year from study groups. The second group were present during a supervised session in May 2009. The student nurses were not warned that they would be asked about hepatitis. The first year students were studying the common foundation programme of a pre-registration nursing programme, while the third year students were from both the adult and the mental health branches of the pre- registration programme.</p>
<p>The data of the students were divided into two year groups: first year and third year, and each year group was subdivided into two age groups, less than 30 years and greater than or equal to 30 years. Missing answers were counted as do not know. A total score for the hepatitis questionnaire was computed. Correct responses were scored 1 and incorrect or do not know responses were scored 0. The maximum and minimum scores possible were 18 and 0. The data were analysed using Fisher’s exact test and <italic>t</italic>-test. Although the object of the paper was to compare the results of the 1984 questionnaire with those of today, the authors also used their specialist knowledge to augment the questions while retaining the same format.</p>

<p>Ethical approval was granted from the University School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health ethics committee, to include the student nurses as participants within this study.</p>

<sec id="section4-1757177411427480" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 264 questionnaires were returned. Ninety-four (90%) questionnaires were returned by registered nurses and healthcare assistants from the local hospitals. One hundred and seventy of 264 (64%) questionnaires were returned from student nurses. Ninety-two questionnaires were returned from first year students and 78 from third year students. A head count was not taken of the total number of students present during the session; therefore it was not possible to confirm if all 110 students in year 1 and 109 students in year 3 were present. The minimum return from the first year students was 84%, and 72% from the third year group, calculated on 100% student attendance at the sessions. The study participants ranged in age from 17–49 years (median 24 years). The median age for the first year students was 23 years and for the third year students it was 25 years. The mean and range scores for the whole group, first and third year students are 8.17 (0–17), 6.68 (0–12) and 8.08 (0–14) respectively.</p>
<p>The results of questions that could be directly compared with questions from the 1984 study are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>. There were significantly more participants who gave correct answers for questions associated with the transmission of hepatitis B in the 2009 survey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>, Q1.1 (b), Q2.3). The clinical knowledge of hepatitis B infection was poorer in the recent survey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>, Q2.1 and Q2.2) and more than 50% of participants did not know that hepatitis B infection had a long incubation period.</p>

<p>The majority of participants from both studies did not know how hepatitis A was transmitted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>, Q4.1 and Q4.2). Although there was no significant difference in the number of participants who did not know that hepatitis A was transmitted through faeces and food, there were significantly more in the 2009 study group compared with the 1984 group, who did not know that hepatitis A is not commonly transmitted through blood (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>, Q4.2). Interestingly when the answers from the hepatitis A sections are split into three categories: registered nurses, first year students and third year students, the number of participants with the correct answer for Q4.1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>) were 43 (46%), 0 (0%) and 12 (16%) respectively. There were significantly fewer correct answers when the first year students were compared with the nurses from the 1984 and 2009 studies (0/92 <italic>v</italic> 34/151, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 and 0/92 <italic>v</italic> 43/94, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed, respectively) and significantly fewer correct answers were scored by third year students when compared with registered nurses from the 2009 study only (12/78 <italic>v</italic> 43/94, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed). However, significantly more registered nurses scored the correct result for this question (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>, Q4.1) from the 2009 study than the 1984 study (43/94 <italic>v</italic> 34/151, <italic>p</italic>=0.0002 Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed).</p>
<p>As total questionnaire scores were normally distributed, parametric analysis was used. Third year students scored significantly more highly than first years in terms of their total score, knowledge of hepatitis A and knowledge of hepatitis A, B and C (<italic>p</italic>=0.001, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0004, <italic>p</italic>=0.003 respectively, <italic>t</italic>-test, one-tailed) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411427480">Table 2</xref>). Among first year students the greater than or equal to 30 years group scored significantly higher than the less than 30 year group on questions relating to hepatitis C and the last section on hepatitis A, B and C (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.029 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, <italic>t</italic>-test, one tailed respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411427480">Table 2</xref>). Similar analysis on the data from the third year students revealed no statistically significant differences in knowledge between the less than 30 years and the greater than or equal to 30 years age groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has confirmed that confusion between hepatitis A and B still remains. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177411427480">Stein et al (2003)</xref> believed that lack of knowledge regarding the transmission of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus explained the non-compliance of medical and nursing staff with infection prevention precautions. Knowledge of hepatitis B has improved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>) and we speculate that this could be attributed to the introduction of standard infection prevention precautions. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA first recommended universal precautions in 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177411427480">CDC, 2009</xref>). Initially these dealt only with blood and blood products, but were later changed to include all body fluids and renamed standard precautions. These additional precautions also reduce the risk of faecal–oral transmission of micro-organisms and thus hepatitis A infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411427480">Anonymous, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The participants in this study have demonstrated an increased knowledge of the transmission of hepatitis B compared with those surveyed in 1984 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>). However, knowledge on the incubation period was poor as the majority in both groups did not know that the incubation period is two to six months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>). Incubation periods are not taught as part of standard precautions. There were no differences between first and third year students’ knowledge of hepatitis B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411427480">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177411427480">McGrane and Staines (2003)</xref> demonstrated that nurses’ knowledge of the infectivity of hepatitis B was greater among nurses working in high-risk areas, which may have been due to further training. Interestingly, significantly more 2009 participants felt that hepatitis B had a higher mortality and was permanently infectious (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises that hepatitis A is one of the oldest diseases. It is self-limited, caused by infection in areas where sanitation is poor and living conditions are cramped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177411427480">WHO, 2000</xref>). The registered nurses showed significantly more knowledge of hepatitis A than first year and third year students. The overall incidence of hepatitis A has decreased within the European Union over the last 10 years, from 15.1 per 100,000 population in 1996, to 3.9 per 100,000 in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411427480">Anonymous, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the students may not have had experience of hepatitis A. Both in 1984 and 2009, participants confused hepatitis A with hepatitis B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411427480">Table 1</xref>). Thus they did not know that hepatitis A could be transmitted through faeces and food.</p>
<p>There are obvious limitations to a survey of this nature. The study was of those nurses and nursing students who were available at the time of the study and who agreed to take part. Our results may not represent all nursing staff or students. The ‘improvement’ described in our study is based on a cross-sectional sampling approach rather than by re-testing the same individuals so this is really a proxy measure. There are also inherent difficulties in comparing a 1984 study with one today. However, we felt that this would be a useful exercise and we believe that our overall conclusions are valid. Nurse education has changed considerably over the past 25 years, moving from an apprenticeship type model with an emphasis on clinical practice to a more mixed academic and clinical experience following the Project 2000 reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411427480">United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing and Midwifery, 1986</xref>) which were intended to create ‘knowledgeable doers.’ Nurse education is now located in Higher Education and the move to an all-graduate professional preparation is now close to realisation. The majority of today’s students will have computers and access to the internet within their own homes, providing endless access to a wide range of information. Thus, it is surprising that these students did not have greater knowledge than the 1984 cohort. Our results suggest that teaching of ‘viral hepatitis,’ should emphasise differences between hepatitis A, B and C, especially routes of transmission and should become part of the undergraduate nurse education curriculum. Nevertheless, third year students scored significantly higher than first years in their knowledge of hepatitis A and hepatitis A, B and C but there was no difference between the older (≥30 years) and younger students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411427480">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Knowledge on the spread of infection is important to nurses, not only to protect themselves from becoming infected, but also for them to act as a resource to their patients, advising them on lifestyle implications and on precautionary measures to prevent the spread of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177411427480">Roberts, 2000</xref>). When describing what nurses need to know in relation to bloodborne pathogens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411427480">Twitchell (2003)</xref> concluded that prevalence, risk of transmission, availability of prophylaxis and treatment was important. It is as significant for today’s nurses to be aware of hepatitis A, B and C as their counterparts 25 years ago.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that over the last 25 years there has been a significant increase in the knowledge of the transmission of hepatitis B virus. However, it must not be assumed that nursing staff will take advantage of online information. The knowledge of hepatitis A remains poor and it is still being confused with hepatitis B. The overall knowledge of the hepatic viruses remains low and highlights a need in the education of today’s nurses.</p>
