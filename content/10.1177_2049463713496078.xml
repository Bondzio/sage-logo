<p>This edition of the <italic>British Journal of Pain</italic> (<italic>BJP</italic>) marks a momentous development in the evolution of our Society’s journal. Back in 2007, its predecessor, <italic>Reviews in Pain</italic>, was launched with the aim of providing concise summaries of basic sciences and clinical practice relevant to contemporary pain management. Initially, each issue contained a mixture of topics with the aim of interesting the multidisciplinary membership of the British Pain Society. Each article was accompanied by summary points and multiple-choice questions for those readers wishing to demonstrate continuing professional development.</p>
<p>More recently, the focus changed to commissioning themed issues on topics as diverse as neuropathic pain, failed back surgery syndrome, pain education, trauma, orofacial pain and visceral pain. Since 2012 the team at SAGE Publications has supported the editorial board by enhancing the professional nature of the publication. Last year, we introduced the publication of abstracts from the British Pain Society’s Annual Scientific Meeting in the first supplement to the <italic>BJP</italic>.</p>
<p>In order to increase the scope of the journal, an editorial decision (endorsed by Council) was taken to accept original research submissions, and the preceding issue contained the first two original papers. It is exciting that we now have a sufficient number of manuscripts that have been through the peer-review process to allow a whole edition to be dedicated to publication of original research.</p>
<p>Research requires two things. First, knowing what has already been discovered and having a background knowledge of the subject; second, formulation of appropriate methodologies that will help provide evidence to answer identified gaps in the literature. Although the thought of research may seem daunting to many, particularly for already time-pressed clinicians, most are inquisitive and have questions about their practice. Research and evaluation projects do not always have to be costly and time consuming. Think about how your questions might be turned into small-scale research projects and do consider the <italic>BJP</italic> when submitting your work for publication.</p>
<p>Although reviews are important in keeping informed as to the latest developments in a particular field, it is only by original thought and research that our knowledge will advance in order to improve outcomes for patients who experience pain. The journal does not stand still, however, and it is hoped that each edition from 2014 will include at least one systematic review in addition to topical reviews and primary research.</p>
<p>Over the years <italic>Reviews in Pain</italic> and the <italic>BJP</italic> have been fortunate to have several inspirational and visionary editors: Professor Jon Raphael; Dr Michael Platt and Felicia Cox jointly; and, more recently, Felicia alone. The inclusion of primary research in the <italic>BJP</italic> develops and strengthens its position in our field.</p>
