<body>
<p>ADHD is the most frequent psychiatric disorder of childhood, affecting 8% to 10% of children worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711416800">Biederman &amp; Faraone, 2005</xref>). It is most common in boys, with a male to female ratio averaging between 6:1 in clinical samples and 3:1 in epidemiological samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711416800">Gingerich, Turnock, Litfin, &amp; Rosen, 1998</xref>). ADHD is characterized by persistent and pervasive inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness, and is a major risk factor for educational failure, later antisocial behavior, and difficulties in peer relationship. Comorbid disorders are common in ADHD, particularly oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). This poses an additional challenge to the management of ADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants are the pharmacological treatment of choice for ADHD, yet, increasingly, good clinical practice guidelines call for behavioral, educational, and other therapeutic interventions in addition to the pharmacological treatment.</p>
<p>ADHD is a significant stressor for caregivers and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711416800">Bussing et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711416800">Thorell &amp; Rydell, 2008</xref>). To date, several parent training programs have been designed to address behavioral difficulties in children. Frequently, parent training programs combine psychoeducation and behavioral parent training. Behavioral parent training is designed to teach parents how to apply behavior modification techniques, typically through role-play, discussion, and home practice. Using this form of treatment has shown positive effects on parent management skills, parental interactions, and child’s compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711416800">Pisterman et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, child’s aggression, parental stress, and severity of ADHD symptoms have been shown to decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416800">Anastopoulos, Shelton, DuPaul, &amp; Guevremont, 1993</xref>). Parent education groups, which include psychoeducation about ADHD symptoms and medication, have been found to be effective in improving parent–adolescent relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711416800">McCleary &amp; Ridley, 1999</xref>). These findings are in line with now well-established practice in adult psychiatry where psychoeducation of patients and their families is considered part of evidence-based practice.</p>
<p>There is a growing interest toward understanding the role of social competence and emotional development in children with behavioral disorders, including ADHD. In addition to behavioral and attention difficulties, children with ADHD have been reported to be unpopular with peers, have low self-esteem, and have more difficulty forming and maintaining relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711416800">Grizenko, Archambault, &amp; Pawliuk, 1992</xref>). Thus, poor social competence is a common deficit seen in children with ADHD. When compared with typically developing children, children at high risk for ADHD were found to have impaired emotional recognition, which in turn significantly affected their social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711416800">Kats-Gold, Besser, &amp; Priel, 2007</xref>). Impairments in social functioning and peer relationships are shown to continue into adulthood, increasing chances of poor adjustment to society and further academic failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711416800">Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2004</xref>). These findings stress the significant role that social competence plays in children’s functioning.</p>
<p>Social skills programs are commonly used to improve the social competence in children. Yet, the effects of various social skills training programs for children with ADHD require further examination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416800">Antshel and Remer (2003)</xref> examined the efficacy of social skills training in children with ADHD and found that children and parents reported improved assertion skills, but effects on the other domains of social competence were unclear. In addition, they found that children with comorbid ODD benefited less from the training than children without this comorbidity. As children with ADHD often present with comorbid ODD, developing a program that will benefit children with and without the comorbid ODD is essential. In a study conducted at Douglas Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711416800">Grizenko et al., 2000</xref>), a modified social skills training program was developed to target children’s understanding of self-/other perspective and improving their emotional recognition. The study compared the modified social skills training program with a traditional social skills training program. In this study, children identified by teachers as having behavioral difficulties at school were randomly assigned to either a traditional social skills training program or a modified social skills training program. The modified program aimed at increasing children’s understanding of emotions and self-/other perspective taking. The results indicated that children in the modified program demonstrated more improved behavior than children in the traditional program, and the improvement was maintained at the 9-month follow-up. These findings stress the importance of including the self-/other perspective taking and understanding of emotions in the social skills training for school-age children with behavioral difficulties. As a result, this program, along with parental psychoeducation and training, was offered in the therapeutic summer camp for children with ADHD.</p>
<p>Numerous summer treatment programs (STPs) have been described in the literature for children with ADHD. They combine behavioral interventions in recreational and academic settings, a reward and consequence system, as well as group-based parent-behavioral training sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711416800">Pelham &amp; Hoza, 1996</xref>). The program, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416800">Pelham et al. (2000)</xref>, has shown to be effective. Results demonstrated a reduction in parent ratings of the child’s symptoms and an increase in counselor and teacher ratings of rule-following, classroom productivity, self-esteem, and sports skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416800">Pelham et al., 2000</xref>). Further support for STPs was demonstrated by two well-controlled crossover studies. It was shown that withdrawal of the behavioral treatment during the course of the program caused detriment to behavior, and in teacher and counselor ratings, and academic functioning. Reinstating the STP improved all components back to previous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711416800">Chronis et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the current study is to examine the effectiveness of a modified social skills program and parent psychoeducation and parent training program in an intensive, 2-week therapeutic summer day camp for children diagnosed with ADHD. We hypothesize that children who participated in the camp as compared with an ADHD control group will show improvement in ADHD symptoms, peer relationships, and overall functioning once they return to their regular community school.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1087054711416800">
<title>Population</title>
<p>A total of 33 children with ADHD from the Douglas Mental Health University Institute ADHD Clinic were offered to participate in a 2-week therapeutic summer day camp for the last 2 weeks of August. The children were diagnosed with ADHD based on a clinical interview with a child psychiatrist, school reports, and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children–Version IV. The diagnosis was made using the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711416800">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) criteria. Exclusion criteria included having an IQ of less than 70 on the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children–III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711416800">Weschler, 1991</xref>) or a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder, Tourette’s syndrome, or psychosis. Prior to starting the camp, parents were asked to complete the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale–Parent Version (WFIRS-P), and the Conners’ Global Index–Parent Version (CGI-P) to assess the level of children’s behavioral difficulties and overall functioning. Children were asked to complete the Index of Peer Relations (IPR). As children who attended the therapeutic camp were in an artificial environment (small groups, with therapists experienced in working with children with severe behavioral problems), it was essential to assess whether each child was able to maintain the skills they learnt in their natural environment. To accomplish this, we conducted a follow-up interview with the parents and children 3 weeks after the children were integrated to their community schools. During the follow-up interview, parents were asked to complete the WFIRS and CGI-P based on the child’s performance after finishing camp. Children were asked to complete the IPR based on their peer relationships with children in their regular school and not based on their relationships with children from the camp. There was no change in medication status or adjustment of medication during the summer camp or in the 3-week follow-up period. Children who were on medication stayed on medication; those who were not on medication remained so.</p>
<p>The treatment group was compared with control group of 15 children with ADHD who were recruited from the ADHD clinic of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute but who did not attend the therapeutic day camp because they either lived too far away for parents to drive them daily to the camp or had prior engagements at the time the camp was offered. Children in the control group were similarly diagnosed as the treatment group and had the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. They also did not have any change in medication status or adjustment of medication during the period. The parents of the control group did not participate in the parental psychoeducation sessions. The same questionnaires (IPR, CGI-P, and WFIRS) were administered to the control group at a similar time. Approval for the study was given by the Douglas Mental Health University Institute Ethics and Research Board. Written informed consent was given by the parents; all children also agreed to participate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1087054711416800">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The children attended the therapeutic summer day camp for a 2-week period. A total of 6 hr were spent on therapeutic interventions each day; an hour was dedicated to each of the following interventions: social skills training, music therapy, play therapy, exercise therapy, and art therapy. Focus was maintained on social skills training during all therapies. Children in the camp were divided in treatment groups that consisted between four and six children.</p>
<p>A total of 7 key social skills were selected as the focus for the 2-week period. They included the following: (a) introducing yourself, (b) joining in, (c) knowing your feelings, (d) dealing with your anger, (e) using self-control, (f) responding to teasing, and (g) staying out of fights. The therapist first described how to perform the skills in an appropriate manner. The children were then paired and asked to role-play the new skill in front of the group. Following this, children were asked to role-play the skills from the other’s perspective in an effort to understand situations from other person’s point of view. Practice of the skills continued throughout the day while participating in other therapies. This allowed the children to perform the social skills in a range of settings. The therapists observed the children to ensure that the social skills were being carried out properly. At the end of the day, children had to auto-evaluate their behavior and to engage in a discussion about social skills with their parents at home. Feedbacks were also collected daily from parents for the therapists to evaluate the child’s behavior at home.</p>
<p>Treatment goals included improving the child’s (a) ADHD symptoms, (b) peer relationships and social skills, and (c) self-esteem. The staff who worked in the day camp had 5 to 15 years of experience working in a day hospital for children with severe disruptive behavior disorders and used the same manualized social skills training approach in the day hospital as in the camp. Therefore, the staff were very well trained, and the interventions were consistent and reliable throughout.</p>
<p>During the same period, the parents attended four 2-hr sessions of psychoeducation and parent training. The sessions were led by an experienced clinical social worker and nurse. During the session, they talked about the following: (a) identifying ADHD symptomatology, (b) pharmacological treatment overview, (c) understanding the importance of play and establishing positive relationship between parents and children, (d) how to praise and reward effectively, (e) how to use discipline and time-out, (f) the importance of structure, and (g) how to approach the systems outside of the home, such as after-school programs and other services available for the children.</p>

<sec id="section4-1087054711416800">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The initial severity of children’s problems was assessed using the CBCL. This is a 113-item questionnaire that measures internalizing and externalizing behaviors. A <italic>T</italic>-score of more than 70 is considered in the problem zone. The test has a test–retest reliability of 0.95 to 1.00 and interrater reliability of 0.93 to 0.96. It has known validity and good internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711416800">Achenbach, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Three questionnaires were used to assess changes in behavior of the children: the WFIRS, CGI-P, and IPR. The WFIRS measures a child’s ability to function and the impact a child’s behavior has on other areas of function. It is a 50-item questionnaire whose domains include family, learning and school, life skills, child’s self-concept, social activities, and risky activities. The WFIRS-P was used, which is the version completed by the parent of the child. Scoring ranges from 0 to 3, a score of “2” or “3” on any item indicates impairment. The scale can be scored for each domain by creating a mean score for the total scores/number of items in each domain. For clinical purposes, a mean score of &gt;1.0 in all domains (except risky behavior, which is 0.5) means that the child is impaired. The internal consistency of the scale is greater than 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711416800">Canadian Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Resource Alliance, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The CGI-P allows for an evaluation of the severity of the ADHD symptomatology. The parent completes the questionnaire, which consists of 10 items, specifically used to rate children between ages 3 and 17 years old. The test is composed of two main factors, “emotional lability” and “restless-impulsive behavior.” Ratings are on a 4-point Likert-type scale, 0 = <italic>being not at all true</italic> and 3 = <italic>being very much true</italic>. These scores are then converted into normalized <italic>T</italic>-scores. Any value above 65 is considered in the clinical range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711416800">Conners, Sitarenios, Parker, &amp; Epsteins, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The IPR consists of 25 self-report questions, aiming to assess the quality of peer relationships. It uses a 5-point scale for each question, with a score greater than 35 indicating problems. It is completed by the child. The mean reliability alpha of the IPR is .94, indicating excellent internal consistency. The IPR also has excellent known groups validity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711416800">Corcoran &amp; Fischer, 1987</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1087054711416800">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to compare sociodemographic characteristics of the treatment group and the control group. <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to compare the change in score (prescore–postscore) in the treatment and control group for the CGI-P, WFIRS, and IPR. Effect sizes were calculated for each scale in the treatment group.</p>
<sec id="section6-1087054711416800">
<title>Effect size</title>
<p>The effect size for the treatment group was calculated as the mean difference of pre- and postintervention scores divided by the weighted <italic>SD</italic> of the two groups. Effect sizes were interpreted according to Cohen’s criteria, a small effect size is between 0.2 and 0.3, a medium effect size is between 0.5 and 0.8, and a large effect size is 0.8 and greater. All tests showed to have a large effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711416800">Cohen, 1998</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1087054711416800">
<title>Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Sample</title>
<p>The study included 48 participants, 15 in the control group and 33 in the treatment group. All participants had been previously diagnosed with ADHD. The treatment group consisted of 24 males and 9 females with a mean age of 8.6 years (range = 6–12). Of this group, there were 23 participants with combined-type ADHD (70%), 1 with hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD (3%), and 9 with inattentive-type ADHD (27%). A total of 20 children were on medication (61%) and 13 children were not (39%). The average CBCL total was 70.0. The control group consisted of 10 males and 5 females, 8 with combined-type ADHD, 1 with hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD, and 6 with inattentive-type ADHD. There was no statistically significant difference in sex, ADHD subtype, medicated/not medicated status, CBCL score, age, or yearly parental income between the control and the treatment group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711416800">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the initial CGI-P, IPR, and five out of the six WFIRS initial scores. The only difference between the control group and treatment group was that the control group had fewer problems on the WFIRS social activities score (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study show that the intensive 2-week summer therapeutic day camp for children with ADHD, which includes self-/other perspective taking and parent psychoeducation and training program, appears to be a highly effective method for improving behavior, peer relationships, and overall functioning in children with ADHD. The statistical analysis demonstrated significant improvement in scores for the treatment group on all three test measures: the CGI-P, IPR, and WFIRS. In fact, pretreatment means for the CGI-P, IPR, and WFIRS were all in the clinical problem range and after treatment improved to a mean that was in the nonproblem range. The mean CGI-P score at pretreatment was 76.5 and decreased at posttreatment to 64.5 (clinical range is &gt;65). Mean WFIRS were initially all in the clinical range (clinical range for the WFIRS is &gt;1.0 for all WFIRS subscales, except 0.5 for WFIRS Risky Behavior) and at follow-up were all less than 1.0; the IPR initial mean score was 42.5 (clinical ranges is &gt;35) and decreased to 21.2 after treatment. This study also included a control group, which allowed for evaluation of the effects of time and repeated testing on outcome measures. The control group did not show improvements in any of the tested domains.</p>
<p>The ADHD treatment group as compared with the control group showed significant improvement on all WFIRS scores except the WFIRS Risky Activities subscale (if the Bonferroni correction was taken into account). This can be explained in that this subscale addresses behaviors concerning illegal actions, smoking, taking illegal drugs, police involvement, and sexually inappropriate behavior, questions typically not relevant to young children. As the majority of children in this study were below 10 years, Risky Activity scores were already very low preprogram and so did not show much change.</p>
<p>The group of children with ADHD who participated in the summer day camp showed large effect sizes on most measures, validating the success of the social skills training and parent psychoeducation and training program. The largest effect size of the eight tests was found in the IPR, followed by the WFIRS Learning and School, WFIRS Child Self-Concept, and WFIRS Social Activities subscales and the CGI-P. Reviewing the social skills taught during the program, it is evident that there was a direct correlation between the target behaviors of the seven social skills taught and these highest scoring measures. Targeted behavioral problems discussed specifically during the social skills training showed greater score improvements than problem areas not directly addressed by the training, for example, life skills such as brushing teeth, getting ready for school, and problems eating unhealthy food.</p>
<p>Social skills presented during the camp aimed at satisfying three main objectives of the program. The first goal was to improve severity of ADHD symptoms. Social skills “knowing your feelings,” “dealing with your anger,” and “using self-control” were specifically selected for this purpose. While teaching these skills, the therapists discussed different types of feelings, body cues, temper outbursts, fidgeting, frustration, relaxation exercises, dealing with anger in a school setting, proper articulation of feelings, and eye contact. Looking at the large effect size of the CGI-P scores, it appears that the social skills training was effective. Of the 10 items on the CGI-P, 6 relate to topics discussed during the camp: level of fidgeting, temper outbursts, frustration, distractibility, mood changes, and crying. In addition, WFIRS Learning and School subscale addresses several factors specifically discussed during the camp: causing problems for the teacher in the classroom, being removed from class, and receiving detentions. The large effect sizes of these two measures can be linked to the specific discussion of their items during the social skills training.</p>
<p>A vast amount of time was also dedicated to working on the children’s peer relationships, the second main objective of the program. “Introducing oneself,” “joining in,” “responding to teasing,” and “staying out of fights” were some of the seven social skills taught over the 2-week period. Training discussed identifying teasing and bullying between peers, walking away from a negative situation, “I feel” statements, stop and count to 10, body language, and evaluating possible consequences. The success of teaching these social skills is reflected in the IPR and WFIRS Social Activities subscale scores, tests designed to evaluate peer relationships. Scores on test items evaluating frequency of teasing, bullying, problems getting along with others, problems making and keeping friends, and feeling of belonging in your current peer group all improved significantly after the social skills training. Again, the social skills training focused on peer relationships at school, rather than with family members, resulting in higher effect sizes for WFIRS Social Activities subscale and IPR compared with WFIRS Family subscale.</p>
<p>The third objective of the camp was to improve the child’s self-esteem. Success in this objective is evident through the high effect size on the WFIRS Self-Concept subscale. An improvement in the child’s self-esteem is a direct result of better self-control, social functioning, and peer relationships. The social skills training appears to have been successful at targeting specific behavioral problems, even within a 2-week period.</p>
<p>WFIRS Family and WFIRS Life Skill subscales also showed a moderate to large effect size, albeit less than the other measures. This can be explained in that the camp took place in a school setting and training focused mainly on school-related problems and peer relationships. The parent psychoeducation and parent training may be responsible for the improvement in the WFIRS family measures. With a better knowledge of factors such as ADHD symptomatology, effective methods of discipline, and how to establish a positive parent–child relationship, WFIRS Family and Life Skills subscale scores improved significantly. Parents noted fewer fights between family members and less difficulty parenting. The treatment group had less trouble following daily routines at home. Overall, the child’s behavior at home and responsiveness to his or her parents improved following the program. However, the degree of improvement was not as significant as in areas targeted by the social skills training. This suggests that parents could use more extensive training during the summer camp to even further the progress their child makes at home.</p>
<p>The findings of this study support results from previous research. This study found success in using parent psychoeducation and training program, as indicated particularly by the effect size of the WFIRS family and life skills domain. Shown in past studies to reduce parental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416800">Anastopoulos et al., 1993</xref>) and improve the parent–child relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711416800">McCleary &amp; Ridley, 1999</xref>), the present study’s findings provide additional support for parental involvement and psychoeducation as important aspects of behavioral treatment. The improvements in learning and behavior at school, found in this study, support research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416800">Pelham et al. (2000)</xref> that STPs lead to better rule-following and productivity within the school setting. The results show that using social skills training to improve self-/other emotional recognition allowed the child to respond better to situations such as teasing, bullying, and making and keeping friends. This supports past research that showed that for children with ADHD, incorporating self-/other perspective taking is an effective modification of the traditional social skills training program that allows for gains to be maintained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711416800">Grizenko et al., 2000</xref>). Improvement of peer relationships and increased parental ratings of self-concept are a result of higher self-esteem, supporting the notion that STPs successfully elevate self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416800">Pelham et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416800">Antshel and Remer’s (2003)</xref> study, that showed only limited improvement with social skills training, our summer camp intervention showed significant improvement. This can be explained in that our social skills training was much more intensive and the children had a 5-hr period each day when they were continuously prompted to use the social skills they learned, and second, parental involvement was critical in the camp. Parents attended 8 hr of psychoeducation and behavior therapy management training during the camp. It thus appears very important to offer a combination of social skills training for the child with parent training sessions for the intervention to be effective.</p>
<p>The present study has several key strengths and contributes to current social skills training research in numerous ways. First, a pre–post design was used for the treatment and control groups, which allows for the comparison of change scores. Having a control group that did not receive day camp treatment allowed us to control for repeated testing and the effects of time. Moreover, objective questionnaires were used and completed by the parents and the children. In addition, the children were followed up once they were integrated back into their normal school setting; thus the results of the trial give an understanding as to how the children’s behaviors and peer relationships changed in their regular settings and not just in a highly supervised six-children-per-group day camp. Finally, the social skills and parent education/training program is a systematic manualized approach that can be replicated in other settings.</p>
<p>There were a few limitations in the study. First, there was a relatively small sample size as well as only a short-term evaluation of the treatment effect; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about the long-term effectiveness of treatment. In addition, a follow-up period of only 3 weeks may have limited the accuracy of child behavior evaluations in their regular school setting post treatment. In some instances, there were limited reports from teachers to parents as well as little exchange between the child and peers, potentially affecting the child’s perception of the quality of his or her peer relationships.</p>
<p>Finally, the study was not conducted blindly. Parents were aware of the assigned group of the children. This could influence the parents’ evaluations of their child’s behavior, potentially seeing more improvement than actually present, or inversely, expecting more rapid, substantial progression during the 2 weeks of the study, diminishing their evaluation of the level of improvement. It would have been useful to have data provided by a source blinded to treatment conditions, such as a teacher or group of peers. Unfortunately, given that we tested the children 3 weeks after they returned from summer holidays to school, it was not possible. The children would have had a different teacher from the one they had before summer camp. Therefore, the pre- and posttesting would have been completed by two different teachers who may have had different expectations of the child and a different ways of evaluating the child. Similarly, the children returned to a different class with a different group of peers, and so we could not compare pre- and postevaluations of the children done by their peers.</p>
<p>The present results support the hypothesis that a social skills training program including self-/other perspective taking, parent psychoeducation, and parent training may provide improvement in ADHD symptoms, peer relationships, and overall functioning once reintegrated in regular community school. Future research in this domain should include studies using larger sample sizes and evaluating longer term effects. Also, reports from teachers, prior to the summer holidays and following the summer day camp, who are unaware of the child participation in a therapeutic day camp may be of benefit.</p>
<p>In summary, an intensive therapeutic summer day camp for children with ADHD appears to be a promising treatment modality but further research is needed to assess whether gains will be maintained over time and be generalized to other settings.</p>
