<abstract>
<p>Preston and Hofelich’s (2012) conceptualization of self–other overlap includes both neural and subjective levels, but neural overlap is given a central and necessary role in their model. The model’s broad scope includes many types of empathy phenomena and points to stable patterns and relationships among them. A self–other overlap idea that can cover such a range of phenomena makes gains in explanatory cohesiveness. This may come at the expense of specificity and predictive power in investigating particular neural systems implicated in empathy. The neural overlap concept is broadly useful, but putting it to work in neuroimaging experiments reveals operational ambiguities. Investigating the details of specific systems might suggest further refinements in how we identify meaningful neural self–other overlap.</p>

<p>The concept of “empathy” is like the closet in the classic radio comedy routines of <italic>Fibber McGee and Molly</italic>: Fibber McGee goes hunting for something in the overstuffed hall closet and, inevitably, all its contents come crashing down on him as soon as he opens the door. “Going to straighten out that closet one of these days!” he vows from under the pile. There is a large (and to some extent miscellaneous) amount of content that needs to fit into the empathy closet, and in order to do so we need not only boxes and labels, but an understanding of how they should stack.</p>
<p>The order-imposing approach of Preston and Hofelich’s review is to identify different “stable states” in empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421392">2012</xref>, Table 2) and to map them onto a framework that encompasses neural and subjective levels of self–other overlap. This framework involves representations, feelings, and actions. The “stable states” represent conceivable, and in many cases familiar, manifestations or failures of empathy that might occur in ordinary interactions between two people. Preston and Hofelich’s perspective also ambitiously leaves room for the mix of emotion, memory, language, concepts, cultural constructs, and social conventions that characterizes the fleeting states elicited by any dyadic interaction. The application of the term “stable states” to these implies that empathy is as noisy and busy as mental experience can be, but reliably gives rise to certain patterns.</p>
<p>Such patterns probably cannot be discerned without a wide view. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421392">Preston and Hofelich’s (2012)</xref> view in this article is intentionally quite wide. This may be a drawback for those seeking a finer grained perspective or requiring more distinct boundaries between the concepts included in the framework. However, the value of the broad view is in discerning relationships and patterns in the phenomena as well as in the literature. A particular strength of Preston and Hofelich’s model is that the dynamic aspect of empathy is built in, allowing the fluctuations, multiple sources of modulation, and informative variance captured by empirical measures to funnel into our hypotheses. Further, its ethologically influenced perspective on empathy phenomena not only highlights potential animal models of human behavior, but also allows investigation of the features of a species’ ecology and social environment likely to contribute to empathic processes.</p>
<p>Self–other overlap is a unifying and organizing principle in this framework. The authors explicitly consider neural self–other overlap to be the basis of the wide range of overlap-mediated empathy phenomena: “identifying the neural level of overlap is critical for a perception-action mechanism (PAM) of empathy, because all other forms are thought to derive from this basic feature of the architecture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421392">Preston &amp; Hofelich, 2012</xref>, p. 26). Of course, if this proposition does not hold up, the model is in trouble. However, as the authors point out, there is abundant evidence that neural and subjective overlap is involved in empathy. There may be less evidence for the <italic>necessity</italic> of overlap to felt empathy, but there is nevertheless a strong theoretical case that empathy is based on mechanisms that render the contents of others’ experience in the same terms as one’s own, however this is accomplished.</p>
<p>It is possible, though, that the broadness of the neural self–other overlap concept as described in the article may diminish its predictive power with regard to particular types of empathic phenomena or their underlying mechanisms. Certainly there is a tension between inclusiveness and specificity here. The “overlap” idea smuggles interpretation and prediction weaknesses into the model. This is partly because for any given state (say, a pattern of blobs from a neuroimaging experiment), we currently lack the criteria to decide what counts as meaningful overlap.</p>
<p>For example, my collaborators and I have examined the idea of neural overlap during pain empathy by looking at “self” and “other” pain activations at the individual level using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421392">Morrison &amp; Downing, 2007</xref>). There was overlap at the group level for feeling and observing pain, implying that observing someone else’s pain draws on the same neural processing as feeling pain directly. However, individuals showed varying degrees of overlapping activation—and some showed none at all—despite rating others’ pain as unpleasant as their own. These results called into question a simple interpretation of activation overlap as an index for empathy mechanisms, suggesting at the very least that we cannot make assumptions based on averaged, spatially smoothed brain activations. We must also allow for the possibility that functionally similar neural coding between self- and other-related processes does not necessarily entail spatial overlap. Some forms of empathic feeling could result from operations that produce comparable results by different means or in entirely different parts of the brain (e.g., “commensurate coding”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421392">Prinz, 1990</xref>). For now, though, spatial overlap remains the most tractable variety in neuroimaging.</p>
<p>Preston and Hofelich are right that “. . . to understand the full range of empathic experience, one needs to conceptualize other states that can differ significantly across individuals and entail emotion to varying degrees” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421392">2012</xref>, p. 26). On the other hand, there are methodological advantages to taking a narrower but more specific approach to overlap. Empathy definitely goes beyond pain, but on the other hand pain provides a relatively circumscribed system within which to study vicarious responses. Examining overlap in terms of specific systems lets us identify details that could yield a better sense of the scope and limits of the mechanisms involved. For example, the possible existence of close analogues to mirror-neuron-like coding for pain in the cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421392">Hutchison, Davis, Lozano, Tasker, &amp; Dostrovsky, 1999</xref>) could support the interpretation that activation overlap here is due to functionally equivalent coding and probably not, say, mere statistical blur at the noisy edges of nearby, but functionally different, activation clusters. In contrast, since any mechanisms for commiseration about a bad date are less likely to be comparably direct, we would use other criteria to determine the functional equivalence of overlap effects or to reduce them to their lowest common functional denominator.</p>
<p>So in order to increase predictive power by identifying details, and to arrive at criteria for interpreting effects, at some point it becomes necessary to zoom in on a particular system. Preston and Hofelich’s model does not preclude this by any means. In fact, in my view one of the model’s most valuable aspects is also one of the most specific: the proposal that some forms of altruistic actions (especially rescue) rely on a mammalian neural system for offspring retrieval behavior. This is a very innovative and exciting proposal.</p>
<p>Preston and Hofelich’s framework has both empirical and theoretical bases, and is not without the friction generated by moving between method and theory. The authors admirably decided not to wait for “one of these days” before straightening out the empathy closet. Their closet is organized and the contents are neatly stacked, but it is still possible to delve into a particular box on a particular shelf.</p>
