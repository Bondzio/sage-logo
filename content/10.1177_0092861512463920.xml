<abstract>
<p>Marketing authorization holders should report adverse drug reactions (ADRs) derived from spontaneous case reports and literature for their medicinal products to competent authorities. Yet the difference in quality of data from both sources has never been analyzed. To this end, YES Pharmaceutical Development Services in cooperation with the German Medicines Manufacturers Association has conducted an analysis examining more than 25,100 spontaneous and literature cases that occurred between 2007 and 2008. Reporting rates of ADRs for specific drug substances (DSs), expectedness, and the system organ class (SOC) referred to were examined. It was found that the distribution of ADRs to specific SOCs differs between both groups for selected DSs. For more than 37% of the DSs being evaluated, a difference of 10% or more regarding reporting rates of unexpected ADRs was observed between both groups. These findings underline the substantial importance of regular literature reviews in addition to the spontaneous reporting system for a sufficient safety assessment of medicinal products.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the primary goals of pharmacovigilance is the early detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that are novel by virtue of their clinical nature, severity, or frequency in order to exclude or minimize any harm to patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512463920">1</xref>
</sup> Recognizing a potential link between a drug and an adverse event is extremely challenging mainly due to the huge amount of postmarketing safety data that need to be screened.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512463920">2</xref>
</sup> Two important main sources of such safety data are spontaneous case reports (SCRs) and case reports derived from regular literature screening. Marketing authorization holders (MAHs) are obliged to report serious ADRs brought to their attention by health care professionals to the competent authorities (details are laid down in Volume 9A of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union and in the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices). Furthermore, MAHs should perform systematic literature reviews for their medicinal products at least once a week and should report serious ADRs derived from this screening to the authorities. Both sources of information are important instruments for the evaluation of a drug’s safety. However, both systems have not been compared so far in detail with regard to their advantages, limitations, and differences. Therefore, an analysis of safety data derived from a pharmacovigilance database of the German Competent Authority (ie, BfArM) compared with safety data generated from a bibliographical ADR database (Vigilit<sup>®</sup>, YES Pharmaceutical Development Services, Friedrichsdorf, Germany [YES]) was undertaken.</p>
<p>The current analysis focuses on the following 3 primary topics of interest:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Is there a difference in the distribution of ADRs to specific system organ classes (SOCs) between the 2 groups?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is there a difference in reporting rates of unexpected ADRs in literature compared with the spontaneous reporting system?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How does the distribution of ADRs to predefined medication groups in literature compare to the spontaneous reporting system?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0092861512463920" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>For the analysis of spontaneous reports, all cases spontaneously reported to the German Health Authority (ie, BfArM) between 2007 and 2008 were extracted from its pharmacovigilance database.</p>
<p>Data of bibliographical case reports were derived from the Vigilit<sup>®</sup> system designed by YES. It is a validated management and retrieval system for such reports that encompasses all activities relating to the statutory obligation to continuously monitor scientific literature. Since 2003, YES has regularly screened medical publications on behalf of numerous pharmaceutical companies for 490 different drug substances (DSs) and has developed a database including more than 26,000 bibliographical ADR reports until now. For this analysis, all cases included between 2007 and 2008 in the Vigilit<sup>®</sup> database were examined.</p>
<p>Data from the BfArM pharmacovigilance database and the Vigilit<sup>®</sup> database were imported into a relational SQL database system using the mySQL programming environment. This project-specific database was necessary for the analysis and to have an identical data set structure. For better comparability, only those SCRs were analyzed that matched the 490 DSs included in the Vigilit<sup>®</sup> system. If available, both original databases provided the following information for each case: report identification, gender and age of patient, reported reaction, medical history with onset and stop date, suspected drug name (proprietary or generic) and indication for use, concomitant drugs, and indication for use. In both databases, all ADRs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version valid at the time of ADR occurrence. These data sets were incorporated into the project-specific SQL database. </p>
<p>The data were transferred to the statistical analysis system in comma separated values (CSVs) format. An analysis was carried out that compared the results for literature cases to those for SCRs based on descriptive statistics. For rate differences between the 2 groups, confidence intervals were computed according to Newcombe’s method (method 10 in Reference 3). IBM SPSS Statistics software version 19.0.0.1 was used for all statistical analyses.</p>
<p>To analyze whether there is a difference in the distribution of ADRs to specific SOCs, every MedDRA coded event was grouped to the respective SOC.</p>
<p>To cluster the bibliographical ADRs according to predefined medication groups, the respective suspected DS was classified to one Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system main group (ie, first level of the ATC classification) if an exact identification based on the available case data was possible. Otherwise, the ATC group was set to “unknown” (eg, route of administration and reason for use were missing). For the SCRs, the information was available in most cases in the database; otherwise, it was also set to “unknown.”</p>
<p>Of the 490 DSs in the Vigilit<sup>®</sup> system, 32 were selected for the analysis of expectedness of the reported ADRs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512463920">Table 1</xref>). The aim was to include at least 5% of all DSs to this subanalysis. Upfront it was decided not to include vitamins, electrolytes, mineral supplements, antiseptics/disinfectants, and alcohol. Furthermore, a minimum of 25 cases for a respective drug in each treatment group was requested. Following this, DSs belonging to the ATC groups “dermatologicals,” “antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents,” “sensory organs,” and “various” were excluded for this subanalysis as the amount of information was too sparse. The 32 DSs were identified with the aim to have at least 1, and preferably up to 5 substances from the medically most important ATC main groups. For each DS included in this analysis, 1 core Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) valid between 2007 and 2008 was chosen—if possible the SPC of the originator—to retrospectively determine the expectedness of ADRs. </p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>For all 490 DSs, a total of 25,107 cases were examined: 9427 literature cases and 15,680 spontaneous cases. These cases included 20,552 ADRs in the literature group versus 44,872 ADRs in the SCRs group. The mean number of ADRs per case was 2.2 and 2.9, respectively.</p>
<p>The mean age of the patients on whom the case reports were based was 46.8 years in the literature group and 49.5 years in the SCRs group. In the literature group, 48.8% were females and 43.7% were males (for the rest, sex was not mentioned in the respective publication). In the SCRs group, 56.1% were women and 39.0% were men. A slight imbalance regarding sex between both groups was seen as being of no relevance for further evaluation. The majority of patients in both groups received no concomitant medication (58.7% vs 63.2%, respectively). In the majority of cases, only 1 drug was regarded as suspected for a respective ADR (65.3% literature group, 67.8% SCRs group).

<title>Distribution of ADRs to System Organ Classes</title>
<p>While evaluating the distribution of ADRs to specific MedDRA-SOCs per group for all 490 DSs in total, we found no major rate differences between the literature group and the SCRs group. None of the differences between the 2 subsets exceeded 4.5% (point estimate), revealing no medically important difference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512463920">Table 3</xref>). Most of the ADRs belonged to the SOC “nervous system disorders” (13.8% literature cases and 12.3% SCRs) followed by the SOC “psychiatric disorders” in the SCRs group (10.2%) and the SOC “general disorders and administration site conditions” in the literature group (9.0%).</p>

<p>When selected DSs were chosen for the evaluation of the distribution of ADRs to MedDRA SOCs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512463920">Table 1</xref>), a difference in the distribution rates of 10% or more was regarded as medically important. Such differences were observed for 27 of the 32 selected DSs. The point estimates for the medically important differences ranged from 10.0% to 45.9% (for tamsulosin). The relatively high reporting rate for tamsulosin is mainly due to the ADR “floppy iris syndrome,” with 13 cases in the literature group and none in the SCRs group. For those DSs where there was a reporting difference of 10% or more for the SOC “injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (ie, tamsulosin, alendronic acid, fentanyl, and diphenhydramine), a higher rate of literature cases was reported compared with the spontaneous reporting system. The relationship was inverse concerning the SOC “gastrointestinal disorders” (for the DSs acetylsalicylic acid, lidocaine, amoxicillin, and alendronic acid). For all other SOCs, no trend was observed for higher reporting rates in either group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512463920">Table 4</xref> presents the ADRs by MedDRA SOC with a reaction rate difference of 15% or more.</p>

<p>There seems to be a tendency that ADRs referring to the MedDRA SOC “injury, poisoning and procedural complications” were more often published in literature than they were reported spontaneously to the competent authority as unexpected events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0092861512463920">Table 6</xref>). The highest reporting rates of unexpected ADRs in this SOC were observed for alendronic acid (60.4%) and fentanyl (55.8%) (both in the literature group). For alendronic acid, this was mainly attributable to the ADRs femur fracture and stress fracture, with no such reports in the SCRs group. For fentanyl, the most common ADRs in the above-mentioned SOC were overdose, including accidental and multiple drug overdose, with only a few such reports in the SCRs group.</p>

The suspected DSs with the highest rate of reported ADRs belonged to the ATC group “nervous system” (44.1% of the reported ADRs in the literature group and 42.5% in the SCR group, respectively). DS treating conditions of the cardiovascular system were the second most common group of suspected DSs (12.9% literature group, 12.7% SCRs group).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge this is the first systematic analysis of SCRs compared with literature cases. Both systems are an integral part of postmarketing surveillance.</p>
<p>Health care professionals are encouraged to report ADRs to either MAHs or competent authorities. Many factors, such as novelty of the drug or ADR, severity, or seriousness, can influence spontaneous reporting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512463920">4</xref>
</sup> The relevance of this system has been described by Olivier and Montastruc,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512463920">5</xref>
</sup> who analyzed the nature of scientific evidence leading to drug withdrawals for pharmacovigilance reasons in France. In 19 of 21 drug withdrawals during a predefined time frame, scientific evidence leading to withdrawal came from SCRs. An unavoidable limitation of this system is underreporting. Tavassoli et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512463920">6</xref>
</sup> mentioned a reporting rate of 5%-10% for serious ADRs in France. This is in line with a low reporting rate in the Czech Republic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512463920">7</xref>
</sup> Another disadvantage is the so-called notoriety bias. Pariente and coworkers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512463920">8</xref>
</sup> analyzed the impact of safety alerts on the reporting frequency of spontaneous reports and observed an increase in SCRs after a respective safety alert for a variety of drugs (ie, notoriety bias). They concluded that this may lead to increased reporting of the event in association with other drugs.</p>
<p>Case reports derived from literature can have a significant clinical impact, especially for rare events that might not be detected in preapproval clinical studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512463920">9</xref>
</sup> They can increase the awareness for potential signals and might trigger further reports. Guidelines for submitting adverse event reports for publication have been prepared,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512463920">9</xref>
</sup> but unfortunately these have not been globally transferred into daily publication practice. According to Impicciatore and Mucci,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512463920">10</xref>
</sup> adequate information about the route of administration, the formulation, or the proprietary name of the suspected drug as well as details about the event outcome, the seriousness, and concomitant medication is quite often missing, making a comprehensive safety assessment difficult. Notoriety bias is also a limitation of literature case reports.</p>
<p>Data derived from the 2 reporting systems for the current analysis seem to be valid and robust, as comparable results have been described earlier. In our analysis, ADRs were most frequently related to nervous system drugs and cardiovascular drugs, which is in line with an analysis by Thiessard and coworkers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512463920">11</xref>
</sup> who examined the French pharmacovigilance system. The SOC most often reported in our analysis was “nervous system disorders” followed by the SOC “psychiatric disorders” in the SCR group and the SOC “general disorders and administration site conditions” in the literature group. These data are also comparable to results presented by Thiessard et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512463920">11</xref>
</sup> who reported “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” (29%) as the most common SOC, followed by “nervous system disorders” (19%), “general disorders and administration site conditions,” “blood and lymphatic system disorders,” “vascular disorders,” and “gastrointestinal disorders” (12% each).</p>
<p>Haramburu et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512463920">4</xref>
</sup> evaluated SCRs of unlabeled ADRs from the French pharmacovigilance database for 10 drugs during the first 4 years of marketing and reported rates of 31.3% (hypnotics) to 77.8% (gastric secretory inhibitors) for unexpected ADRs. Comparable ranges have been found in our analysis for 32 selected DSs. Differences with regard to reporting rates of unexpected ADRs in both groups could most likely be a chance finding.</p>
<p>The slight tendency toward a higher reporting rate of unexpected ADRs from the SOC “injury, poisoning and procedural complications” in the literature group compared with the SCR group could be explained by the public and academic interest in such topics (eg, poisoning, overdose). One example is the ADR “floppy iris syndrome,” being first described in literature in April 2005,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512463920">12</xref>
</sup> for which 13 cases were published for the drug tamsulosin but none was spontaneously reported in our current analysis. This underlines that ophthalmologists and surgeons seemed to be more academically oriented by publishing this medically important event rather than reporting it to the authorities. In the meantime “floppy iris syndrome” is listed in the SPC, which seemed to be most likely attributable to several literature reports of this ADR.</p>
<p>The opposite was observed for the SOC “pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions,” where health care professionals were sensitized to spontaneously report such events rather than publish the respective case. According to Kopečná et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512463920">7</xref>
</sup> gray areas in spontaneous reporting are reporting of overdosing, intoxications, drug abuse, and misuse, an observation that is in line with our findings.</p>
<p>Besides the advantages and limitations of both systems, the current comparison shows that none of the 2 systems could be used as standalone system. The combination of both is necessary for an adequate assessment of a drug’s safety, given that for one drug an unexpected adverse event might be detected (earlier) with regular literature screening whereas for another drug an early signal might be detected via the spontaneous reporting system. Our results indicate that regular literature screening seems to be of special importance for newly marketed drugs, for approval of new indications or new populations (eg, elderly, children) as seen for tamsulosin (ie, floppy iris syndrome) and alendronic acid (ie, atypical femur fracture).</p>
<p>Our analysis is limited by the fact that for the assessment of expectedness, an SPC valid between 2007 and 2008 was not always available retrospectively, so that the rate of unexpected events could be higher. Furthermore, because only 32 DSs (out of 490 in total) were chosen, the difference between the 2 reporting systems with regard to unexpected event rates might have been underestimated. However, our data show the importance of the parallel use of both systems for early signal detection.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Spontaneous reporting should be the backbone of any pharmacovigilance system supported by adequate regular literature screening. Given the underreporting of ADRs by health care professionals, a regular literature search is a powerful tool to obtain additional and valuable information on the safety of a specific drug that is not covered by the analysis of spontaneous reports.</p>
