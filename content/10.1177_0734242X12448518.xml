<abstract>
<p>‘Red mud’ or ‘bauxite residue’, a waste generated from alumina refinery is highly alkaline in nature with a pH of 10.5–12.5. Red mud poses serious environmental problems such as alkali seepage in ground water and alkaline dust generation. One of the options to make red mud less hazardous and environmentally benign is its neutralization with acid or an acidic waste. Hence, in the present study, neutralization of alkaline red mud was carried out using a highly acidic waste (pickling waste liquor). Pickling waste liquor is a mixture of strong acids used for descaling or cleaning the surfaces in steel making industry. The aim of the study was to look into the feasibility of neutralization process of the two wastes using Taguchi’s design of experimental methodology. This would make both the wastes less hazardous and safe for disposal. The effect of slurry solids, volume of pickling liquor, stirring time and temperature on the neutralization process were investigated. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the volume of the pickling liquor is the most significant parameter followed by quantity of red mud with 69.18% and 18.48% contribution each respectively. Under the optimized parameters, pH value of 7 can be achieved by mixing the two wastes. About 25–30% of the total soda from the red mud is being neutralized and alkalinity is getting reduced by 80–85%. Mineralogy and morphology of the neutralized red mud have also been studied. The data presented will be useful in view of environmental concern of red mud disposal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Bayer process of extraction of alumina from bauxite remains the most economical process till date. In the Bayer process, the insoluble product generated after bauxite (containing 40–60% A1<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub>) digestion with sodium hydroxide at elevated temperature and pressure to produce sodium aluminate is known as ‘red mud’ or ‘bauxite residue’. The waste product gets its name due to its consistency and colour caused by the oxidized iron content present in it. Red mud is a mixture of compounds originally present in the parent mineral, bauxite, and of compounds formed during the Bayer cycle. As the bauxite has been subjected to sodium hydroxide treatment, red mud is highly caustic with a pH in the range of 10.5–12.5. The main reaction that occurs in the Bayer process (the conversion of bauxite to sodium aluminate) can be schematized as follows:</p>

<p>About 1 tonne of alumina is produced from 3 tonnes of bauxite and about 1 tonne aluminium metal is produced from 2 tonnes of alumina (Annual Report, Chapter 5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12448518">Department of Ministry of Mines, India, 1999-2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Depending on the raw material processed, 1–2.5 tonnes of red mud is generated per tonne of alumina produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12448518">Paramguru et al., 2005</xref>). Bauxite ore mined globally amounts to be around 205 million tonnes for 2008 and 201 million tonnes for 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12448518">US Geological Survey, 2010</xref>). This indicates that an enormous quantity of red mud is generated worldwide every year (over 70 million tonnes) posing a serious and alarming environmental problem. Voluminous research and development work for the storage, disposal and utilization of red mud is being carried out all over the world.</p>
<p>Red mud is disposed as dry or semi-dry material in red mud ponds or abandoned bauxite mines. It has a high ionic strength and is disposed of as slurry having a solid concentration of 30–60%. The environmental concerns relate to two major aspects: the very large quantity of red mud generated and its causticity.</p>
<p>Problems associated with the disposal of red mud waste include: its high pH, alkali seepage into underground water, safety in storage, alkaline airborne dust emissions, and the vast area of land required for disposal. Up to 2 tonnes of liquor with a significant alkalinity of 5–20 g L<sup>−1</sup> caustic soda (as Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) accompanies every tonne of dry mud.</p>
<p>Although red mud appears to be consolidated, it has a muddy consistency because of the fineness of the material involved and their colloidal nature due to the caustic soda present in it. Neutralization is required to convert the highly caustic state of red mud to a state which is no longer highly caustic and is less hazardous. Neutralization of red mud will help to reduce the environmental impact caused by the adverse storage behaviour of the residue and also significantly lower the effort needed during ongoing management of the deposits after closure. It will also open new opportunities for utilization of the residue which to date have been prevented because of the high pH. The costs of neutralization will, to some degree at least, be offset by a reduction in the need for long-term management of the residue deposits. Studies have been carried out by Alcoa World Alumina Australia to investigate the potential impact of residue leachates on clay seal materials of red mud ponds. The studies indicated that as the pH (and hence alkalinity) of the leachate (caustic liquor present along with the red mud) in contact with the clay seal increases, the clay itself becomes increasingly susceptible to dissolution reactions which alter the chemical and mineralogical composition of the clay seal and probably its sealing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12448518">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>). By reducing the pH of residue leachate, the potential risk of long-term degradation to clay or synthetic liners will be reduced. Furthermore, any leachate which does escape from the impoundment will have a reduced impact on the receiving waters, thus the overall risk of groundwater contamination would be reduced significantly.</p>
<p>Hence, efforts to ameliorate red mud are being carried out by possibly incorporating a pH-reduction processing step. These methods include treatment of red mud with CO<sub>2</sub>, seawater, bioleaching, sintering and acid also being one of them.</p>
<p>The feasibility of treating red mud with acid have been studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12448518">Hughes and Thornber (1991)</xref>. Various aqueous acidic solutions have been considered for this application, including acidic industrial wastewater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12448518">Wong and Ho, 1994</xref>). The use of carbonic acid has also been considered. A number of studies have been performed to investigate the feasibility of treating bauxite residue with acid on Kwinana red mud slurry. Red mud has been treated with acidic spent pickling solutions (SPSs), derived from the steelmaking process to provide a coagulant – a mixture of aluminium and iron salts – for waste water treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12448518">Piga et al., 1993</xref>). Neutralization using acids can be reasonably cheap if sufficient large quantities of waste acids are available. Red mud has been treated with hydrochloric acid to dissolve only the sodium content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12448518">Onnnyemauwa and Gregory, 1976</xref>; US Patent 3985567) and the treated material is mixed with kaolinitic clay and formed into construction bricks.</p>
<p>Acid pickling liquors (HCl and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) are used in cold rolling mills and galvanizing mills to clean iron and steel surfaces. Waste pickling liquors are highly acidic in nature with a very low pH (less than 2) and contain dissolved iron with chromium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc being also present in minor concentration (less than 20 ppm). Red mud being alkaline can be neutralized by treatment with this acidic waste which may generate a waste that is much less hazardous than the individual wastes. In turn, red mud would also neutralize the pickling waste liquor.</p>
<p><italic>Pickling waste liquor</italic>: Pickling is a metal surface treatment used to remove impurities, such as stains, inorganic contaminants, rust or scale, from ferrous metals, copper, and aluminum alloys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12448518">Eagleson, 1994</xref>). A solution called pickling liquor, which contains strong acids, is used to remove the surface impurities. It is commonly used to descale or clean steel in various steelmaking processes. The primary acid used is hydrochloric acid, although sulfuric acid was previously more common. Hydrochloric acid is more expensive than sulfuric acid, but it pickles much faster while minimizing base metal loss. Pickling sludge is the waste product from pickling, and includes acidic rinse waters, metallic salts and waste acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12448518">Rao and Ramchandra, 2006</xref>). Pickling sludge from steel processes is usually neutralized with lime and disposed off in a land fill. In place of lime, alkaline red mud may be utilized for its neutralization.</p>
<p>In the present study, the feasibility of using pickling liquor to neutralize alkaline red mud has been studied. Although the acid –base reaction has been investigated before by many researchers, studies on the factors affecting the acid–base reaction in red mud neutralization process with pickling liquor has been limited till now. During neutralization of red mud with pickling waste liquor, the pH would depend upon a wide range of different factors such as the content of solids in the red mud slurry, volume of pickling liquor added, stirring contact time and temperature. A comprehensive study of these effects is of great significance and is necessary to understand the process. Therefore a multifactorial experimental design, the Taguchi method, has been applied to approach this problem of evaluation of pH values.</p>
<p>Taguchi’s design of experiments has been used extensively in product quality assessment and several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12448518">Barker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12448518">Ross, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12448518">Roy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12448518">Srivastava et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448518">Taguchi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448518">Taguchi and Yu-in, 1979</xref>). Taguchi method has been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12448518">Lataye et al. (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12448518">2009)</xref> to study the multicomponent sorption of pyridine and its derivatives from aqueous solution onto rice husk ash, granular activated carbon and bagasse fly ash. It has also been used in other areas of engineering and medicine as well. In this contribution, Taguchi’s fractional factorial design of experiments is used to examine the effect of significant parameters on the pH of red mud slurry. The average values and the signal to noise (S/N) ratio of the quality response characteristic (pH) each parameter at three levels of their values have been calculated from the experimental data. The response curves have been graphically represented to reflect any change in the quality characteristic and S/N ratio with the variation in process parameters. Significant parameters have been identified by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the experimental data.</p>

<p>Mineralogically, red muds have phases of undigested alumina, aluminosilicates, phases of iron and titanium. These phases are hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), goethite Fe<sub>(1−<italic>x</italic>)</sub>Al<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>OOH (<italic>x</italic> = 0.33), gibbsite Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, boehmite AlO(OH), calcite(CaCO<sub>3</sub>), calcium aluminium hydrate (<italic>x</italic>.CaO.<italic>yAl</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>O</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub>.<italic>z</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O), rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>), anatase (TiO<sub>2</sub>), CaTiO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>, kaolinite Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2SiO<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, sodalites, aluminum silicates, cancrinite (NaAlSiO<sub>4</sub>)6CaCO<sub>3</sub> and hydrogarnet Ca<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<italic>n</italic>(OH)<sub>12−4<italic>n</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>The sodium present in red mud (total soda) is in two forms: free caustic soda and bound caustic soda. Free caustic soda is the entrained liquor in the red mud slurry which gets incorporated during the digestion process and remains with red mud in spite of repeated washings. Free soda is in the form of NaOH, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaAlO<sub>2</sub>, etc. The pH of the red mud is due to the presence of these alkaline solids in red mud. Inclusion of caustic soda in bound form in the red mud is due to the desilication step carried out in the Bayer process for removal of kaolinitic silica in bauxite. Bound soda is in the form of sodalite complex which can be stated as ‘NAS’ phases: 3(Na<sub>2</sub>OAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SiO<sub>2</sub>)Na<sub>2</sub><italic>X</italic> with (<italic>X</italic> = CO<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup>, 2OH<sup>−</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, 2Cl<sup>−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12448518">Kurdowski and Sorrentino, 1997</xref>). In red muds, about 20–25% is free soda, and the rest is in the form of sodalite complex.</p>
<p>Red mud is a very fine material in terms of particle size distribution. Typical values for particle size distribution are 90 weight % below 75 µm. The specific surface area (BET) of red mud is between 10 and 30 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, depending on the degree of grinding of bauxite. The BET surface area of red mud used was found to be 20.26 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<title>Taguchi’s design of experimental methodology</title>
<p>A well planned set of experiments, in which all parameters of interest are varied over a specified range, is an approved approach to obtain systematic data. Mathematically speaking, such a complete set of experiments ought to give desired results. Dr Taguchi of Nippon Telephones and Telegraph Company, Japan, has developed a method based on ‘orthogonal array’ experiments which gives much reduced ‘variance’ for the experiment with ‘optimum settings’ of control parameters. Taguchi methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12448518">Peace, 1993</xref>) use an orthogonal array distribution to design an experiment producing smaller, less costly experimental set-ups that have a high rate of reproducibility. In neutralization of red mud with pickling liquor, it is important to identify relevant factors affecting the process and the way that they interact in order to neutralize the red mud. However, one of the main problems is the difficulty in designing experiments to compare the effects and interactions of multiple variables. For example, a traditional experimental design to compare four independent variables at three different levels each requires a large number of individual experiments (i.e. 81 experiments). The logistical and resource implications of this experimental design make these experiments very difficult to carry out. With the Taguchi method, using an orthogonal array distribution to design an experiment, a study involving four factors at three different levels can be conducted with only nine individual experiments. The Taguchi method consists of three phases: designing the experiment, running and analysing, and confirming and validating the experimental results. After selecting the variables to be studied, the Taguchi method depends on distributing the factors under study in an orthogonal array, which distributes the variables (factors) in a balanced manner. Each array can be identified by the form <italic>L</italic><sub>A</sub>(<italic>B</italic><sup>C</sup>), the parameter <italic>L</italic>, which is designated by subscript A, represents the number of experiments that would be conducted using this design, <italic>B</italic> denotes the number of levels within each column which denotes how many levels could be investigated, while the letter C indicates how many factors or variables could be included in the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12448518">Peace, 1993</xref>). Hence Taguchi’s L<sub>9</sub>(3<sup>4</sup>) orthogonal array matrix and experiments are carried out in triplet under the same conditions.</p>
<p>The range of different parameters used (factors: A, B, C, D) which could have their effect on final pH of red mud slurry when neutralized with pickling liquor are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12448518">Table 2</xref>. The parameters were selected on the basis of the preliminary experimentation carried out. The red mud slurry which is disposed off in red mud ponds generally contains 30–60% slurry solids and hence the range for this parameter was based on it.</p>

<title>Neutralization studies</title>
<p>The initial pH of the red mud slurry was 10.7 (50 g of red mud was stirred with 100 mL of distilled water for 30 min). Different quantities of red mud were mixed with 100 mL distilled water to get the slurry. Pickling liquor was added and the slurry was agitated at a constant speed for a fixed duration of time and at the desired temperature in the temperature-controlled water bath. After each experimental run, the pH of the slurry was measured.</p>
<p>The red mud obtained after neutralization at the optimized condition was analyzed by using the wet chemical method for its chemical constituents. It was analyzed mineralogically also for determination of phases using X-ray diffraction (XRD; PAnalytical (X-Pert Pro), Holland). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been conducted with the neutralized red mud using an Electron Probe Analyser (MAKE: JEOL, Japan, JXA-840A).</p>

<title>Analysis of experimental data</title>
<p>The experimental data generated was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore how variability in the pH value is attributed to various factors mentioned above. Taguchi software was used for all the analysis which was based on Taguchi method for determination of main effects of the process parameters. The plot of response curves, analysis of variance for raw data and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio data was used for the analysis of results. In order to confirm that the optimal parametric values using Taguchi’s methodology are valid, selected confirmatory experiments were carried out under optimal conditions.</p>

</fig>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12448518">Figure 2</xref>, it can be seen that the pH of the neutralized slurry increased with the increase in percentage solids (factor A). This was due to the increase in free caustic soda in the slurry with the increase in the quantity of red mud. There was a sharp increase in pH when factor A changed from level 1 to 2 as compared to the change in pH from level 2 to level 3. An increase in quantity of pickling liquor (factor B) decreased the pH of red mud slurry. An increase of factor B from level 1 to 2 decreased the pH much below 7 as the pickling liquor was highly acidic in nature. A further increase in factor B to the level 3 decreased the pH value to nearly 5, which would make the slurry more acidic in nature. A marginal increase in pH value was observed with the increase in stirring contact time of pickling liquor in red mud slurry from level 1 to level 2 and subsequently from level 2 to level 3. The caustic soda which remained adhered to the red mud and was trapped in the crystallites came into the solution as soon as red mud was mixed with water. As the pickling liquor was added this caustic soda, which was mainly in the form of NaOH, reacted with pickling liquor, instantaneously neutralizing the red mud slurry. Similarly, the temperature (factor D) at which the neutralization process was taking place remained non-variant from level 1 to level 2 and from level 2 to level 3 as the reaction between an acid and base is fast and is not temperature dependent. The overall results convey that the pH of the slurry decreases with one major parameter, namely the volume of pickling waste liquor. The desired pH of the neutralized slurry was 7.0 and hence the optimum condition for the process was observed to be the percentage solids at level 3, the volume of pickling liquor to be between level 1 and level 2, the stirring time at level 3 and the temperature at level 2 (A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>3</sub>D<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>The contribution of individual parameters was weighted as shown in ANOVA (analysis of variance) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12448518">Table 5</xref> to see their effect on desired response characteristic (pH). The most significant parameter once again was the volume of pickling liquor with a percentage contribution of 69.18%. The other significant parameter was the slurry solids which was the quantity of red mud used and had a percentage contribution of 18.48%. The stirring time had a much lesser effect of about 5%. As the temperature (factor D) had a negligible effect on the value of pH achieved, it had a smaller variance and was of small significance. Hence it was pooled to increase the statistical significance of the other important factors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12448518">Figure 3</xref> shows the contribution of each of the parameters.</p>

<title>Red mud and liquor after neutralization</title>
<p>The chemical analysis of red mud before and after neutralization is as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0734242X12448518">Table 7</xref>. It can be seen, that alumina, iron, silica, titanium and calcium more or less remained the same, but about 25–30% of the total soda from the red mud was being neutralized. It means that nearly all of the free soda was being neutralized with the pickling waste liquor. The mineralogy (XRD pattern) of the neutralized red mud (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0734242X12448518">Table 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12448518">Figure 4</xref>) shows the undigested gibbsite, sodalite, hematite and a prominent phase of calcite. The morphological SEM photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12448518">Figure 5</xref>) of neutralized red mud shows the agglomerated material containing sub-angular fragments of iron and titanium. The blocky, small and smooth structures are of sodalite. The agglomerates are composed mostly of small particles which are smaller than 5–7 µm in size and are made up of iron, alumina and sodalite minerals. The SEM micrograph mainly shows the porous structure of the agglomerates which were caused by neutralization of the free soda occluded in the crystalline structure. This has also been noted during filtration of neutralized red mud slurry. It was observed that after neutralization the filtration rate of the red mud slurry increased noticeably. As porous structure can be observed in the SEM micrograph, the neutralized red mud may be used as an adsorbent.</p>

<p>The comparison of the liquid phases without and with neutralization is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0734242X12448518">Table 9</xref>. The decanted liquid (the liquid phase which would be disposed off after neutralization), has a much lower pH of 7.45 which is within permissible limit and a significant reduction in alkalinity (about 80–85% reduction) is observed. The iron content of the liquid remains the same while the total dissolved solids (TDS) increases. The methods used to control TDS are: precipitation, ion exchange, evaporation and membrane separation. The chloride content in the liquid increases and it can be used in manufacture of brine. The conceptual flow diagram is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12448518">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Herein the feasibility of the use of acidic pickling waste liquor in neutralization of alkaline red mud, using Taguchi’s experimental methodology is discussed. The findings obtained demonstrate that the Taguchi method is a valuable tool for the investigation of the effects of multiple variables in obtaining the desired pH values. The main effects of process parameters such as slurry solids, quantity of pickling waste liquor, stirring time and temperature on the pH value of the red mud slurry was studied. The optimum process conditions were found to be 40% slurry solids in 100 mL water, 6 mL pickling waste liquor, 135 min stirring time and 40 °C temperature. The volume of pickling waste liquor was found out to be the most significant factor affecting the neutralization process (69.18% contribution). The other significant parameter was the slurry solids which is the quantity of red mud used for neutralization (18.48% contribution). The stirring time has a much lesser effect of about 5% and the temperature has nearly a negligible effect on the value of pH achieved.</p>
<p>This study shows that an acidic waste which is available in abundance can be used to neutralize an alkaline waste and thus both the wastes can be made less hazardous for disposal. Neutralization with pickling waste liquor reduces the alkalinity of red mud by about 85% and also decreases the viscosity of the red mud thus improving settling and filterability of red mud. After neutralization and with an advance filtration facility, red mud slurry can be disposed off with pH -values around 7 and much reduced alkalinity, thus rendering it safe for disposal. The neutralized red mud also may be used as an adsorbent for which further studies need to be carried out.</p>
