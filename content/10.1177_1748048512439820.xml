<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On 25 January 2011, mass protests demanding the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak’s regime and urgent political and economic reforms took place in different parts of Egypt. After 18 days of continued demonstrations, on 11 February the protesters succeeded in overthrowing the president and his government. Power was handed over to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to lead the country through the transitional phase. During this 18-day period, the Egyptian protesters succeeded to a large extent in achieving maximum publicity and attracting the attention of the world by mobilizing news media coverage of their protests. Different news channels and newspapers, including major players such as CNN and Al Jazeera, gave priority to Egypt’s news round the clock. Programmes were interrupted to broadcast the latest news of the Egyptian protests and many newspapers and other media channels changed sides during this period.</p>
<p>This article studies the mainstream media coverage of the protests in Egypt using a combination of quantitative measures. For the purposes of this article, the term ‘mainstream media’ refers primarily to conventional newspapers as opposed to both conventional newspapers and news channels. The article also provides an analysis of the argument that some newspapers shifted positions through the period under consideration. Three main questions are directly addressed in this study: why do news media, in particular newspapers, tend to sometimes give more attention to some events and ignore others, and how did that happen in the case of the coverage of the Egyptian protests? Second, how did the news media cover the Egyptian protests, and why did some news outlets, if any, change sides during the period? And lastly, what was the effect of the social media on the mainstream media’s coverage of the protests?</p>
<p>Egypt’s newspaper outlets are divided into three categories: government, party and privately owned, with the government-owned ones constituting the largest share of circulation. In an investigation into the state of the Egyptian media structure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439820">Iskander (2006)</xref> argued that even with the recent changes (up to the 2005 presidential elections) in the media regulations in Egypt, an active and independent media system was still not achievable, as the state’s control of the different media outlets was still strong. He further stated that even with the existence of several party or privately owned media outlets that represented different orientations, there were clear limits to how free these outlets could be. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048512439820">Sakr (2010</xref>) stated that reporters inside Arab dictatorships like Egypt are faced with two sets of obstacles – the first is the traps planted within the independent journalistic institutions, such as the journalists’ union, while the second is demonstrated in the exercise of the government’s authority through licensing institutions, controlling news flow and detaining journalists. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512439820">Black (2008</xref>) argued that although Egyptian newspapers were officially given more freedom by Mubarak’s administration, these freedoms were withdrawn during events that the regime felt represented a strong challenge. These claims stress the importance of studying the domestic newspapers’ reports of the protests covered in this article, as this will allow us to effectively analyse how the government’s control over news media was demonstrated during this event. Due to the significant implications that the events in Egypt had for the global political scene, it was also important to consider the coverage provided by some other national and international newspapers in order to compile a richer image against which a transnational comparison could be made. In the case of non-Egyptian newspapers it can be argued that the political orientations and policies of the different organizations and countries that these institutions were based in played a major role in how they reported the protests. Because, during the early days, the protests in Egypt were framed by many western diplomats and politicians as an uprising against a corrupt regime, the non-Egyptian news media tended to present coverage that was biased towards the protesters. The mirror analogy, which argues that news media tend not to reflect basic facts but rather to report these facts from the lens of the most established political views, helps to explain this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439820">Tuchman, 1978</xref>). This means that the framing of many news stories can be affected heavily by differences in the prevailing national policies within which the different news institutions operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439820">Hallin, 1984</xref>). A further examination of these arguments and many others, paying particular attention to the event under consideration, is provided in the sections that follow.</p>

<sec id="section2-1748048512439820">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>With regard to the media’s role in influencing the ranking and perception of different stories, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512439820">Walgrave and Aelst (2006</xref>) analysed the media’s political agenda-setting power and found that this power differs between different outlets and situations and that it is contingent on several factors, such as the different inputs involved and the political context in which this power is exercised. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048512439820">Wu and Coleman (2009</xref>) argued that there is a much stronger effect of attributes reporting compared to issues reporting with regard to influencing the public agenda and the general readership. They found that the media’s reports of the attributes of election candidates, for example, tend to have a high correlation with people’s perceptions about the candidates, which reflects the strong impact of these reports. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512439820">Luther and Miller (2005</xref>) found that when reporting protests, news media outlets tend to ignore or diminish the significance of those that go against the most dominant political views and those that are held by the political elites. They further stated that the usage of certain legitimizing or delegitimizing keywords in the news stories is a result of these outlets’ efforts to influence the public agenda and rank the importance of different issues. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512439820">Reese and Buckalew (1995</xref>) found that the effect of the media’s agenda-setting efforts tends to be amplified when the media, after influencing people’s opinions in the first place, start reporting public opinion.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have investigated how different factors affected the coverage provided by different media outlets of particular events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439820">Fang (2001</xref>) studied the differences in the coverage of two different events in two different countries by two ideologically opposed newspapers. He found that their coverage was similar for one event but very different for the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439820">Fang (2001</xref>) attributed the huge divergence in the coverage of the second story to two main factors. The first factor was differences in the diplomatic relations of the reporting countries with the countries in which these events took place. He stated that as the event country had weak diplomatic relations with the country in which one of these newspapers operated, the newspaper was allowed to portray the event in an aggressive way; stronger diplomatic relations motivated the other newspaper to do the exact opposite. The second factor mentioned by Fang was the policies of the newspapers themselves, which he says can play a very important role in influencing how a newspaper will portray any event to the public (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512439820">Cottle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439820">Milne, 2005</xref>). Fang concluded that the portrayal of foreign protests is highly determined by what he called ‘ideological and political opportunism, as well as the obligation to justify the policies adopted by the government’ (2001: 611).</p>
<p>Another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted (2005</xref>) on the news media coverage of the anti-war protests in New York between 2003 and 2005 found that the news media attempted to lessen the significance of these protests in a variety of ways. First, the news media tried to diminish the significance of the anti-war movement through its shallow and irregular reporting of single events. Second, as stories were reported from the perspectives of the official sources, protesters’ views were either reflected incorrectly or just simply ignored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted (2005</xref>: 387) stated that ‘the protestors were framed as a deviant group of outsiders at best, and terrorist sympathizers at worst’. Furthermore, she explained that in order to avoid questioning the status quo of the war in Iraq, most newspapers and news channels linked supporting the troops which was seen as patriotism with supporting the war. Nevertheless, the findings of this study are incomplete to some extent due to the fact that only particular events were chosen and analysed during the period studied; also the analysis was limited to one newspaper, <italic>The New York Times</italic>, which eliminated the possibility of making a comparison. In a similar paper, entitled ‘Framing the anti-war protests in the global village: A comparative study of newspaper coverage in three countries’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng (2008</xref>) studied how coverage of anti-war protests over a period of six months differed between <italic>The New York Times</italic> (US), <italic>The Times </italic>(UK) and <italic>People’s Daily</italic> (China). The results of this study revealed that coverage of events reflects the policies and political and social structures of each country. Peng also found that news contents were directly affected by the prevailing ‘public mood’ and historical ‘journalistic practices’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439820">Milne, 2005</xref>). He mentioned that, for example, <italic>People’s Daily</italic> offered greater space and more protester-biased reporting of the anti-war demonstrations than <italic>The Times</italic> and <italic>The New York Times</italic>. Peng also stressed that <italic>People’s Daily </italic>coverage of the protests aimed to portray them as legitimate social movements, which sat in complete contrast to the portrayals provided by the other two western newspapers. However, the findings of Peng’s study are inadequate to some degree because, in order to have a more balanced comparison, more newspapers from each country would need to be added to reflect the different political orientations that prevail within each country. Additionally, studying more newspapers from each country would provide an opportunity to study the differences within the same country and contrast them with the transnational differences – a point that was neglected in this study. Nevertheless, in this study we try to overcome this problem by looking at a wider variety of newspapers that operate in different countries, which will allow us to improve our analysis and its conclusions.</p>
<p>On the issue of selective reporting, or more formally ‘selection bias’, a research study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439820">Smith et al. (2001</xref>) on the effects that the news media’s coverage of protests has on the communication of their agenda to the general public found that there is a strong tendency for television media, unlike print media, to only report demonstrations that fit within specific accepted themes (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512439820">Gamson and Wolfsfeld, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439820">Gans, 1979</xref>). The researchers also found that the focus of these reports was on the theme – or issue – only, rather than on the events themselves. However, they noticed that when the agendas of these protests were non-thematic, the emphasis in the reports, which were usually episodic, was placed on the event itself – while trying to marginalize the main issue and portray the protesters negatively (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512439820">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512439820">Halloran et al., 1970</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439820">Smith et al. (2001</xref>: 1416) concluded, ‘We would expect that social movements most threatening to the existing socioeconomic order tend to attract more episodic than thematic coverage.’ This study, however, overlooked the answer to an important related aspect on how new themes – or frames – emerge and how different news media institutions treat them. It also lacked a discussion of the major factors contributing to the prevalence and survival of some themes rather than others. A paper on the news media selection bias by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439820">McCarthy et al. (1996</xref>) studied the reporting of protests in 1982 and 1991 in Washington, DC by two newspapers and three news channels. The study found that the size of the demonstrations played a major role in the news media’s decisions regarding whether or not to cover the event and in determining the type and frame of the coverage if any was provided (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439820">Oliver and Maney, 2000</xref>). The next important factor, according to this study, was whether or not the demonstrations fall within the media attention cycle. The researchers found that even demonstrations that are small in size can be heavily covered if they are related to the prevailing reported issues. However, the researchers stressed that the media attention cycle is mainly shaped by official sources rather than demonstrators, leaving a very slim chance that demonstrations that are not directly linked to the cycle will be reported. McCarthy et al. stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>The likelihood that a protest will be reported by the mass media is shaped by forces mostly beyond the control of most protest groups, unless they are capable of generating mass participation in demonstrations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439820">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>: 495)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One of the major limitations of this study was its sole focus on demonstrations in Washington, DC; this provided biased results due to the relatively more in-depth reporting of events occurring in the capital compared to other places.</p>
<p>Very few studies have been done on the issue of the role of social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook, in moving the masses in different protests. The interaction between social media and mainstream media has also been neglected thus far, due to the relative freshness of this phenomenon. In a study of how the Red Shirts’ protests employed social media during their rally against the Thai government, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512439820">Carthew (2010</xref>) argued that the demonstrators’ heavy reliance on Twitter and Facebook to communicate the truth of what was happening in the streets put pressure on the mainstream media to present more unbiased, unframed stories. Carthew further stated that the use of Twitter by the protest leaders to disseminate information to the public about the protest events proved to be very successful with hundreds, and sometimes thousands, going out to the streets based on these ‘tweets’ alone. He mentioned that at the start of the protests, the number of followers of the Twitter page of the main leader of the protesters reached more than 65,000 in a relatively short period. However, Carthew also noticed that the Thai prime minister at that time had also employed Twitter to reach his followers and monitor his opposition and that his number of page followers had reached more than 50,000 by the time the protests began. In regard to mainstream media, Carthew mentioned that many journalists from different parts of the world depended heavily, if not solely, on ‘tweets’ by both sides to cover the protests. He quoted one of these journalists as saying:<disp-quote>
<p>But in Thailand’s fast moving and violent political crisis, there was no time to wait for those ‘old media’ to tell us what was going on. What we needed to know was: What were people tweeting? (Cathew, 2010: 26)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This study, however, lacked an analysis of the true and direct effects of these media on mobilizing the masses and affecting media stories. Although a general image was given, analyses of specific cases related to these two aspects were missing throughout the study, which produced inadequate conclusions as a result.</p>
<p>The present article primarily aims to address the lack of sufficient direct comparisons between Arabic and non-Arabic newspapers in the literature, particularly in regard to the issue of protest coverage. It also plans to supplement the available literature on the interaction between mainstream media and social media by using the recent events in Egypt as an example. Furthermore, this study is also intended to fill some of the gaps in the literature associated with analysing the possible shifts in some news outlets’ coverage of various events.</p>

<sec id="section3-1748048512439820">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>In order to provide a balanced response to the questions in this study, it was very important to ensure that a variety of political orientations and views were represented in the selected sample. Therefore, three main factors were taken into consideration when selecting the newspapers to be included in this study, which were: country of origin, target audience and language. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048512439820">Table 1</xref> shows these different factors in regard to our sample of study. Generally, these different newspapers were studied because they reflected different political views, which helped the comparative nature of this study. For example, <italic>Al Ahram</italic> represented the local newspapers in Egypt, of which the majority are government-owned, whereas <italic>Arab News</italic> and <italic>China Daily</italic> were included – the first owned by a very important player in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia) and the second by a non-western global power (China) – because they reflected different views to the European and American viewpoints. The latter were represented by the <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic> and <italic>Guardian International</italic>. Lastly, <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> was also included because of the strong economic and political relations between Egypt and Israel and the expected significant impact of the events in Egypt on Israel’s security and domestic conditions. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that although other newspapers could have been excellent choices for our study, the exclusion of these institutions from the sample came as a result of either the unavailability of data or time-constraints – or both. Moreover, news channels such as Al Jazeera and CNN International also played a major role in the events, however they were excluded from this study due to the difficulty associated with comparing the channels’ coverage with the coverage provided by the newspapers because of the differences with regard to the issue of broadcasting time available for the former versus the publishing space available for the latter. This is in addition to the fact that a fair examination of Al Jazeera’s coverage of the events would require a study dedicated to that purpose alone, due to its important and significant role in the events. It is also important to note that during the gathering of data, which were in this case in the form of news stories, opinion columns were excluded due to the fact that these usually do not reflect the policy of the institution itself. However, it is necessary to note that many of the writers of these columns have dedicated their spaces to talking about the protests from the outset. Moreover, in at least two of the newspapers studied, the majority (about 55–60%) of the writers of these columns were either part-time or full-time journalists in the same institution. We need not concern ourselves here about the issue of electronic versus conventional newspaper formats because only the texts were considered in this study; hence the reporting of these stories does not differ between the two formats.</p>

<p>With regard to the time period covered by the study, data were collected from 26 January, a day after the protests started, until 12 February, one day after the resignation of the Egyptian president – a total of 18 days. The first day of the protests – 25 January – was excluded, as many newspapers did not have any stories related to the event published on that day. Additionally, it is important to note that some days are missed in the analysis of some newspapers due to the fact that news stories published on these days were not available on the database used by the study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748048512439820">1</xref></sup> With regard to the results included in this study, it is necessary to remind the reader of the limitations associated with comparing the number or lengths of news stories published in the different newspapers due to the inherent variation between these publications regarding the number and size of their pages.</p>
<p>To effectively address the questions presented by this article, a content analysis was performed on all of the news stories collected for the period being studied. The analysis aimed to collect information for five main parameters. The first parameter was a word count of all of the news stories covering the event that were published on each day. The second was a count of the number of stories published on the front page and inside pages. The third parameter was the rank and political orientation of the people cited in these stories. The fourth was a count of how many times stories from social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, were cited. The last parameter was a count of how many times several keywords appeared in these stories – five categories of keywords were chosen to represent how protesters were portrayed in the stories of the different newspapers. These categories were:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Revolution</italic> and its synonyms such as uprising, Intifada, etc.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Chaos</italic> and its synonyms such as disorder, insecurity, etc.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Human rights</italic> and words linked to this phrase such as abuse, cruelty, etc.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Corruption</italic> and its synonyms such as mistreatment, misuse, etc.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Social media</italic> and words linked to this phrase such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It is worth mentioning that a modified form of ethnographic content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048512439820">Altheide, 1996</xref>) was used to continuously improve the preciseness and validity of the parameters used in the study and its results. As the data were collected for the analysis, the predefined research parameters were modified based on any new patterns identified in the texts in order to inform the choice of parameters. This also helped when determining the five categories of keywords – as mentioned above – and when picking the words within them.</p>
<p>For the purpose of conducting a general comparison of the newspapers included in this study, a points-based scale was developed that gave equal weight to each of the studied parameters. These parameters were combined to create two categories, with each category containing the parameters that convey the same overall meaning about the particular aspect (intensity or orientation) of the coverage. Although it could be argued that some of the parameters were more important than others, giving them all equal weights helped to avoid the problem of deciding which were more or less important. The points assigned to each publication in each of these categories were proportionally adjusted to reflect differences in the page size of these different publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748048512439820">2</xref></sup>

<p>On the first day of coverage, 26 January, all of the six newspapers provided a relatively comparable amount of coverage except for <italic>China Daily</italic>, which only published a very short story in its inside pages, and <italic>Arab News</italic>, which did not publish anything. The next day’s coverage followed a reasonably similar pattern, with <italic>China Daily</italic> choosing to publish a short story on the front page and another story in the inside pages and <italic>Arab News</italic> publishing its first story about the protests in the inside pages. During the next 15 days, 28 January–11 February, four of the newspapers maintained relatively high and constant coverage intensity with very close averages. <italic>China Daily</italic> provided the lowest coverage intensity, with at least two days passing without any news about the protests. <italic>Arab News</italic>, on the other hand, had fairly variable coverage intensity, with several stories in some days and nothing in others. On the last day of coverage, 12 February, all of the newspapers provided strong coverage – relative to their previous coverage – of Mubarak’s resignation and the end of the protests.</p>
<p>The relatively weak coverage of the protests by <italic>China Daily </italic>and <italic>Arab News </italic>could be explained to a large extent by the strong diplomatic relations between the government of Egypt and the governments of Saudi Arabia and China. It may also be linked to the susceptibility of the political systems in both countries to pro-democracy movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512439820">Fang, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439820">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>). It could be strongly argued that these countries tried to keep the news about the revolution to a minimum to reduce domestic awareness of the pro-democracy movement in Egypt and other places, due to their profound fear of similar uprisings occurring on their doorsteps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the very low coverage intensity on the first two days may be the result of a belief that the events in Egypt were just incidental and that they were not likely to last longer than a few days. With regard to <italic>Al Ahram </italic>and <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic>, the intensive coverage provided by both newspapers is largely explained by the former being a domestic major newspaper and the latter being published in a country that has many close political and economic ties to Egypt. This supports Mueller’s (1997) claim that news outlets in countries closer to the event tend to provide more intensive coverage. <italic>Guardian International </italic>and<italic> International Herald Tribune</italic>’s intensive coverage is largely attributed to the location of Egypt in the Arab world and the Middle East and its significant role in the region, as well as the existence of several news agencies in Egypt. Being that they are commercially focused on meeting the demands of international rather than domestic readers, both newspapers were expected to provide intense coverage of the protests in Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512439820">Rai and Cottle, 2007</xref>). However, the association of the Egyptian protests with the prevailing issues being reported (especially after the virtual victory of the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, which paralleled the Egyptian protests in many ways) also increased the intensity of coverage provided by these two newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439820">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

It is worth mentioning that all citations of non-Egyptian people were counted under the foreign official category, regardless of the newspaper. In this section, the term ‘pro-government’ refers to the Egyptian government officials and its supporters, whereas the term ‘pro-opposition’ refers to the protesters and the opposition leaders. The figures were gathered to help us analyse how balanced the coverage of the different newspapers was in regard to the number of citations of the different parties involved in the Egyptian events. We also aim to study any patterns or dramatic changes that may have evolved during the 18-day period.</p>

<p>First, with regard to <italic>Guardian International </italic>and<italic> International Herald Tribune</italic>, both had a clear tendency to cite more pro-opposition speakers than pro-government ones. On almost every day the number of pro-opposition representatives cited was higher than their official rivals. Moreover, although usually fewer than the pro-opposition counts, the counts of foreign officials and media representatives cited in both newspapers were also higher than the pro-government ones; this may reflect the international character of these newspapers. The favourable citing of more pro-opposition than pro-government representatives is due to the fact that the protests were largely referred to by western officials as ‘peaceful’ and ‘democratic’ movements. These newspapers were expected to follow this lead and give more space to the opposition. As noted earlier, western and perhaps even Middle Eastern public opinion and political debate was focused on and supportive of the ‘Freedom Wave’ that had started with the Tunisian Revolution; the reporting of the events in Egypt was highly influenced by these prevailing trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512439820">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439820">Hallin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439820">Milne, 2005</xref>). <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> also cited slightly more pro-opposition than pro-government speakers on average. However, it overall cited more foreign (although in this case they could have been domestic as well) officials than each of the former, which is largely due to the fact that this newspaper is focused on domestic (Israeli) rather than international readers. Third, <italic>Arab News</italic> gave almost equal opportunity on average to pro-opposition and pro-government representatives. However, there was a clear trend of favouring government officials initially, while giving more space to the opposition during the final days. One explanation of this trend is the fact that Saudi Arabia’s government had initially declared support for Mubarak’s regime; however, as more western pressure was placed on Mubarak to step down, the Saudi government changed its position and so did its newspaper (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439820">Fang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>China Daily </italic>gave more space to pro-government representatives throughout the period than pro-opposition representatives and foreign officials. One could argue that the reason behind giving significantly fewer opportunities to the opposition representatives is that China’s government did not officially recognize the legitimacy of the movements in either Tunisia or Egypt. As a result, the newspaper tried to marginalize the protesters and their demands by affording officials and pro-government representatives more opportunities to represent their views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted, 2005</xref>). Finally, <italic>Al Ahram</italic> was clearly biased towards the pro-government representatives, being a government-owned newspaper itself. During the initial days no opposition representative was cited and foreign officials were rarely cited. However, towards the end of the protests, more space was given to the opposition representatives. It is worth noting that only after Mubarak stepped down on the evening of 11 February were more opposition representatives cited in the next day’s stories than their government rivals. One justification for this pattern lies in the fact that, by ignoring the protesters’ opinions, <italic>Al Ahram</italic> and perhaps other government-owned media tried to influence the process of public opinion by manufacturing a more positive public image of the government; they did this through citing officials talking about their plans to improve the situation and end the ongoing unrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439820">McLeod and Hertog, 1992</xref>). Additionally, by giving significantly more space to pro-government representatives, who usually try to discredit the protesters and their demands, <italic>Al Ahram</italic>’s potential aim was to decrease public support for the protesters’ movement and thus inhibit its ability to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439820">McLeod and Hertog, 1992</xref>). However, an argument may arise as to whether giving more opportunities to a party is a true reflection of the position taken by the newspaper or not. Some people may argue that this merely arises as a result of the journalists’ search for information and not the editorial policy itself. Therefore, caution should be taken when considering the discussion above in separation of the other sections in this study.</p>

These figures were gathered to analyse how each newspaper portrayed the Egyptian protesters and their demands using these different keywords. Also, we try to reveal any shifts in the patterns of their usage during the period studied. With regard to the interpretation of the different keyword categories, we consider to what degree these different keywords were used either positively or negatively to portray the protesters. First, higher usage of ‘Revolution’ indicates a favourable portrayal of the protesters, due to the association of this word with the struggle for freedom and democracy. Second, higher frequency of the ‘Chaos’ category indicates a negative portrayal of the protests, as these words were frequently used to either describe the protests as chaotic actions or to describe their demands as demands for chaos and disorder. Third, higher usage of ‘Human rights’ would signify a positive portrayal of the protesters, due to the fact that words in this category were used to highlight violations and potential abuses of human rights by the Egyptian authorities. Lastly, more frequent usage of ‘Corruption’ category words, which were used to stress the existing injustices and misuse of power by the government officials in Egypt, signalled favourable coverage of the protests. The ‘Social media’ category is discussed in a later section.</p>

<p>
<italic>Guardian International </italic>and<italic> International Herald Tribune </italic>had very similar reporting patterns, which favoured the protesters over the government. Both newspapers had significantly higher counts of ‘Revolution’ than any other category and an overall higher total count in the other two positive categories, ‘Human rights’ and ‘Corruption’, than ‘Chaos’. As previously stated, the fairly positive view of the global public towards the increasing significance of ‘Freedom Revolutions’, especially after the astonishing success of the revolution in Tunisia, had helped to create a new favourable theme of coverage for ‘freedom seekers’ around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439820">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). This largely explains the more frequent use of positive categories than negative ones by both newspapers, reflecting the demands and expectations of the prevailing ‘public mood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439820">Milne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> and <italic>Arab News </italic>also used more words from the ‘Revolution’ category than any other category, although with less intensity. <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> used words from the ‘Chaos’ category more than any other newspaper studied. This perhaps reflects the fear within the Israeli government of the political implications and potentially disastrous results of the unrest in neighbouring Egypt, which was confirmed by the daily comments made by the Israeli officials during the period studied. <italic>Arab News </italic>avoided the usage of words from the ‘Human rights’ and ‘Corruption’ categories until the relatively later stages when Mubarak’s government had officially recognized to some degree the protesters’ allegations of the existence of widespread corruption and human rights violations. <italic>China Daily</italic>, on the other hand, despite using ‘Revolution’ words more frequently, totally avoided using words from either the ‘Human rights’ or ‘Corruption’ categories, with one exception. Their clear avoidance of these words may be related to two factors, the first being the government’s policy on avoiding human rights and reforming issues. The second is its strong relationship with Mubarak’s regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>). <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic>,<italic> Arab News </italic>and<italic> China Daily</italic> truly reflect the mirror analogy discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439820">Tuchman (1978</xref>), with each newspaper’s coverage reflecting the prevailing national policy under which they operate.</p>
<p>Lastly, although <italic>Al Ahram</italic> used more ‘Revolution’ words overall, it frequently used ‘Chaos’ words to discredit the protesters and their demands. Moreover, its gradually increasing usage of ‘Revolution’ words, as well as its clear avoidance of ‘Corruption’ and ‘Human rights’ words during the initial days are clearly related to changes in the government’s political stance during the period. After four days of protests and as Mubarak announced the dismissal of the cabinet due to huge corruption and human rights violations, these two word categories got more attention in <italic>Al Ahram </italic>stories. Furthermore, closer to the end of the protests, particularly during the last three days when more concessions were being announced by the Egyptian government, <italic>Al Ahram</italic> surprisingly stopped using ‘Chaos’ words; their largest usage of ‘Revolution’ words occurred on the day that followed Mubarak’s resignation – 12 February. One strong explanation for <italic>Al Ahram</italic>’s stance during the initial days is its focus during this period on emphasizing the chaotic side of the protests and portraying the protesters as deviants, while at the same time delegitimizing their demands and justifying the police’s brutality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439820">McLeod and Hertog, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>How well did the newspapers perform?</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439820">Figure 1</xref> shows a graphic representation of the six newspapers in terms of two factors: coverage orientation (<italic>x</italic>-axis) and coverage intensity (<italic>y</italic>-axis). This figure was drawn using the data collected for all parameters except the social media. The notes under the figure show the adjustments made to the data to guarantee an equal representation of each parameter, while also accounting for the differences in the page size of these different publications. With regard to coverage orientation, <italic>Al Ahram</italic> seems to have provided significant pro-government oriented coverage compared to the other newspapers in the study, followed by <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic>, <italic>China Daily</italic> and <italic>Arab News</italic>, with only minor differences between the three. This largely confirms Fang’s (2001) conclusions about the role of national policies in determining coverage of international events. With the exception of <italic>Al Ahram</italic>, which is already an Egypt-based newspaper, all of the other newspapers were published in countries that had very strong diplomatic and economic relations with the Egyptian government, and this strongly influenced how these newspapers treated the news about the Egyptian protests (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall comparison based on intensity and orientation of coverage. <italic>Notes:</italic> Equal weights were given to each of the story and word counts (in order to account for the differences in the magnitude) on the <italic>y</italic>-axis (coverage intensity). The values on this axis were: <italic>Al Ahram</italic>: 126.9, <italic>Arab News</italic>: 41.3, <italic>China Daily</italic>: 13.3, <italic>Guardian International</italic>: 88.8, <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>: 89.3 and <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic>: 91.9. Equal weights were given to each of the citation and keyword counts on the <italic>x</italic>-axis (coverage orientation). The values on this axis were: <italic>Al Ahram</italic>: 61.0, <italic>Arab News</italic>: 16.0, <italic>China Daily</italic>: 20.5, <italic>Guardian International</italic>: 134.0, <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>: 123.5 and <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic>: 24.5. ‘Chaos’ values were tripled as a negative category in order to match them with the other three positive categories, whereas citations of foreign officials and media were ignored due to their neutral nature.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the far right of the figure, <italic>Guardian International </italic>and<italic> International Herald Tribune </italic>appear to have provided the most pro-democracy oriented coverage in this sample, with very small variation. Both newspapers were also very close in terms of coverage intensity, reflecting the high similarity between the different western journalistic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>). In terms of the coverage intensity of the other four newspapers, the place of each newspaper on this axis seems to resemble the geographic locations of the countries in which these institutions operate. The closer the newspaper’s country is to Egypt the more coverage intensity we find, with the Egypt-based <italic>Al Ahram</italic> having the highest intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439820">Mueller, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Were there any shifts in positions?</title>
<p>In its coverage of the news on the resignation of Mubarak and the falling of his regime, <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> claimed that Egypt’s media had shifted their position towards the protesters in a story entitled ‘Without Mubarak, Egypt state TV switches sides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512439820">Hyde, 2011</xref>: 3). The article stated that ‘During the 18-day uprising, state TV and pro-Mubarak newspapers portrayed the hundreds of thousands of protesters as a minority of troublemakers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512439820">Hyde, 2011</xref>: 3). The article added that, in reference to <italic>Al Ahram</italic>, ‘It remains unclear at what point editorial policy changed, but the dramatic shift was apparent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512439820">Hyde, 2011</xref>: 3). Although it is hard to completely capture signs of any shifts in the position – or tune – of any news outlet within such a short period (18 days), the different parameters employed in this study give us an overall picture of how that may have happened. <italic>Guardian International</italic>, <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>,<italic> China Daily </italic>and <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> appear to have provided consistent coverage, regardless of the existence of any clear bias towards any party. However, there appear to be some signs of change in the coverage of both <italic>Arab News</italic> and <italic>Al Ahram</italic>. With regard to <italic>Arab News</italic>, a close examination of its coverage reveals that it significantly favoured the Egyptian government’s side during the early days, before moving towards providing more balanced reporting in line with the rapid changes in the political scene. This conclusion is mainly backed by the trends revealed in previous sections, especially with regard to the people cited and the keywords used in the stories. It is also confirmed by tracing the change in headlines from its first day of coverage, with front page headlines such as ‘Police break up new protests in Cairo’, ‘King condemns Egypt violence’ and ‘States exploiting Egypt protest’. At later stages, however, the newspaper moved towards using more pro-opposition front page headlines such as ‘No takers for Mubarak’s new carrot’ and ‘Euphoria as Mubarak quits’. This could also be confirmed by a study of the photos published on the protests, however this is outside the scope of this particular study.</p>
<p>
<italic>Al Ahram</italic> followed a very similar pattern to <italic>Arab News</italic>, only with more aggressive coverage of the protesters during the initial days. Some of the front page headlines used were ‘Demonstrations and disorder continue and looting acts spread around the country in the absence of security’, ‘Charges of illegal assembly, resisting arrest and destruction of properties directed towards rioters’ and ‘Demonstrations continue and security forces are committed to restraint’. Nevertheless, the front page headlines used during the later stages such as ‘A new era in Egypt’ and ‘Public hunt of corruption and corrupters continues’, were completely the opposite. Furthermore, some of the words and terms used to describe the pro-democracy protesters and the government supporters were very dissimilar. Words such as ‘responsible youth’ and ‘patriotic youth’ were frequently used to describe Mubarak’s supporters even up to the last moments, while the protesters were referred to many times as ‘rioters’ and ‘immature youth’. Moreover, although significantly bigger in size than their rivals, the word ‘thousands’ was usually used to refer to the number of participants in the pro-democracy protests, while the word ‘millions’ was more often used to describe the participation in the pro-Mubarak protests, although this changed in the later stages. In addition to all of these factors, we find that our discussion in the previous sections regarding the orientations of people cited in the stories and the usage of different keywords confirms to a large extent the idea that <italic>Al Ahram</italic>’s editorial policy shifted during the period studied. Although the potential shifts of <italic>Arab News </italic>and<italic> Al Ahram</italic> appear to have happened at different points, they are likely to have been triggered by similar dramatic changes in the national political consensus, especially after the dismissal of the cabinet and the reorganization of the ruling party in Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512439820">Cushion, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439820">Hallin, 1984</xref>).</p>

<title>Interaction of mainstream and social media</title>
<p>A vital role was played by the social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook, in igniting the first spark of the Egyptian uprising. It also played a major role in mobilizing the masses and influencing the mainstream media’s coverage of the revolutionary events. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table16-1748048512439820">Table 5</xref> shows the number of stories published in each of the six newspapers on the Egyptian protests that included direct quotations from the social media. Four out of the six newspapers studied had used at least one quote from Twitter or Facebook. The people quoted varied from western officials to opposition leaders to even ordinary ‘tweeters’. Although the overall number of quotes is quite small compared to the number of stories and words published each day, some of these quotes were newsworthy in terms of source and content. For example, <italic>Arab News</italic> quoted the US State Department’s spokesman stating in a Twitter message ‘The Egyptian government can’t reshuffle the deck and then stand pat, President Mubarak’s words pledging reform must be followed by action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048512439820">Werner, 2011</xref>: 3). Furthermore, Wael Ghonim’s ‘mission accomplished’ ‘tweet’ was heavily quoted by many newspapers and news agencies due to his leading and significant role in the uprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048512439820">Fahim, 2011</xref>: 4). However, the generally low reliance on social websites as sources of information (considering the important role they played in the revolution) may be explained by the fact that access to the main leaders of the different parties involved was relatively easy, especially with the coexistence of reporters on the ground who favoured conventional methods of reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512439820">Jha, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>In regard to the number of times that words linked to ‘Social media’ were used in different stories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1748048512439820">Tables 4a</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table15-1748048512439820">4f</xref>), we can see that these words were used more frequently in the first half of the period studied than the second half in all six newspapers. This may be largely related to the huge role played by social media during the first half in mobilizing and organizing the protests. Protesters used the social websites to spread the word about what was happening and to announce their next moves to their colleagues around Egypt. These were virtually the main communication methods between the protesters, and mainstream media journalists had to follow them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048512439820">Rojecki, 2002</xref>). Overall, a level of interaction between the two types of media, mainstream and social, seems to have existed but to a lower degree than expected based on the major role played by social media on the ground.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study examined the coverage of the 2011 protests in Egypt provided by six newspapers. The study found that both the intensity and objectivity of the coverage provided by all of the newspapers studied were largely influenced, although in varying degrees, by the government policies and diplomatic relations of the countries in which these newspapers operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512439820">Cottle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512439820">Fang, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439820">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439820">Hallin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439820">Milne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439820">Tuchman, 1978</xref>). Moreover, the study also confirmed findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439820">McCarthy et al. (1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512439820">Gitlin (1980</xref>) on the role of prevailing themes and media attention cycles in determining the type and intensity of coverage provided, especially in the case of <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic> and <italic>Guardian International</italic>. Additionally, the study found that in their attempt to delegitimize the protesters and their demands, some of the newspapers studied (mainly <italic>Al Ahram</italic>) frequently cited pro-government representatives and repeatedly used several negative keywords in order to portray the protesters negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439820">Brasted, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439820">McLeod and Hertog, 1992</xref>). An overall comparison between the six newspapers revealed that geographic proximity to the place in which the events took place was a major factor in determining the intensity of coverage provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439820">Mueller, 1997</xref>). It also confirmed previous findings about the wide similarity between western journalistic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439820">Peng, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In regard to the argument about the potential shifts in position by some newspapers, the study found that the coverage provided by <italic>Arab News</italic> and <italic>Al Ahram</italic> showed some changes in tune, from being more pro-government to more pro-democracy. However, it is argued that this shift was not very significant, which is partly due to the short period during which events took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512439820">Cushion, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439820">Hallin, 1984</xref>). The other newspapers studied were relatively consistent. With regard to the interaction between mainstream media and social media, the study found that the journalists from the six newspapers clearly preferred to rely on conventional sources rather than social websites for their news, which may have been due to easy access to conventional sources in this case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512439820">Jha, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the study revealed that some significant quotes from these websites were used in several stories, implying that the newsworthiness of the different stories found on these websites may have also played a role in this matter. Future studies should look more deeply at the interaction between social and mainstream media and possible shifts that can occur in the perspectives of the news outlets during the reporting of different events. Further studies of the same event could include television news and other types of social media to supplement the understanding of the whole process.</p>
