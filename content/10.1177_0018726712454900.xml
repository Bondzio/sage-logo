<abstract>
<p>While prior research suggests that the cognitive changes triggered by cross-cultural experiences can enhance an individual’s creative-thinking abilities, this is yet to be verified through empirical field research. We draw on schema theory, and the principle of psychological dissonance experienced during cultural adaptation, to argue that expatriates undergo wholesale cognitive changes that can lead to enhanced creative-thinking abilities. We test this hypothesis by measuring changes in the creative-thinking abilities of a sample of expatriates over the first 12 months of their placement. When compared with a control group of non-expatriates, the expatriates showed significant increases in overall creative-thinking abilities and cognitive flexibility, although not originality, elaboration, or ideational fluency.</p>

<p>The ongoing process of globalization continues to dismantle barriers that previously separated cultures, and in the process has created societies and organizations brimming with people from different cultural backgrounds. Research into the culturally diverse nature of organizations has tended to emphasize the advantages and challenges of ‘managing’ a workforce or team comprising members from diverse backgrounds (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726712454900">Tran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726712454900">Van Laer and Janssens, 2011</xref>), while often overlooking the multiple forms of diversity that exist within individual workers. A growing literature stream has begun to highlight the benefit to organizations (and individuals) of the unique perspectives, knowledge, and abilities of bi- and multi-cultural staff, and of staff with diverse cross-cultural experiences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712454900">Benet-Martínez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712454900">Tadmor and Tetlock, 2006</xref>). For organizations, attracting, developing and retaining such employees may be critical to success in a globalized, knowledge economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712454900">Harvey and Moeller, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At the forefront of this phenomenon are multinational organizations from the corporate, government, and non-government sectors. As well as comprising staff and leaders from diverse cultural backgrounds, these organizations play an active role in global ‘brain circulation’ through recruiting and expatriating staff to and from different parts of the world, and so are increasingly staffed by individuals possessing a breadth of cross-cultural experiences, languages and identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712454900">Taylor and Osland, 2003</xref>). Within this context, there is a need to understand how these individuals have been shaped by their multicultural experiences, and how latent capabilities that emerge from these experiences might be utilized (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726712454900">Osland et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we examine the hypothesis that the processes of cognitive change that expatriates undergo whilst adapting to a new culture can lead to them becoming more creative thinkers. Expatriates, defined as people who spend a period of time living and working in a foreign country, confront myriad novel, ambiguous, and challenging situations that disrupt their habitual routines. In response, they are forced to internalize a series of cognitive adjustments as a means of coping in the new environment. These adjustments can include fundamental reshaping of how they see the world, resulting in changes that are permanent – even transformational (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726712454900">Osland, 2001</xref>). One outcome of these, we suggest, is the loosening of one-dimensional routines and attitudes, and the creation of a more flexible, more creative mindset.</p>
<p>The article contains three sections. Firstly, we review extant literature and outline the theoretical basis for the study. From this, the study’s hypotheses are drawn. Next, we detail the research methods and findings of the study. Finally, the results are discussed in relation to their practical and theoretical implications for organizations and expatriates alike.</p>

<title>Creativity and creative development</title>
<p>Creativity, defined broadly as the ability to produce ideas that are both novel and relevant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712454900">Amabile, 1996</xref>), has been called ‘the ultimate economic resource’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712454900">Florida, 2004</xref>: xiii). It is the cornerstone of knowledge creation and innovation, and is increasingly recognized as critical to the long-term success of individual careers, firms, and even nations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712454900">Benedek et al., 2006</xref>). While research has begun to unearth a range of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes that can contribute towards individual creativity, central among these are the various <italic>creative-thinking abilities</italic> – cognitive processing abilities that enable the individual to produce creative ideas (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726712454900">Ward et al., 1999</xref>). Unlike convergent thinking, which focuses on identifying single solutions to problems, creative thinking produces multiple and varied responses. It is central to creativity; indeed, most tests measuring individual creativity are, in fact, creative-thinking tests (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712454900">Runco, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, creative thinkers are those who possess four related abilities that are critical to creativity in any domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712454900">Guilford, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726712454900">Torrance, 1966</xref>). Firstly, their cognitive structures allow them to produce a large number of ideas that are relevant to the requirements of the problem or task at hand. This <italic>ideational fluency</italic> involves the efficient and rapid retrieval of information and ideas from within one’s cognitive frameworks, the generation of logical possibilities or alternatives, and the application of these to new situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712454900">Guilford, 1967b</xref>). Such abilities are frequently the focus of structured ‘creativity’ training interventions through the teaching of creative heuristics like brainstorming or ‘what if’ scenarios (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712454900">Benedek et al., 2006</xref>). Secondly, creative individuals are able to produce ideas that are uncommon, unexpected, or unusual (<italic>originality</italic>). This originality is generally operationalized as the production of ideas that are rare (i.e., statistically less common than the norm; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726712454900">Torrance, 1966</xref>), and thus relates to the <italic>quality</italic> of ideas being developed, rather than the quantity. Thirdly, creative individuals also have the ability to embellish their ideas with detail and complexity. This <italic>elaboration</italic> is important in developing the quality of an idea from its often vague and generalized origins to a more useable ‘finished product.’ As such, it involves developing and communicating the operational specifications and implications that can contribute to both the originality and relevance of an idea by making it more easily understood, or more readily accepted by users. Finally, creative people are cognitively flexible. <italic>Cognitive flexibility</italic> involves being able to re-frame problems or examine situations in different ways. It assists creative output by enabling the individual to overcome mental blockages or ‘functional fixidity’ through avoiding well-used patterns of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712454900">Smith and Blankenship, 1991</xref>), and so results in a variety of possible interpretations that cover a problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>In combination, these four components: cognitive flexibility, ideational fluency, elaboration, and originality, are the building blocks of creative thinking. They enable cognitive pathways to be explored and information to be processed in ways that provide the ‘something extra’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712454900">Amabile, 1996</xref>: 87) that distinguish technically competent responses from truly creative ones.</p>
<p>While studies have reported that formal teaching interventions can increase particular creative-thinking abilities in adults (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726712454900">Puccio et al., 2006</xref>), only recently have researchers begun examining whether creative-thinking abilities can be developed ‘informally’, outside structured training interventions. The core of this has been work undertaken by Leung, Maddux and colleagues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712454900">Leung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712454900">Maddux and Galinsky, 2009</xref>). Working primarily with students, they have conducted a barrage of cross-sectional studies examining the impact of simulated and (past) authentic multicultural experiences on subjects’ creative output on particular problem-solving and/or divergent-thinking tasks. While these studies are limited to correlational methods or temporary experimental manipulations, they consistently report an association between prior experience living abroad and more creative responses. However, although this impressive line of investigation has demonstrated an association between cross-cultural experiences and greater creativity, and via the experimental work suggests causal linkages under certain conditions, research to date has relied on cross-sectional studies in controlled laboratory settings. Accordingly, the relationship between one’s cross-cultural experience and creative-thinking abilities remains unconfirmed by real-world tests.</p>

<title>Expatriation and cultural adaptation</title>
<p>While ‘corporate’ expatriates within multinational firms remain the focus of expatriate researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712454900">Bonache et al., 2001</xref>), a broader view of expatriation is emerging, in recognition that expatriates in the government and non-government sectors are equally critical to the success of their organizations, and confront similar challenges and opportunities to those in the corporate sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712454900">Lambell et al., 2008</xref>). One such challenge faced by all expatriates is that of adapting to the host culture. Researchers have documented a range of individual antecedents as well as work and non-work environmental inputs that can influence cultural adaptation outcomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712454900">Bhaskar-Shrinivas et al., 2005</xref>). Theoretical approaches to understanding cultural adaptation are premised on equilibrium models, which view it as a process triggered by the need to achieve harmony between individuals’ perceptual frames of reference, their behavior, and their socio-cultural environments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712454900">Ward et al., 2001</xref>). From this perspective, adaptation is a response to the cognitive tension accompanying the psychological ‘imbalance’ created by the new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726712454900">Torbiörn, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>One line of research examining adaptation patterns and consequences focuses on the psychological troughs and peaks that expatriates experience when adjusting to a new culture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712454900">Berry, 2006</xref>). These temporal models show that adaptation first requires a breakdown of existing mental maps, a process caused by the stripping away of familiar touchstones and reference points that normally guide behavior and identity. This is followed by a period of cognitive transformation during which expatriates reconfigure their cognitive frames of reference in order to develop the wherewithal to cope in the new surroundings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712454900">Kim, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The psychological outcomes of cultural adaptation are double-edged, involving both short-term pain, like anxiety, stress, and frustration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726712454900">Oberg, 1960</xref>), and long-term gain – for instance, improved cultural-awareness and problem-solving skills (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712454900">Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712454900">Kim, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712454900">Doidge (2008</xref>: 299) calls living in a foreign culture ‘an unending, brutal workout for the adult brain’ that forces wholesale cognitive rewiring and promotes new neural connections. In the following section we outline a tentative theoretical framework that links these cognitive changes to the processes of cultural adaptation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018726712454900">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Our cognitive schemas provide the template through which we view the world and process information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0018726712454900">Weick et al., 2004</xref>). These ‘mental maps’, developed through experiences in our home culture, lack the interpretive ballast to handle the demanding situations encountered in a new cultural environment, where misunderstandings, misattributions, and mistakes are common experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726712454900">Selmer, 2005</xref>). These experiences activate two processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712454900">Kim, 2001</xref>): one of deculturation (relinquishing and adjusting aspects of one’s existing cognitive databank), and another of acculturation (building new schemas by taking on elements of the new culture). We propose that each contributes in different ways to individual creative-thinking abilities. Below we outline our basis for this, together with related hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section5-0018726712454900">
<title>Deculturation</title>
<p>In the early stages of being in a new culture, expatriates’ perceptions are dictated by home-culture mental maps, which operate within a limited range of habitual cognitive frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726712454900">Weick, 1979</xref>). While effective in the ‘equilibrium’ of a single culture, these schemas are inadequate to process situations in the new cultural surrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712454900">Shaw, 1990</xref>). Thus, a common response to the disorientation of a new culture is to surrender out-dated, one-dimensional routines and processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712454900">Adler, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712454900">Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712454900">Kim, 2001</xref>). While some home-culture scripts may be retained, or even affirmed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712454900">Bond and Yang, 1982</xref>), in general ethnocentric schemas, which are least flexible and integrated (i.e. rigid, one-dimensional), are most readily relinquished because they provide the least value in the host culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712454900">Endicott et al., 2003</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712454900">Kim (2003</xref>: 261) refers to this process as ‘unlearning … old cultural habits’. By way of example, an American expatriate posted to India will quickly learn that rigid, one-dimensional ways of interpreting communication cues (e.g. nodding one’s head always means ‘yes’), or resolving interpersonal conflict (e.g. discussing a problem is always the best solution), are unlikely to succeed and so must, at least temporarily, be abandoned.</p>
<p>Surrendering habitual schemas leads to short-term pain through loss of confidence and identity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712454900">Ward et al., 2001</xref>). However, it forces expatriates to confront the possibility that multiple interpretations exist, and thus to broaden the range of schemas they activate. In order to understand situations and make attributions, they must explore new connections between categories of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712454900">Leung and Chiu, 2008</xref>). The result, we suggest, is that expatriates process situations more flexibly, and become adept at recognizing multiple meanings, resolving internal discrepancies, and bringing competing ideas together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712454900">Smith and Blankenship, 1991</xref>). Cognitively flexible people have low levels of functional fixedness, and so are able to apply knowledge in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712454900">Plucker and Runco, 1999</xref>). The most extreme outcome of this, achieved by truly bi- or multi-cultural individuals, is the flexibility to frame-switch between perspectives effortlessly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712454900">Hong et al., 2000</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesize that:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Expatriates undertaking expatriate assignments will show a significant increase in cognitive flexibility, when compared with non-expatriates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second consequence of the deculturation process is that expatriates can no longer rely on instinctive information processing. Researchers have long recognized the constraints of subconscious, habitual perception to the production of creative responses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712454900">Ford, 1996</xref>). This is particularly common in the familiar surrounds of one’s own culture, where environmental cues can be recognized, processed, and categorized with great speed and efficiency using existing schemas. In contrast, behavioral episodes that cannot be categorized automatically must be processed in a more active or mindful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712454900">Louis and Sutton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712454900">Shaw, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726712454900">Thomas and Inkson (2003</xref>: 40) refer to this as ‘switching off (one’s) cultural cruise control.’ While active information processing requires effort and energy, it stifles habitual thought patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712454900">Louis and Sutton, 1991</xref>). Less constrained by initial conventional responses, expatriates develop the ability to suspend judgment and move more fluidly to alternative ‘hypothesis’ responses rather than ineffective, habitual responses. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712454900">Koestler (1963</xref>: 333) notes in his classic treatise of creativity, ‘The mind in labor is liberated from the tyranny of rigid, over-precise schemata: it is enabled to unlearn and acquire … a greater fluidity of thought.’ This ideational fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712454900">Mednick, 1962</xref>) is critical to creative problem-solving because it enables the production of an array of (potential) alternative options. Thus, our second hypothesis is:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Expatriates undertaking expatriate assignments will show a significant increase in ideational fluency, when compared with non-expatriates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One prominent set of home-culture mental maps that undergo transformation relate to the verbal and non-verbal codes through which we communicate. Communicating across cultural boundaries is ‘at the heart of cross-cultural adaptation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712454900">Kim, 1988</xref>: 59). It requires developing shared meaning with others whose cognitive frames may differ sharply from one’s own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712454900">Gudykunst and Kim, 1992</xref>). In the absence of shared assumptions and intent, effective cross-cultural communication – irrespective of the common language/s being used – necessitates great cognitive attention to the encoding and decoding of messages during interactions, and adjustments to the way in which messages are transmitted and received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712454900">Kassis-Henderson, 2005</xref>). This includes surrendering the use of ‘restricted’ (or shorthand) communication, which enables efficient in-group communication, for the use of more ‘elaborated codes’ that require greater planning and explicitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712454900">Bernstein, 1966</xref>). For instance, articulatory clues, both verbal and non-verbal, must be expanded, and vocabulary and syntactic selection more highly elaborated. Among the approaches commonly used are supplementing verbal with non-verbal cues, communicating intentions behind a message, using signposting and labeling language more frequently, and being attuned to specific feedback (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712454900">Comfort and Franklin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712454900">Kassis-Henderson, 2005</xref>). This use of stronger elaboration codes in cross-cultural interactions may be especially high among expatriates from individualistic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712454900">Gudykunst and Kim, 2003</xref>), who seek greater verbal clarity from communication.</p>
<p>The relationship between language and cognition, while contested, has a long history (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712454900">Sapir, 1985</xref>). It is generally agreed that repeated communication patterns have a strong influence on cognition in a range of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712454900">Conway and Schaller, 2007</xref>), a view supported via recent experimental studies using brain imaging technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712454900">Franklin et al., 2008</xref>). Elaboration, while the least studied of the four creative-thinking abilities, is seen primarily as a communication ability that involves giving ‘flesh and skin to the skeleton (of an idea) by adding detailed information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712454900">Guilford, 1967a</xref>: 104). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726712454900">Torrance (1967)</xref> is one who has argued that encouraging the use of verbal elaboration skills can help learners to develop elaboration abilities necessary to support creative thinking. For these reasons, on balance, we hypothesize:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Expatriates undertaking expatriate assignments will show a significant increase in elaboration, when compared with non-expatriates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section6-0018726712454900">
<title>Acculturation</title>
<p>As well as forcing changes to the composition and use of one’s existing schema, the adaptation process requires expatriates to create new cognitive frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712454900">Kim, 2001</xref>). This occurs later in the adaptation process, as the expatriate begins to recognize and value differences within the new culture, and to integrate these with their current worldview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712454900">Adler, 1975</xref>). Several authors have argued that the diverse range of people, ideas, and problems that expatriates confront are conducive to developing original ideas (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712454900">Leung and Chiu, 2008</xref>), and cross-sectional studies with expatriates and immigrants have shown that as they acculturate they develop new schemas that integrate different worldviews (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712454900">Kim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712454900">Tadmor and Tetlock, 2006</xref>). In other words, rather than simply assimilating host-culture approaches within existing schemas, the process of integrating the new experiences causes fundamental changes to expatriates’ cognitive structures. This is, in effect, a process of forced learning that is provoked by the new socio-cultural milieu; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712454900">Berns (2008</xref>: 199) notes, ‘(t)he brain is lazy’:<disp-quote>
<p>It only changes when it has to. And the conditions that consistently force the brain to rewire itself are when it confronts something novel.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In general, this schema creation (acculturation) and integration is only possible once the expatriate recognizes the limitations of home-culture scripts. At this stage, novel stimuli from the environment are acknowledged as being useful, and so noticed and retained, rather than screened out by perceptual biases that may be present earlier in the adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712454900">Black and Mendenhall, 1991</xref>). Once integrated, we argue, these new schemas provide the foundation to enable expatriates to produce original responses that capitalize on both home- and host-culture frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726712454900">Rothenberg, 1976</xref>). Such ideas may include extensions or adaptations of either home- or host-culture perspectives, or ‘hybrid’ responses or analogies that are original in their own right and which spring from combining the two perspectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712454900">Lynton and Thøgersen (2006</xref>: 172, 179), for instance, have recently reported that expatriates working with Chinese host-culture nationals began to change their ‘analytical thought patterns’ and develop ‘new cognitive styles’ that incorporate eastern and western patterns of thought. This integration of different perspectives enables the production of ideas that are unique, and thus our fourth hypothesis is:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Expatriates undertaking expatriate assignments will show a significant increase in originality, when compared with non-expatriates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Collectively, the arguments and research presented above suggest that cultural adaptation can lead expatriates to develop the four building blocks of creative thinking. Thus we expect that, ceteris paribus, these changes would lead to an improvement in expatriates’ overall creative-thinking abilities. For this reason, our final hypothesis is:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Expatriates undertaking expatriate assignments will show a significant increase in overall creative-thinking abilities, when compared with non-expatriates.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To examine these hypotheses, our study employed a pretest–post-test longitudinal panel design with two non-equivalent groups: a group of expatriates, and a ‘control’ group of non-expatriates. All participants were native speakers of English. Data were collected via a commonly used psychometric test administered at pre-departure (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>1</sub>) and again 12 months later (<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>) – a duration deemed sufficient to prevent the practice effect or pre-test sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712454900">Gay, 1996</xref>). Because random allocation to groups was not possible, statistical methods were used to control for any inter-group differences at pre-departure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712454900">Gay, 1996</xref>). Four additional variables that research suggests may moderate the effect of expatriation on creativity were controlled for:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Age</italic>: While creative-thinking abilities are generally believed to remain stable in adulthood, research shows that cognitive maturation or decline can alter creative performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712454900">Jaquish and Ripple, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726712454900">Torrance, 1968</xref>);</p></list-item>

<title>Sample and procedures</title>
<sec id="section9-0018726712454900">
<title>Expatriate group</title>
<p>The purposive sample comprises a rarely studied sub-sector of the expatriate community – professionals working in international aid and development, hereafter referred to as expatriate development professionals (EDPs). EDPs are highly skilled, professional expatriates working in the ‘third sector’ of NGOs and operating within communities in least developed countries. They work in a range of professions, notably health, education, and governance, although increasingly in business and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712454900">Cook and Jackson, 2006</xref>). The objectives of EDPs are linked to the broader landscape of international development, which aims to help individuals, organizations and communities become self-reliant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726712454900">Remenyi, 2004</xref>). In our study, EDPs were recruited through <italic>Australian Volunteers International</italic> (AVI), a not-for-profit organization that has managed almost 8000 self-initiated EDP placements over a 50-year period.</p>
<p>Three theoretical factors determined this choice of sample. Firstly, a number of researchers have called for the use of expatriate samples beyond the ‘headquarters-to-subsidiary management transfer’ paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712454900">Harvey and Moeller, 2009</xref>: 279), and which better reflect the multifarious reality of contemporary global workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712454900">Inkson et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, unlike many corporate expatriates, the objective of the EDPs’ role focuses on the development of the organization (and community) with which they work, rather than their own personal development. This was important because research has shown that expatriates assigned for ‘professional development’ reasons are more likely to report personal change than those expatriated for other reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726712454900">Shay and Baack, 2004</xref>). Thirdly, while their placements were managed by AVI, all participants were employed in, and reported to, a diverse number of host-culture organizations and communities in a total of 18 different countries. Consequently, the sample enabled the study to control for extraneous influences from the immediate work environment, thus enhancing generalizability.</p>
<p>The expatriate group comprised a diverse sample of 86 Australian and New Zealand EDPs. Subjects came from a variety of professions, including managers, consultants, accountants, lawyers, doctors, social workers, educators, and IT experts; 38 percent were male, while 94 percent held formal post-school qualifications. Subjects’ age at pre-departure ranged from 20 to 68 years (mean = 41.5, SD = 13.3). The expatriates undertook assignments in 18 different countries in Asia (e.g. Timor Leste, China, Indonesia, Thailand), the Pacific (e.g. Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Solomon Islands), and Africa (e.g. Malawi, Swaziland, South Africa). Just over three-quarters (76%) had previous international work experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018726712454900">
<title>Control group</title>
<p>Sampling criteria for the control group included two conditions: (a) undertaking full-time work in domestic settings, and (b) attending the pre-departure briefing. The latter was considered important to remove the potential that the briefing would influence the dependent variable. The control group of 20 professionals comprised volunteers who were unable to accept their assignment owing to circumstances beyond their control (no work visa, deterioration of security in the host country, family health), as well as current and former AVI staff who had attended the same briefing as part of their orientation to the organization. Like the expatriate group, they came from a variety of professions. Ages ranged from 27 to 68 years (mean = 37.6, SD = 9.6). Males comprised 45 percent of this group, while 80 percent held formal post-school qualifications. Seventy percent had prior international work experience.</p>

<sec id="section11-0018726712454900">
<title>Sample attrition</title>
<p>In longitudinal research, participant withdrawal can reduce the sample size and confound the measurement of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712454900">de Vaus, 2002</xref>). While steps were taken to limit attrition (e.g. seeking alternative contact details), several participants were forced to or chose to withdraw during the study. The final sample comprised 54 expatriates and 15 non-expatriates, representing an overall attrition rate of 35 percent. The major contributor to attrition of expatriates was political or military upheaval in host countries (one-third of all withdrawing expatriates). For others, the most common explanations were early return (i.e. placement ‘failure’ or illness), unreliable communication in the host country, or too busy. The rate of attrition compares favorably with other longitudinal studies, even in domestic contexts, where withdrawal rates above 50 percent have been reported (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712454900">Hechanova-Alampay et al., 2002</xref>). The final sample sizes were sufficiently large for statistical purposes. They meet the minimum suggested for ‘natural experiment’ studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712454900">Gay, 1996</xref>), are comparable with other recent longitudinal studies of expatriates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712454900">Suutari and Brewster, 2003</xref>), and were as large as was possible, or likely possible, under constrained ‘real-world’ circumstances, obtained through the cooperation of AVI. Independent <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed no significant differences between the two samples on main demographic variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712454900">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>All instruments, and the protocols involved in administering them, were administered in the English language, and were pilot tested with postgraduate students (<italic>n</italic> = 48) prior to being used.</p>
<sec id="section13-0018726712454900">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>While at least 250 instruments exist that aim or claim to provide objective measures of creative-thinking abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712454900">Cropley, 2000</xref>), this study used an identical before-and-after psychometric test of creative-thinking ability, the highly regarded <italic>Torrance Test of Creative Thinking</italic> (TTCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726712454900">Torrance, 1966</xref>). An abbreviated form of the TTCT developed specifically for adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712454900">Goff and Torrance, 2002</xref>), the <italic>Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults</italic> (ATTA), was used. The test measures all four cognitive abilities associated with creative thinking in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712454900">Goff and Torrance, 2002</xref>): ideational fluency, originality, cognitive flexibility and elaboration, as well as a range of creativity indicators, like resistance to premature closure, and conceptual incongruity. The subjects’ responses are coded using detailed guidelines to produce a numeric score for each sub-scale, and an overall creativity index. Results have been shown to be fair in terms of race and gender across language, socioeconomic and cultural boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712454900">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726712454900">Torrance, 1987</xref>). For instance, originality scores are those that are statistically infrequent based on responses drawn across different cultural and socio-economic groups, and so results are not distorted by culturally <italic>different</italic>, rather than truly original, responses.</p>
<p>Multiple studies and meta-studies across a 40-year period have demonstrated the test’s predictive and concurrent validity, internal consistency, and inter-rater and test–retest reliability (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712454900">Cramond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712454900">Goff and Torrance, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712454900">Kabanoff and Bottger, 1991</xref>). Importantly, the test does not discriminate creativity in one field from another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712454900">Hocevar, 1981</xref>). This was a critical determinant because our hypotheses relate to generic creative-thinking abilities, rather than domain-specific knowledge and behavioral skills. Earlier studies have shown that the creative requirement of a work role can influence creative output in relation to the specific work domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726712454900">Unsworth et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, a domain-neutral test like the ATTA was able to capture most directly the type of (cognitive) changes being hypothesized.</p>
<p>The ATTA comes with detailed protocols to ensure administration is standardized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712454900">Goff and Torrance, 2002</xref>), including verbatim instructions and time limits. These protocols were used to administer the test at pre-departure briefings (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>). Most participants were still on assignment at <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, and so all post-tests, including the control groups’, used independent administrators. Participants were posted a separate sealed envelope containing a copy of the test booklet, the written administration protocols and specific instructions, and asked to give the envelope to an independent person to administer the test. Participants were aware of this requirement prior to agreeing to participate in the study. All administrators completed and signed a form confirming their role in administering the test, and returned the tests to the researchers. On these forms, all administrators confirmed that no problems were experienced.</p>
<p>Professional expert coders, blind to the hypotheses, were contracted to score completed tests. These trained and experienced coders were employed by Scholastic Testing Service in the United States, the firm which produces and oversees the administration of the TTCT/ATTA tests globally. All test responses were coded for anonymity prior to being scored. Subjects’ scores in the cognitive flexibility (Hypothesis 1), ideational fluency (Hypothesis 2), elaboration (Hypothesis 3), and originality (Hypothesis 4) sub-scales, as well as overall Creativity Index (Hypothesis 5), were used as dependent variables in hypothesis testing. In line with the hypotheses, the Creativity Index used to test Hypothesis 5 is not independent of the measures for Hypotheses 1–4; rather, it is a composite measure that includes cognitive flexibility, ideational fluency, elaboration, and originality as sub-scales.</p>

<sec id="section14-0018726712454900">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>A brief survey administered at pre-departure collected basic demographic and employment data, including age (in years) and previous international experience (duration in years). Subjects’ occupation was categorized using the internationally recognized Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712454900">ABS/SNZ, 2006</xref>). As a measure of <italic>role transition</italic>, subjects were asked ‘What is your current or most recent position (job title and role)?’. This was then compared with the position and work role that the subject undertook during the study period (‘What is your position over the next 12 months (job title and role)?’). Using the ANZSCO classifications, responses were coded according to whether subjects’ placement involved a change of role (e.g. from a technical role to a teaching or managerial role), or whether it was unchanged (0 = no change; 1 = change).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726712454900">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Comparison with withdrawing participants</title>
<p>A series of post-hoc one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted on pre-departure scores for all dependent variables. These compared: (a) participants withdrawing from the study (<italic>n</italic> = 37) with those completing both data waves (<italic>n</italic> = 69), irrespective of the reason for withdrawal or the group (i.e. expatriate/control); (b) expatriates forced to withdraw owing to evacuation (<italic>n</italic> = 14) with those who withdrew for other or unspecified reasons (<italic>n</italic> = 18); and (c) (i) expatriates completing the study (<italic>n</italic> = 54), (ii) expatriates who withdrew (<italic>n</italic> = 32), (iii) control group members completing the study (<italic>n</italic> = 15), and (iv) control group members who withdrew (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Normality tests on each group of data were satisfactory. No significant differences were found between subjects completing final tests and those who withdrew.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0018726712454900">3</xref></sup> The final sample was therefore deemed representative of the initial sample for the purposes of the subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Hypotheses testing</title>
<p>Testing the hypotheses involved comparing pre-test to post-test changes in the two groups’ scores on each of the dependent variables: cognitive flexibility (Hypothesis 1), ideational fluency (Hypothesis 2), elaboration (Hypothesis 3), originality (Hypothesis 4), and creativity index (Hypothesis 5).</p>
<p>First, a series of separate split plot analysis of variance tests (SPANOVA) were performed for each dependent variable using a single within-subject factor of time (pre/post), and a single between-subject grouping factor (expatriate/control). The SPANOVA method is a variation of the parametric statistical procedure, analysis of variance, which tests differences between groups of people, and is commonly used in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712454900">Cronbach, 1957</xref>). By enabling both between-group and repeat-measures variables in the analysis, it can measure and compare the impact of an ‘intervention’ on different groups over the period of time. The method controls for any differences between the two groups’ scores at pre-departure, and so overcomes problems associated with subjects not being randomly allocated to groups.</p>
<p>In all analyses, the tests of between-subject effects were non-significant, indicating no direct effect of variables on the ATTA scores themselves. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712454900">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the SPANOVA analyses, reporting the effects of covariates and the expatriate intervention on the <italic>change</italic> in scores of each dependent variable.</p>

<p>As the Table shows, after controlling for moderating variables, a significant positive effect in respect of the expatriate assignment over time was found for cognitive flexibility (<italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 5.45, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and the creativity index (<italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 6.09, <italic>p</italic> = .01). Using the <italic>F</italic>-ratios to calculate an effect size in the form of a Pearson correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic>, the expatriate assignment intervention represents moderate effect sizes of .28 and .30, respectively. However, the interaction effects for ideational fluency (<italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = .52, <italic>p</italic> = .47, <italic>r</italic> = .09), elaboration (<italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = .29, <italic>p</italic> = .59, <italic>r</italic> = .07), and originality (<italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = .20, <italic>r</italic> = .16) were not significant. Thus, the SPANOVA analyses give support to Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 5 only.</p>
<p>Next, in order to triangulate results, dependent means <italic>t</italic>-tests examined whether the change in the expatriate group’s scores were, in their own right, statistically significant (i.e., regardless of changes in the control group’s scores). Again, the results showed that the expatriates’ pre-post scores increased significantly for both cognitive flexibility (<italic>t</italic>(53) = 4.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 2-tailed) and the creativity index (<italic>t</italic>(53) = 3.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 2-tailed), but not originality (<italic>t</italic>(53) = .16, <italic>p</italic> = .87, 2-tailed). However, the <italic>t</italic>-test did show a significant rise in expatriates’ pre-post ideational fluency scores (<italic>t</italic>(53) = 2.13, <italic>p</italic> = .03, 2-tailed), while the rise in elaboration was significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1 level (<italic>t</italic>(53) = −1.87, <italic>p</italic> = .07, 2-tailed). Using an equation described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726712454900">Rosenthal (1991)</xref>, the increase in expatriates’ scores represent moderate to strong effects of <italic>r</italic> = .49 (creativity index), <italic>r</italic> = .48 (cognitive flexibility), <italic>r</italic> = .28 (ideational fluency), and <italic>r</italic> = .25 (elaboration). The changes in the control group’s scores were non-significant for all tests.</p>
<p>Collectively, the results unanimously support Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 5 (significant increases in cognitive flexibility and overall creative thinking). However, contrary to our predictions, expatriates did not show an increase in originality (Hypothesis 4). While expatriates’ ideational fluency and elaboration levels rose across the study period, this increase was not significant when compared to the changes in the control group’s score, and so there is insufficient evidence to support Hypothesis 2 or Hypothesis 3 (significant increases in ideational fluency and elaboration, respectively).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This longitudinal field study examined whether, and to what extent, an expatriate assignment could contribute positively toward expatriates’ creative-thinking abilities (as measured by pretest–post-test changes in scores of the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults). The results show that expatriates, in general, increased their overall creative-thinking abilities (Hypothesis 5), and that the major – indeed, the sole significant – contributor to this was an increase in cognitive flexibility (Hypothesis 1). Both these increases were statistically significant in their own right (i.e. pretest–post-test comparison), and when compared with a control group of non-expatriates. However, the belief that an expatriate assignment can contribute significantly to the other building blocks of creative thinking is unsupported. In short, our data show that, rather than expatriation contributing to the full range of abilities that can make an individual a better creative thinker, its effect occurs primarily through enhanced cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>The effect sizes for the increase in cognitive flexibility and overall creative thinking were moderate to strong, ranging from <italic>r</italic> = .28 to .49. To our knowledge, no longitudinal panel studies have previously quantified ‘natural’ changes in creative-thinking abilities. However, evaluations of formal training interventions – often criticized for producing post-measures that are inflated by confirmation bias, ‘training to criterion’, and demand characteristics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726712454900">Parloff and Handlon, 1964</xref>) – have been conducted. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726712454900">Scott et al. (2004)</xref> carried out a meta-analysis of 70 pretest–post-test studies reporting the impact of a variety of different creativity training programs. While different measures were used, making cross-study comparisons difficult, the authors report that for studies utilizing subjects over the age of 14, the average overall effect size was Δ = .59 (SE = .13). In a meta-analysis of 46 studies that all used the TTCT to measure the impact of creativity training, most with school-aged subjects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726712454900">Rose and Lin (1984)</xref> found that formal training accounted for 22 percent of the variance in performance. Both these averages represent effect sizes not dissimilar to the current study. Other longitudinal panel studies using the TTCT to measure the impact of structured training interventions with adults have reported calculable effect sizes ranging from .37 to .42 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712454900">Clapham, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712454900">Goff, 1992</xref>). In summary, the effects we observed on cognitive flexibility and overall creative thinking are not dissimilar to those achieved by structured creativity training initiatives.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the theoretical model described above, the results suggest that it is the <italic>deculturation</italic> stage of adaptation, during which the expatriate struggles to achieve equilibrium by challenging and manipulating existing schemas, that has the major impact on expatriates’ creative development, rather than the schema-building process of <italic>acculturation</italic>. On this point, the results give tentative support for the phased framework of cognitive change that we introduce. Hypotheses 1–4 relate chronologically to phases of adaptation, and the change occurring ‘earliest’ in the adaptation process showed the strongest effect (Hypothesis 1 – cognitive flexibility), with mixed support for Hypothesis 2 (fluency) and Hypothesis 3 (elaboration), and none for Hypothesis 4 (originality). Thus, one explanation for the absence of support for Hypothesis 4 is that the benefits of the acculturation stage to one’s originality may take longer than the time allowed in our study. While most researchers suggest that sojourners adapt fully within the first 12 months (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726712454900">Ward et al., 2001</xref>), it is possible that the subjects had not adapted sufficiently to integrate the cultural learning fully in ways that facilitated responses that were original or fully elaborated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712454900">Bhaskar-Shrinivas et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, full integration may require a form of post-adjustment that might not take place until after repatriation to the home country. If this is the case, study periods longer than the current 12-month duration and/or which capture post-repatriation data may be required for any originality gains to be apparent.</p>
<p>On a related issue, while the average pre-departure scores of all five dependent variables were higher for subjects with prior international experience than those with no prior experience, these differences were not significant. In other words, prior international experience did not predict pre-departure scores on any of the five scales we report for either group, or for the full sample. Therefore, it is possible that the benefits from acculturation may, in fact, be reversed as the individual re-acculturates to the home culture. Alternatively, it may be that the creative-thinking abilities developed during the prior international assignments may not have been activated recently and so remained dormant at pre-departure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712454900">Shaw, 1990</xref>); activating these may have required a form of cognitive priming (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712454900">Hong et al., 2000</xref>). Given this finding, we suggest that further longitudinal studies tracking repatriates after their return from an international assignment might be fruitful.</p>
<sec id="section19-0018726712454900">
<title>Theoretical implications and limitations</title>
<p>While earlier studies have shown a correlation and suggested links between expatriation and changes in creative-thinking ability, the empirical results presented here provide tentative support for this research, which until now has been confined to laboratory-based, cross-sectional designs. Moreover, while longitudinal studies have been used to understand elements of the expatriate experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712454900">Suutari and Brewster, 2003</xref>), such studies are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712454900">Harrison et al., 2004</xref>), and there exists a notable absence of studies employing pretest–post-test panel designs, despite these being the most conclusive measure of intra-individual change across time. Thus, this study provides arguably the most direct empirical test to date of the expatriate-creativity hypothesis. In doing so, we believe that the findings provide some welcome nuance. It has long been claimed, and often assumed, that cross-cultural experiences make expatriates more creative. While our results support this, they do suggest that a more accurate link might exist between the challenges of deculturation and cognitive flexibility, which is recognized as the creative-thinking ability most sensitive to experience and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726712454900">Runco and Charles, 1997</xref>). Given that cognitive flexibility is a skill frequently associated with global leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726712454900">Osland et al., 2006</xref>), the findings offer support for the effectiveness of expatriate assignments for developing valuable capabilities. At the same time, the results challenge two existing assumptions within expatriate research: firstly, that creative-thinking ability is an issue of expatriate <italic>selection</italic> rather than development (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712454900">Harvey and Novicevic, 2002</xref>), and, secondly, that fundamental personal change is confined to expatriates on <italic>developmental</italic> assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726712454900">Shay and Baack, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Before addressing the practical implications of the findings, several caveats should be considered in interpreting the results. The TTCT/ATTA, while the most widely used and validated test of creativity, measures creative-thinking <italic>ability</italic>, rather than creative output. As discussed earlier, this was an important determinant in our choosing to use it. However, while the ATTA’s predictive validity is strong (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712454900">Plucker, 1999</xref>), the relationship between the expatriates’ enhanced cognitive flexibility and their work output is unclear. Secondly, we theorize that the changes we observed emerge from the expatriates’ adjustment to their new cultural environment. However, culture operates at multiple levels, and so <italic>which</italic> cultural environment remains unclear. The expatriates crossed multiple cultural boundaries, including organization, profession, level of development, and nation, and while the variety of national and organizational settings of the sample help control for many extraneous variables, the influence of factors like leadership style or the workplace environment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726712454900">Wang and Rode, 2010</xref>) cannot be discounted. Similarly, while we controlled for a range of variables shown to moderate creative-thinking abilities, other personal and acquired antecedents like personality, motivations, learning orientation, or cultural upbringing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712454900">Caligiuri, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712454900">Leung and Chiu, 2008</xref>) may have influenced the effects noticed. Thus, we suggest that the study be viewed as an initial investigation that should be followed by a more fine-grained analysis of the impact of various antecedents and environments.</p>
<p>An additional issue concerns the extent to which the results might be generalized beyond the sample. The comparisons with withdrawing subjects suggest that the expatriates were representative of the experimentally accessible sample. The expatriates’ demographic characteristics are also typical of other empirical studies within AVI (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712454900">Brook et al., 2007</xref>), and in similar agencies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726712454900">Peace Corps, 2011</xref>), suggesting sound ‘population validity.’ The generalizability to the broader expatriate community is likely constrained by two factors. Firstly, as outlined above, the purpose of the EDP’s role is organizational development. Given research suggesting that expatriates with objectives linked to their professional development report greater personal change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726712454900">Shay and Baack, 2004</xref>), it may be that the changes are even more pronounced in this group. Secondly, EDPs generally relocate across large cultural distances, and so the different cultural milieu may provide a ‘blow to the head’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712454900">Gregersen et al., 1998</xref>: 28) that reshapes their cognitive frames in different ways to the more modest cultural chasm traversed by some expatriates. Future studies might consider including a third comparison group: expatriates undertaking a less ‘extreme’ form of expatriate assignment. Having said that, distinctions between the EDPs and ‘mainstream’ expatriates should not be overstated; for instance, like other expatriates, the motivations of EDPs are complex, and frequently include career development outcomes, even if their roles do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712454900">Hustinx and Lammertyn, 2003</xref>). Like corporate expatriates, they also make up a pool of skilled globally mobile workers that are highly sought after by knowledge-intensive organizations from all sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712454900">Cook and Jackson, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The study’s results are likely of interest to both individual expatriates and the organizations that recruit and support them. While organizations often use expatriate assignments to develop human capital (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712454900">Dickmann and Doherty, 2008</xref>), limited research has measured or examined cognitive changes experienced by expatriates. The objective, quantifiable changes reported here, therefore, provide some initial empirical evidence that may make expatriate assignments more attractive to individuals wishing to enhance their creative-thinking abilities, and thus reduce the extent to which firms rely on financial incentives to encourage staff to expatriate.</p>
<p>The issue of how organizations might refine their expatriate management processes to support the growth in creative-thinking abilities of expatriates could extend to all stages of the expatriate lifecycle. For instance, while cross-cultural training programs have limited influence on adjustment patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712454900">Hechanova et al., 2003</xref>), pre-departure training that raises expatriates’ awareness of existing cognitive frameworks and the role that these play during adaptation, or that teaches processes for observing and integrating relevant new ideas, may facilitate or expedite the development of ideational fluency, elaboration, and/or originality capabilities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712454900">Boyacigiller et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, firms may design repatriation procedures and/or follow-up placements that recognize and exploit the cognitive flexibility of their staff as a way to retain both the expatriate and the creative dividends that they accrue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712454900">Amabile and Khaire, 2008</xref>). The findings also raise questions for the ways in which organizations might structure expatriate assignments. For instance, do short-term postings contribute sufficiently to the deculturation process to influence cognitive flexibility, or is a minimum duration required? How might firms replicate the ‘benefits’ of expatriation in domestic contexts through, for example, the use of cross-cultural teams, or environments that temporarily simulate uncertainty in ways that can challenge employees’ habitual schemas? And what might individual expatriates or organizations do to limit or prevent any amortization of creative-thinking abilities after repatriation?</p>
<p>Conversely, some firms or individuals may be more concerned with the short-term instability created by cognitive changes, rather than the potential benefits. Research of corporate, mainly managerial, expatriate development has tended to focus on incremental learning outcomes that are role- and organization-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712454900">Harvey and Novicevic, 2006</xref>), and organizations using expatriates to perform control functions may view significant cognitive changes as (potentially) contributing to agency costs, repatriation turnover, or even placement failure. Consequently, the value of the assignment to the expatriates’ development must be tempered against contextual and organizational factors. While this is a legitimate concern, even those individuals or firms not seeking professional development would be wise to understand, and where necessary plan for, the cognitive changes that expatriates may undergo.</p>
