<p>We are pleased to announce that the SAGE Track site is now officially open to article submissions. <italic>Journal of Building Physics</italic> (<italic>JEN</italic>): the URL for the site is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jen">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jen</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Authors can now begin submitting to the site. All authors will need to register with the system first to submit an article. We will begin to phase the current submission process out. The article submission guidelines on the <italic>JEN</italic> homepage will be changed shortly so that authors are instructed to submit new articles to the online submission site. When an article is submitted to the site, the editor is notified by email. Editor will be able to log in to the site and begin processing the article by selecting and inviting reviewers.</p>
<p><italic>JEN</italic> is the internal name of this journal because we had the building enclosure in the previous title. Yet, it is still a journal about enclosure (envelope in Canada), energy, and environment so the name <italic>JEN</italic> is appropriate. Please be careful in typing “JEN” because Scholar One has also journals with acronyms JAN, JCN, and so on.</p>
<p>SAGE Corporation also instituted a website called “editor’s choice collection” where a few selected articles per year (since 2007 on) are placed for your access. They can be accessed directly through the link <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jen.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/editorchoice">http://jen.sagepub.com/cgi/collection/editorchoice</ext-link>, or accessed from the last issue of the journal on the SAGE website. While the best papers from sponsored conferences are expanded and published in this journal, the International Association of Building Physics is also thinking about electronic publication of other conference papers. This journal will keep you informed through the editorial section.</p>
<p>The automatic upload has some advantages: it will eliminate the need for a paper copy and marking the date of original submission, reviewers will be able to read and upload reviews directly to the website, and the editor will notify the authors about acceptance or rejection of their submission by sending a letter from the central computer. Yet, all computer systems also have a dark side. I have often been frustrated when the website told me, “your password should have minimum 8 characters, one alphanumeric character but no marks like @#&amp; etc.” Often when you type it and try to access the account, the response of the system appears “either name or password” does not match our records. Therefore, be careful about selecting your name, and the system will be able to change the password. One more comment, if you are a frustrated reviewer and the system is slow to respond, you can always send the review directly to me using two e-mails: <italic><email>mark.bomberg@gmail.com</email></italic> and to <italic><email>mark.bomberg@ymail.com</email></italic>. The two e-mails are necessary because thee-mail of Google works everywhere, except in China, where I teach.</p>
<p>The reorganization of the journal includes also the Editorial Board, and a new generation of young researchers from the established universities are replacing the older members or joining for the first time. They will be introduced in the next two issues.</p>

<p>Dr Hans Janssen is an Associate Professor at the Building Physics Section of the Department of Civil Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium. Since his appointment in October 2011, he has been teaching building physics and hygrothermal performance, and researches moisture transfer in building materials. Hans Janssen earned his MSc degree in civil engineering at KU Leuven in 1997, based on his master’s project “Thermal performance of highly insulated wood frame walls,” performed in collaboration with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway. The four Erasmus months spent in Trondheim revolved solely around his master’s thesis activities, an experience that unveiled his fascination for research. In response, he embarked on a PhD project at the Laboratory for Building Physics of KU Leuven, to successfully defend his PhD thesis “The influence of soil moisture transfer on building heat loss via the ground” in 2002. After a year-long traveling break, he returned to the Laboratory for Building Physics of KU Leuven in 2003, for a postdoctoral project on “Moisture transfer in brick masonry.”</p>
<p>In 2006, he was appointed Assistant Professor at the Section of Building Physics and Services at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark. His primary lecturing responsibilities revolved around heat and mass transfer in buildings, and his key research focused on moisture transfer in building materials. In 2008, he became Associate Professor at the Section of Building Physics and Services at DTU, to return to the Building Physics Section at KU Leuven in 2011.</p>
<p>Hans Janssen’s research centers on moisture transfer in porous materials in general, and on physical models and numerical tools in particular, for the correct description and the efficient simulation of moisture transfer phenomena, respectively. His research activities have to date resulted in 21 articles in international journals and 42 articles in conference proceedings, some of which have been honored with “best paper” and “best presentation” awards.</p>

<p>Dr Mario A Medina, PhD, PE, is Associate Professor in the Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering Department at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, in the United States.</p>
<p>He also has an appointment in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He joined the faculty in 1998. Dr Medina holds a PhD in mechanical engineering with a specialization in building thermal sciences. He has extensive experience in the modeling and experimentation of building enclosure systems. His research involves the development and experimental verification of thermodynamic and heat transfer models used to study building energy dynamics as a result of enhanced insulation systems and the thermal performance of building mechanical systems.</p>
<p>He has published over 50 technical articles in the area of building energy efficiency alone. He has written over 100 reports detailing energy conservation procedures from assessments in industrial manufacturing plants. He received an “Outstanding Service Award” from the Office of Industrial Technologies of the US Department of Energy (DOE) for work related to promoting energy conservation. Dr Medina has been involved in the experimentation and simulation of the performance of insulation systems since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to highlight that the April 2013 issue of <italic>JEN</italic> expands the best articles of young researchers from the 2012 conference of building physics, and they are being <bold>presented by the chairman of the IABP Conference Professor Shuichi Hokoi, acting as a guest editor of this journal issue</bold>.</p>
<p>We intend to continue a similar pattern in all future conferences that are cosponsored either by the International Association of Building Physics or this journal.</p>
