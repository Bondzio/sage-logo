<p><italic>Media Nations</italic> is an exploratory attempt to build bridges between the academic study of nationalism and mass communication. It focuses on investigating the role of the media in ‘manufacturing national identity and inclusion’ (p. 2). At 220 pages (including the index), this book is an ambitious project covering the mass media in relation to globalization, modernity, nationhood, war, gender, national concepts of time, cultural diversity and cosmopolitanism. For each topic, Mihelj provides at least one case study. For example, how does ‘time’ relate to the media and nation building? An historical analysis of the evolution of the Chinese national calendar, from the late Qing Dynasty period to the post-Mao era, reveals close relationships between the concepts of ‘time’ (here national calendars) and national imagination, national narrative, visions of modernity and accompanying media events. Mihelj provides examples of specific Chinese calendar entries:
<disp-quote>
<p>May Day (1 May) was aimed at celebrating the achievements of the working classes worldwide, the Youth Festival (4 May) was centred on the Chinese youth as the symbol of the country’s Communist future, the Army’s Day (1 August) was designed to commemorate the founding of the first armed uprising to the Nationalist Party government in 1927, and National Day (1 October) was dedicated to the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949. (p. 152)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For readers of <italic>Discourse &amp; Society</italic>, this book is of particular interest because Mihelj brings two fields of academic inquiry – nationalism studies and media and communication studies – into conversation. Mihelj also presents research at the boundaries of text-based discourse analysis, cultural analysis and the sociological investigation of the impact of media institutions. On top of this, the comparative-historical analysis adopted throughout the book crystallizes the understanding of ‘nationhood’ and its historical evolution.</p>
<p><italic>Media Nations</italic> requires a reasonable amount of effort from the reader to work out the connections between chapters. The reader sometimes has to go through pages of discussion to realize a shift in topic has occurred. It can be hard to follow how the current discussion relates to the previous concept. Readers would appreciate, for instance, a bit more foreshadowing in the shift from the discussion of <italic>Volksgemeinschaft</italic> (people’s community) under Nazi rule in Germany to the new principles of media operation (pp. 64–65). The first two chapters of the book are slightly over-dense, but provide an informative theoretical grounding in nationalism, media and communication studies. They are also rich and comprehensive in case studies. Readers do not have to wait long to see a broad range of case studies and examples, such as the advent of digital broadcasting satellites and their effect on media ownership in India; the adaptation and localization of global genres in Hong Kong soap opera; and the multinational and multilingual media systems of Switzerland and Belgium. In the remaining chapters, case studies are used to analyse various genres or modes of expression, related to media and national identities, inclusion and exclusion.</p>
<p>Soap opera is a frequently discussed genre throughout the book. The case study of a Hong Kong soap opera <italic>Love Talks</italic> (1999) provides a snapshot, in the context of globalization, of how the marriage between traditional Chinese values, media policies, restrictions and the marketing strategies of multinational media agencies produces media hybrids (e.g. a Chinese Cinderella). Mihelj argues that ‘the plot (of <italic>Love Talks</italic>) is driven by traditional Chinese notions of fate and love, but it is at the same time organized around the central contest between tradition and modernity’ (p. 41). The example of the first Indian soap opera <italic>Hum Log</italic> (<italic>We the People</italic>, 1984–1985) provides an analysis of the ‘televisual portraits of womanhood’ in India (p. 134). It illustrates the role that mass media plays in the negotiation of the ideal of Indian femininity and masculinity.</p>
<p>The newspaper is another form of publication and mass communication discussed in <italic>Media Nations</italic>. The example of <italic>The Chicago Defender</italic>, ‘Chicago’s foremost African-American newspaper’, shows how ‘minority media can in fact themselves contribute to the formation of more integrative and inclusive public spheres and identities’ (p. 174).</p>
<p>Do these case studies from all over the globe provide sufficient empirical evidence to posit an argument about the relationship between nationalism and the mass media? Do the case studies presented offer the possibility of a broader generalization? Do they have a systematic or qualitative method of analysis? Perhaps the answer to these questions is no, and Mihelj herself is well aware of these weaknesses. After all, ‘such generalization was not really the aim’ and ‘the character of <italic>Media Nations</italic> is largely exploratory’, writes the author (p. 8). With profound discussions of theory and concepts in two wide-ranging disciplines, nationalism and media studies, and abundant case studies, <italic>Media Nations</italic> has certainly achieved its aim of bridging the gap between these two areas. Each case study presented in the book opens a new window for discourse analysts, media and communication researchers, and advanced media students to explore and take the journey further.</p>
