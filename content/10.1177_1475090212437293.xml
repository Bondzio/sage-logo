<abstract>
<p>A prime concern of maritime transport is to enhance ship safety and to reduce marine pollution related to ship incidents and accidents. Since the elimination of marine accidents is practically unrealistic, a reasonable target for the maritime industry and relevant regulatory bodies is the mitigation of accidents in terms of minimization of the probability of occurrence and of the associated consequences. The present study focuses on a comprehensive analysis of recorded accidents on medium and large oil tankers (deadweight over 20,000 t), which occurred after the introduction of the Oil Pollution Act (USA, 1990) up to the present. Raw casualty data were reviewed and re-analysed in order to produce appropriate statistics useful for the implementation of risk-based assessment methodologies. The main outcome of this particular study is the identification of the significant qualitative historical trends of tanker accidents and of the quantitative characteristics of particular tanker accidents, such as the overall frequencies of accidents per ship year, the frequency of each major accident category and per tanker ship size, the ship types or designs and ages, the degrees of severity of accidents and the tonnes of oil spilled per ship year.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The main objectives of the present study are identification and quantification of the main hazards that may lead to a tanker’s loss of watertight integrity (LOWI) and consequently cause environmental damage. Within the framework of the POP&amp;C project funded by the European Union (EU),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475090212437293">1</xref></sup> the casualty data for the AFRAMAX class of tankers were systematically analysed and post-processed as necessary for the application of a risk-based methodology regarding pollution prevention and control with respect to tanker accidents.</p>
<p>Further studies beyond those of the POP&amp;C (Pollution Prevention and Control) project were conducted in the framework of another EU-funded project SAFEDOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475090212437293">2</xref></sup> by the National Technical University of Athens, Ship Design Laboratory (NTUA-SDL), in collaboration with Germanischer Lloyd, Hamburg, namely addressing the data for SUEZMAX, VLCC and ULCC tankers; thus the data on almost all large-size tankers were investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475090212437293">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475090212437293"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475090212437293"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475090212437293">6</xref></sup> In order to identify the possible effects of the tanker size on the accident statistics, we complemented these studies recently by the analysis of medium-size tankers, namely in the range 20,000–60,000 t deadweight (DWT); thus the data on HANDYSIZE and HANDYMAX tankers were also investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475090212437293">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comparison of the results for medium tankers with those for large oil tankers enables valuable conclusions to be made regarding the effect of the tanker size on maritime pollution accidents, identification of important trends in the safety of oil transport by tankers and also determination of the accident and pollution rates, as necessary for implementation of risk-based methodologies in tanker design and operation. Finally, the conducted analysis encompasses identification of the most heavily polluted geographical areas worldwide arising from tanker accidents.</p>

<title>Methodology of work</title>
<sec id="section3-1475090212437293">
<title>Field data model</title>
<p>In order to conduct a risk analysis assessment, it is necessary to analyse the available casualty data and to investigate the historical risk as a first step in the process of comprehensive potential risk evaluation.</p>
<p>Historical casualty data were extracted from two commercial databases, namely IHS Fairplay (former Lloyd’s Register Fairplay) and Lloyd’s Maritime Intelligence Unit (LMIU), which are considered the most prominent and complete by today’s standards. Obviously, both above-mentioned databases were originally not designed for potential application in risk assessment procedures; their information is to a great extent available in textual form, whereas details of importance for formal safety assessment (FSA) procedures are missing. Additionally, the particular databases appear incomplete in view of significant under-reporting, as indicated in the FSA on general cargo ships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475090212437293">8</xref></sup> Therefore, their direct usage in engineering risk-based studies appears quite problematic.</p>
<p>In order to overcome the particular problem, a new purposely designed database was developed by NTUA-SDL which enabled further processing towards quantification of detailed event categories and direct extraction of conditional probabilities of identified accident scenarios in terms of frequency and consequence models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475090212437293">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the field data analysis model implemented herein, as applied in the present risk assessment method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475090212437293">9</xref></sup> Casualty records from commercial databases, namely the IHS and LMIU databases, are inserted in the NTUA-SDL database. Each record is reviewed and registered in the appropriate accident category, and information on the complementary texts is post-processed in predefined database fields. As an outcome, the initial probabilities of the main top events in the framework of fault and event tree analyses are calculated as well as the conditional probabilities for each generated scenario. These resulting probabilities are checked against corresponding published data from external sources for verification purposes. Considering the operational fleet at risk, as may be deduced from the above commercial databases, the two main parameters leading to calculation of the risk, for tanker accidents are determined, namely the frequencies of accidents per ship year and the associated consequences in terms of likely number of crew fatalities and spill tonne rates.</p>

<title>Sampling plan</title>
<p>In general, risk modelling starts with identification of all the possible initiating events relevant to the investigated problem. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475090212437293">Figure 2</xref> presents all possible main hazard categories that may lead a ship to be engaged in an undesired top main event (accident), independently of ship type. The particular categorization was firstly introduced within the framework of the EU-funded project POP&amp;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475090212437293">1</xref></sup> and it is adopted in this particular study as well. The definition of each category is as follows:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>machinery failure</italic>: where a technical failure of machinery or a related system affects the vessel’s seaworthiness (note that, when machinery failure leads to grounding (drift grounding), it is accounted for under grounding events);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>failure of hull fittings</italic>: damage to a ship’s hull-fitting equipment and outfitting, affecting the ship’s seaworthiness or efficiency, e.g. deck equipment, vessel propeller, propeller portion or propeller adjoining parts.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The present study focuses on accidents that potentially lead to a ship’s LOWI and to accidental oil pollution; thus only the first six categories of accidents are investigated, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475090212437293">Figure 2</xref> (shaded box).</p>
<p>The particular categorization is part of post-processing data analysis because there are strong deviations from the corresponding categorization in the commercial databases. For example, fire and explosions cases are treated as one category in IHS and LMIU databases and in other data sources. Upon examining the causes and consequences of fire and of explosion accidents, it can be seen that these differ considerably and, because the aim of the analysis is to use this information for risk-based methodologies, it was considered essential to define accurately the first initiating event. Furthermore, the IHS and LMIU databases also have a category called ‘hull and machinery’ which incorporates structural failures, failures of machinery and propulsion devices, and failures of hull and deck fittings, all of which should be rationally examined under separate categories as they are associated with different causes (fault trees) and consequences (event trees).</p>
<p>The present study on tanker accidents is confined to the last two decades, namely it takes into account accidents between 1990 up to October 2009. 1990 is considered a landmark year because of the introduction of the double-hull (DH) tanker concept through the Oil Pollution Act (1990) (OPA 90) in the USA (in the aftermath of the catastrophic <italic>Exxon Valdez</italic> accident in 1989) and its tremendous effect on regulatory developments thereafter. It is believed that this period is quite representative for assessing today’s situation. It is noted that previous studies on the same subject showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of accidents in the post-1990 period, taking into consideration that a series of key regulations that were introduced was found to be related to the significant decrease in the frequency of tanker accidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475090212437293">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study refers to tankers of the following DWT sizes:</p>

<p>ULCC (ultra-large crude carrier) tankers, greater than 320,000 t.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Regarding the main tanker subtypes or subcategories, only categories relevant to oil tankers were considered in the current investigation, namely according to the definition in the IHS database: oil tankers, crude tankers, shuttle tankers, product carriers and chemical and oil tankers. It is noted that ore–bulk–oil carriers, ore–oil carriers and chemical tankers (and the related accidents that may have led to maritime pollution) were excluded from the present analysis, because these tanker subtypes have special design or layout and operational features, which are not representative of the whole class of tankers.</p>
<p>An overview of the analysed sampling plan accounting for non-serious accidents as well as accidents with high degrees of severity is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475090212437293">Table 1</xref>. Note that there is a small difference between the study period for each main category of tanker size, namely the period for medium-size tankers goes up to October 2009, whereas that for the large tankers goes up to October 2008.</p>

<title>Operational fleet at risk</title>
<p>The annual operational fleet at risk is defined as the number of ships that operate in the corresponding period, and it was calculated according to the monthly operation of each vessel based on data from the IHS database. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475090212437293">Figure 3</xref> presents the corresponding fleet of large and medium tankers at risk, together with the annual distributions of the DH fleet and non-DH fleet. It should be noted that the data shown for the operational fleet at risk cover the period until the end of 2010, which is different from the casualty data period analysed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475090212437293">Table 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In terms of the total fleet distributions, both annual fleets are comparable in annual terms as well as with respect to the total values within the studied periods; thus they are fully satisfactory in terms of sampling for the conducted risk analysis:</p>
<list id="list3-1475090212437293" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p><italic>medium tankers</italic> (1990–end of 2010):</p>

<p>total fleet at risk, 32,808 ship years;</p>
<p>DH fleet at risk, 16,498 ship years.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The annual population of DH ships was significantly small in the first few years of the analysis period, namely 1990–1995, but it steadily increased as could be expected because of the gradual enforcement of the requirements of the DH ship concept worldwide (and the corresponding phase-out of single-hull ships), surpassing for the first time the non-DH fleet in the period 2001–2003.</p>

After 1999, the DH fleet started to have a considerable share in the overall operational fleet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475090212437293">Figure 3</xref>). This meant that the newly built ships that entered the operational fleet at the year of the census had enhanced implemented formal International Maritime Orga- nization (IMO) procedures, which were in compliance with stricter rules; they included the enhanced design (DH concept) and their crew underwent enhanced training. Furthermore, the existing fleet at that time had to comply with a series of stricter regulations until their phase-out, so that as a consequence the overall frequency of accidents decreased.</p>

<p>Focusing on the navigational accidents (collision, contact and grounding), both tanker main sizes exhibit reduced frequencies within the studied period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475090212437293">Figure 8</xref>). In practice, after 1999, the annual frequency does not decrease further but starts to oscillate below an upper limit (2.0 × 10<sup>−2</sup>). Apart from the entrance of newly built ships of the DH type, mentioned before, some enhanced safety regulations were introduced and applied to existing (non-DH) ships as well, such as the provisions on routing systems given in the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, European Telecommunications Standards and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, and all this possibly led to the resulting frequency decrease.</p>

<title>DH ships and NASFs</title>
<p>First, the two parameters of NASF risk analysis (frequencies and consequences) are studied in relation to the basic design of ships (DH and non-DH ships). Clearly, the consequence analysis is highly dependent on the ship’s basic design because the DH concept gives a lower probability of non-pollution in scenarios with small hull penetrations in the cargo area. Furthermore, the frequency parameter appears non-highly related to a ship’s basic design in cases of navigational events (collision, contact and grounding) or fire and explosion events. However, in cases of NASF, the frequency parameter may differ significantly depending on the hull type, because the particular event category is highly related to the ship’s internal structure.</p>

<title>Ship’s age and NASF</title>
<p>An overview of the basic hull type of ships involved in cases of NASF is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475090212437293">Figure 13</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Except for the basic hull type, NASF is also strongly related to the ship’s age. However, this relationship is not straightforward, as could be expected, but is rather complicated as shown below.</p>
<p>First, as single-hull ships are inherently of greater age than DH ships are, it is essential to evaluate both ship types on a common age basis during the study period. Considering this and focusing on the NASF by group age, it is found that there is a first peak in the NASF frequencies for DH medium oil tankers in the age group 6–10 years old, and a second peak in the middle age group (16–20 years old), whereas frequencies for more aged DH ships (over 20 years old) are lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1475090212437293">Figure 14</xref>). The latter can be explained by the fact that there are only very few operating DH ships over 20 years old.</p>

</fig>
<p>Comparable results for large oil tankers also show complex (and maybe unexpected) patterns of frequencies, namely high frequencies in the young age group (0–5 years old), and then continuously increasing frequency when they are more than 6–10 years old. In the young age group (0–5 years old) there is a marked structural failure rate for all large ship subsizes, except for VLCC and ULCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475090212437293">Figure 15</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475090212437293">12</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475090212437293-fig15.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The above-identified problems of NASFs for tanker ships of relatively young age (in particular, for large tankers) suggest problems in the quality of recent newly built ships, rather than fatigue-type structural failures. Thus, although we may expect NASF problems to be directly related to ship’s age, this relationship is not straightforward but needs careful investigation of the actual causes of NASFs.</p>

<title>Conclusions and the way ahead</title>
<p>Casualty databases provide significant information and can be considered as very important tools for the safety and environmental performance of the industry. Studying these data, the vulnerability of a design can be determined, leading to guidance of a possible regulatory process in terms of structural and operational profiles. Since the commercial databases are not designed with respect to usage for direct application to different engineering problems, a review and post-processing of data are considered essential for investigation and conclusions in any analysis.</p>
<p>The current study presented results of a systematic analysis of accidents pertaining to medium and large oil tankers (DWT over 20,000 t) and covering the period after the introduction of OPA 90, namely 1990–2009 (October), continuing earlier studies by NTUA-SDL on the design and safety of tankers. The calculated values derived from the statistics must be used with caution because available databases do not consider all accidents (the problem of under-reporting) and provide only a ‘snapshot’ based on a certain observation period. Thus, single accidents may have a significant impact on the accident frequencies and especially on the identified consequences. In order to show the uncertainty of the frequencies presented in this paper a confidence analysis was also presented regarding the main initiating events.</p>
<p>The data in this paper provide the basis for the development of a risk model for medium tankers, which complements studies conducted earlier for large tankers. Such a risk model should consider the uncertainty in the initial accident frequencies as well as in the dependent probabilities in the scenarios. This would allow the effect of uncertainty also to be considered in subsequent analyses, for instance in a cost–benefit analysis of design modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475090212437293">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>An alternative valuable approach, when investigating historical data of this type, has been presented by Kelangath et al.;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475090212437293">14</xref></sup> it introduces the use of data-driven Bayesian modelling in risk analysis and makes a comparison with the different data-driven Bayesian methods possible, which demonstrates some interesting trends hidden in the casualty databases.</p>
<p>Having completed the FSA procedure for large oil tankers earlier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475090212437293">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475090212437293">9</xref></sup> the present study is the first to address systematically the effect of the ship size in the framework of FSA procedures. This is considered essential, particularly when dealing with ship types, where safety performance (here, the safety of the environment) may dramatically change with increase in the ship size. A comparison of the results obtained herein for medium tankers with corresponding results for large oil tankers enabled identification of notable differences in the accident patterns, although overall trends are comparable.</p>
<p>In the next stage of this research, which will be complemented by the analysis of accident data for small tankers (DWT below 20,000 t), the societal risk will be calculated and expressed by frequency–number of fatalities diagrams (denoting the cumulative frequencies of losses of human lives) and frequency–spill size diagrams (denoting the cumulative frequencies of oil pollution in tonnes, i.e. the environmental impact of oil spillage); this will allow even more comprehensive conclusions on the safety of oil transport by all sizes of tankers.</p>
