<abstract>
<p>Industrial tribunals and stakeholders involved in wage hearings are sometimes called upon to consider and weigh contrasting evidence that, due to its technical nature, may be inaccessible to non-specialists. This article investigates the example of two different economic analyses of gender and pay that were submitted to Fair Work Australia as part of an ‘equal remuneration’ case for workers in the social and community services sector. It demonstrates how the different analyses partly reflect the different theoretical approaches to the analysis of labour exchange implicit in the alternative submissions, and investigates the strengths and weaknesses these approaches posed when attempting to explain gendered patterns of pay in the care sector. The article argues that understanding the key assumptions and definitions underlying each type of economic analysis can contribute to an improved comprehension of the different viewpoints on gender pay equity among economists. Of particular importance are: the contrasting approaches to understanding differences between specific jobs and a group of jobs categorized as occupations; the meanings attached to the terms ‘value’ and ‘productivity’; and the distinction between discrimination and undervaluation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612465527" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2010, the Australian Services Union (ASU) initiated an application before Fair Work Australia (FWA), seeking ‘equal remuneration’ for work undertaken by the largely feminized workforce in the Social and Community Services (SACS) sector. Subsequent submissions to FWA addressed the question of whether work undertaken by the affected workers is under-remunerated and, if this is the case, whether this is linked with the sector’s feminized workforce. Two alternative analytical approaches contained in submissions provide a useful case study of contrasting theories and arguments used by economists to analyse gender and pay. These analyses provide insights into the contested nature of economic ideas and should be of interest to the broader academic and policy community engaging with economic evidence on important issues such as gender pay equity. In contexts such as the equal remuneration case, evidence submitted by economists has the capacity to affect significant policy outcomes, with material effects for those involved in funding and working in particular sectors. The importance of understanding economic evidence and the sources of dispute between economists can, thus, be high.</p>
<p>The aims of this article are twofold. The first is practical: to enhance the ability of participants in industrial cases to more fully understand and engage with economic concepts and methods used to analyse gendered patterns of pay. We attempt to achieve this aim by explaining two alternative theoretical approaches to the issue of gender pay equity by economists. The second aim is to identify some of the sources of disagreement that were evident in the economic analyses submitted to the SACS equal remuneration case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612465527"><title>Background and Context of the Case</title>
<p>Section 2.7 of the Fair Work Act 2009 gives FWA the authority to make orders relevant to equal remuneration as follows: ‘FWA may make any order it considers appropriate to ensure that, for employees to whom the order will apply, there will be equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value.’ The specific guidelines for assessing equal remuneration do not require a male comparator or evidence of discrimination to demonstrate the need for an equal remuneration ruling. Instead, ‘the concept of gender-related undervaluation means that inferences can be drawn that a particular type of work is likely to have been undervalued because of gender linked characteristics, without the use of comparators’ (National Pay Equity Coalition and Women’s Electoral Lobby, 2010: 32; quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465527">Baird and Williamson, 2010</xref>: 346). This approach was labelled an ‘indicia approach’ in the FWA decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465527">FWA, 2011a: para. 33</xref>). Indicia refer to indications, signs or ‘circumstances that point to the existence of a given fact as probable, but not certain’ (Legal Dictionary, 2012). The unions’ claims reflected the approach used in an equal remuneration case in Queensland and outlined in a report into pay equity in New South Wales, where indicators of possible undervaluation, rather than male comparators, were used to argue a case for pay equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185612465527"><italic>QSU v QCCI and Others</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612465527">New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, 1998</xref>). The case was therefore conducted in a different manner from ‘comparable worth’ cases, where the skills and work undertaken by women in predominantly feminized occupations, such as secretarial work and nursing, are compared with occupations dominated by male employment, such as car-washing and mechanics (see e.g. references to US cases in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185612465527">England, 1999</xref>). Instead, the unions’ approach identified indicators, establishing a profile that, prima facie, could indicate the possibility of an undervaluation of work based on gender. Such a profile would, according to FWA, include elements such as female domination, female characterization of work, weak unions or few union members, a large component of casual workers, poor access to training or career paths, small workplaces and inadequate recognition of qualifications. In the majority decision, FWA noted that an indicia approach had some limitations and concluded that the list of indicia included in the unions’ application provided ‘no more than a framework for considering whether there is undervaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465527">FWA, 2011a</xref>: para. 249). Thus, while references to specific indicia such as the feminized workforce and history of the sector were included in the decision, comparisons with public sector workers also informed the conclusion about undervaluation in the SACS sector. The minority decision by Vice President Watson was relatively more critical of the indicia approach and of the comparison with public sector wage rates. At this stage, the future use of an indicia approach in equal remuneration cases remains an open question, with the FWA decision providing only qualified acknowledgement for its role in demonstrating undervaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612465527"><title>The Unions’ Contention</title>
<p>The unions’ application, submitted in March 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465527">ASU, 2010</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185612465527">1</xref></sup> was for a wage increase for SACS workers of 30%. Their use of an indicia approach relied on two broad arguments that relate to the indicators listed earlier. First, SACS employees are predominantly women and SACS work is undervalued, having regard to the nature of the work and the skills and responsibilities involved in performing the work. In this regard, the applicant unions stated that 80% of the workforce was female and that ‘industry statistics on remuneration compared to statistics of remuneration generally in the community establish that workers in the industry are low paid workers’, although no specific wage rates were outlined in the contentions. Second, specific historical and institutional factors have contributed to the ongoing undervaluation of work by SACS employees. This set of arguments was developed by addressing each of the indicators outlined earlier, including statements regarding the female characterization of the work, the lack of previous work value cases at a national level, the large number of small employers, the competitive tendering processes used by governments for providing the funds used to pay the wages of SACS employees and the history of wage regulation in the sector. Paragraph 39 in Schedule B of the ASU’s application to FWA made it clear that one part of their strategy was to facilitate the national implementation of gains from a 2009 decision by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185612465527"><italic>QSU v QCCI and Others</italic>, 2009</xref>). This awarded increases of between 18% and 37% for community sector workers, based on indicators of likely or probable undervaluation rather than direct comparators from other occupations or industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465527">Baird and Williamson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While the ASU provided relatively few data to document their contentions in their initial application, evidence on each contention was provided throughout the case and summarized in FWA’s decision. It was noted that the not-for-profit sector is a key provider of services in the SACS sector in Australia. While this has its origins in the development of community services organizations in the 1950s and 1960s, the sector grew strongly in the 1980s and 1990s as governments increasingly introduced contracts for the provision of services in preference to providing services directly through government departments. In the words of the FWA decision, the sector has become more ‘professionalized’ and ‘the line between the not-for-profit sectors and business sector, increasingly blurred’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465527">FWA, 2011a</xref>: 60).</p>
<p>FWA noted that the sector contains more than 6000 organizations, including 2607 employing businesses, which would be affected by an equal remuneration decision. More than 96% of the employing businesses are small or medium, with less than 200 employees. There are an estimated 153,000 employees in the sector with 90% employed by not-for-profit organizations. The majority of employees are women, varying between 76% and 81% of employees depending on which particular occupational group or sub-sector is considered, compared with an Australian average of 47%. Part-time employment represents over half of all employment in the sector compared with 29% nationally. Of total SACS workers, 64% hold a post-school qualification, with many holding tertiary qualifications in an area such as social work and psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465527">FWA, 2011a</xref>). In 2010, the average weekly ordinary full-time earnings (AWOTE) for SACS workers equated to annual incomes ranging from about $30,000 to $36,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612465527">Australian Government, 2010</xref>), as compared to national average earnings of close to $65,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612465527">ABS, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612465527"><title>Contrasting Economic Analyses of Gender, Work and Pay</title>
<p>In the course of the hearings and in the decision handed down on 16 May 2011, submissions by the Australian Industry Group (AIG)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185612465527">2</xref></sup> and the ASU were the focus of a debate on the different economic perspectives on the gender pay gap. Submissions by the AIG and the ASU both addressed the relatively low rate of pay received by employees in the SACS sector, and the question of whether these rates reflected a gender-based undervaluation of the employees’ work. However, they reached opposite conclusions. The AIG submission asserted that insufficient evidence existed to support a claim that the SACS employees’ work was currently undervalued. In contrast, the ASU submission argued that the available evidence indicated that undervaluation was occurring and was significant.</p>
<p>To understand these differences, it is necessary, first, to comprehend the theoretical approach underpinning each analysis. In the AIG submission, orthodox labour economics informed the analysis of the gender pay gap. In this approach, employers and workers are modelled as being involved in contract negotiations over labour services. Employers are assumed to be motivated by the prospect of individual gain and, as such, to offer a price (wage) for the labour service that will reflect the expected extra value of the worker’s contribution to production, usually referred to as the ‘marginal revenue product’. Thus, on the ‘demand side’, this approach relates wage differences between workers to the market value of the commodities they produce and their productiveness. In turn, the market value (price) of commodities is assumed to reflect the social value of the goods and services concerned.</p>
<p>Workers are characterized in the orthodox approach as sellers of labour who are motivated by a desire to maximize their self-interest. As such, they require a price (wage) that at least matches the value of alternative uses of their labour time and will reflect the relative disamenity (including occupational hazards and unsocial hours) involved with the work. This approach links the supply of labour and the ‘reservation wage’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185612465527">3</xref></sup> of workers, which will vary with the value of alternative uses of their time (e.g. increasing when young children are present in the household).</p>
<p>Modifications to the basic orthodox model allow for the possibility that wage outcomes may diverge from marginal revenue product. For example, monopsony power (where there is a single large employer) is predicted to result in wage outcomes that fall below workers’ marginal revenue product, and imperfect information is viewed as reducing workers’ prospects of being adequately compensated for occupational risks. Further extensions of the model introduce the element of discrimination, predicting, for example, that if employers have a ‘taste for discrimination’, then the wage outcomes of affected groups will be pushed lower, at least in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612465527">Becker, 1971</xref>). The influence of organizations such as wage-setting tribunals, employer associations and unions is also commonly recognized. However, typically, organizations are modelled in orthodox analyses only as constraints on the ability of individual employers and workers to negotiate their labour contracts. The basic elements and structure of the model emphasizes a market exchange between individual, rational and maximizing ‘agents’ who act on preferences that are autonomous and stable. The institutional context of labour exchange plays, at most, a peripheral role.</p>
<p>The orthodox approach is based on deductive reasoning, and its simplifying assumptions facilitate its application to a broad range of social and economic contexts. The key differences in orthodox analyses of wage outcomes in different countries or regions, in different time frames, and/or in contrasting institutional contexts is not generally found in the model or underlying assumptions. Largely similar assumptions, theory and models are used in many contexts but with different data. The relevant data are typically obtained through large, national data sets that have been developed to meet the needs of multiple researchers and projects. The analysis typically tests for correlations between specific variables. In such analyses, ‘explanations’ refer to the extent that particular independent variables (such as education or labour market experience) are correlated with particular dependent variables (such as wages). Explanations also explore the extent to which the correlations are robust (consistent) across countries and time.</p>
<p>In contrast, the economic analysis included in the ASU submission was informed by institutional theory, which, as its name suggests, emphasizes the way in which the institutional (cultural, relational and historical) context is fundamental to the determination of wage outcomes. This approach puts institutions at the centre of the analysis, rather than relegating them to the context in which rational, individual decisions are made.</p>
<p>Institutions are defined to include both formal institutions, such as constitutions, laws and regulations, as well as informal institutions, which include social norms and conventions. Both types of institutions are assumed to combine and affect how different types of work are evaluated by participants in the exchange of labour services, their motivations, bargaining power and outside options, and the rules governing the determination of wage rates. Thus, the nature of ‘negotiations’ of labour services – and actual wage outcomes – is predicted to vary with change in the institutional context.</p>
<p>In the institutional approach, employers’ behaviour in wage negotiations is assumed to be influenced by their beliefs about what they <italic>should</italic> pay for particular labour services, in addition to what might be financially viable or attractive. Their beliefs will reflect previous practices and conventions in their industry or workplace context. Workers’ behaviour is assumed to be affected by perceptions about legitimate remuneration for their labour, in addition to concerns about working conditions and financial incentives. Again, these are likely to reflect previous practices and conventions in their workplace context. Actual wage outcomes are also assumed to be affected by formal and informal institutions that influence the bargaining power of the different participants.</p>
<p>Institutions are modelled as shaping each part of the labour exchange. As indicated earlier, social norms about what is a fair or legitimate wage rate for a particular type of work are viewed as affecting the nature of wage demands. Because these norms are assumed to be formed largely with reference to prevailing wage relativities, the historical context of the labour exchange is also important. Informal institutions, such as social norms about the legitimate actions of different groups of individuals in bargaining situations, play a similar role. Importantly, they also influence norms relating to the legitimate and desirable occupation roles of men and women and the legitimate range of wage payments for different roles. Formal institutions (such as the presence or otherwise of a legal right to strike or engage in lockouts) affect the set of actions available to participants in bargaining situations and, subsequently, wage outcomes.</p>
<p>Institutional labour theory does not generally predict that wage differences between individual workers will closely reflect either differences in the value of their productive contribution or the relative amenity of their jobs. The influence of institutions is pervasive, and the potential for ‘undervaluation’ is identified in a range of market institutions, including those that fail to adequately value the commodities produced by different groups of workers; those that affect the motivations and opportunity sets of different groups of employers and workers; and those that influence the distribution and valuation of different types of work.</p>
<p>Analyses undertaken within an institutional framework draw on more diverse methods and data than those typically utilized in studies informed by the orthodox approach. Research may use large national data sets to identify correlations between the characteristics of groups of employees and their earnings. However, this is often the first stage of a larger enquiry into the institutional sources of the patterns in wages. To this end, researchers using an institutional approach often draw on smaller-scale, local projects that take into account specific documentary and qualitative data relevant to explaining particular institutional contexts. They can be both deductive and inductive in their approach; that is, in some case studies informed by institutional theory, the approaches test existing theory or hypotheses, while in others, they build contributions to new theory based on insights from particular case studies or experiences. A key purpose of the institutional approach is to explain why particular economic events or outcomes have occurred, rather than to focus predominantly on correlations between variables. Furthermore, ‘explanation’ typically focuses on causal relationships between particular combinations of social, cultural and historical factors leading to a known outcome (such as low wages). These factors have previously been identified as contributing to low wages among care workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612465527">Briggs et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185612465527"><title>Analyses Submitted to Fair Work Australia</title>
<p>The application of different ‘economic’ viewpoints to explaining the relatively low earnings of SACS employees is demonstrated in economic evidence submitted to FWA. The economic analysis included in the AIG submission was based on two articles involving Professor Deborah Cobb-Clark. The first was a co-authored article with Juan Barón (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark, 2010</xref>) that reported the results of an empirical study of the different average wages received by Australian men and women. Reflecting the orthodox approach to understanding wage determination, this study explored the correlations between the wage outcomes of individuals and a range of worker and job characteristics that were hypothesized to be generally relevant to workers’ productiveness, the value of the commodities produced or the attributes of the jobs that were performed. This study investigated: differences in men’s and women’s average experience in employment (such as tenure with their current employer); demographic characteristics (such as worker age, language background and children); education; and a range of job characteristics (such as industry of employment, contract type, hours of work, union membership, firm size and, for some purposes of the analysis, occupation). A statistical analysis known as ‘decomposition’ enabled the authors to identify whether men’s and women’s different average earnings were correlated with the observed differences in the job, experience, education and demographic characteristics of male and female workers.</p>
<p>A broadly similar analytical procedure featured in the second Cobb-Clark article. This article, co-authored with Michelle Tan (and ultimately published as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465527">Cobb-Clark and Tan, 2011</xref>), addressed the question of whether men’s and women’s non-cognitive skills (defined as their personality traits) influence the occupations in which they are employed and, if so, whether or not this contributes to a disparity in men’s and women’s wages. Variables relating to a range of non-cognitive skills were added to an empirical analysis of the gender pay gap that was similar to the Barón and Cobb-Clark study, on the assumption that these skills also affect worker productiveness and, thus, wage outcomes.</p>
<p>Two findings from these studies were particularly important to the FWA case. The first, reported in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark (2010)</xref> article, was that the different job characteristics (union membership, contract type, part-time work, industry, firm size) of men and women were correlated with differences in wages, and that these largely ‘explained’ the gender pay gap (i.e. the relatively low wages of women) at the lower end of the pay distribution, with the implication, noted by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark, 2010</xref>: 238), that the work of low-wage female employees is not undervalued relative to their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Part of the difference in men’s and women’s earnings was not correlated with the variables analysed by Baron and Cobb-Clark. In keeping with orthodox analysis, this part of the difference in men’s and women’s average earnings was labelled as ‘unexplained’. A second related finding of their analysis was that the ‘unexplained’ portion of the gender pay gap generally <italic>increased</italic> (and the part of gender pay gap accounted for by job characteristics fell) when controls for occupation were included in the decomposition analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark, 2010</xref>: 237). This led the authors to conclude that ‘In the Australian context … in most cases the occupational distribution favours women with respect to wages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark, 2010</xref>: 241).</p>
<p>These particular findings and conclusions may not be immediately obvious to readers who are not familiar with decomposition techniques, so a few words of explanation are added here. When measures of occupation are included in a wage decomposition, we are effectively asking ourselves what the gender wage gap would look like if women’s ‘productive’ characteristics (including occupational distribution) remained the same but they were paid according to the male wage structure. In the Australian literature, it is not uncommon to find that women would be worse off. This effect arises because there are proportionately more women in professional jobs than men. At November 2011, for example, of all women in employment, 24.8% were in professional jobs. The corresponding share for men was 18.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612465527">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The decomposition technique does not account for vertical segregation, however, where men and women are in the same occupational group but men hold the senior positions (e.g. as school principals) and women the lower-level positions (such as teachers). The high importance of vertical segregation and gender pay gaps <italic>within</italic> occupations is, therefore, worth noting. Cobb-Clark and Tan found that virtually all (96.5%) of the total gender pay gap they observed in their study was due to gender pay gaps within occupational categories. If the majority of the gender pay gap occurs within occupations, then changing the pattern of men’s and women’s employment across occupations (by reducing occupational segregation) is unlikely to affect the size of the gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465527">Preston and Whitehouse, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of these findings to the FWA case was high because they implied that the work of women in low-wage sectors, such as the SACS sector, was not undervalued. The evidence was used to argue that women involved would be worse off if they worked in occupations that were less female-dominated.</p>
<p>Subsequent witness statements jointly submitted by the authors of this article, at the request of the ASU, critiqued these conclusions. Part of the critique centred on the methods employed in the Cobb-Clark studies of the gender pay gap. However, other parts of our statements (and a later interchange between the two groups of economists) highlighted the differing theoretical viewpoints of orthodox and institutional labour economists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612465527"><title>Methods Used in the Study of the Gender Pay Gap</title>
<p>Our joint statement (Austen, 2010b) pointed, first, to problems inherent in the measurement of occupation and the impact of these limitations on the analysis of the gender pay gap. The key problem we identified was that of data restrictions, which force analysts to group myriad different jobs into broad occupational groups. Barón and Cobb-Clark’s use of 64 occupational groupings for the entire Australian workforce was particularly detailed. Even so, 64 occupational groupings did not come close to representing the range of actual occupations in the Australian economy and, as a result, each of the measured occupational groups in the study contained a wide range of specific occupations with differing wage outcomes.</p>
<p>We asserted that using broad occupational groupings in a statistical analysis of the gender pay gap will have two key consequences. First, the analysis will not uncover the contribution to the gender pay gap of occupational segregation that occurs within the broad occupational groups. Second, it has the potential to result in misleading statements on the impacts of occupational segregation on gender pay equity.</p>
<p>Our statement used the data produced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465527">Cobb-Clark and Tan (2011)</xref> to illustrate these ideas. Reflecting comments made in the preceding paragraphs, attention was first drawn to Cobb-Clark and Tan’s (2011) finding that virtually all (96.5%) of the total gender pay gap was due to gender pay gaps <italic>within</italic> the 18 occupational categories used in that study, and that these gaps <italic>could not</italic> be explained by the differences in the measured characteristics of men and women working within these broad occupational groups. Our interpretation of this data was that jobs within each broad occupational group are vertically segregated according to gender and that differences in pay between male- and female-dominated occupations at this narrower level are likely to have contributed to the gender pay gap. We put forward the example of the occupational group of Science, Engineering and Other Professionals to illustrate these points. Noting that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465527">Cobb-Clark and Tan’s (2011)</xref> article implies that in this occupational category, women receive lower wages than men – despite having similar educational qualifications, labour market experience, demographic characteristics and non-cognitive skills – our statement observed that this relatively broad occupational category, based on two-digit-level Australian Standard Classification of Occupation codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465527">ABS, 1997)</xref>, includes Science, Building and Engineering Professionals, as well as Health and Social Professionals. We also observed that the first occupational subgroup is likely to comprise mainly men; the latter mainly women. Thus, our statement suggested that a likely explanation for a gender pay gap <italic>within</italic> the broad occupational category is that the wages paid to health and social professionals are, on average, lower than those paid to science, building and engineering professionals for reasons that do not result from measurable differences in the education, experience and other attributes of the two groups of workers. This was cited as evidence in support of the argument that women’s relatively low wages reflect the influence of gender-based undervaluation.</p>
<p>Our statement also used the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark (2010)</xref> data to identify how economic evidence on the impacts of occupational segregation can cause confusion. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465527">Barón and Cobb-Clark’s (2010)</xref> finding that occupational segregation was favourable to women’s relative wage outcomes was shown to have a specific meaning: that, keeping current wage structures constant, the movement of women from <italic>broad</italic> occupational groups where they are currently ‘over-represented’ (such as clerical and sales work and professionals) to those where they are currently ‘under-represented’ (such as labourers and transport and production work) would increase the gender pay gap. Earlier work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465527">Preston and Whitehouse (2004)</xref> reached a similar conclusion, noting that a finding of occupational segregation favouring women arises, in part, from women’s over-representation in professional occupations in education and health. They noted that if women were to have the same occupational patterns as men, it would require that some women in feminized professions move to, for example, trade-based or labouring occupations mostly undertaken by men. Such a shift might lead to an overall fall in women’s earnings and a potential increase in the gender pay gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465527">Preston and Whitehouse, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185612465527">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, the different conclusions of our statements and Cobb-Clark’s statements on the importance of occupational segregation to the gender pay gap highlights the differing results that obtain from examining vertical versus horizontal segregation. Our statement focused on vertical occupational segregation – differences in the allocation of jobs between men and women who work within the same broad occupational group. It emphasized data showing pay gaps <italic>within</italic> these broad occupational groups that could not be explained by the measured characteristics of the men and women involved, and used this data to support a claim that the pay gaps were attributable to the different rates of pay attached to men’s and women’s work within the groups. In contrast, the Cobb-Clark conclusion that occupational segregation did not contribute to the gender pay gap was based on an assessment of the effects of horizontal occupational segregation; the differences in men’s and women’s representation in broad occupational groups; and the differences in men’s and women’s rates of pay in these broad groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612465527"><title>Differing Theoretical Viewpoints on the Meaning of ‘Undervaluation’ and ‘Value’</title>
<p>The different theoretical viewpoints of the economists became more apparent when Cobb-Clark responded to our statement that ‘unexplained’ gender pay gaps within occupational groups demonstrated ‘the importance of the undervaluation of women’s work within narrowly defined occupational categories to the total level of gender inequality in the Australian labour market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612465527">Austen et al., 2010</xref>). In a supplementary statement, Cobb-Clark expressed surprise that Austen, as an economist, could draw such a conclusion. She outlined what she perceived to be the economic approach to the question of whether particular rates of pay reflect the value of the worker’s contribution in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>As an economist the notion of ‘undervaluation’ has a particular meaning which requires comparison of ‘like with like’. Specifically, undervaluation (or discrimination) occurs when equally productive workers are treated differently solely on the basis of their non-productive characteristics such as gender, religion, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, etc. (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612465527">Blau et al., 2010</xref>). Workers’ productivity depends not only on their own characteristics, but also on the nature of the work they do, and the value of the goods and services they provide to others. For this reason, it is difficult to make judgments about undervaluation when we cannot compare workers with the same skills (e.g., educational attainment, field of study, experience, tenure, etc.) doing the same work (e.g., hours, firm size, detailed occupation) …</p>
<p>From an economist’s perspective, the information which is contained within Article 1 [the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465527">Cobb-Clark and Tan (2011)</xref> article showing gender pay gaps within occupations] is not detailed enough to draw conclusions in relation to whether undervaluation is present or whether the differences in wages are due to market conditions … .</p>
<p>From an economist’s perspective, wages should be equal to the value of what you are producing. In addition to an employee’s education and experience which can be broadly categorised as an employee’s ‘skills and labour market experience’, job characteristics like the size of the employing organisation, the industry of employment, casual or part-time employment, union membership as well as the value of the product or service to consumers are all relevant to determining the value of what is being produced. From an economics standpoint … Job characteristics and the value of what is being produced are also relevant to determining value. Furthermore, if you are comparing workers in different jobs it is extremely difficult to assess whether one is undervalued relative to the other. You are not comparing like with like. (Cobb-Clark, 2010a: 4–5)</p></disp-quote>These extracts from the Cobb-Clark witness statement provide a useful summary of the orthodox approach, and complement the outline provided earlier. The perception that there is only <italic>one</italic> economic viewpoint, the orthodox viewpoint, is worth noting. Explanations of gender differences in pay according to this viewpoint reflect either differences in the characteristics of men and women or differences in market conditions affecting the jobs they work in, or both. The extracts also show how, in the orthodox approach, wage outcomes are assumed to reflect ‘the value of what is being produced’. However, the extracts contain several additional insights into how orthodox economists approach the issue of undervaluation. Undervaluation is regarded as equivalent to discrimination, and the standard of proof for undervaluation is set very high, requiring a comparison of like with like. Proving undervaluation is seen as very difficult when ‘you are comparing workers in different jobs’.</p>
<p>These features of the orthodox approach to undervaluation are important; for example, the conflation of discrimination and undervaluation is problematic in a context, such as the ASU case, where discrimination and undervaluation are regarded as distinct issues with potentially different causes and remedies. Additionally, the reluctance to compare remuneration for different <italic>types</italic> of work poses problems when the intention of the relevant legislation is to achieve this. The individualistic perspective of the orthodox approach can be seen to force this outcome. As implied in the earlier description of the approach, a gender-based wage difference across occupations is viewed as being possible only if women (as individuals) are <italic>discriminated</italic> against, and this results in a gendered pattern of wages across occupations. The idea of undervaluation of particular <italic>types of work</italic> (or occupations) cannot be accommodated in this individualistic conceptual framework, as groups of jobs or occupations per se are not an object of value. Moreover, as Cobb-Clark’s testimony shows, if a gender-based pattern of wages across occupations is observed, the suspicion is that ‘unobserved heterogeneity’ in either worker or job characteristics is the culprit; that the analysis at the group level is not comparing ‘like with like’.</p>
<p>In contrast, the institutional analysis conceptualizes wage negotiations as inherently associated with social structures and the roles and power these structures define for specific individuals. Positions, rather than the individuals that occupy them, have power and value, with social norms about the value and status of particular positions affecting the range of wage outcomes available to workers holding them. As a result, in this conceptual framework gender-based undervaluation (in addition to discrimination) is a possibility, linked to inadequate valuation of the occupational roles performed by women; social structures and relationships that bias the allocation of positions within the social structure; and the maldistribution of power.</p>
<p>A further aspect of Cobb-Clark’s statement that is important to note relates to her comment that ‘From an economist’s perspective, wages should be equal to the value of what you are producing’. The ASU’s legal counsel probed the meaning of this statement in her cross-examination of Cobb-Clark during the FWA hearings. She enquired if the statement was a normative statement and Cobb-Clark responded that it was a positive, not a normative, statement:<disp-quote>
<p>Counsel: “That’s a normative statement from an economics perspective, not a statement of necessarily the reality … ?”</p>
<p>Cobb-Clark: “No, it is not a normative statement; it is a positive statement.”</p>
<p>Counsel: “It’s a positive statement?”</p>
<p>Cobb-Clark: “It is a positive statement.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465527">FWA, 2011a</xref>: 5174–5175)</p></disp-quote>Cobb-Clark’s response might be interpreted in different ways. She could be asserting a belief that the (orthodox) economic perspective is that wages do in fact reflect the value of what is being produced. Alternatively, she could be asserting that the (orthodox) economic perspective is that wages should reflect the value of what is being produced. The latter version is closer to the wording of her statement, but it clearly expresses the statement of a norm; it states what should be the case with regards wages and value. The first version is a positive statement. However, this creates something of a paradox because if wages do in fact reflect the value of what is produced, then there is little point in conducting wage cases that consider gender and pay; market forces will ensure that men and women are remunerated according to the value of their contribution unless discrimination exists.</p>
<p>The notion that wages ultimately reflect the value of what is being produced is highly contested terrain in economics (a highly cited account is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465527">Dobb, 1973</xref>). However, it is also apparent in our initial statement, which cites a large and diverse literature in feminist economics (which is closely linked to institutional economics) on the failure of apparently gender-neutral market institutions to adequately value the commodities produced by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465527">Himmelweit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185612465527">Ironmonger,1996</xref>); on the impact of social structures and relationships on women’s and men’s work and career goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612465527">Pujol, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612465527">Strassman, 1997</xref>); and on the influence of social norms associated with providing care on the distribution of unpaid household work and, subsequently, on the gendered nature and configuration of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465527">Folbre, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Our statement identified the SACS sector as one where care services are commonly purchased by government agencies but used by clients. As a result, the link between the demand for the service (reflecting its social or community value), the price received by care providers and the wages they can offer care workers was identified as being, at best, weak. The type of market environment envisaged in the orthodox conceptual framework was not seen as applicable to the sector. Thus, the likelihood that the wages received by SACS workers would reflect the value of what they produced was rated as low and the importance of institutions in wage determination was rated as high.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612465527"><title>Differing Theoretical Viewpoints on the Meaning of ‘Productivity’</title>
<p>Further differences became apparent when Cobb-Clark responded to our statement linking the concept of ‘worker productivity’ primarily to worker attributes such as education and experience. Cobb-Clark equated productivity to value and included job characteristics such as the size of the employing organization, the industry of employment, casual or part-time employment and union membership in her definition of the concept: ‘from an economics standpoint this [our approach] is not sensible. Job characteristics and the value of what is being produced are also relevant to determining value’ (Cobb-Clark, 2010a: 5).</p>
<p>This is an important distinction as it affects the conclusions reached on whether the observed gender pay gap is justified. In the Cobb-Clark analysis of the pay gap, organization size and union membership were included in the definition of worker productivity. The inference was that the pay gap between workers in small and large organizations – and between unionized and non-unionized workers – is justified by differences in the value of work performed. The transcript proceedings in the equal remuneration case at least show that concepts of negotiating capacity or power are also drawn on by orthodox economists to explain the higher wages of union members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185612465527">FWA, 2011b:</xref> 5184). However, this type of causal explanation is not reflected in an approach that includes union membership in the definition of productivity and that, as a result, does not treat wage differences between union members as something that could be relevant to the question of undervaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185612465527" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The submissions demonstrate that explanations put forward by economists for observed links between gender, work and pay can be contentious and conflicting. In this case, analyses of women’s earnings were simultaneously interpreted by different economists participating in the case as either ‘explaining’ gender differences in average pay or demonstrating inequities in payments to the largely feminized community sector workforce (see Cobb-Clark, 2010b and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612465527">Austen, 2010a</xref>, respectively).</p>
<p>A key reason for the different conclusions is related to the different conceptual frameworks that inform the analyses conducted by these economists. As described in this article, the orthodox approach, which currently dominates economic thinking, relies on deductive reasoning and a characterization of human behaviour and interaction based on individual decisions, stable preferences and a wish to maximize personal gains. This approach asserts that wages are determined by ‘market’ factors relating to workers’ productivity and an objective value of what they produce and the supply of labour. In contrast, analyses based on institutional theory conceptualize interactions between workers and employers as taking place in an historical, relational and cultural context that affects the participants’ motives; structures their interactions; determines their bargaining power; and determines the range of potential wage and other outcomes. The likelihood that wages will reflect the value of what is produced is not rated highly in the institutional approach.</p>
<p>Different viewpoints on the gender pay gap can also result from economists using different definitions of occupational segregation, occupation and worker productivity. The differing emphasis given to the potential divergence of market prices from social values provides a further source of conflict among economists. In the equal remuneration case, the orthodox submission relied on the concept of horizontal occupation segregation to argue that segregation was, on average, positive for women’s wage outcomes. It used a broad concept of worker productivity that discounted the wage differences between, for example, union and non-union workers as relevant to the gender pay gap. The submission also assumed that the market prices for care services reflected their social value. In contrast, the institutional viewpoint focused on the concept of vertical occupational segregation to argue that wage differences between female- and male-dominated occupations contribute to the gender pay gap. This submission relied on a narrow definition of worker productivity (in terms of worker attributes such as education and experience) to emphasize wage differences between men and women with similar characteristics. It discounted the possibility that the wage received by care providers for their services would reflect the value attached to these services by the community, with the consequence that the wages of SACS workers were unlikely to reflect the value of their contributions.</p>
<p>It is interesting and important to note that the two economists used similar (and, in some cases, identical) data to argue their different positions. A poorly acknowledged feature of economics is that empirical evidence plays a very small role in deciding the merits of competing explanations of labour and other economic phenomena. The reasons for this are contentious, but well-known arguments include McCloskey’s analyses of the nature of knowledge and persuasion in economics and Lawson’s accounts of the (misplaced) ontological theories on which orthodox economics is based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612465527">Lawson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612465527">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612465527">McCloskey, 1994</xref>). Both sets of arguments comprise substantial (but different) theses that emphasize economists’ frequent reliance on research strategies that adopt the language of physical science but rarely (if ever) attain a comparable capacity to distinguish between theories on the basis of ‘objective’ data. The difficulty arises because neither the theories nor the data are ‘objective’; they reflect a wide range of social norms at almost every point of the research process in defining relevant questions, identifying relevant data, applying relevant analytical techniques and interpreting results.</p>
<p>The evaluation of different types of analyses and approaches, therefore, involves much more than considering different interpretations of similar data. The purpose and methods of economic analyses must also be considered and an understanding sought of their strengths and limitations. The key methods employed in orthodox analysis rely on a social ontology that assumes atomism, as well as stability and regularity in economic relationships and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612465527">Lawson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612465527">2003</xref>). This is similar to the ontology underlying physical sciences. As such, orthodox methods focus on investigating economic relationships by measuring correlations between individual employee and job characteristics and wages. Explanation of the legal, social or historical basis of relationships is not a key focus and if explanations are forthcoming, they are forced to be of the reductionist type, where institutions (such as unions) are interpreted as the aggregation of individual preferences or characteristics. This is why, for example, correlations involving key variables such as occupation can be relatively unrevealing in terms of understanding gendered patterns of pay. Correlations between earnings and occupation may lead us to acknowledge the importance of occupational segregation to the gender pay gap, but do little to explain why this is the case. Increasingly closer correlations might be obtained by using ever more detailed occupational data, but these would do little to explain why different occupations are valued differently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022185612465527">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, institutional analyses use a range of data and methods to examine possible individual <italic>and</italic> institutional contributory causes of observed economic relationships. By acknowledging the separate reality of formal and informal institutions, research undertaken within this framework can focus on issues such as the history of an occupation, the impact of social norms on the valuation of the type of work undertaken by men and women, and how these are relevant to the gender pay gap.</p>
<p>Expectations, if they exist, that economists can provide objective evidence are unrealistic and misplaced. Within the discipline, these features are widely (although not universally) known but perhaps not prominently acknowledged. Different schools of thought have developed in economics that reflect the wide range of standpoints that inform research programmes and methodologies. However, in a context in which one particular school of thought dominates the discipline, it is important that those outside of the discipline are reminded that all economic research, even when it is presented as objective and empirical, contains embedded assumptions and methodological constraints. There <italic>are</italic> major differences in earnings by gender within the Australian economy that are either unexplained or appear to be associated with wage differences between male- and female-dominated occupations. No single research method or set of data can adequately explain these phenomena and the potential causes, and appropriate policy responses will always rely on judgement and compromise as well as high-quality research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185612465527" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There are considerable risks if the philosophical or methodological basis of economic analyses of the gender pay gap is either neglected or misunderstood. If only one type of economics is seen as valid, then the capacity to critique and provide alternative views diminishes. The statements provided by academics in the equal remuneration case demonstrate the considerable value of having alternative research agendas and approaches presented and questioned.</p>
<p>For stakeholders not familiar with the details of economic theories, the previous point might be important, but it is unlikely to be sufficient for understanding research that is often presented in a highly technical format. It can be particularly difficult to challenge assertions made by highly qualified experts who undertake sophisticated forms of analysis. We suggest that this might, to some extent, be overcome by critically evaluating economic analyses of the gender pay gap by asking a series of questions about the assumptions that have been made. First, what was the definition of ‘<italic>occupation</italic>’ used by the researchers? If broad occupational groupings have been used, then it is important to consider whether or not the conclusions reached provide insights into the earnings of men and women with very similar jobs, or whether the occupational groups contain men and women with widely diverging jobs. Second, and related to the previous point, what meaning has been attached to ‘<italic>undervaluation</italic>’? If undervaluation is equated with discrimination, then it is likely that only certain social processes are acknowledged as contributing to the wage disadvantage suffered by women. These processes may include discrimination against individual women workers on the basis of their sex, but will not include an undervaluation of the work performed due to its female characteristic or association. Third, what assumptions were made about the nexus between the market price of the product being produced and its ‘<italic>social value</italic>’? If the social value of the product is equated with prices paid in a ‘market’, then it is important to consider the competitive structure of that market. ‘Value’ can have very specific meanings within economic analyses and it is important that the meaning used in any particular study is clearly understood. Fourth, what assumptions underlie the concept of ‘<italic>productivity</italic>’ in the analysis? Is productivity assumed to be related to the individual characteristics of employees, employers or industries? It is also important to consider potentially relevant factors related to productivity that might be omitted from the analysis. For example, is managerial expertise or experience included as a factor that might contribute to productivity? What implications does this have for the conclusions reached? Finally, how are <italic>institutional arrangements</italic> treated in the analysis? Is it assumed that the analysis is valid regardless of relevant institutional dimensions, such as history and social and organizational context, that operate within the specific labour exchange under consideration? If institutional dimensions are not part of the analysis, then how does this affect the relevance of the conclusions reached in the analysis, and how does it affect the way in which industrial relations tribunals perceive their own role in shaping wage outcomes?</p>
<p>By considering these questions, insights can be gained into the strengths and weaknesses of different forms of economic analysis. Adopting this approach can ensure that no specific method is seen as the ‘gold standard’ form of analysis. It also ensures that social policy is informed by critical evaluation and debate of research findings.</p>
