<abstract>
<p>It is well documented that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 are at high risk for a variety of cognitive and learning deficits. The current study investigated the use of a developmental screening tool, the Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones, as an accurate, reliable, and efficient indicator of developmental delays. Sixty-eight percent of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 were found to have a developmental delay in at least 1 of the 8 areas tested by the Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones. Significant developmental abnormalities were found in the areas of fine motor (35%), gross motor (52%), and math/premath (31%). A positive association was found between the presence of a previously diagnosed optic glioma and math/premath delays (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0022) and between male sex and fine motor delays (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0325). The Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones assessment demonstrates the high presence of developmental delays in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and the need for aggressive and early screening.</p>

<p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3000 births.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811423974">1</xref>
</sup> In that affected individuals are prone to the development of benign and malignant tumors—including optic pathway glioma, neurofibroma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors—neurofibromatosis type 1 is frequently regarded as a tumor predisposition syndrome. Despite the predilection for tumor formation, the most commonly reported neurologic complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 in childhood is cognitive impairment, including learning disabilities and academic underachievement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811423974">2</xref>
</sup> In addition, children with neurofibromatosis type 1 have problems related to executive function, including attention deficit<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811423974">3</xref>
</sup> as well as visual-spatial and visual-perceptual skills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811423974">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While these cognitive deficits are commonly encountered, children with neurofibromatosis type 1 also have delays in fine motor coordination, reading and vocabulary, spelling, and mathematics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811423974">5</xref>
</sup> Because of these deficits, children with neurofibromatosis type 1 are at a 6-fold increased risk for receiving remedial teaching for learning, behavior, speech, or motor problems<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811423974">4</xref>
</sup> and a 4-fold increased risk for requiring special education.<sup>3</sup> As these developmental delays may be harbingers of future cognitive and behavioral problems,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811423974">6</xref>
</sup> it is critical to employ a simple, efficient, and accurate means to identify these at-risk children at an early age. The purpose of this study is to utilize one such developmental screening tool to assess developmental delays in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811423974">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073811423974">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 66 children younger than 8 years were administered a developmental milestones screening assessment as part of their routine care at the St. Louis Children’s Hospital Neurofibromatosis Clinical Program. Between February 2010 and June 2011, 152 patients younger than 8 years were seen. All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 using National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference criteria were included in this study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811423974">1</xref>
</sup> Children referred from outside physicians based on suspicious clinical features but who were not diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 were excluded from the study. Thus, 86 patients were excluded because they did not have sufficient features to warrant the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1, while 2 patients were excluded because of an inability to participate due to conflicting appointments. No families refused screening.</p>
<p>This study was conducted under an approved human studies protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine using a waiver of informed consent. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patient demographics and clinical features of neurofibromatosis type 1. Demographic data included patient sex, race, mode of inheritance (spontaneous or familial) of neurofibromatosis type 1, and the presence of an optic glioma or a plexiform neurofibroma. The developmental screening tool was administered as part of the patients’ routine medical care, and medical records were accessed for developmental assessment results.</p>

<sec id="section3-0883073811423974">
<title>Developmental Assessment</title>
<p>The Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones was employed since it provides a brief, reliable, and accurate assessment of a child’s skills across 8 developmental domains and has been standardized on more than 1600 children younger than 8 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811423974">7</xref>
</sup> The Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones evaluates expressive language, receptive language, fine motor, gross motor, social-emotional, and self-help, as well as both reading and math in older children. Age-appropriate assessments are presented on a single page in a laminated book that includes instructions for evaluating each developmental domain. One question or task corresponds to each of the 6 to 8 developmental domains tested on each assessment form. There are 20 different assessment forms, each designed for children in a specified age group. Children write directly on the page with dry erase markers in order to complete a majority of the expressive language, fine motor, and math tasks. Children answer questions about printed short stories or pictures to complete the receptive language and reading tasks, while social-emotional and self-help domains are assessed using specific motor skills and questions concerning behavior. Many of the assessment questions for infants and young children are directed to the parents to determine what tasks their children can perform. Performance in each task is assessed using a multiple-choice format, which can be completed in less than 5 minutes. A single scoring template is placed over the form to reveal the correct and incorrect answers, which are then transferred to a longitudinal developmental growth chart. Children with performance scores below the 16th percentile on any particular section were considered delayed in that area. The screening tool was developed based on the Brigance Inventory of Early Development II and the Brigance Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills–Revised and has a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 95% across domains and age levels.<sup>

<sec id="section4-0883073811423974">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized with descriptive statistics. Categorical measurements were summarized by counts and percentages. The proportion of cases with developmental delays in each area and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Associations between demographic or clinical characteristics and the developmental delays were described with contingency tables and compared using the Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to identify factors that independently associated with developmental delay. All analyses were two sided, and significance was set at a <italic>P</italic> value of .05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institutes, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<sec id="section5-0883073811423974">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients’ ages ranged from 7 months to 8 years, with a mean age of 4 years 3 months (standard deviation, 1 year 11 months). Patient demographics were equally distributed between sex (32 male, 34 female) and mode of inheritance (34 familial, 32 spontaneous). The race distribution (56 Caucasian, 9 African American, and 1 Middle Eastern) parallels the percentages seen in other outpatient clinics at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. Eighteen percent of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 harbored an optic glioma (18.18%), while 21% had a coexisting plexiform neurofibroma.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight percent of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 were found to have a developmental delay in at least 1 of the 8 areas tested: fine motor (mean, 34.72%; range, 23.88-46.86), gross motor (51.52%, 33.54-69.20), receptive language (23.61%, 14.40-35.09), expressive language (22.39%, 13.11-34.22), math/premath (30.61%, 18.25-45.42), reading/prereading (27.66%, 15.62-42.64), self-help (20.90%, 11.92-32.57), and social-emotional (19.61%, 9.82-33.12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811423974">Figure 1</xref>). In particular, children with neurofibromatosis type 1 as a group exhibited statistically significant delays in fine motor, gross motor, and math/premath skills. Over 50% of these children had gross motor delays.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next determined whether specific demographic data or clinical features of neurofibromatosis type 1 were associated with developmental delay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811423974">Table 1</xref>). In the areas with no significant developmental delays (receptive language, expressive language, reading/prereading, self-help, and social-emotional), no associations were found. Similarly, gross motor delays were not associated with any specific demographic or clinical parameter. However, a positive association was found between the presence of a previously diagnosed optic glioma and math/premath delays (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0022) as well as between male sex and fine motor delays (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0325). Additionally, a positive trend was found between the presence of a previously diagnosed optic glioma and fine motor skill delay (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0888). There was no sex bias in the number of patients with optic glioma. Of the 12 children with optic glioma, 3 were treated for symptomatic progression. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 20 children, and 14 had T2 hyperintensities (unidentified bright objects), 10 of whom also had an optic glioma. One patient was on stimulant medication, 1 had scoliosis, and 2 had stable tibial pseudarthroses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies examining developmental delays in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 have focused on school-aged children, 8 to 16 years,<sup>4,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811423974">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811423974">10</xref>
</sup> or preschool/school-aged children older than 4 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811423974">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811423974">11</xref>
</sup> In these prior reports, more comprehensive assessment tools were employed, including the Bailey Scales of Infant Development,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811423974">6</xref>
</sup> the Bruininks-Oseretsky instrument (2nd ed.),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811423974">11</xref>
</sup> the Beery Visuo-Motor Integration test,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811423974">10</xref>
</sup> and computer-based tests of motor performance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811423974">12</xref>
</sup> Each of these tests requires 45 to 60 minutes to complete. While these assessment methods are valuable, they are not practical tools to identify at-risk children in large, high-volume tertiary care clinics. Moreover, it is imperative to screen children at an early age (preschool), when aggressive interventions can be instituted. For this reason, we chose the Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones tool and found that 68% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 exhibited developmental delay in at least one sphere.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 have significantly poorer motor development<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811423974">12</xref>
</sup> and proficiency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811423974">11</xref>
</sup> In one report, 54% of the 26 children with neurofibromatosis type 1 older than 4 years exhibited lower scores of motor proficiency,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811423974">11</xref>
</sup> similar to our population of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. In a study on 39 toddlers (21-30 months of age), psychomotor scores were significantly lower for those children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (92 ± 10 for the children with neurofibromatosis type 1 compared with 106 ± 11 for those without neurofibromatosis type 1).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811423974">6</xref>
</sup> Importantly, the presence of fine motor and gross motor delays in children correlates with later cognitive dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811423974">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found an association between the presence of optic gliomas and/or unidentified bright objects and delays in both fine motor and math/premath skills. This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that fine motor delays<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811423974">14</xref>
</sup> as well as impaired visuomotor integration and coordination<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811423974">15</xref> </sup>were associated with the presence of unidentified bright objects. While it is possible that these deficits result from coexisting brain tumors in our population, there was no relationship between these impairments and brain tumor treatment or degree of visual compromise. Further investigation will be required to define the causal relationship between optic glioma or unidentified bright objects and these specific developmental delays.</p>
<p>Lastly, we observed a statistically significant association between male sex and fine motor delays. A previous study of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 reported lower fine motor scores in boys than in girls, but the differences were not statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811423974">11</xref></sup> No gender differences for fine motor skills were reported in children with autism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811423974">16</xref></sup> but boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were more delayed in motor development and performance compared to girls with ADHD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811423974">17</xref>
</sup> It is worth nothing that male gender was previously found to be a risk factor for the development of specific learning disabilities in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811423974">8</xref>
</sup> In this report, 37% of boys exhibited specific learning disability compared with 5% of girls, which correlates with the high frequency of significant IQ discrepencies (Performance IQ greater than Verbal IQ) in boys with neurofibromatosis type 1. The basis for this sexual dimorphic observation is not known.</p>
<p>In conclusion, one of the primary benefits of this study is its utility in identifying children with significant developmental delays who are most in need of early intervention. Based on these encouraging results, we recommend that this rapid screening tool be incorporated into the routine evaluation of children with neurofibromatosis type 1. Since the test was originally designed to be administered by parents, it is easy to administer, requires little training, and costs less than $1 per patient. Future application of this assessment will facilitate the implementation of appropriate therapy services for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
