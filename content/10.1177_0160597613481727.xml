<p>As an assistant professor I became interested in studying personal ads, in part because I perceived a lack of attention to this phenomenon by sociologists. In my view, we ceded explanation for the growth and outcome of this activity to psychologists, communications, and media scholars. More importantly, we failed to address the phenomenology of those who participated in placing personal ads. With some exceptions, I believe that this remains true.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597613481727">1</xref>
</sup> However, in a relatively brief period of time, what I call personal advertising, the impersonal public marketing of the self in a circumscribed medium, space, or place, has become a normative way of meeting people and establishing relationships. We know that modern personal advertising is linked to geographic mobility, demographic and cultural changes, occupational constraints, the limited success of more traditional dating methods, and innovations linked to twenty-first-century technology. Aside from the reality that people increasingly engage in alternative lifestyles and live longer, demographic trends indicate that the number of unmarried people has increased significantly, and this population is characterized as more connected, caring, and politically engaged; yet, it continues to be ignored in discussions of sexuality, intimacy, and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597613481727">Gerstel 2011</xref>). In his new book <italic>Going Solo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597613481727">2012</xref>), Eric Klinenberg reminds us that people are increasingly choosing to live alone; however, this does not mean that they want to be alone or that they <italic>are</italic> alone—there is a difference. It is clear that we live in a rapidly changing world, and just as rapidly people approach these changes by innovating. Therefore, we need to keep informed about how technological changes affect our most intimate associations, providing the basis for personal relationships and even the foundation of family. The following review focuses on one of the many ways that people are making connections, Satellite dating.</p>
<p>In modern times, where we find more niche markets and willing mediators there has been a literal explosion of variations on the theme of personal advertising, with print ads placed in newspapers or magazines now accompanied by video dating, Internet personals and matchmaking services, such as eHarmony, “It’s Just Lunch” and speed dating, with all of its variants. Whether they occur through an online advertisement, video clip, or rotating foray in a bar or community center, these activities have the added character of what one writer called `transitory' moments, where people meet often for a single date, coffee, or five-minute speed-dating session. Indeed, we have seen the impact of technology on courtship practices in the use of automobiles, birth control pills, telephones, answering machines, the Internet, and the iPad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597613481727">Bailey 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481727">2004</xref>). The latest of these innovations involves the use of cell phones and satellite Apps to form what is now called location-based dating, also known as Satellite, Mobile, and GPS dating. Apps is simply shorthand for “application,” software that can run on any electronic device (e.g., smartphone).</p>
<p>This mode of connecting gives new meaning to the label “transitory moments,” as Smartphone technology is linked to Apps that connect user profiles in various ways. Users simply download the App, create a profile name, upload a photo (optional), and answer questions about themselves (also optional). Phone alerts notify them when potential mates are nearby, or in the case of one App (<italic>Assisted Serendipity</italic>) when the male to female ratio is optimized in their favor. These are followed by “introductions.” The rest is up to the participants. The first Mobile dating Apps emerged in 2003, with the rest following around 2007, and although the numbers of dating Apps pales in comparison to the multibillion dollar online dating industry, they are growing.</p>
<p>Of the six Mobile dating websites that I examined, location-based dating was promoted as a “global network for meeting people,” “the mobile matchmaker,” and an assisted way to “get your game on.” Some of the more extreme claims refer to mobile dating as “a state of mind,” “a way of life,” “preserving the magic of serendipitous meetings,” and even “good for the environment” because people are meeting people nearby, and therefore, do not have to use their car. These mobile Apps vary with respect to how they are marketed and their targeted audiences. For example, <italic>Grindr</italic> is advertised as an “all male social network” which has been so successful that its founder has now developed <italic>Blendr</italic>, a site for straight women. <italic>Skout</italic> advertises as a social network site where one can meet “new friends or activity partners.” However, most of the mobile Apps are explicit about their focus on dating, and there is even an App that targets gay, straight, and couples interested in “mobile hookups”(<italic>Naughtymeetings</italic>.com).</p>
<p>The way that romance intersects with commerce is also visible in Satellite dating. Though most are advertised as “free,” several Apps provide different types of memberships (for a fee), with the <italic>Premium</italic> membership offering not only the ability to receive introductions and send “winks,” but also the ability to see who looks at your profile. Like several of their online counterparts, some of the mobile services use scientific techniques for matching, such as “chemistry” surveys, proposed as assisting users in optimizing their match. Indeed, the more dependent we have become on scientific answers, the more profitable it is for entrepreneurs to sell us the idea that personal advertising has mastered the science of matching people romantically. As a result, modern personal advertising, including mobile dating, has evolved from a spontaneous and relatively cheap way to meet people in the 1970s and 1980s, to a growing industry in which exchange of money for accessing potential mates is linked to a demand for success.</p>
<p>Most Apps also build in some type of security measure to allay user concerns. For example, <italic>Skout </italic>and <italic>MeetMoi</italic> provide only general or approximate location information as opposed to targeting the specific location information of a member. <italic>Assisted Serendipity</italic> simply notifies the user when the “scales of love tip” in his or her favor, that is, when the male to female ratio of people in one’s favorite bars, clubs, coffee shops or restaurants, shift to optimize meeting a member of the opposite (or same) sex.</p>
<p>
<italic>Skout</italic> markets its App as having two communities, an Adult community and a Teen community of users that it restricts according to age appropriate groups “based on school grades” (members can only communicate with peers close to their age).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597613481727">2</xref>
</sup> As an assurance that members are secure, the site also claims that “we ban over 40,000 devices each month for violations” though just how secure participants feel knowing that the company has to regularly ban this number of devices is anybody’s guess. Each of the sites have some statement about their origins. However, <italic>Skout</italic> and <italic>Grindr</italic> present the most detail along with multiple buttons that offer access to the App’s Blog, Press coverage, Security Measures, User Interviews and Stories, Events that link the virtual world with the real-world events sponsored by the App, and even an Online Store, as some sites vacillate between presenting their services as facilitators of social networking versus dating.</p>
<p>Is the old school of online dating in process of being replaced by GPS dating? In the past two years, media outlets such as CNN, the <italic>New Yorker</italic>, the <italic>New York Times</italic>, and National Public Radio (NPR) have featured segments on this new approach to meeting and mating. Supposedly, technological communication provides an intersection of interest with the means for communicating personally yet self-protectively through the use of online advertising and matchmaking services. This may be perceived as less true in mobile dating, at least by women. According to NPR’s Lauren Silverman, GPS dating currently reflects gender disparities, with men users of mobile dating Apps outnumbering women by a ratio of 4:1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160597613481727">3</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, the number of mobile dating Apps continues to expand and established online services such as eHarmony are expanding with them.</p>
<p>During a time when scholars and pundits have argued that we are experiencing diminished trust in institutions and persons, attenuated social ties, and the so-called collapse of community, how do we explain the phenomenon of Satellite dating, which has as its central dilemma, making intimate connections without the use of traditional screens? Akin to many forms of online dating, Satellite Dating characterizes what political scientist Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597613481727">Putnam (2000)</xref> referred to as a “thin trust” situation, one where trust is extended beyond the radius of people known personally to the anonymous <italic>other</italic>, with a presumed goal to establish “thick trust” relationships or personal relationships that are multi-stranded and embedded in reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597613481727">Putnam 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, along with other personal advertising activities, people are increasingly using location-based dating to connect with potential mates.</p>
<p>The same explanation for the growth of personal advertising we have witnessed in the last decades of the twentieth century applies to the appeal of mobile dating Apps—the benefits of mobile dating coincide with features of our postmodern society. In a world of radical individualism, multiple identities and dynamic relationships, unfettered markets and consumer capitalism, mobile dating is perfectly suited to a mobile society where relationship tourism has become a way of life for millions of people. The features marketed by mobile dating services—time, ease, and proximity, go hand in hand with the perception of increased options and greater freedom to engage those options. In addition to convenience, Satellite dating affords participants the opportunity to fantasize about anonymous others, creating and recreating the ideal mate or partner; and though these fantasies may evaporate once reality sets in (i.e., meeting the person), an endless capacity and need to seek out others balances the costs of having to meet strangers who either may not appeal to them, or for whom they may not be acceptable. And while greater numbers of possibilities do not guarantee greater numbers of connections, interviews with women who engage in multiple forms of personal advertising suggest a feeling of empowerment as they declare interests and present identities, select potential mates, and express their goals and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597613481727">Quiroz 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Already, attitudes have changed dramatically toward these practices, and changes in the formation of personal relationships are of sociological and practical interest. The universal need to connect with one another and the techniques presented here illustrate how people adapt to the challenges of the postmodern world. GPS dating provides opportunities to learn about and meet others in a form suited to its particular historical moment, a moment where proximity, convenience, and technology merge to promote finding love, literally around the corner.</p>
