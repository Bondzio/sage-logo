<title>Background:</title>
<p>Intra-articular corticosteroid injection is a commonly used therapy for adhesive capsulitis, but there are only few studies that compare the efficacy of corticosteroids according to different doses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513480475">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To determine whether intra-articular injections with a high-dose corticosteroid improves pain and function in patients with adhesive capsulitis better than a low dose or a placebo.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513480475">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513480475">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Participants (n = 53) with primary adhesive capsulitis in the freezing stage were randomly assigned to receive ultrasound-guided intra-articular injections with 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (high-dose group, n = 20), 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide (low-dose group, n = 20), or placebo (n = 13). After a single injection, participants were all instructed to carry out a home exercise program. The outcome measures included the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), visual analog scale (VAS) for average shoulder pain level, and passive range of motion including flexion, abduction, extension, external rotation, and internal rotation before treatment and at weeks 1, 3, 6, and 12 after treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513480475">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline between the 3 groups. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc tests showed improvement in SPADI and VAS scores and in flexion, abduction, and internal rotation especially for the low- and high-dose groups compared with the placebo. Yet, no significant difference was found between the 2 different corticosteroid dose groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513480475">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>We assessed the efficacy of corticosteroid injections according to 2 different doses that are most widely used in intra-articular injections for adhesive capsulitis. This study shows that there were no significant differences between the high- and low-dose corticosteroid groups, indicating the preferred use of a low dose in the initial stage.</p>

<body>
<p>The use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections to treat adhesive capsulitis has remained one of the most common procedures for practicing orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, and primary care physicians. Early treatment with intra-articular corticosteroid injections may reduce synovitis, thus shortening the natural history of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480475">12</xref></sup> Although corticosteroids used in intra-articular injections vary in types and doses, little has been reported about their efficacy and acting duration. Because of the paucity of high-quality studies, physicians have selected corticosteroid types and doses based on their experience, cost, and availability and not scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Triamcinolone acetonide is one of the most commonly used long-acting corticosteroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480475">30</xref></sup> As per our literature review, most authors and textbooks have used or recommended 20 mg,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480475">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480475">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480475">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480475">31</xref></sup> 30 mg,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480475">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480475">29</xref></sup> and 40 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480475">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480475">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480475">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480475">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480475">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480475">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480475">33</xref></sup> Not many studies have, however, attempted to provide the evidence for such a selection. One study concluded that the response to corticosteroid injections in adhesive capsulitis is dose dependent, with a higher dose (40 mg triamcinolone acetonide) relieving pain more effectively than a lower one (10 mg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480475">9</xref></sup> Yet, such a low dose as 10 mg is not usually considered to be a common practice, and thus, the study’s result may not constitute a sufficient basis for an optimal dose.</p>
<p>A higher dose of corticosteroids may raise the incidence of local and general complications, such as atrophy of subcutaneous fat tissue, local depigmentation of the skin, tendon ruptures, lesions to local structures such as the nerves, disturbance of the menstrual pattern, hot flush-like symptoms, and hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480475">13</xref></sup> Moreover, intra-articular corticosteroids may alter the metabolism of articular cartilage, inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage repair and inducing cartilage damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480475">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480475">24</xref></sup> The severity of such damage is dose dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480475">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480475">27</xref></sup> Therefore, efficacy as well as adverse effects must be considered together when determining the optimal dose. In the present study, 2 different doses of a corticosteroid (20 mg and 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide), which are most widely used for patients with adhesive capsulitis, and placebo have been selected to compare the efficacy and find the optimal dose. We hypothesized that a high-dose corticosteroid would be more effective for pain and function than a low dose.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546513480475">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Between August 2010 and September 2011, eligible participants with shoulder pain were recruited from an outpatient rehabilitation clinic of a university hospital in Suwon, South Korea. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the university hospital, where all the participants gave their written informed consent and underwent standardized history and physical examinations. We also carried out active and passive range movements and tests for impingement and rotator cuff tendinopathy and checked for any tenderness and/or swelling of the lesion in the affected shoulder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546513480475">
<title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Eligible participants were men or women between the ages of 20 and 70 years who had adhesive capsulitis with a normal radiograph finding of the affected shoulder and restriction of passive motion of greater than 30° in 2 or more planes of movement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480475">4</xref></sup> stage 2 of adhesive capsulitis (freezing stage) according to Hannafin and Chiaia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480475">12</xref></sup> at least 1 month of pain duration, and average pain intensity during a day defined as a score of 3 points or more on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) rated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Participants were excluded if they had any of the following: secondary adhesive capsulitis (secondary to other causes including inflammatory, metabolic, or infectious arthritis; cerebrovascular accident; tumor; or fracture), rotator cuff lesion on both physical and ultrasonographic examinations, full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff on ultrasonographic examination, previous corticosteroid injection at the affected shoulder, and medication such as an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with the exception of those who agreed to stop for a minimum of 5 days before the injection.</p>
<p>Over half the participants had received treatments including oral analgesics, acupuncture, and physical modalities such as heat, cold, and electricity from some other health care systems. The authors were not able to track the type and efficacy of previous treatments. Participants undergoing any of these treatments were excluded from this study. Only those who agreed to stop the treatment for a minimum of 1 week before the injection were included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513480475">
<title>Sample Size</title>
<p>The required sample size was calculated based on the study of the treatment of adhesive capsulitis by Buchbinder et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480475">4</xref></sup> Mean Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores of treatment (40 mg methylprednisolone acetate) and placebo (normal saline) groups showed a significant difference during the 12-week treatment. Using the mean change of SPADI scores from the treatment and placebo groups, we constructed a means matrix with a multiplier of 1. With an α of .05, 80% power, and 15 standard deviations for 3 between-participant and 5 within-participant factors, we obtained a minimum sample size of 42. Considering the potential dropout rate of 20%, the final total sample size was 53. Because corticosteroid injections are already known to have a short-term effect on painful shoulders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480475">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480475">8</xref></sup> we minimized the size of the placebo group, the ratio being 3:3:2 for high-dose (40 mg) corticosteroid, low-dose (20 mg) corticosteroid, and placebo groups, respectively.</p>

<title>Design and Randomization</title>
<p>This study was a randomized, triple-blind (participants, injection operator, and evaluator), placebo-controlled dose-comparative trial. A schematic diagram of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480475">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 112 participants were recruited. Of these, 59 were excluded.

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>For intra-articular injections, participants sat in an upright position with their hands positioned on their thighs. A 23-gauge, 6-cm-long needle was inserted parallel to the transducer in a semi-oblique plane from the posterior side of the shoulder. The needle was advanced with real-time ultrasound equipment (Logiq P6, GE Healthcare, Seongnam, South Korea) using 10- to 12-MHz linear array transducers until the needle tip entered the glenohumeral joint. The injection was prepared according to a sterile technique using opaque syringes so that the participants, injection operator, and evaluator remained blinded to group assignment. The participants were randomized to have a single injection of 4 mL of 10 mg/mL triamcinolone acetonide and 1 mL of 1% lidocaine (high-dose group), 2 mL of 10 mg/mL triamcinolone acetonide and 3 mL of 1% lidocaine (low-dose group), or 5 mL of 1% lidocaine (placebo group). The injection operator, one of the authors (S.H.Y.), is a board certified physiatrist with over 7 years of experience in musculoskeletal rehabilitation and ultrasound-guided injections. The expansion of the articular capsule was checked while the fluid was being injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480475">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Participants had to stay in the hospital for more than 20 minutes after the injection for any signs of acute adverse reactions including local bleeding, weakness, anaphylaxis, and/or vasovagal reactions. Late adverse reactions including postinjection flares of pain, disturbance of the menstrual pattern, facial flushing, subcutaneous fat atrophy, skin depigmentation, and infections were also checked at each follow-up.</p>
<p>After the injection, the evaluator handed out picture leaflets and instructed the participants about the home exercise program for increasing the joint’s range of motion including stretching forward and bending down to a desk, Codman exercises, wall-climbing exercise, external and internal rotations with a bar, and posterior shoulder stretching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480475">20</xref></sup> Recommendation was also given at each follow-up examination to keep exercising. Exercises were to be performed 3 times a day, lasting 10 minutes each round. Participants were also encouraged to write in an exercise diary to record the exercise frequency, duration, and any difficulties. These diaries were checked at each follow-up visit. Participants were also called and encouraged to continue exercising. They were also prohibited from taking any additional physical agents or medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546513480475">
<title>Outcome Measurements</title>
<p>Evaluation on the treatment efficacy was conducted before treatment and at weeks 1, 3, 6, and 12 after the injection by the evaluator who was not informed of the dose of injections. The primary outcome measure was the SPADI, a self-reporting questionnaire for patients with shoulder pain, which consists of 13 questions that are divided into 2 domains: pain (5 items) and disability (8 items).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480475">26</xref></sup> Each domain score is equally weighted and added to obtain a total percentage score between the range of 0 (best) to 100 (worst). Secondary outcome measures included a 10-cm VAS for global shoulder pain and shoulder range of motion. A 10-cm VAS with 0 cm as “no pain” and 10 cm as “the worst imaginable pain” was used to assess pain. The participants had to mark, along the line, an answer to the following question: “With respect to the worst pain you have experienced in your life, what was the average level of your shoulder pain in the last 1 week?” Face-to-face interviews were used to evaluate the SPADI and VAS scores. The passive range of motion was measured by a goniometer, forward flexion and abduction in the supine position, and extension lying on the side of the unaffected limb. External and internal rotations were measured in 90° of abduction of the shoulder and 90° of flexion of the elbow. The evaluator moved participants’ shoulders slowly, and the angle upon onset of pain was measured 3 times to record the average value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546513480475">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We used χ<sup>2</sup> and 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests to compare the mean values and proportions of participants at baseline. The effect of injections during 12 weeks was evaluated with repeated-measures ANOVA. If the repeated-measures ANOVA for group-by-time interaction was significant, post hoc tests (Tukey) of between-group comparison were conducted for a composite of all weeks. Significance was accepted for <italic>P</italic> values of less than .05. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0363546513480475" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 53 participants recruited, 2 from the placebo group who claimed to have no effect from the injection were excluded from further follow-ups. Of these, one had been administered an intra-articular corticosteroid injection at a private clinic, and no information was obtained about the treatment of the other patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480475">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513480475">Table 1</xref> lists baseline characteristics of the study participants. There was no significant difference between the 3 groups in age, sex, duration of shoulder pain, and dominance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513480475">Table 2</xref> shows the changes of outcome measurements after the injections. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time in all outcome measurements (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), meaning that compared with pretreatment, all outcome measures improved significantly for patients in the 3 groups by time. Group-by-time interactions were significant for SPADI, VAS, flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. Post hoc tests for between-group comparisons revealed that there was a significant improvement in low- and high-dose groups compared with the placebo group, but no significant difference was found between low- and high-dose groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After receiving one of the ultrasound-guided intra-articular injections of a high-dose corticosteroid (40 mg), low-dose corticosteroid (20 mg), or placebo, participants with primary adhesive capsulitis carried out home-based exercises for 12 weeks. The corticosteroid groups showed improvement compared with the placebo group in terms of pain and disability and in passive range of motion including flexion, abduction, and internal rotation, while no statistically significant difference was found between the high- and low-dose groups.</p>
<p>Although intra-articular corticosteroid injection is a commonly used therapy for adhesive capsulitis, there are only a few studies that compare the efficacy of corticosteroids according to different doses. There was one previous study that administered a blind intra-articular injection to patients with adhesive capsulitis using 2 different doses of a corticosteroid (10 mg vs 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide). The study concluded that because the high-dose corticosteroid showed better effects than did the low dose in relieving symptoms (pain and sleep disturbance), the response to corticosteroid injections is dose dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480475">9</xref></sup> However, we believe that it is not practical to compare 10 mg and 40 mg dosages because such a low dose as 10 mg is not common practice. Instead of 10 mg, we used 20 mg,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480475">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480475">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480475">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480475">31</xref></sup> a dose that is often used or recommended by previous studies or textbooks, to compare with 40 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480475">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480475">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480475">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480475">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480475">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480475">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480475">33</xref></sup> Unlike the claim that the corticosteroid injection was dose dependent, our study showed no difference between 20 mg and 40 mg in terms of its effect.</p>
<p>There has so far been no clear guidance on the adequate dose of corticosteroids with intra-articular injections: Physicians have mainly relied on their experience. Different authors recommend different doses, and some even recommend using the size of the joint to determine the maximum dose of the corticosteroid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480475">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480475">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480475">32</xref></sup> For triamcinolone acetonide injections in the glenohumeral joint, some authors recommend 40 mg,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480475">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480475">32</xref></sup> while others suggested 30 mg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480475">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480475">29</xref></sup> or 80 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480475">21</xref></sup> In our study, the group receiving low-dose corticosteroid injections showed no significant difference in efficacy compared with the high dose. Therefore, the use of 20 mg can be considered first in an initial trial to minimize its potential local and systemic complications.</p>
<p>Because 2 patient-reported outcomes, both measurements of subjective symptoms, were collected, it was important to identify the minimum clinically important difference. The minimum clinically important difference is the smallest difference in a score that patients perceive as beneficial and would mandate a change in the patient’s management, which also indicates relevant changes in clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480475">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480475">14</xref></sup> The minimum clinically important difference determined for the SPADI score was more than 10 points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480475">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513480475">34</xref></sup> If the difference in the SPADI score claimed by the patient before and after the treatment was less than 10 points, it may be of no clinical importance even if it is statistically significant. In our study, 75.0% (15 participants) of both high- and low-dose corticosteroid groups met the minimum clinically important difference at week 12, while only 18.2% (2 participants) did for the placebo. Throughout the study, the dropout rate was 0% for the corticosteroid groups and as high as 15.4% (2 participants) for the placebo group. The reason for the dropouts included participants’ desire to receive treatment in some other health care systems because of continued pain after the injection. Based on the minimum clinically important difference for the SPADI score and dropout rate, the treatment efficacy in the corticosteroid groups appears to be superior to that of the placebo while similar between the 2 corticosteroid groups.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors selected triamcinolone acetonide among other types of corticosteroids. Because the key feature of corticosteroids is solubility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480475">19</xref></sup> a different corticosteroid, such as a short-acting corticosteroid, could have shown a different result. Nonetheless, the result of this study can still be a useful reference for other types of long-acting corticosteroid injections that are just as commonly used as triamcinolone acetonide and of equivalent potency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480475">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480475">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>This study showed the low dose of a corticosteroid to be as effective as the high dose. Had follow-up been sufficiently longer, the 2 groups may have rendered different results. Nonetheless, 2 systematic reviews done in the past claimed that a corticosteroid injection may be of only short-term benefit for shoulder pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480475">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480475">8</xref></sup> Also, the duration of action when using triamcinolone acetonide for periarticular injections is known to be only about 2 to 3 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480475">6</xref></sup> Based on these findings, the authors concluded a 12-week follow-up would be sufficient.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, although all the participants were instructed to carry out exercise programs at home, they were not checked individually for compliance. Second, as an intra-articular injection is usually considered for patients with adhesive capsulitis whose level of pain is severe, participants selected in the previous studies had high initial average VAS scores of 6.5 to 7.2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480475">4</xref></sup> 6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480475">9</xref></sup> and 5.7 to 6.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480475">28</xref></sup> However, our study’s average level of pain measured was 4.9 to 5.5, slightly lower than the previous studies. Had we conducted the study with more severely affected patients, the result may have been different. Third, despite conducting simple radiograph, ultrasonographic, and physical examinations to exclude participants with secondary adhesive capsulitis, we may have still missed those with labral lesions or small rotator cuff pathological abnormalities in the absence of a magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. Fourth, whereas Hannafin and Chiaia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480475">12</xref></sup> categorized adhesive capsulitis into 4 stages based on arthroscopic findings, clinical examination, and pathological appearance, we selected participants in the freezing stage (stage 2) based only on the clinical examination. Therefore, not all of our participants may fall within the same natural history of adhesive capsulitis. Lastly, adhesive capsulitis is known to be a common disease among women in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480475">2</xref></sup> Yet, in this study, the percentage of male patients of a total of 51 participants was 52.9% (27 participants) and as high as 60% in the low-dose group, which makes it difficult to generalize our result.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have assessed through this study the efficacy of corticosteroids according to 2 different doses (40 mg and 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide), which are most widely used in intra-articular injections for adhesive capsulitis. Because there were no significant differences between the high- and low-dose corticosteroid groups, the initial use of a low dose is encouraged to minimize the potential local and systemic complications.</p>
