<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Both impaired heart rate recovery (HRR) and low fitness are associated with higher mortality risk. In addition, HRR is influenced by fitness status. The interaction between HRR, mortality, and fitness has not been clearly defined. Thus, we sought to evaluate the association between HRR and all-cause mortality and to assess the effects of fitness on this association.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Treadmill exercise testing was performed in 5974 male veterans for clinical reasons at two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (Washington, DC and Palo Alto, CA). HRR was calculated at 1 and 2 min of recovery. All-cause mortality was determined over a mean 6.2-year follow-up period.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Mortality risk was significantly and inversely associated with HRR, only at 2 min. A cut-off value of 14 beats/min at 2 min recovery was the strongest predictor of mortality for the cohort (hazard ratio = 2.4; CI 1.6–3.5). The mortality risk was overestimated when exercise capacity was not considered. When both low fitness and low HRR were present (≤6 metabolic equivalents and ≤14 beats/min), mortality risk was approximately seven-fold higher compared to the High-fit + High-HRR group (&gt;6 metabolic equivalents and &gt;14 beats/min).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> HRR at 2 min post exercise is strongly and inversely associated with all-cause mortality. Exercise capacity affects HRR-associated mortality substantially and should be considered when applying HRR to estimate mortality.</p>

<p>Autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance is associated with mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398432">1</xref></sup> The heart rate (HR) response to, and recovery from, a bout of exercise has long been used as a reflection of ANS function, as the heart rate response is mediated by the dynamic interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the ANS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398432">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711398432">2</xref></sup> Specifically, greater sympathetic tone predominates as heart rate increases during exercise, and vagal reactivation mediates the rate at which heart rate recovers after exercise. Conversely, HR upon cessation of exercise and within the initial 30 seconds of recovery is mainly affected by reactivation of the parasympathetic system, while sympathetic withdrawal becomes important later during recovery (beyond about 2 min).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711398432">3</xref></sup> Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, a growing body of studies in recent years has shown that the rate in which heart rate recovers from exercise (termed heart rate recovery, or HRR) is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398432">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the abundance of studies on the clinical utility of HRR and the recommendation that HRR be included in the exercise test report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711398432">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711398432">24</xref></sup> the methods used to assess HRR, the variety of HRR cutpoints, the different time points in recovery (1, 2, and 5 min), and computations of HRR using various mathematical models make its implementation in clinical practice difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398432">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398432">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398432">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398432">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711398432">25</xref></sup> Differences in the findings among previous studies are likely attributable to the different criteria used to define impaired HRR, failure to account for a number factors that may influence HRR and differences in populations studied. For example, HRR is greatly influenced by the fitness level of the individual, yet fitness levels have not been adequately addressed in previous studies. It is well known that beta-blockade therapy lowers maximal HR and HRR, yet little has been done to explore HRR in patients receiving beta-blockers. Finally, racial differences have been suggested to influence the relationship between HRR and outcomes, but few data exist that have explored this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711398432">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711398432">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before HRR can be applied widely in clinical practice, accepted standards for its use must be developed. Therefore, the purposes of the current study were: (1) to compare the prognostic power of HRR at different cut-points; and (2) to determine if these cut-points are influenced by beta-blockade, fitness levels, or race.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711398432"><title>Study design and population</title>
<p>Between March 1992 and 23 December 2008, a symptom-limited exercise tolerance test (ETT) was administered to 5974 male veterans at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, DC (<italic>n</italic> = 4000) and the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, California (<italic>n</italic> = 1974), for clinical reasons. All individuals included in this study successfully completed the test with the exception of the following exclusions: (1) a history of an implanted pacemaker; (2) left bundle branch block that developed during the test; (3) those who were unstable and required emergent intervention;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711398432">24</xref></sup> (4) those with ST-T wave changes suggestive of an ischaemic response to the exercise test confirmed by a subsequent imaging procedure; (5) those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and (6) those not treated with beta-blockers with an impaired chronotropic response, defined as a ratio of &lt;0.8 between the percentage heart rate reserve (HRR) and metabolic reserve (MR) at peak exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711398432">28</xref></sup> The percentage HRR used and percentage MR achieved are described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711398432">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711398432">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 5974 participants were all men, either African American (<italic>n = </italic>3206) or Caucasian (<italic>n</italic> = 2768). All gave written consent prior to the ETT. The study was approved by the Internal Review Board at each institution. All demographic, medicalm and medication information was obtained from patients’ computerized medical records just prior to the test. Each individual was also asked to verify the computerized information on history of chronic disease, current medications, and cigarette smoking habits. Body weight and height were recorded prior to the test. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>We recorded dates of death from the Veterans Affairs Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator System File. This system is used to determine benefits to survivors of veterans and is complete and accurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711398432">30</xref></sup> The social security death index was used to match all subjects to their record according to Social Security number. Vital status was determined as of 19 June 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711398432"><title>Exercise assessments</title>
<p>Exercise capacity for the individuals at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, DC, was assessed by the standard Bruce protocol. For the individuals assessed at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, an individualized ramp protocol was used as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711398432">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Peak exercise time achieved by each individual was recorded in minutes. Peak workload was estimated as metabolic equivalents (METs). One MET is defined as the energy expended at rest, which is approximately equivalent to an oxygen consumption of 3.5 ml per kg body weight per min. Exercise capacity (in METs) was estimated based on speed and grade achieved using a commonly used equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711398432">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711398432">32</xref></sup> Individuals were encouraged to exercise until volitional fatigue in the absence of symptoms or other indicators of ischaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711398432">24</xref></sup> The use of handrails during the exercise test was discouraged and only allowed for balance and safety. The test was terminated if the individual relied on the handrails to maintain treadmill speed. Age-predicted peak exercise HR was determined based on standardized methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711398432">33</xref></sup> Medications were not changed or stopped before testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711398432"><title>Recovery heart rate assessment</title>
<p>Recovery heart rate was assessed at 1, 2, and 5 min post exercise. The recovery phase consisted of the subject walking on the treadmill at a speed of 1.5 miles/hour (mph) and 0% grade until blood pressure is assessed. This is accomplished within the initial 45 seconds following the termination of the exercise. The treadmill was then stopped and the subject was placed in the supine position. The time from the end of exercise to the subject being placed supine was within 60 seconds. The 1-min recovery heart rate (1-min HRR) was defined as the difference between heart rate achieved at peak exercise minus heart rate at 1 min post exercise. Similarly, the 2-min heart rate recovery (2-min HRR) was defined as the difference between heart rate achieved at peak exercise minus heart rate at 2 min post exercise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711398432"><title>Recovery heart rate categories</title>
<p>To assess the mortality risk of 1-min HRR, we assessed each incremental change of 2 heart beats in recovery at this point starting with ≤10 beats and finishing with ≤40 beats.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion we assessed the mortality risk associated with 2-min HRR, starting with ≤10 beats and finishing with ≤40 beats HRR. Based on the hazard ratios from these analyses, we formed five HRR categories. The first category consisted of those with HRR ≤14 heart beats (HRR-1), because of the similarity of the hazard ratios for HRRs between 10 and 14 beats. The following categories were based on 6-heart beat intervals. Thus, the second category consisted of those with HRR between 15 and 20 heart beats (HRR-2), the third category (HRR-3) consisted of individuals with HRR between 21 and 26 heart beats; the fourth category (HRR-4) consisted of those with a HHR between 27 and 32 heart beats, and those with 33 or more heart beats comprised the fifth category (HRR-5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711398432"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation, while categorical variables are expressed as absolute and relative frequencies (%). Associations between categorical variables were tested using Pearson’s chi-squared test. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine age and BMI differences between the two races. Equality of variances between treatment groups was tested by the Levene’s test.</p>
<p>Receiver-operating-characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to compare the MET level achieved, BMI, and HRR in terms of their discriminatory accuracy in predicting survival. Survival analysis was performed with the use of Cox proportional hazards models to determine the variables that were independently and significantly associated with mortality. To avoid colinearity between the different HRR cut-off categories we created several models, each including the HRR for only one category. The analyses were adjusted for age in years, BMI, peak MET level achieved, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, dyslipidaemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy), cardiovascular disease, race, and cardiovascular medication (ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and statins). Cox proportional hazards analysis was also performed to determine the relative risk of the five HRR categories. These analyses were also adjusted for the aforementioned covariates. Finally, similar analyses were performed in the subgroup of patients treated with beta-blockers.</p>
<p>A <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 for two-sided tests was considered as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS software (SPSS version 15.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711398432" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The mean follow-up period was 6.2 ± 3.1 years (range 0.8–17.2 years) and the average annual mortality was 1.4%. There were 513 deaths (289 for African-Americans and 224 for whites). Approximately 80% achieved a peak HR that was at least 85 % of the age-predicted value. We observed no significant interaction between race and HRR (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31) and therefore, the data were not stratified by race.

<p>Because no significant mortality risks were associated with any of the 1-min HRR assessments, we turned our attention to the potential risks associated with 2-min HRR. Adjusted hazard ratios for each two heart beat incremental change in HRR-2 are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711398432">Table 3</xref>. The hazard ratio was approximately 2.4 for HRR ≤14 and declined by approximately 0.5 between 15 and 20 heart beats. The decline then became less evident and an asymptote was achieved beyond 40 heart beats. Based on these findings, we formed the five aforementioned HRR categories (HRR-1–HRR-5) and assessed mortality risk accordingly. These hazard ratios are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711398432">Table 4</xref>. The data are presented in two models; one adjusted for METs achieved (Model 1) and the other without adjusting for MET level achieved (Model 2).

<p>When exercise capacity was considered (Panel A; Model 1), the relative risk for the entire cohort was 2.7 times greater (hazard ratio = 2.7; CI 1.9–3.8), for individuals in the HRR-1 category (recovery heart rate of ≤14 beats at 2 min post exercise), compared to those with a HRR&gt;40 beats. The risk was 50% higher for those in the HRR-2 category (hazard ratio = 1.5; CI 1.0–2.1); 40% higher HRR-3 category (hazard ratio = 1.4; CI 1.0–1.9) and was not significantly different for the HRR-4 category (27–32 heart beats).</p>
<p>We observed similar findings when we considered only those treated with beta-blockers (Panel B; Model 1). The risk for those in the most impaired HRR category (≤14 beats, HRR-1) was 3.2 times greater than those in the HRR-4 category (hazard ratio: 3.2; CI 2.0–5.2; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001), with no statistically significant differences observed in any of the other HRR categories.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1741826711398432"><title>Exercise capacity, HRR, and mortality risk</title>
<p>Because exercise capacity is inversely associated with mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711398432">34</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711398432">37</xref></sup> and high fitness is associated with a more precipitous reduction in heart rate upon cessation of exercise, we aimed to assess the relative contributions of fitness and HRR on mortality risk. Therefore, we repeated the aforementioned proportional hazard analyses without adjusting for peak MET level. The findings, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711398432">Table 4</xref>, Model 2, suggest that when fitness level was not considered, mortality risk was overestimated for all categories in the entire cohort and in those treated with beta-blockers.</p>
<p>Cox proportional hazards and ROC analyses further supported the concept that both exercise capacity and HRR were strong predictors of mortality. For each 1 MET increase in exercise capacity, the mortality risk was lowered by approximately 18% (hazard ratio = 0.82; CI 0.79–0.85); and the ROC area was 0.70 (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). Likewise, the hazard ratio for each heart beat in HRR was 0.98 (CI 0.97–0.99) and the ROC area was 0.62; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). Thus, for every 10-beat reduction in heart rate at 2 min post exercise, the mortality risk was lowered by 15%.</p>
<p>To further explore the combined effect of fitness and low HRR, we combined the lowest quartiles of exercise capacity and HRR, defined as those with an exercise capacity ≤6 METs and HRR (≤14 heart beats) (Low-fit+Low-HRR group). The remaining categories were defined as follows: those with ≤6 METs and a HRR &gt;14 heart beats comprised the low-fit and high-HRR group (Low-fit + High-HRR); those who achieved &gt; 6 METs and HRR ≤14 heart beats comprised the High-fit and Low-HRR group (High-fit + Low-HRR); and those with &gt;6 METs and &gt;14 heart beats comprised the High-fit and High-HRR category (High-fit + High-HRR). We used the latter category as the referent group. The findings presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1741826711398432">Table 5</xref> depict a substantially greater hazard ratio when lower fitness levels or lower HRR were present for all comparisons.

<p>In this study we evaluated the association between HRR and all-cause mortality in a large cohort of male veterans. Our results reinforce the general premise regarding the association between HRR and all-cause mortality, as reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398432">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup> An additional noteworthy finding was that exercise capacity has a significant additive effect on the risk associated with HRR. In this regard, several observations are notable. First, risk reduction associated with HRR is overestimated when exercise capacity is not considered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711398432">Table 4</xref>). Second, and perhaps more relevant clinically, was that when low exercise capacity and low HRR were present, the relative risk for mortality increased by approximately seven-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1741826711398432">Table 5</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that exercise capacity and HRR contribute to mortality risk independently and both should be quantified as a routine part an exercise test. This is not surprising given the well-documented strength of exercise capacity in predicting outcomes in individuals referred for exercise testing with and without cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711398432">34</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711398432">37</xref></sup> and supports the suggestion that both HRR and exercise capacity should be considered in risk models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398432">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with those reported by Shetler et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398432">8</xref></sup> who reported that the combination of an abnormal HRR (using 22 beats at 2 min in recovery as a threshold) and impaired exercise tolerance (&lt;5 METs) yielded a five-fold higher risk for mortality. However, the risk in our cohort is substantially higher, particularly in African Americans. The latter finding merits further investigation.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711398432"><title>Effect of beta-blockade on HRR-associated mortality risk</title>
<p>We also considered the effect of beta-blockade on the predictive value of HRR since HRR would intuitively be reduced by beta-blockade. We observed that the risk for those treated with beta-blockers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711398432">Table 4</xref>) is more than three-fold higher among those in the most impaired HRR group (≤14 beats) and ceases to be significant beyond that level.

<sec id="sec13-1741826711398432"><title>Methodological concerns with previous studies</title>
<p>Although the prognostic utility of HRR has been demonstrated in various patient populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398432">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup> several concerns have been raised regarding exercise recovery period, the populations tested, and the various cut-off points proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711398432">39</xref></sup> Regarding the recovery period, major methodological concerns with previous studies have been raised, especially when a 2-min cool-down period was utilized. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398432">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398432">7</xref></sup> Specifically, after reaching exercise peak, individuals either: (a) performed an active cool-down recovery at 1.5 mph and 2.5% grade for 2 min);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398432">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398432">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711398432">14</xref></sup> (b) at a speed of 1 mph for 1 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398432">16</xref></sup> to more than 1.5 min;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398432">12</xref></sup> (c) were seated in a chair;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398432">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711398432">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711398432">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup> or (d) placed immediately in a supine position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398432">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398432">9</xref></sup> This approach is subject to great variability and explains at least in part the variety in HRR cut-off levels proposed and assigned a higher risk by previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398432">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398432">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711398432">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398432">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711398432">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most indicative example of how the type of recovery affects the cut off points is depicted by Vivekananthan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711398432">14</xref></sup> where the active cool-down period, defined as walking on the treadmill for the first min of recovery, was associated with a cut off value of 12 beats at 1 min while the absence of a cool-down period was associated with a cut off value of 18 beats at 1 min of recovery.</p>
<p>To address this, we assessed HRR at 1, 2, and 5 min post exercise. In contrast to previous studies that used different testing methodology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398432">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup> our findings suggest that using standard treadmill exercise methodology, the 2-min HRR time point is the most potent predictor of mortality. We therefore provided specific HRR cutoff points based on the 2-min recovery period. Based on our findings, we believe that the 2-min recovery period is more practical for several reasons. First, for safety reasons, most exercise protocols allow time for a gradual decrease in the speed and elevation of the treadmill, rather than stop abruptly. The patient then dismounts the treadmill and walks back to a bed or chair. This is accomplished within approximately 30–60 seconds. The rate of decrease in treadmill speed and grade as the recovery period is initiated and patient’s ability to walk back to the bed or chair are potential sources of variability. By comparison, the 2-min assessment is less likely to be influenced by these issues.</p>
<p>Second, it has been suggested that the heart rate within the initial 30 seconds of recovery is mainly affected by reactivation of the parasympathetic system, while the withdrawal of sympathetic influences becomes important later in recovery (beyond ≈2 min).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711398432">3</xref></sup> Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the heart rate at 2 min of recovery better reflects autonomic balance. In this regard, our findings suggest that a delayed response in sympathetic withdrawal following exercise may underlie the higher risk for mortality.</p>
<p>The third concern raised by previous studies is the type of population studied. Some studies focused on screening symptom-free patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398432">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398432">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398432">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711398432">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711398432">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711398432">17</xref></sup> while others studied special populations including heart failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398432">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711398432">19</xref></sup> post myocardial infarction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup> and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711398432">18</xref></sup> The population studied could certainly affect the optimal cutpoint and time period in recovery to measure HRR as well as the strength of the association between HRR and outcomes. In the present study, exercise testing was performed to evaluate exercise-induced ischaemia. In this regard, our sample is similar to the populations undergoing exercise testing worldwide and reflects usual clinical practices.</p>
<p>The fourth major concern is the many HRR criteria proposed to quantify risk. Reported cut off points include 6 beats at 1 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398432">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711398432">19</xref></sup> 12 beats at 1 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398432">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398432">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711398432">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398432">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398432">20</xref></sup> 25 beats at 1 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711398432">10</xref></sup> 22 beats at 2 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398432">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711398432">17</xref></sup> 42 beats at 2 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398432">7</xref></sup> 50 beats at 3 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711398432">15</xref></sup> and 55 beats at 5 min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711398432">18</xref></sup> This variability is likely due to differences in the tested populations and the type of recovery period. For example, the low HRR cut-off point of 6 beats at 1 min was reported in patients with heart failure, a condition well known to be characterized by abnormalities in autonomic function, underscoring the impact of the population on HRR levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711398432"><title>Study limitations</title>
<p>Several issues limit the application of our findings. Our population consisted only of men that were referred for clinical indications, and thus the findings cannot be extrapolated to women or to a general unselected male population. Since two different exercise protocols were used, possible differences may have occurred in the estimation of exercise capacity. Although no significant interaction between exercise capacity and the two sites was observed, the possible influence of the protocol on the results cannot be discounted. Data were available for all-cause mortality and not for cardiovascular or other causes of mortality. Although similar relationships have been demonstrated between HRR and cardiovascular disease mortality, using all-cause mortality as an end point in clinical investigations is viewed as more objective, unbiased, and accurate while cardiovascular mortality has been criticized as potentially inaccurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741826711398432">40</xref></sup></p>

<p>A strong inverse association between HRR and all-cause mortality was observed in male veterans. In addition, only the 2-min HRR was associated with increased mortality risk in contrast to several previous studies, possibly due to differences in testing methodology and the population studied. Since we have used standard exercise testing methodology and studied individuals similar to usual everyday clinical practice, our findings are of clinical relevance. Finally, we observed a significant effect of exercise capacity and beta-blockade on the association between HRR and mortality, and these variables should be considered when studying the predictive value of HRR.</p>
