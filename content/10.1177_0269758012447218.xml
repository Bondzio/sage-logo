The RCIADIC is one of the most comprehensive inquiries conducted about Indigenous Australians, and it is often cited to support the introduction of Australian Indigenous justice policy reforms. This article describes the lives (as both victims and offenders) of the 11 females whose deaths were investigated by the RCIADIC. The inquiry was initially established to examine whether the state’s practices in prisons and watch-houses contributed to the 99 deaths that were investigated. This article documents how the deceased females arguably became invisible as both victims and offenders in favour of the Indigenous males who had died in custody, despite the fact that the inquiry attempted to include a racialized perspective. The article concludes by comparing the recommendations of the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Inquiry − a Canadian inquiry that took place around the same time as the RCIADIC, and which, at the time, was able to adequately consider the difficulties facing Canadian Aboriginal women when confronted by the Manitoba justice system. This intersectional race and gender analysis illustrates that without proper consideration the needs of racialized women will remain unmet when having to contend with criminal justice and legal processes.</p> </abstract> <kwd-group> <kwd>Indigenous deaths in custody</kwd> <kwd>Indigenous female offenders</kwd> <kwd>intersectional race and gender analysis</kwd> <kwd>Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</kwd> </kwd-group> </article-meta> </front> <body> <sec id="section1-0269758012447218"> <title>Introduction</title> <p>In an article written in 1988, Adrian Howe noted that:<disp-quote> <p>[t]he stereotypical Aboriginal prisoner – the Aborigine at greatest risk of being imprisoned – is a male aged between 20 and 29. It is Aboriginal males in this age group who are at greatest risk of death in custody and who are, consequently, the focus of the national inquiry. But while it is now well established that Aboriginal people are amongst the most imprisoned in the world, it is well to remember that some of these people are women. … [Yet] [w]e know so little about them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447218">Howe, 1988</xref>: 5)</p> </disp-quote> This article is about 11 Indigenous<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269758012447218">1</xref> </sup> females who died in custody between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989 and whose deaths were investigated by the Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC), the national inquiry referred to in Howe’s quote. The inquiry was heralded as the inquiry that would transform race politics for Indigenous people in Australia. It was established on 16 October 1987 and it considered 99 deaths.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269758012447218">2</xref> </sup> After more than two decades since it tabled its National Report, the inquiry continues to significantly influence Indigenous criminal justice policy in Australia. Although the original terms of reference contained in the Letters Patent initially only required an investigation into <italic>how</italic> the deaths had occurred, they were later extended to include a consideration of the underlying social, cultural and legal issues that may have had a bearing on the deaths. The RCIADIC produced an Interim Report, 97 death reports, four regional reports and the National Report, consisting of five volumes, which was tabled in Federal Parliament on 15 April 1991 and made 339 recommendations. The RCIADIC concluded that Indigenous people were vastly over-represented in custody and that it was because of this over-representation that so many deaths had occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991e</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 6). Since the RCIADIC inquiry, Indigenous imprisonment rates have increased: Indigenous prisoners comprised 14% of the total prison population in 1992, whereas in 2006, the proportion had increased to 24% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758012447218">Jeffries and Bond, 2009</xref>: 47). More importantly, ‘[t]he rate of Indigenous women’s imprisonment across Australia rose 10 percent between 2006 and June 2009’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758012447218">Bartels, 2010</xref>: 8), and they were 16 times over-represented in prison compared to non-Indigenous women in June 2009 − a figure which is higher than the over-representation rate for Indigenous men, which in 2009 was 13 times higher than that of non-Indigenous men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758012447218">Bartels, 2010</xref>: 9).</p> <p>Although 11 out of the 99 deaths were of Indigenous females, there was no separate analysis of these females as a group in the Interim, National or regional reports, i.e. the females were not considered <italic>as females</italic>. To be fair, nor was there an analysis of the males <italic>as males</italic>. However, some scholars, and the commissioners themselves, noted that the major focus of the inquiry was on the males who died, which is how the inquiry characterized the notion of ‘race’ – that it equated to being about young Indigenous males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269758012447218">Atkinson, 1996</xref>; Bulbeck;<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269758012447218">3</xref> </sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758012447218">Marchetti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758012447218">Payne, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991b</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 357). This lack of gender-specific analysis occurred despite the fact that, at the time the RCIADIC was established, Indigenous women were over-represented in police and prison custody, and their imprisonment rate had been increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447218">Howe, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758012447218">Kerley and Cunneen, 1995</xref>).</p> <p>Criminal legal reasoning and criminological theories have traditionally tended to prioritize the experiences of males rather than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269758012447218">Gelsthorpe, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758012447218">Mukherjee and Scutt, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758012447218">Naffine, 1987</xref>), mainly because there are many more males (in number) who come in contact with the criminal justice system than females. It is generally believed that white females are better behaved, less dangerous and less delinquent than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269758012447218">Gelsthorpe, 1989</xref>). However, when it comes to <italic>racialized</italic> women, statistics show that they are over-represented in the criminal justice system when compared to non-racialized women as both victims and offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269758012447218">Behrendt et al., 2008</xref>: 125; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758012447218">Gabbidon and Green, 2005</xref>: 97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758012447218">Stubbs and Tolmie, 2008</xref>). Despite this, ‘there is still limited research on women and crime generally, and women, race and crime specifically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758012447218">Gabbidon and Green, 2005</xref>: 97).</p> <p>When researching and debating criminal justice policies and practices, an intersectional race and gender approach is important because it enhances our understanding of how racialized women experience the criminal justice system as both offenders and victims. Had the RCIADIC conducted such an analysis in its investigation, it may have acquired a better understanding of the lives of Indigenous people as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269758012447218">Atkinson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758012447218">Behrendt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758012447218">Bolger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758012447218">Hunter, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269758012447218">Lucashenko (1997</xref>), an Australian Indigenous professor, argues that simply adopting a race <italic>or</italic> gender perspective (but not both) reinforces inequality, since it masks the positions of power held by those claiming to be oppressed:<disp-quote> <p>There seems to be a tendency, problematic among both Black and feminist politics, to seek to situate oneself in the position of most oppressed and then use this position not as a tool for change but as a justification for a politics of victimhood. This tendency masks an open discussion of hierarchies of oppression and overlooks the power that may be held by individuals in contrast to their theoretical position.

This article presents a summary of who the 11 females whose deaths were investigated by the RCIADIC were, according to the information presented in their death reports. The manner in which the RCIADIC characterized and framed their deaths and lives is contrasted with the manner in which the inquiry characterized the deaths and lives of the 88 deceased males. This analysis uncovers what the RCIADIC could have considered, and in the end what it did (and did not) consider in its final recommendations.</p> <p>The methodology used for the analysis involved both a thematic content analysis of the death reports of the 99 deceased and semi-structured interviews with 48 people who either worked in the six main offices and Aboriginal Issues Units established for the inquiry or who were involved in some other capacity with the RCIADIC. Ethical clearance to conduct the interviews was obtained from the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee. Of those interviewed, 20 were Indigenous, nine of whom were female and 11 male, and 28 were non-Indigenous, eight of whom were female and 20 male. Twenty-three interviewees were legally trained; only three of the Indigenous people interviewed had such qualifications. A purposive or strategic sampling approach was used to select people who would be an authoritative source on the workings of the RCIADIC and its various sub-units. Other criteria used for selecting people to be interviewed were that they be representative of the different positions created within the RCIADIC and that a sufficient number of people were selected from each regional office. The interview questions were semi-structured and open-ended, which is consistent with feminist and decolonizing approaches to interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758012447218">Berg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758012447218">Davies, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758012447218">Tuhiwai Smith, 1999</xref>).<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269758012447218">4</xref> </sup> </p> <p>In order to properly consider the extent to which the recommendations of the RCIADIC would have differed had it taken an intersectional race and gender approach, a brief comparison was made with the recommendations, which related to female Aboriginal<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269758012447218">5</xref> </sup> offenders in Manitoba, made by the Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People (commonly referred to as the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, and hereafter abbreviated as AJI). The AJI released its final report on 29 August 1991, less than five months after the RCIADIC tabled its National Report.<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0269758012447218">6</xref> </sup> The two inquiries were in many ways similar: both were initiated due to controversies surrounding the deaths of certain indigenous<sup> <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0269758012447218">7</xref></sup> people and the subsequent investigations of those deaths by police; the establishment of both inquiries was controversial, and challenged by a variety of institutions and organizations; and both inquiries made a large number of recommendations dealing with the dispossession and marginalization of indigenous people. There was, however, one glaring difference between the two inquiries. This difference related to the way in which each inquiry considered the problems that confronted indigenous females. The AJI dedicated an entire chapter to a consideration of the relationship between Aboriginal women and the Manitoba justice system. Within this chapter there were 19 recommendations that specifically related to the abuse of Aboriginal women and children, and to the sentencing and parole of Aboriginal women. The RCIADIC, however, included no such chapter in its National Report and it expressly referred to Indigenous females in only five of its 339 recommendations. Had the RCIADIC adopted an intersectional race and gender approach in its investigations, its recommendations may have more closely reflected those contained in the AJI report.</p> </sec> <sec id="section2-0269758012447218"> <title>Comparing the deaths and lives of the female and male deceased who were investigated</title> <sec id="section3-0269758012447218"> <title>Details of the deaths</title> <p> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269758012447218">Table 1</xref> provides details of the age, place of detention and death, and cause of death of each of the females who were investigated by the RCIADIC. The average age of the females was 32 (the same as the average age of the males), the youngest female being 14 and the oldest 58 (compared to the youngest male, who was 16, and the oldest, who was 62). Twenty-five of the 88 males (29%) were under 25 years of age, a factor which in the end influenced the commissioners to focus on the young males who had died:<disp-quote> <p>Aboriginal juveniles, particularly males, require very particular consideration in this Report. Of the 99 deaths investigated and reported upon by Commissioners 13 died under the age of 20; 14 died between the ages of 20 and 24; 23 between the ages of 25 and 29. The mean age for all deaths was 32 years, the median age … was 29 years. Of those who died under the age of 30 (50 cases) only 5 were females. Whilst the increasing involvement of Aboriginal females in the juvenile and adult justice system and the deaths of some of them is a matter of great concern, overwhelmingly the typical portrait of the Aboriginal deaths in custody was that of young males.

Indeed, there was no critical examination of gender-specific patterns that emerged from the female deaths investigated. For example, Commissioner Wyvill noted in his regional report that there were seven ‘preventable’ deaths in Queensland and that five of those deaths were of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991a</xref>: 27−36). There was no further discussion of the matter to determine whether Indigenous female detainees received a lesser standard of custodial care in Queensland than male detainees. On the other hand, the occurrence of eight self-inflicted male deaths in watch-houses around Queensland (particularly in northern remote regions) in less than a year prompted the RCIADIC to consider whether a ‘copycat’ syndrome existed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991a</xref>, pp. 19−20).</p> <p>Of the 11 females, nine were detained in police custody at the time of their death, one was in a children’s home and one was in prison for motor vehicle related offences. Six (55%) of the females died from poor health (or what the National Report termed ‘natural causes’) as opposed to external causes or from the harmful effects of alcohol or other drug abuse. Compared to this, only 31 of the 88 (35%) males investigated died from natural causes.</p> </sec> </sec> <sec id="section4-0269758012447218"> <title>Marital status and experiences of abuse</title> <p>Eight of the 11 females had during their lives either been married or been involved in de facto relationships. These relationships were generally marked by violence, mainly because of the consumption of alcohol by one or both partners. Six of the 11 had between one and six children each. The death reports of eight of the 11 females contained references to the deceased having been victims of physical or sexual abuse. In the cases of Nita, Joyce, Barbara (Yarrie) and Fay, the perpetrators were noted as their husbands or de facto partners. Nita’s husband had also been convicted for incest in 1976. In the cases of Faith, Barbara (Tiers) and ‘the woman who died at Ceduna on 18 February 1983’, there was either no reference to the identity of their assailants or there was simply a reference to the fact that they had been assaulted by members of the community. Karen had been raped by one of her mother’s cousins when she was two. She had also been raped less than a month before she died by an Aboriginal man (with an accomplice) who was 14 years older.</p> <p>Similarly, the deceased males had experienced much tragedy throughout their lives, including the death of children and partners. Forty-one of the 88 male deceased had during their life been married or had lived in a de-facto relationship. Many had been involved in relationships that were marred by violence and aggression or had been raised in families which exhibited such characteristics. The constrasting difference was that an analysis of the information contained in the death reports revealed that just over 55% had been convicted of offences involving assaults of a physical or sexual nature during their life. As will be explained below, this was not the offending pattern exhibited by the deceased females.</p> <p>Almost a third of the males were noted as having physically assaulted family members, including partners, children and mothers. Two had been convicted of killing their partners (one was convicted of manslaughter and the other of murder). There were 14 who were convicted of a rape, sexual assault, attempted carnal knowledge or indecent assault of adults and minors. The victims of two of the 14 had been male. Some of the wives or de facto partners of the deceased males were also noted as having engaged in assaults against their partners, but there was no further exploration of this fact to determine whether the assaults were committed in self-defence.</p> </sec> <sec id="section5-0269758012447218"> <title>Substance abuse</title> <p>All the females were described in the death reports as having alcohol or drug abuse problems. References were mainly made to their alcohol abuse, describing the deceased females as having had ‘a severe alcohol problem’; drinking ‘to excess’ or ‘heavily’; being ‘heavy user[s] of alcohol’; having had lives ‘dominated by alcohol’; being ‘rarely sober’; and being ‘itinerant’ or ‘chronic’ alcoholics. Indeed, except for Karen Lee O’Rourke, all the females had been arrested a number of times for alcohol related offences such as being drunk in a public place, drink driving, and disorderly conduct while under the influence of alcohol. All of the females, aside from Karen and ‘the woman who died at Ceduna on 18 February 1983’, had been consuming substantial amounts of alcohol at the time of their arrest for their last offence. In the case of ‘the woman that died at Ceduna’, her last arrest related to unpaid fines for being convicted for drunkenness. Her report does not indicate whether she was under the influence of alcohol at the time of her last arrest, although she was arrested on the footpath near the Community Hotel at Ceduna.</p> <p>One of the lawyers I interviewed made the following telling remark in relation to these women:<disp-quote> <p>This would have to be probably a rash generalisation, bearing in mind my limited memory of it, but I think the women we dealt with were basically alcoholics and street kids, whereas a lot of the young men that died were 21 to 22. They had been drinking the night before, but it wasn’t suggested that they were hopeless alcoholics. In fact, some of them [the males] may have been locked up for the first time at the time they committed suicide whereas the women that we dealt with … they were used to incarceration. (Non-Indigenous male lawyer, 11 March 2004)</p> </disp-quote>  Attributing the males, but not the females, a ‘victim’ and therefore virtuous status was reflected in other topics covered in the official reports. For example, the National Report and two of the regional reports contained comprehensive accounts of the manner in which colonization had affected Indigenous men and women. Generally, Indigenous men were portrayed as having suffered a greater loss of status as a result of colonization than Indigenous women. This conclusion stemmed from research work conducted by non-Indigenous anthropology, history and sociology scholars, both male and female. Indigenous women were regarded as having been protected from the full effects of colonization since their role as mothers and carers had (according to the commissioners) remained intact: ‘Whilst forced cultural change has had substantial impact on the traditional role of Aboriginal men, Aboriginal women even though they have been exposed to the same cultural forces have basically retained the role of gatherer and child carer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991b</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 376).</p> <p>Despite the prevailing view of the lawyers and commissioners that the males were a product of the dispossession and oppression which resulted from colonization, most of the aggression exhibited by the males was associated with alcohol abuse and most of their offending (whether public order, property or violent offending) was associated with alcohol or drug abuse. Although the commissioners’ opinions regarding the severity of any alcohol or drug dependency of the deceased were not always conclusive, 78 of the 88 death reports described the male deceased as being a heavy drinker, alcoholic or drug abuser. A further three of the males were said to drink but not excessively or to the extent that they had an alcohol problem.</p> </sec> <sec id="section6-0269758012447218"> <title>Offending history of the deceased females</title> <p> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758012447218">Kerley and Cunneen (1995</xref>) noted, in an article which considered the failure of the RCIADIC to adopt an intersectional race and gender approach, that:<disp-quote> <p>[n]one of the women was in custody at the time of her death for a serious offence … None of the women was incarcerated at the time of death for violent offences or property offences. Indeed the reasons for incarceration can only be described as minor. In the majority of cases the ‘crime’ was victimless. In other jurisdictions, and indeed for other women in the same jurisdiction, the conduct in question might have been treated as a health issue rather than a criminal problem (p. 547).</p> </disp-quote>  Indeed, at the time of their last arrest, five of the females were detained for drunkenness, three for unpaid fines, one for driving without a licence and while under the influence of alcohol, and one for indecent language. Karen Lee O’Rourke (the juvenile) was detained while arrangements were being made to return her to Sydney because she did not want to return to her most recent foster care placement.</p> <p>Although none of the females had been convicted of a violent offence at the time of their death, which is in stark contrast to the deceased males, a number of the females had previously engaged in various degrees of violent or aggressive behaviour. These offences included unlawful assaults against police, shouting at or abusing members of the public, disorderly behaviour that involved fighting, and robbery with violence. Such behaviour was, in all cases, described as being related to their excessive consumption of alcohol. One of the deceased females, Christine Lesley Ann Jones, had no assault convictions; however, she was described in the report as having a <italic>capacity for violence</italic> following the consumption of alcohol. Prior to Christine’s last arrest, she had violently assaulted her cousin by hitting her over the head with a beer bottle and jumping on her head (although interestingly, this incident was not the cause of her last arrest).</p> <p>A national police custody survey conducted by the Criminology Research Unit, a research unit established by the RCIADIC, confirmed that Indigenous women were vastly over-represented for offences of public drunkenness and disorderly conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758012447218">Biles and McDonald, 1992</xref>: 284). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758012447218">Kerley and Cunneen (1995</xref>) criticized the RCIADIC’s lack of gender-specific analysis in this regard (p. 534). In the inquiry’s defence, the death reports of the females did consider the topics of decriminalizing public drunkenness and avoiding the detention of people who are unable to pay fines, as well as the importance of assessing the condition of a detainee’s health at the time of arrest. These topics were further considered in greater detail in the National Report. Therefore, it can be argued that the commissioners did discuss matters that were pertinent to the offending patterns of Indigenous women. In making their observations, however, the commissioners did not take a gender-specific focus and could not therefore have adequately responded to the circumstances of Indigenous female offenders. In particular, questions pertaining to why so many of the females abused alcohol and other substances, thereby attracting the attention of authorities, needed to be raised. Answers may have pointed to the prevalence of abuse experienced by Indigenous women, as well as to concerns regarding their inability to properly provide for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758012447218">Kerley and Cunneen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758012447218">Payne, 1990</xref>).</p> </sec> <sec id="section7-0269758012447218"> <title>Official discourse of men’s violence</title> <p>In contrast to the manner in which the female deceased were described, the commissioners made specific mention of the fact that the family members and communities of the deceased males held them in high regard. They did this despite the fact that the deceased males had such violent tendencies. For example, Edward Frederick Betts, a highly skilled Australian Rules footballer, was noted as being ‘well regarded in the community and within his family’, although he was severely addicted to alcohol and his wife had obtained restraining orders against him for his violent behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991d</xref>: 2). Stanley Brown, who drank heavily and was prone to violent assaults against his tribal law wife that required hospitalization, was described in the report as being ‘highly respected in the Aboriginal community for his involvement in matters concerning traditional Aboriginal law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1990b</xref>: 2). ‘The man who died at Oodnadatta on 17 December 1983’ (his name was suppressed for cultural reasons) was a tribal man who used traditional law to punish others for breaches of customary law. He was described in his report as being ‘well respected within the Aboriginal community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1991c</xref>: 2). The deceased’s last arrest was a consequence of his committing two assaults occasioning bodily harm and one common assault against an Indigenous woman and her eight month old child, and his wife, whom he had married under traditional law. He was a heavy drinker and often intoxicated when committing offences of assault.</p> <p>Despite their numerous convictions for assault, often against their wives or other Indigenous women and children, there was no discussion of the importance of improving the safety of women and children in cases where traditional law is practised (often under the influence of alcohol) in any of the reports. It is impossible to determine in relation to each of these cases whether the commissioners felt an obligation towards family members or the community to include positive remarks that had been made about the deceased in the reports. While the statements no doubt accurately reflected certain aspects of the personality of the deceased, it is difficult to ignore the fact that the men were also extremely violent. At the same time, there was no critical reflection upon this fact, apart from connecting it to the excessive consumption of alcohol. This may have been deliberate on the part of the commissioners so as to avoid a perception of negative stereotyping of the deceased by non-Indigenous people. Indeed, seven of the non-Indigenous people interviewed commented that they or the Indigenous women they had spoken to did not want to disparage the males they were investigating.</p> <p>Although alcohol abuse was considered as an underlying issue in a number of reports and was recognized as contributing to the problem of violence in communities, the solutions offered tended to focus on the long-terms goals of acquiring self-determination and empowerment rather than on the immediate safety of members of the communities. For example, the <italic>Report of the Inquiry into the Death of Bernard Matthew Johnson</italic> contained a discussion of ‘alcoholism and violence on Aboriginal communities’. Bernard Matthew Johnson lived on Palm Island and at the time of his death was in custody for the manslaughter of his second wife. He had previously pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his first de facto wife. Both killings were very violent, involving repeated bashings to the body and head of the victims. In discussing the occurrence of violence on Palm Island, Commissioner Wootten emphasized that such behaviour was not considered normal or acceptable in Indigenous communities. He mentioned the fact that Indigenous women had formed support groups to discuss ways to cope with the violence but that Indigenous men had yet to fully address the cause of such behaviour. Wootten rejected using incarceration as a way to remedy the situation and instead suggested, re-invest[ing] Aboriginal society with opportunities to manifest independence and develop self-esteem: it may be a long process, but it will not begin until Aboriginal people are listened to with the respect that is shown people in authority, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758012447218">RCIADIC, 1990a</xref>: 37). While such advice is valid, the discussion did not highlight the more immediate need for safety for Indigenous women and children.</p> </sec> <sec id="section8-0269758012447218"> <title>Conclusion</title> <p>Overall, the tone of the death reports was sympathetic towards the difficult lives the deceased females had endured, and the commissioners were as critical of any negligent treatment by custodial officers and inadequate police and coronial post-deaths investigations as they were of the treatment given to the males who had died. It is clear from the information presented above, however, that there were certain characteristics and problems that were of particular relevance to the female deceased which were not explored by the commissioners. Overwhelmingly the view was that the inquiry focused on ‘race’, with an acknowledgement that Indigenous males were at the forefront of the racialized inquiry. The main explanation given for the racialized, male focus was that there was no requirement or request by Indigenous people to focus on gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758012447218">Marchetti, 2008</xref>). The disadvantaged position of Indigenous men, who were violent towards women, children and other community members, was afforded more concern and attention than the experience of Indigenous women at the hands of those men. Although other serious complaints emerged, such as the sexual assault and mistreatment of Indigenous women by police, they were put aside for the sake of saving the men from State inflicted forms of violence and thereby saving Indigenous people as a whole (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758012447218">LaRocque, 1997</xref>, who makes a similar argument in relation to the competing rights of Canadian Aboriginal men and women). By comparison, the introductory paragraph of the chapter in the AJI report, which focused entirely on Aboriginal women, gave the following reasons for requiring such a focus:<disp-quote> <p>Aboriginal women and their children suffer tremendously as victims in contemporary Canadian society. They are the victims of racism, of sexism and of unconscionable levels of domestic violence. The justice system has done little to protect them from any of these assaults. At the same time, Aboriginal women have an even higher rate of over-representation in the prison system than Aboriginal men. In community after community, Aboriginal women brought these disturbing facts to our attention. We believe the plight of Aboriginal women and their children must be a priority for any changes in the justice system. In addition, we believe that changes must be based on the proposals that Aboriginal women presented to us throughout our Inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758012447218">Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People, 1991</xref>, Vol. 1, p. 475).</p> </disp-quote>  The acknowledgement that Aboriginal women and children suffered from colonization in ways that were different from Aboriginal men paved the way for the AJI to consider the ways in which the justice system had failed Indigenous women separately to those for Aboriginal men. This led to the formulation of 19 recommendations, which specifically related to Aboriginal women and which included recommendations that:</p> <list list-type="bullet"> <list-item> <p>spousal and child abuse programs be established with the involvement of Aboriginal leaders and police forces;</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>shelters and safe homes controlled by Aboriginal women be established;</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>culturally appropriate alternatives to incarceration for Aboriginal women be developed;</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>women who were incarcerated be allowed to serve their sentences in Manitoba or in other facilities nearest to their home community;</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>children be able to frequently visit their mothers while in detention and to do all that was possible to ensure that the family was kept together;</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>Aboriginal women be appointed to the National Parole Board; and</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>halfway houses for Aboriginal women who were released from correctional institutions be established, and that they be managed by Aboriginal women.</p> </list-item> </list> <p>The RCIADIC’s treatment of the problems concerning Indigenous women, particularly those that were detrimental to their safety, was inadequate. Although there were many procedural constraints placed upon the RCIADIC’s ability to conduct its inquiry (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758012447218">Marchetti, 2008</xref>), there is evidence to suggest that inquiries, such as the AJI, were able to surpass similar constraints and adopt an intersectional race and gender approach. The importance of doing so is evident when one compares the different ways indigenous women were characterized by the two inquiries and the differences reflected in the resulting recommendations.</p> </sec> </body> <back> <ack> <title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>I would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their thought-provoking comments and ideas.</p> </ack> <notes> <fn-group> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0269758012447218"> <label>1</label> <p>The word ‘Indigenous’ is used in the Australian context in order to identify the group of people investigated by the RCIADIC.

The circumstances and the sheer number of Indigenous deaths in custody had fuelled the anger and suspicion of the families and relatives of the deceased. They demanded an inquiry into the deaths so that they could understand how the deaths had occurred. The federal government began to take these demands seriously, perhaps in part due to their fear of being embarrassed at the upcoming bicentennial celebrations by the discontent of Indigenous Australians, and finally established the RCIADIC with the promised cooperation of the State and Northern Territory governments, which was not, in the end, always forthcoming. Only one commissioner was initially appointed because it was assumed that there would only be approximately 44 deaths to investigate; however, realizing that the number of deaths that needed investigating was much larger, five other commissioners were appointed. A Criminology Research Unit and seven Aboriginal Issues Units were established to assist with the investigation into underlying issues.</p> </fn> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0269758012447218"> <label>3</label> <p>Bulbeck C (undated) <italic>The dark figures: How Aboriginal women disappeared from the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</italic>.</p> </fn> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0269758012447218"> <label>4</label> <p>Feminist and decolonizing approaches to interviewing are typically concerned with building a rapport with the people being interviewed.

The impetus for the AJI’s establishment was the alleged inadequacy of the police investigations conducted into the death of two Aboriginal people, Helen Betty Osbourne and John Joseph Harper. Helen Osbourne was killed in 1971 and it was only in 1987, 16 years after her death, that a man was finally convicted for her murder. Both the investigation into her death by police and the trial were criticized by many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people as having shielded the alleged killers from prosecution. Six months after the trial of Helen Osbourne, John Joseph Harper died during a struggle with police while being questioned about his identity. The Winnipeg Police Department claimed that the shooting was an accident, and exonerated the police officer involved the day after the shooting. Many people, particularly in the Aboriginal community, believed that several questions about the incident were left unanswered by the police service’s internal investigation. They claimed that it had been tainted by racial prejudice. These two deaths, as well as statistics that showed Aboriginal people were vastly over-represented in prison (the AJI report noted that, at the time of the inquiry, although Aboriginal people comprised only 11.8% of Manitoba’s population, they made up at least 50% of the Province’s prison population), prompted a call for a judicial inquiry into the manner in which Aboriginal people were treated by the Manitoba justice system. According to the scope of the inquiry, the AJI was to consider all aspects of the justice system in its investigation, including the police, courts and correctional services. Nothing in the terms of reference indicated that Aboriginal women were to be considered separately.</p> </fn> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0269758012447218"> <label>7</label> <p>When referring generally to First Nation Peoples, the term ‘indigenous’ is used.
