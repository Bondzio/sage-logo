<p>By the time this is printed, we should be finalizing our preparations for the 2<sup>nd</sup> International Case Conference at LUMS on 18–19 January 2013 (see AJMC 2013 poster included). We hope that this conference will be even more successful than the previous one since the case method philosophy is now gradually being adopted by many management institutions in Asia.</p>
<p>The first case in this issue is on the well known organization, Wipro Technologies (we had a case on Wipro in our last issue as well) and the Project Management communication issues that the company faces as it fulfills a major overseas assignment. It depicts the efficient communication practices followed by Nitish and the eventual fulfillment of the project by adhering to the communication plan and the project framework.</p>
<p>The Wipro case is followed by the MIS case, MCB: Implementation of the Symbols Project that tracks both the decision of Muslim Commercial Bank in Pakistan to convert to a US$ 1.7 million banking enterprise system and its roll out between 2002 and 2008. The complete project re-organization allows readers to understand the need to appreciate certain factors that may be deemed as trivial, especially where top-down IT enabled change is being implemented.</p>
<p>In Succession Management Challenges: The Case of a Family Business in the UAE, the company’s current survival and future development hinges upon the ability of the family members to make the right decisions together and evolve to adapt to changing environmental conditions to secure firm longevity.</p>
<p>The other two cases are from the healthcare sector but cover different topics. The Employee Strike at UHS by Qureshi and Mahmood traces the series of events that led to the crippling employee strike faced by the University of Health Sciences in 2009–2010. The case throws into question the leadership styles/philosophies employed by a wide variety of actors ranging from the Vice Chancellor (VC) of UHS, to the Board of Governors (BoG), the union office holders and even the provincial government. On the other hand, TeleSehat by Hassan and Farooq discusses the very new area of Telemedicine and its development in Pakistan. This case illustrates the use of innovation process by a technology company, Comcept, to build a profitable telemedicine startup in Pakistan, where previous efforts in telemedicine were rudimentary and philanthropic. The case brings to light the challenges and risks faced by Comcept, and concludes with Asad Karim trying to decide which strategic partnerships his organization should opt for, to transition from its startup stage to becoming profitable.</p>
<p>A big thank you once again to our reviewers and contributors. We are obliged to our readership for their continued patronage. A reminder that you may contact the authors directly to obtain the teaching notes. I hope you enjoy reading and teaching AJMC 9:2 cases.</p>
