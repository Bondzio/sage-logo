<title>News of ABCD: seminars</title>
<p>In the last issue of <italic>Information Development</italic> we reported on the webinars that had taken place. Many people who had heard about them on the Internet, particularly from the mailing list, were unable to see them in real time because of timetable problems in their work or because of not having sufficient bandwidth, causing the Elluminate software to cancel the connection.</p>
<p>The organizers of the seminars and the developers of the software led by Ernesto Spinak and Egbert de Smet reported that they had an excellent experience in sharing, in real time, presentations about the application of new technologies based on CISIS, and progress was shown about what was due to be available in the next release of ABCD.</p>
<p>Therefore, BIREME has made available the videos and documents presented to allow all interested colleagues to download them and view them conveniently in their own time. Also, those who already saw them in real-time have an opportunity to view them another time, possibly leading to new questions and comments.</p>
<p>If you get the chance to see them, the organizers would be very grateful for questions and comments: please send them to reddes.bvs-tech@listas.bireme.br with a copy to <email>isis-users@iccisis.org</email></p>

<title>J-ISIS for Macintosh</title>
<p>Jean-Claude Dauphin, the developer of J-ISIS, reports that a new release of J-ISIS for Mac OS X with many example databases is available on J-ISIS Kenai website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kenai.com/projects/j-isis/downloads/download/jisis-mac-10-June-2012.zip">http://kenai.com/projects/j-isis/downloads/download/jisis-mac-10-June-2012.zip</ext-link>. Additionally anyone interested in using J-ISIS on Linux Ubuntu may be interested by the following forum topic: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kenai.com/projects/j-isis/forums/forum/topics/523852-Instalaci%C3%B3n-en-UBUNTU-Linux">http://kenai.com/projects/j-isis/forums/forum/topics/523852-Instalaci%C3%B3n-en-UBUNTU-Linux</ext-link></p>
<p>Mr Dauphin may be contacted by email at jc.dauphin@gmail.com, or jc.dauphin@afus.unesco.org. If you contact him as a result of reading this, please mention that you have read this in <italic>Information Development</italic>.</p>

<title>J-ISIS for Windows</title>
<p>Mr Dauphin has issued a new intermediate release of J-ISIS available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kenai.com/projects/j-isis/downloads/download/jisis_suite%2026%20June%202012.zip">http://kenai.com/projects/j-isis/downloads/download/jisis_suite%2026%20June%202012.zip</ext-link></p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of Ernesto Spinak, this release can be run in Spanish as well as in English. Most of the GUI text is translated, however some text not yet. To run J-ISIS in Spanish, edit the jisis_suite.conf file which is in the /etc/ folder of the J-ISIS installation:</p>
<p>Edit the jisis_suite.conf file which is in the /etc/ folder, and change the command line switches as follows:</p>
<p>command line switches</p>
<p>default_options=“--branding jisis_suite -J-Xms512m -J-Xmx1024m</p>
<p>-J-Duser.language=<bold>en</bold> -J-Duser.country=<bold>EN</bold>
</p>
<p>-J-Dnetbeans.logger.console=true-J-ea-J-Dsun.awt.disableMixing=true”</p>
<p>Change the country code from English to Spanish as follows:</p>
<p># command line switches</p>
<p>default_options=“--brandingjisis_suite-J-Xms512m -J-Xmx1024m</p>
<p>-J-Duser.language=<bold>es</bold> -J-Duser.country=<bold>ES</bold>
</p>
<p>-J-Dnetbeans.logger.console=true-J-ea-J-Dsun.awt.disableMixing=true”</p>
<p>Save the <italic>jisis_suite.conf</italic> file and restart J-ISIS</p>
<p>Note that this release corrects a serious bug. The LesserThan (“&lt;”) and GreaterThan (“&gt;”) characters of HTML tags stored in fields were wrongly replaced by the HTML entities (&lt;) and (&amp;gt). Thus displaying HTML stored in a field produced by the ISIS Print Format was not interpreted as HTML and displayed as Plain Text. This is now corrected: HTML text stored in fields are now correctly displayed as HTML</p>

<title>Printing catalogue cards on a Laserjet</title>
<p>Gennady Zolot from the Institute of Mathematics in Kiev, Ukraine writes: How must I set up a printer (an HP Laserjet 1100), to print separate catalogue cards using CDS/ISIS for Windows (1.5, build 3) on the Windows 98 platform? He says he has used recommendations from the book: Buxton A. and Hopkinson A. <italic>The CDS/ISIS for Windows Handbook</italic> (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3077/">http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3077/</ext-link>) but a record from the database is not printed in the right place on the card and in the wrong font.</p>
<p>Piet de Keyser from Belgium replies: “You could print to a TXT file from CDS/ISIS print. In your pft you can end each card with a certain combination of characters (e.g. !!!) which will mark the end of the card. After this, you load the file into your word processor and you change the !!! into ‘new page’ using a global edit or manually if you cannot do it globally. At that point you can change the font to something that looks better. You must set the length of the page to the format of your catalogue cards (probably 3 × 5 inches).</p>

<title>Running ABCD in a 64-bit environment (e.g. Windows 7)</title>
<p>Many users are worried about running ABCD in a 64-bit environment. Egbert De Smet reports that he has been using ABCD for more than 2 years on a 64-bit PC (Windows 7 or Debian) without any problems. No virtual machine or anything similar is needed. He feels that some users are confusing the problem of running CDS/ISIS for Windows (which is a 16-bits application) in a 64-bit environment with running ABCD in 64-bit, which doesn't require anything in advance.</p>
<p>The reason for the difference is that the CISIS-executables on which ABCD is based are 32-bit which can run straightforward in 64-bits. </p>
<p>Users of ABCD will be pleased to know that in addition BIREME is experimenting with a 64-bit version of the CISIS-executables, which are already running fine. These are not really necessary but would offer a small performance gain by being natively 64-bit. So, running ABCD in 64-bits is not a problem.</p>

<title>Last occurrence of a repeatable field</title>
<p>Leo Riesthuis of the Netherlands says that for one of his ABCD databases he would like to display only the last occurrence of a repeatable field. What format will achieve this?</p>
<p>Bohdan Rames suggests that as in CDS/ISIS for Windows for, for example, repeatable v10 the format is: v10[nocc(v10)]</p>
