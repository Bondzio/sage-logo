<abstract>
<p>Is uniform color related to aggressive behavior? Prior research has produced mixed results comparing the effects of black (vs. colored) uniforms on aggressive penalties in the National Hockey League (NHL), and the effect of white (vs. colored) uniforms remains unexamined. Luckily, the NHL has conducted multiple quasi-experiments with uniform (jersey) color over time. To examine the color–aggression link, the authors analyzed the last 25 seasons of NHL penalty-minute data (649 seasons from 30 teams collapsed across 52,098 games). When teams wore black jerseys, they were penalized more than when they did not (<italic>d</italic> = 1.19; Study 1). When teams switched to wearing colored jerseys at home games, they were penalized more than when they wore white jerseys at home games (<italic>d</italic> = 0.83; Study 2). Collectively, these quasi-experimental findings suggest that black jerseys are associated with more aggression and that white jerseys are associated with less. The authors discuss possible causes for these color-aggression effects.</p>

<p>In the 2010, Darren Aronofsky film “Black Swan,” the Tchaikovsky ballet “Swan Lake” takes the center stage. The lead ballerina struggles with the physical and psychological demands of playing both the pure, innocent, and good white swan, and the seductive, deceptive, and evil black swan. In the film, color plays a symbolic role, showing the attitudes associated with the different roles. Color not only represents psychological associations but can also influence them. Relationships between color and attitudinal valence are pervasive in nearly every culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611418535">Adams &amp; Osgood, 1973</xref>), particularly associations between “black” and “bad”—and between “white” and “good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611418535">Williams, Moreland, &amp; Underwood, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence of such color-valence associations comes from experimental social cognition. Individuals implicitly associate the color black with negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611418535">Meier, Robinson, &amp; Clore, 2004</xref>), immorality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611418535">Sherman &amp; Clore, 2009</xref>), and criminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611418535">Vrij, 1997</xref>). This association exists early in development; young children believe dark boxes contain negative things (vs. white boxes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611418535">Stabler &amp; Johnson, 1972</xref>). Research on racial prejudice shows a strong connection between skin color and attitudinal valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611418535">Dasgupta, McGhee, Greenwald, &amp; Banaji, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611418535">Williams, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611418535">Wittenbrink, Judd, &amp; Park, 2001</xref>). Even within particular racial or ethnic groups, lighter-skinned individuals have more status and face less prejudice than darker-skinned individuals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611418535">Maddox, 2004</xref>, for a review). This effect also holds in 48 of 51 cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611418535">Iwawaki, Sonoo, Williams, &amp; Best, 1978</xref>); preferences for lighter skin are nearly universal among cultures that value skin color as a sign of beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611418535">Russell, Wilson, &amp; Hall, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, implicit attitudinal evaluations of the colors white and black are significantly related to implicit racial prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611418535">Smith-McLallen, Johnson, Dovidio, &amp; Pearson, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Black, White, and Aggression</title>
<p>Although the experimental social cognition literature shows some convincing color–valence associations, rarely have they been tested in applied settings with behavioral aggression. The most comprehensive investigation to date may be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich (1988)</xref>. In Study 1, they first showed that people unfamiliar with the National Hockey League (NHL) rated black jerseys as significantly more malevolent than nonblack uniforms. We performed a team-level secondary analysis of the mean ratings (their Table 1), which showed a significant difference (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>diff</sub> = 0.92, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>19</sub> = 4.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 2.22); teams that wore black jerseys were perceived as more malevolent than teams that did not (<italic>M</italic>s = 4.82 vs. 3.89, respectively).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich (1988</xref>, Study 2) also examined the effect of black jerseys on penalty minutes per game in 21 NHL teams from the 1970–1971 to the 1985–1986 regular seasons. Our secondary analysis of the standardized (<italic>z</italic>-scored) team means (their Table 3) showed a relation between black jerseys and aggression (<italic>M<sub>z</sub>
</italic>
<sub>diff</sub> = 0.94, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>21</sub> = 3.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 1.67); teams that wore black jerseys were assessed relatively more penalties than teams that did not (<italic>M<sub>z</sub>
</italic>
<sub>s</sub> = 0.79 vs. −0.16, respectively). Of the two teams that switched to black jerseys during the 16-season sample, one was penalized more (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 1.26) but the other was not (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.37). One limitation of this study is that only 2 (9.5%) of 21 teams switched to black uniforms during the 16 seasons, which provides a novel—but underpowered—test of the black uniform effect.</p>
<p>Frank and Gilovich (1998, Studies 3 and 4) even conducted experiments to test the effect of black (vs. white) uniforms on aggression. In Study 3, 20 high school football referees watched videotaped, staged football plays with ambiguously aggressive acts that could be assessed a penalty. Each play was carefully choreographed so that only the offending team’s uniform color (black vs. white) was manipulated. Referees rated the act to be more aggressive—and were more likely to penalize the team—when the team wore black versus white (both <italic>d</italic>s = 1.20). In Study 4, the 6 three-person groups that were randomly assigned to wear black jerseys chose more aggressive games to play with a fictional competing group than did the six three-person groups that wore white (<italic>d</italic> = 1.94).</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich’s (1988)</xref> two experiments (Studies 3 and 4) suggest either a black–aggression causal link—or a white–nonaggression one—their Study 2 could only show correlation and temporal precedence for a black uniform effect in the NHL. Recently, Caldwell and Burger (2011) sought to replicate this black uniform effect by comparing a subset of NHL games from the 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 seasons in which the eight teams that used black “third” jerseys played the same opponents in a pair of home games—once while wearing their normal dark-colored home jerseys and once while wearing their black third jerseys. Over 2 seasons, 102 pairs of games met these specific criteria for the 8 teams of interest. Although they tested multiple penalty measures related to aggression (e.g., penalty minutes at home and away games, severe penalties involving roughing and fighting), none produced a significant difference between black and dark-colored jerseys. For example, a paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test comparing home penalty minutes assessed in games when black jerseys were worn versus when dark-colored jerseys was nonsignificant (<italic>M</italic>s = 13.70 vs. 13.12 min, respectively, <italic>d</italic> = .09).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611418535">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although Caldwell and Burger’s (2011) study featured focused comparisons, its analyses were flawed because they were done at the game level instead of the team level. That is, they ignored the inherent dependency of pairs of games nested within teams. The independence-of-errors assumption is violated whenever nested data structures are ignored. Violation of the independence-of-errors assumption can dramatically alter statistical conclusions, yielding both Type I and Type II errors. Statistically, Caldwell and Burger tested an erroneous model in which all 102 game pairs were assumed to come from 102 different teams, when in fact they came from only 8 teams. Accordingly, their conclusions must be called into question.</p>

<title>Aggression and Penalties in the NHL</title>
<p>If caught by referees, perpetrators of on-ice aggression can receive penalties that range from spending 2 min in a penalty box to a game misconduct (ejection and suspension from the next game). Five-minute major penalties are assessed for violent infractions such as fighting, charging, and spearing (stabbing an opponent with the stick blade). Especially violent major infractions may draw a 10-minute penalty in conjunction with a game disqualification or game misconduct. Two-minute minor penalties are assessed for aggressive—but not necessarily violent—infractions (e.g., elbowing, kicking, kneeing, tripping, high-sticking). Minor penalties are far more frequent than major ones.</p>

<title>Uniform Color in the NHL: A Unique Natural Experiment</title>
<p>Currently, all NHL teams have at least two jerseys—a white jersey and a colored jersey featuring the primary team color—and about 80% of teams have a “third” or “alternate” jersey that features a secondary team color or logo.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past 25 years, numerous NHL teams have changed their jersey designs, logos, and—crucially for our purposes—uniform colors. With a much longer time horizon to draw from than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich (1988)</xref>, we were able to examine the effect of wearing—and switching to—black jerseys on aggression (measured using penalty minutes; Study 1).</p>
<p>The NHL additionally mandates whether the home or away teams wear white or colored jerseys, which would normally confound uniform color with home versus away status (which can affect penalties; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611418535">Glamser, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611418535">Lehman &amp; Reifman, 1987</xref>). The NHL, however, has changed its guidelines over time. Home teams wore white jerseys between the 1984–1985 and 2002–2003 seasons and colored jerseys between the 2003–2004 and 2009–2010 seasons (Study 2). Starting with the 1995–1996 season, the NHL allowed teams to create and wear third jerseys as an alternative to their normal colored jersey in roughly 10–15 games per season (12–18% of games).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550611418535">
<title>The Present Research: A “Hat Trick” of Goals</title>
<p>The goals of the present research were threefold. First, we sought to provide a quasi-experimental test of the black uniform effect—comparing penalties assessed to teams wearing black versus colored jerseys—across time (25 years) for all 30 NHL teams (Study 1). Second, we aimed to analyze penalty minutes at home games to test the effect of an NHL-wide quasi-experiment—teams switched from wearing white to colored jerseys at home games starting in the 2003–2004 season (Study 2). Thus, Study 1 tested the effect of black (vs. colored) jerseys, whereas Study 2 tested the novel effect of white (vs. colored) jerseys. Third, we sought to use multilevel modeling (MLM) to account for the nonindependent structure of data where seasons were nested within teams (Studies 1 and 2).</p>

<sec id="section6-1948550611418535">
<title>Study 1: Black Versus Colored Uniforms</title>
<p>A limitation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich (1988</xref>, Study 2) was that only 2 of 21 teams switched to black jerseys in their 16-year sample. A stronger quasi-experimental test of this effect would involve multiple switching replications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611418535">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>) of the black-versus-colored uniform effect in several teams. To this end, we analyzed the largest data set to date and hypothesized that black uniforms would be related to more penalty minutes than colored (nonblack) uniforms for the average team.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-1948550611418535">
<title>Penalty minutes</title>
<p>We collected NHL penalty infraction minutes (PIM) data for all teams from the 1984–1985 to the 2009–2010 regular seasons. This sample included data from 649 seasons for 30 teams collapsed across 52,098 games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1948550611418535">
2</xref></sup> The total PIM for the sample was 969,690 min (1.84 years). Per season, the PIM ranged from 710 to 2,781 min (median [Mdn] = 1,435; <italic>M</italic> = 1,494; <italic>SD</italic> = 399). Because PIM were positively skewed count data in which the mean and variance were nonindependent, we modeled these data using Poisson regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611418535">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1948550611418535">
<title>Jersey color</title>
<p>We collected data on jersey color using an online historical archive of NHL uniforms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1948550611418535">3</xref></sup> and used the same criterion as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich (1988)</xref>: for each season, we coded a team as having a black jersey if at least 50% of its colored, nonwhite jersey was black.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1948550611418535">4</xref></sup> In our sample, three teams wore a black jersey in all seasons (10%), 17 teams never wore a black jersey (57%), and 10 teams switched to—or from—wearing black jerseys at least once (33%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1948550611418535">5</xref></sup> Because third jerseys were worn in relatively few games and not used by all teams, and because in this study we analyzed season-level data aggregated across games, game-by-game third jersey use was not coded in the present studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611418535">Caldwell &amp; Burger, 2011</xref>). MLM was uniquely suited to examining PIM as a function of both within- and between-team variance in wearing black jerseys over time (seasons).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1948550611418535">
<title>MLM</title>
<p>Because of the hierarchical, nonindependent structure of these data (seasons nested within teams), we used MLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611418535">Nezlek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611418535">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). MLM is ideal for modeling these types of data where the number of level 1 observations per level 2 unit varies (number of seasons per team) and the independent variable of interest (seasons in which teams wore black jerseys), which varies both within and between teams, can be effectively modeled at the season level (level 1). This approach has several advantages, including the ability to model within- and between-team variance simultaneously. The coefficient of interest tested the average difference in PIM between seasons in which teams wore black jerseys (coded +0.5) versus when they did not (coded −0.5), controlling for season (i.e., year or linear time; group-mean-centered).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1948550611418535">6</xref></sup></p>

, top), and penalty minutes decreased between 1984–1985 and 2009–2010 (β<sub>10</sub> = −0.026, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = −18.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial correlation [<italic>pr</italic>] = −.96). The average team was assessed more PIM in seasons when they wore black jerseys (<italic>M</italic> = 1,528 min) versus when they wore other colored jerseys (<italic>M</italic> = 1,386 min), a difference of 142 min (10.2%)—1.73 min/game (104 s). This effect remained significant even after controlling for the lagged, autoregressive effects of PIM (i.e., the previous season’s PIM; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611418535">West &amp; Hepworth, 1991</xref>). Moreover, for the 10 teams that switched to—or from—black jerseys, the effect was marginally significant despite less power, and the effect size was larger (β<sub>20</sub> = 0.076, <italic>t</italic>

</fig>
<p>The data we obtained also had bench minor infraction (BMI) penalty minutes. BMI penalties typically result from personnel errors such as illegal substitutions or too many men on the ice; they are 2-minute penalties assessed against the whole team rather than an individual player, and accounted for only 1.14% of all PIM. Distinguishing between BMI and non-BMI penalties is important for two reasons. First, non-BMI penalties are typically aggressive acts (fighting, roughing, elbowing, kicking, kneeing, tripping), whereas BMI penalties are typically nonaggressive mental lapses (being on the ice when one should not). Second, a quasi-experiment can benefit from the addition of a nonequivalent dependent variable because it helps rule out threats to internal validity and helps bolster the construct validity of the effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611418535">Shadish et al., 2002</xref>). We thus expected a black uniform effect for aggressive (non-BMI) penalties but not for nonaggressive (BMI) ones. BMI and non-BMI penalties were not significantly correlated. Analysis of non-BMI penalty data showed a similar effect to that of all PIM data (β<sub>20</sub> = 0.102, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 3.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 1.20). This effect remained significant even after controlling for the lagged effect of non-BMI PIM. In contrast, analysis of BMI penalty data showed no such black versus nonblack jersey difference (β<sub>20</sub> = 0.0076, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 0.18, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = .07). Collectively, these ancillary analyses supported a key dissociation: the black-versus-colored uniform effect generalized to aggressive penalties but not nonaggressive ones.</p>

<p>In Study 2, we used MLM to test the average effect of multiple, team-level quasi-experiments to examine a link between wearing white-versus-colored jerseys and aggression at home games. As noted above, the NHL conducted a league-wide quasi-experiment starting with the 2003–2004 season: all 30 teams switched from wearing white jerseys to colored jerseys at home games. Thus, we tested the NHL’s jersey-color quasi-experiment and hypothesized that the switch from white to colored jerseys would be related to increased penalty minutes at home for the average team.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>To test the effect of the NHL’s switch from wearing white to colored jerseys at home games on aggression, we needed data that separated team-level penalty minutes between home and away games. We found such data but only for the last decade (2000–2001 to 2009–2010 regular seasons).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1948550611418535">7</xref></sup> Due to a lockout, the 2004–2005 season was cancelled. This resulted in 9 years of data for each of 30 teams (<italic>N</italic> = 270 seasons). Each team played an 82-game season (41 home, 41 away); thus, the data represented penalty minutes collapsed across 22,140 games. We assessed team jersey colors using the methods described in Study 1.</p>

<sec id="section17-1948550611418535">
<title>MLM</title>
<p>To analyze these data, we used a series of multilevel interrupted time series (MITS) models. This is conceptually analogous to conducting an interrupted time-series analysis for each of the 30 teams and then averaging the resulting parameter estimates to test the effect for the average team. This approach has multiple advantages. First, interrupted time-series meet two of the three requirements for causality (correlation and temporal precedence; the third is random assignment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611418535">Kenny, 2004</xref>). Second, whereas most interrupted time-series are case studies (<italic>N</italic> = 1), our MITS models featured the combined power of multiple simultaneous replications (<italic>N</italic> = 30). Third, MITS models allow important concomitant variables to be controlled in the time series (e.g., accounting for Away PIM when modeling Home PIM). The MLM tested the average difference in Home PIM between seasons before (coded −0.5) and after (coded +0.5) the uniform color policy change, controlling for Away PIM (group-mean-centered) and year (centered between the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons to reflect the time of the policy change).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1948550611418535">6</xref></sup>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>In a preliminary analysis, we replicated our Study 1 results, showing that teams were significantly more aggressive (i.e., assessed more penalty minutes) at home games during seasons in which they wore black jerseys (β<sub>40</sub> = 0.059, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 2.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = .77) for the average team, controlling for season and Away PIM.</p>
<p>Regarding the main analysis, teams were significantly more aggressive (i.e., assessed more penalty minutes) at home games after they switched to wearing colored jerseys at home during the 2003–2004 season (vs. wearing white jerseys at home before 2003–2004; β<sub>30</sub> = 0.091, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 2.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.83; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611418535">Figure 2</xref>
; this effect was not significantly moderated by season). In addition, penalty minutes decreased between 2000–2001 and 2009–2010 for the average team (β<sub>20</sub> = −0.018, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = −2.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>pr</italic> = −.41), and Away PIM were positively related to Home PIM (β<sub>10</sub> = 0.00074, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 5.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>pr</italic> = .68). The average team was assessed more Home PIM in seasons when they wore colored jerseys at home in 2003–2004 (<italic>M</italic> = 615 min) than when they wore white in 2002–2003 (<italic>M</italic> = 561 min), a difference of 54 min (9.6%)—1.32 min/game (79 s). This effect remained significant even after controlling for (a) the lagged effects of Home PIM and Away PIM (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611418535">West &amp; Hepworth, 1991</xref>) and (b) seasons in which teams wore black (vs. colored) jerseys (Study 1).</p>

<p>The top panel shows a predicted-scores spaghetti plot of interrupted time series analyses for all 30 teams (thin gray lines) and the average team (thick black line) in which penalty infraction minutes (PIM) at home games (Home PIM) were regressed onto PIM at away games (Away PIM), season, and the policy switch from wearing white to dark-colored jerseys at home games, which occurred between the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons; this is the effect of interest. The bottom panel shows a magnification of the top panel at the point of greatest interest: the jersey policy switch between the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons. Here, the predicted-scores spaghetti plot shows the difference in Home PIM between the 2002–2003 (white jerseys at home) and 2003–2004 (colored jerseys at home) seasons for all 30 teams (thin gray lines) and the average team (thick black line). These difference slopes are enlargements of the intercept shifts (regression discontinuities) shown in the top panel.</p>

<p>In the latter analysis, the effect of black jerseys was reduced to nonsignificance (β<sub>40</sub> = 0.052, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 1.24, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.46); however, this was a weak test of the effect because all teams wore white at home games before the policy switch; there was no black-versus-color effect to test then. A more robust test—the simple black-versus-color effect after the switch—showed a marginal effect (β<sub>40</sub> = 0.087, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = 1.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, <italic>d</italic> = 0.63), suggesting that the association between white jerseys and less aggression may be stronger than that between black jerseys and more aggression; however, one would expect a weaker effect across 6 seasons versus 25 (see Study 1).</p>
<p>Quasi-experiments can benefit from the addition of nonequivalent dependent variables because they address possible threats to validity such as history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611418535">Shadish et al., 2002</xref>). The data we obtained (2001–2010 seasons) had not only Home PIM and Away PIM, but also the number of goals each team scored per season at home and away games. Because the uniform change should affect aggression (penalties) but not performance (goals) in home games, we expected a null effect for the latter, despite the fact that these variables were positively correlated for the average team (<italic>r</italic> = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). To this end, we re-ran the above model substituting home and away goals for home and away PIM, respectively. In contrast to Home PIM, analysis of Home Goals showed no such difference relating to the 2003–2004 switch in home jersey color (β<sub>20</sub> = −0.0019, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>29</sub> = −0.07, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = −0.02). This ancillary analysis supported a key dissociation: the white-versus-color uniform effect generalized to aggression (penalties) but not performance (goals).</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Collectively, the present results show links between black (vs. colored) uniforms and more aggression, and between white (vs. colored) uniforms and less aggression. To be sure, one issue these studies cannot empirically resolve is whether (a) black jerseys are causing more aggression, (b) white jerseys are causing less aggression, (c) both are affecting aggression in opposite directions, or (d) the supposed causal link is spurious (a “third-variable” problem). Nevertheless, the findings of Study 2 suggest that the white-jersey–less-aggression association may be stronger than that of the black-jersey–more-aggression one. Although true experiments are difficult to conduct in settings that involve real physical violence such as professional hockey, we feel that these quasi-experimental findings—for which temporal precedence was established—come closer to establishing a causal link than do one-time correlational studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611418535">Kenny, 2004</xref>). Together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich’s (1988</xref>, Studies 3 and 4) experimental research on uniform color and aggression, our quasi-experimental findings point to a possible causal color–aggression link in professional hockey but not a definitive one.</p>
<p>The effect sizes were large by convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611418535">Cohen, 1988</xref>), ranging from <italic>d</italic> = 1.19 (Study 1) to <italic>d</italic> = 0.83 (Study 2). On the whole, our effect sizes were comparable to those for the black (vs. white) uniform effect on referees in Frank and Gilovich’s (1998) research (<italic>d</italic>s = 1.67, 1.20) but not in Caldwell and Burger’s (2011) study (<italic>d</italic> = 0.09). One reason why the effect size of Caldwell and Burger’s study may be small—in addition to its analytic problems of ignoring nonindependent data—may be that its sample included too few games to iron out many game-level idiosyncrasies. Specifically, their study included data from only 204 games, which is less than 0.4% of the present research’s sample based on 52,098 games. Given the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers, effect sizes based on a larger sample are generally more stable and replicable than those based on smaller ones.</p>
<sec id="section20-1948550611418535">
<title>Limitations and Implications</title>
<p>Although our findings suggest a color–aggression link, one question they cannot address directly is whether uniform colors affect aggression or perceptions of aggression—or both. In related research, participants who imagined wearing red (vs. blue) perceived themselves as more threatening and dominant than their opponent (white); when asked to imagine their opponents wearing red (vs. blue), participants (white) perceived their opponents as being more threatening and dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611418535">Feltman &amp; Elliot, 2011</xref>). That is, penalty minutes alone cannot tell us (a) whether teams are more or less aggressive based on the color jerseys they are wearing, (b) whether teams’ opponents or the referees are simply more likely to see teams in darker or lighter jerseys as more or less aggressive, or (c) some combination thereof. Nevertheless, given Frank and Gilovich’s (1998) experimental evidence suggesting that both aggression and perceptions of aggression can be affected by black (vs. white) uniforms, we believe both factors may contribute to our findings. Our findings do suggest, however, that the color–aggression effect in jerseys is related neither to nonaggressive penalties (BMI) nor performance (goals scored).</p>
<p>One possible limitation of the present research is the ecological fallacy—inferring the behavior of players and judgments of referees based on the aggregate measures of games, seasons, and teams. That is, what is observed at a higher unit of analysis (teams) may not necessarily reflect the process in a lower unit of analysis (individuals). Nevertheless, the inverse fallacy—also called the individualistic fallacy or compositional fallacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611418535">Rentfrow, 2010</xref>)—is equally problematic when we wish to infer that an individual process or phenomenon also holds for groups, and in sports, aggression often operates at both the individual and team levels.</p>
<p>A limitation of any quasi-experimental design is lack of random assignment. Without random assignment, one cannot determine whether a “third,” confounded variable may be partially responsible for the observed effects. A possible confound in interrupted time-series designs is the threat of history—that some unmeasured event may be confounded with the event of interest. Because both of our studies used multiple replications across 30 teams, however, the odds of a third-variable explanation seem remote.</p>
<p>A key strength of the present research is that it features professionals engaged in actual aggressive behavior in a real-world applied setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611418535">Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Funder, 2007</xref>), versus undergraduates’ self-reports of aggression in a laboratory setting. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that there are clearly other, stronger determinants of on-ice aggression (e.g., height, weight; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611418535">Webster, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611418535">Webster &amp; Xu, 2011</xref>) that far outweigh the contribution of jersey color.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1948550611418535">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In professional hockey, uniform color is related to aggression. Our findings suggest that wearing black (vs. colored) jerseys are associated with more aggression (Study 1), that wearing white (vs. colored) jerseys are associated with less aggression (Study 2), and the latter effect may be stronger than the former (Study 2). Nevertheless, our findings cannot speak to whether black jerseys are causing more aggression, white jerseys are causing less aggression, or both. Whether the color–aggression effects are due to the uniform wearer, the opposing player, the referee, or all three, also remains an open question. Because we used quasi-experimental methods, the case for causality is stronger than that for a simple correlational study. Although we cannot completely rule out all “third-variable” explanations, our use of switching replications and nonequivalent dependent variables suggest that threats to validity such as history are unlikely. We believe that this effect adds to a growing literature on the psychological associations between color and valence.</p>

<p>The number of games per season varied from 80 (1984–1985 to 1991–1992), to 84 (1992–1993 to 1993–1994), to 48 (1994–1995, a season shortened by a lockout), to 82 (1995–1996 to 2009–2010, with the exception of 2004–2005, in which no games were played due to a lockout). Because we wished to use penalty minutes per season as the outcome rather than penalty minutes per game, we adjusted the penalty minutes for all seasons to be based on the current 82-game season. For example, if a given team had 1,400 penalty minutes in an 80-game season, then it was multiplied by 1.025 (i.e., 82 of 80) to yield 1,435, which is the adjusted amount for an 82-game season; these are equivalent in terms of penalty minutes per game (i.e., 1,400/80 = 1,435/82 = 17.5 min/game). Because the number of NHL franchises grew over time, from 21 in 1984–1985 to 30 in 2000–2001 through 2009–2010, the number of seasons per team also varied. Specifically, the range was such that 21 (70%) of 30 teams had data from 1984–1985 to 2009–2010, whereas 2 (7%) new teams had data only from 2000–2001 to 2009–2010. Thus, the modal and median number of seasons per team was 25 (<italic>M</italic> = 21.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.63). The four NHL franchises that moved to different cities between 1984–1985 and 2009–2010 were considered the same team because their player rosters remained largely unchanged.

<p>All NHL teams have one white jersey and at least one colored jersey; each is worn in 50% of their games (i.e., home teams wore white jerseys between the 1984–1985 and 2002–2003 seasons and colored jerseys between the 2003–2004 and 2009–2010 seasons; away teams wore colored jerseys between the 1984–1985 and 2002–2003 seasons and white jerseys between the 2003–2004 and 2009–2010 seasons). Because home-versus-away data were unavailable at the team level going back the 1984–1985 season, we could not make this comparison in Study 1; we address it in Study 2.</p>

<p>The 10 teams that switched to or from black jerseys showed a variety of quasi-experimental designs (where B = black jersey seasons and O = other, nonblack jersey seasons): 3 teams had traditional treatment designs (OB), 2 had removed treatment designs (BO), and 5 had repeated treatment designs (four OBO and one OBOB). Luckily, MLM allows for these various within-team designs to be analyzed collectively and simultaneously in conjunction with the 3 teams that always wore black jerseys and the 17 that never did. Having multiple switching replications across multiple teams not only reduced the possibility of history as a threat to validity but also increased the generalizability of our results. Replicating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611418535">Frank and Gilovich (1988)</xref>, we examined season-level data, which collapses across home and away games.</p>
