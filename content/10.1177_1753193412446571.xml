<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Traumatic dislocation of the carpus is a rare complex condition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446571">Garcia-Elias et al. (1989)</xref> classified axial dislocations of the carpus, in which the carpus splits into two columns, into two major types: axial-radial dislocations, in which the radial column becomes unstable and is displaced proximally and radially; and axial-ulnar dislocations, in which the ulnar column is displaced ulnarly and proximally. We describe the case of a patient who had an axial-ulnar dislocation without derangement of the pisiform or the triquetrum, but had a fracture in the hook of the hamate. We have also speculated about the mechanism underlying the dislocation in our patient.</p>
<p>A 45-year-old male machinist presented with pain and swelling in the ulnar aspect of his hand after his right hand was trapped in a rotating rubber-band machine. There was no open wound or evidence of vascular insufficiency or paraesthesia. Radiographs showed complete dislocation of the hamate and dorsal dislocation of the base of the fourth metacarpal bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412446571">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Computed tomography showed dissociation between the third and fourth metacarpals and a displaced fracture of the hook of the hamate, while the pisotriquetral joint was found to be intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412446571">Figure 1(b)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412446571">(d)</xref>). Closed reduction was attempted without success. Using a dorsal approach, the dislocated hamate was reduced using a small periosteal elevator as a lever between the hamate and triquetrum. The reduced hamate bone and metacarpal joint were temporarily fixed using four Kirschner wires (K-wires), and the ruptured ligament was not repaired. The fracture of the hook of the hamate was stabilized using one headless compression screw (HCS, 3.0 mm; Synthes, Switzerland) through a volar approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412446571">Figure 2</xref>). At seven weeks after surgery, the K-wires and splint were removed, and active and passive range-of-motion exercises for the fingers and wrist were initiated. At the final follow-up (16 months after surgery), the patient has achieved almost full range of motion, or almost full, range of motion of the wrist and finger joints and did not have any tenderness in the region located directly over the hook of the hamate; the grip strength of the injured hand has been restored to at least 90% of that of the uninjured hand.</p>

<p>We postulate that this patient developed this injury because of combined traction and rotation force owing to the rotating rubber band. Because the ulnar portion of the hand was trapped in the rotating rubber band, the fourth metacarpal bone was subjected to traction and rotation force, resulting in rupture of the intermetacarpal ligament between the third and fourth metacarpals, the palmar and dorsal transverse interosseous ligaments and the ulnar limb of the arcuate ligament. Subsequently, the hamatometacarpal ligament ruptured and a fracture occurred in the hook of the hamate because of the transverse application of consistent rotation force. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412446571">Matsumoto et al. (2005)</xref> suggested that the pisohamate ligament pulls the pisiform bone out of its normal position during dislocation of the hamate and pisiform. In our case, we thought that the traction and rotation force were not transmitted to the pisiform bone through the pisohamate ligament because of the fracture of the hook of the hamate; therefore, the triquetrum–pisiform ligament remained intact.</p>
<p>The findings obtained in our case are similar to those for the perihamate, peripisiform type of axial-ulnar dislocation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446571">Garcia-Elias et al. (1989)</xref>; however, our case also differs in that the patient developed a fracture at the hook of the hamate without dislocation of the pisiform, and such cases are rare.</p>
