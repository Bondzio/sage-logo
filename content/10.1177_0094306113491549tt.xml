<p>Five years before Marx and Engels published <italic>The Communist Manifesto</italic>, French feminist socialist political activist Flora Tristan wrote <italic>The Workers Union</italic>, which included the now famous words, “Workers of the world, unite!” Such discourse sparked the formation of the first international labor and socialist organizations in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Industry-specific international trade secretariats (ITSs) soon appeared thereafter, forming in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Despite these and countless other efforts, such as more recent campaigns targeting sweatshops in Asia, Latin America, and the United States, the world’s workers have not united (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Armbruster-Sandoval 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491549">Brooks 2007</xref>). Why haven’t they done so?</p>
<p>In his important and somewhat polemical new book, <italic>AFL-CIO’s Secret War Against Developing Country Workers: Solidarity or Sabotage?</italic>, long-time labor activist and sociologist Kim Scipes provides a clear-cut answer—the AFL and later the AFL-CIO (the two labor federations merged in 1955) undermined efforts by workers in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America for more than a century to organize themselves into labor unions. This isn’t “breaking news” as Scipes’ extensive and exhaustive bibliography demonstrates. Rank-and-file labor activists such as Fred Hirsch (with whom Scipes has often collaborated), writers, and scholars have published numerous exposés, articles, pamphlets, and books over the past five decades documenting the nefarious role that the AFL-CIO played in sabotaging the formation of labor unions in the Global South.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this rich body of literature, which Scipes has amply contributed to for thirty years, very few U.S. workers, along with the wider general public, know about this “secret war” that started in the 1880s with the AFL’s first president, Samuel Gompers. As Scipes convincingly shows, Gompers laid the foundation for what became known as “bread-and-butter unionism” or business unionism, which is a narrow vision of unionism based on obtaining better wages and working conditions within the confines of capitalist society. Originally a socialist, Gompers eventually embraced an extremely reformist and reactionary approach, seeking to maintain and protect the privileged position of white skilled male workers vis-à-vis women and developing country workers (often called “workers of color”) within the United Sates. That is to say, not only did Gompers oppose the formation of authentic labor unions in Latin America in the 1900s, he opposed organizing workers of color <italic>inside</italic> the United States; he was, therefore, neither an internationalist nor an <italic>intra-nationalist</italic>. It is important to note here that Gompers, the AFL, and the AFL-CIO did not oppose all forms of unionization in the developing world. Organizations that backed the federation’s business unionist principles, which most crucially did not threaten U.S. corporate and foreign policy interests, were tolerated and supported with funding and training. Called “free” trade unions during the Cold War period, these organizations often undercut and blocked the growth of more authentic and sometimes radical labor unions that adopted anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist positions.</p>
<p>The broad goal of the AFL-CIO’s activities, Scipes argues, was to make the world safe, not for what passes for “democracy” (which is really, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113491549">Bill Robinson’s [1996]</xref> work, polyarchy or elite rule), but Empire, or U.S. imperialism. Using three case studies to demonstrate this point, Scipes shows how the AFL-CIO directly intervened to overthrow a democratically-elected socialist government that supposedly threatened U.S. corporate and foreign policy interests (Chile in 1973); supported authoritarian regimes and efforts by “free” unions that backed them to weaken, if not eliminate, progressive labor unions (Philippines in the 1980s); and collaborated with local labor movements to topple socialist, pro-labor governments (Venezuela in the early 2000s).</p>
<p>The latter event, coming several years after AFL-CIO President John Sweeney closed down the federation’s four labor institutes in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America and opened up a new organization called the American Center for International Labor Solidarity (or the “Solidarity Center”), generated significant controversy because it indicated that labor had still not completely shed its old skin. And yet, aside from this important example, the Solidarity Center, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic, has played a crucial role in the formation of labor unions in the garment industry over the past fifteen years, a point that Scipes completely overlooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Armbruster-Sandoval 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113491549">Ross 2004</xref>). In his rush to categorically condemn the AFL-CIO, Scipes, for example, singles out the Solidarity Center’s Jeff Hermanson for attending a meeting with a “very controversial labor organization” in Haiti in 2004, while ignoring the important work that Hermanson did in the aforementioned countries. Moreover, since when does attending a single documented meeting constitute something nefarious? Scipes should know better; during the Red Scare in the 1950s, people who attended various meetings of relief-oriented organizations were mistakenly called “communists,” even though many were not party members. Such guilt-by-association, McCarthy-like allegations are unfair and malign the vital work that Hermanson and other Solidarity Center staffers have done and are still doing. Aside from the Center’s highly questionable and unethical role in the failed coup against Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, there is little evidence to show that the Solidarity Center and hence, the AFL-CIO, is still involved in a “secret war” against developing country workers. Such a war may still be taking place, but to substantiate such an argument one needs more empirical evidence, which is not provided in this volume.</p>
<p>Thus, while I find the book’s historical analysis of the AFL and the AFL-CIO’s activities (particularly in Latin America) thoroughly documented with ample evidence from primary and secondary sources, it is much weaker on the federation’s contemporary policies. Other than Venezuela, what other “smoking guns” are out there? I agree with Scipes that the AFL-CIO should embrace “social justice” or “social movement unionism,” but wish that he had recognized that there are some within the federation and Solidarity Center who are, in fact, trying to do just that. That is, they are attempting, as Flora Tristan, Marx, and Engels called for, to unite the world’s workers from Wal-Mart, Nike, and many other corporations. Such efforts will take time and warrant our critical support, not unsubstantiated allegations and innuendo. We simply need more hard data to show that the AFL-CIO’s “secret war” is still on-going; that said, the struggle for “another labor movement” and “another world” continues.</p>
