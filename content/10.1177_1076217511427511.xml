<p>This article calls for a new paradigm of professionalism in the field of gifted education. The definition of professionalism varies, and yet the need for a common vision of professionalism in the field is necessary to strengthen gifted education in the future. The authors delineate a framework for sustaining professionalism within the field and ask for commitment from the field’s stakeholders to long-range planning, fidelity with flexibility, and a collaborative infrastructure.</p>

<p>The definition of “professionalism” for teachers has evolved dramatically. The traditional view of a professional educator has included knowledge of scientific and research-based best practices, a well-developed set of technical skills to implement these practices, and the judgment needed to adjust these practices to fit specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427511">Anderson &amp; Herr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217511427511">Labaree, 1992</xref>). The current demands of our educational world, however, have expanded the view of what is needed for professionals well beyond the knowledgeable, technically skilled practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217511427511">Goldhaber &amp; Hannaway, 2009</xref>). Today’s educational professionals must be self-reflective thinking individuals who use and produce knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427511">Hegarty, 2000</xref>). They must have the ability to collaborate with others as part of a team of professionals, parents, and community members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427511">Hiebert, Gallimore, &amp; Stigler, 2002</xref>), and they can expect to fill leadership roles influencing policy and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217511427511">Kincheloe, 2004</xref>). Today, professionalism includes the teacher as a researcher in a dynamic process of continuous learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427511">Anderson &amp; Herr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217511427511">Kincheloe, 2004</xref>). In addition, teachers are required to frame their practice in multicultural understandings and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427511">Hegarty, 2000</xref>). What defines teaching as a profession, and thus calls for standards of professionalism, is the idea that it is a praxis (e.g., a set of practices used in complex ways) that requires reflection and continual growth for success. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217511427511">National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (2002)</xref> identified a profession as being “characterized by certain attributes. Chief among those are a body of specialized, expert knowledge together with a code of ethics emphasizing service to clients. The knowledge base typically provides substantial, but not complete, guidance for professional practice. Professionals possess expert knowledge, but often confront unique, problematic situations that do not lend themselves to formulaic solutions . . . Professionals deal with urgent human problems: matters of life and death, justice, hope and opportunity.” (p. 6)</p>
<p>The National Board standards for teaching, therefore, offer one view of these professional qualities for teachers. Other sets of standards, however, view professionalism in teaching differently, and a complex paradigm of what makes today’s teacher a professional is emerging. In this article, we explore this new paradigm of professionalism, examine the infrastructure needed to support today’s professionals, and offer some thoughts on how we can bring professionalism to scale within gifted education.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217511427511">
<title>New Paradigm of Professionalism</title>
<p>Although there are many, sometimes conflicting, views of professionalism, one area of agreement is that members of a profession have a shared body of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427511">Hegarty, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217511427511">Kincheloe, 2004</xref>). The teacher’s use of knowledge differs from other professionals in that educators must draw on a body of knowledge (e.g., theories of teaching and learning) and work to impart a body of knowledge (the subject or curriculum) to their students. Implicit in this is that there are at least two kinds of knowledge required for educators: subject knowledge and professional knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427511">Hegarty, 2000</xref>). Teacher knowledge is critical to teacher practice and both are multifaceted and dynamic. Teaching is intelligent behavior brought to bear on moment-to-moment decision making regarding how to help students learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427511">Hegarty, 2000</xref>). This decision making hinges on the insights that link general knowledge with specific contextual needs, and the ability to do this well is part of the teacher’s professional repertory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427511">Hiebert et al., 2002</xref>). Teaching is therefore a thinking profession. Teachers are not simply technicians mechanically following rote algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217511427511">Labaree, 1992</xref>). Indeed, the professionalism of teaching is reflected in the insightful use of a complex knowledge base to achieve the goal of teaching: that students learn.</p>
<p>The knowledge base of a professional teacher is not static: it evolves with experience, it is validated through the shared wisdom of a collaborative team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427511">Hiebert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217511427511">Talbert &amp; McLaughlin, 1994</xref>), it is enhanced by continued professional development, and it expands through inquiry action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427511">Anderson &amp; Herr, 1999</xref>). In these ways, a professional’s knowledge is both consumed and generated within a continuous improvement loop. And although professionalism can be defined at the individual level, it must be nurtured and supported through a team approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427511">Hiebert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217511427511">Talbert &amp; McLaughlin, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217511427511">National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (2002)</xref> emphasized that teachers maintain their roles as members of learning communities. Although the traditional view of the teacher is of a solitary figure at the front of a classroom, today’s paradigm of professionalism is diametrically opposed to this model of isolation. If we return to our earlier definitions, we see that each aspect—a growing body of knowledge, dynamic decision making, and collaboration in the community—is facilitated by a supportive team approach. In this vein, education may take a cue from medicine, which has also concerned itself recently with professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217511427511">Swick, 2000</xref>). Professionalism is a specific quality taught and evaluated in medical schools. A “professional” doctor is one who, among other things, is continually mastering a body of knowledge, values performance over reward, and is dutiful to a mandate of service to the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217511427511">Cruess, Cruess, &amp; Johnston, 1999</xref>). Teachers may see a parallel in their profession’s description, as they are expected to have a body of knowledge and also serve altruistic purposes that place the student’s needs foremost.</p>
<p>But, doctors are <italic>not</italic> expected to achieve this level of professionalism on their own. Medical professionals consistently work within a team that includes nurses, doctors, medical technicians, and dozens of others in their communities. A doctor not only improves his or her knowledge of the field by participating in continuing research and attending conferences but also relies on other members of the professional community to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of each patient. When a primary care physician refers us to a radiologist for an X ray and then consults with an orthopedist for a conclusive diagnosis, we do not accuse the primary care physician of not being knowledgeable. Indeed, we expect a team to focus on our medical needs. The doctor working in a community of professionals is what exemplifies good medical practice. Professionalism in teaching should look quite the same with a team of professionals collaborating to address the needs of the student.</p>

<title>Building Capacity to Support a Community of Professionals</title>
<p>It is difficult to operate professionally in a vacuum. A community of professionals with the infrastructure to support professionalism is key to success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217511427511">Fixsen, Naoom, Blasé, Friedman, &amp; Wallace, 2005</xref>). What are the elements of this infrastructure? The infrastructure needed to support professionalism includes policies that guide practice, professional development and technical assistance (TA), research and evaluation, and the provision of adequate resources to do the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427511">Gallagher, 2006</xref>). The elements of this infrastructure combine to provide support for high-quality practice. Each element will be examined in light of its role in supporting a community of professionals in education and more specifically in the area of gifted education.</p>
<sec id="section3-1076217511427511">
<title>Policies That Guide Practice</title>
<p>Social policies are designed to shape practices on a large scale framing the expectations for practice and determining the parameters under which professionals will operate. Policy is a key element of a professional infrastructure because it helps to define and standardize practice in a way that hopefully leads to degree of constancy and quality assurance. A useful definition of social policy is,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Social policy creates the rules and standards by which scarce resources are allocated to meet almost unlimited social needs. An effective social policy should answer the following questions:</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list1-1076217511427511" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Who shall receive the resources?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Who shall deliver the resources?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What are the resources to be delivered?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What are the conditions under which the resources are delivered? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217511427511">Gallagher, 1994</xref>, p. 337)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>When we think about gifted education, policies addressing these questions are usually found at the state level in the definitions of who qualifies for formal identification, teacher licensures, and endorsements within gifted education, and programming guidelines for supports and services for students who are gifted. Although these specific policies are usually determined by state (e.g., legislators) and local (e.g., school boards) decision makers, <italic>direction for policy should come from the profession</italic>.</p>
<p>The existence of practice standards to direct policy is one indicator that a profession is coming to maturity. The National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) has developed a set of pre-K to Grade-12 programming standards (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217511427511">Table 1</xref>) that frame expectations for the field. These standards describe what we do as professionals and lay out our professional activities.</p>

<p>The NAGC programming standards give student outcomes for each of the six areas: learning and development, assessment, curriculum and instruction, learning environments, programming, and professional development. Evidence-based practices for educators are also described, showing what educators can do to support students in reaching these outcomes. The term <italic>evidence based</italic> is currently being used in a variety of ways. Generally, it is used to show that a body of work has reached a threshold of reliability and/or validity. Evidence-based practice, however, is not synonymous with research-based practice and it is more reflective of the new paradigm of professionalism. Three things are essential in establishing the evidence base for a practice: the research base, the wisdom of respected practitioners, and the values held by the community that will be implementing the practice.</p>
<p>The research base for a practice is built over years of looking at how the practice works in a variety of settings, under a variety of circumstances, and with a variety of constituents. This takes time to build and, for the most part, is reflected in publications that are peer reviewed where colleagues adjudicate the work (i.e., research journals). A research base is also tied to a theoretical base, which anchors the practice within a larger body of research. Thus, the theories are both developed from and continue to inform the evidence base for a practice.</p>
<p>The wisdom of practitioners, which is equally important in the establishment of a practice as “evidence based,” is generally seen through the wide adoption of the practice, the acceptance of the practice by key advocates and organizations, the transmission of the practice through standards and guidelines that are accepted by the field, and through publications that are practitioner oriented (e.g., teacher journals). The body of knowledge that represents “teacher craft” moves from the individual to the collective wisdom of what works in practice through deep and sustained collaborative dialogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427511">Hiebert et al., 2002</xref>). This collective wisdom moves teacher craft knowledge from the private individual domain into the public domain of shared professional knowledge. At this point, the practice also influences policies, as exemplified in the NAGC programming standards.</p>
<p>Finally, to be useful, the practice must fit well with the values of those who will be using it. The evidence base must respond to the core ideas and beliefs held by those who implement the practice because they feel that it addresses their needs. This responsiveness is seen through the commitment made to implement the practice and through the inclusion of the practice at all levels of implementation. Generally, this commitment is fostered by the success seen during the early implementation of a practice and, as a result, support for the practice grows—rather than diminishes. The NAGC programming standards and the evidence-based practices they describe can be used to guide the development of new policy and to review or evaluate existing policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217511427511">
<title>Professional Development and TA</title>
<p>A second element of infrastructure needed to support professionalism is the availability of professional development (preservice and in-service) pathways and of TA support. Professional development and TA are essential because they address the knowledge and skills needed for practice, and, as described above, a shared knowledge base is the foundation of a profession. Where are we in gifted education regarding this element?</p>
<p>The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) and its division The Association for the Gifted (TAG) in collaboration with the NAGC has defined the body of knowledge needed to be a teacher of students with gifts and talents. These teacher preparation standards outline the “initial” knowledge and skills needed for gifted education and share what we need to know and be able to do to practice professionally (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1076217511427511">Table 2</xref>). One of the issues not explicitly covered, however, is just how long it takes to actually reach a masterly level of these standards. One does not become a master carpenter simply by having a kit of tools or become a colonel by completing officer’s training school, and one does not become a master teacher by obtaining a certificate. Many years of experience seem to be required to reach the highest levels of professional practice. Professionalism is an ever-evolving target; the longer we practice and the more we learn, the more we grow professionally.</p>

<p>The establishment of standards for professional development is a solid starting place; however, without systematic provision of pre- and in-service support, it is difficult to establish a community of practicing professionals.

The picture becomes even bleaker when we see that schools and districts offer limited access to in-service professional development opportunities specifically for the gifted and talented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217511427511">Westberg et al., 1998</xref>) and that only 5 states require that all teachers complete preservice work focused on gifted and talented learners. This means that building a professional cadre of teachers within gifted education remains heavily dependent on the accessibility of limited pre- and in-service professional development opportunities.</p>
<p>TA support goes beyond professional development to focus on the implementation of new ideas and practices, incorporating these through a two-way communication process that promotes change or innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427511">Gallagher, 2006</xref>). TA operates as a goal-focused partnership between the TA provider and practitioners that is client centered, focused on making a difference, based on access to knowledge from research and proven practice, anchored in a valuing of diverse ideas and input, and committed to building trust with the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217511427511">Trohanis, 2001</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427511">Gallagher, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The term <italic>technical assistance</italic> has been used in many different ways, and it sometimes seems to refer to any kind of help given to an individual or program. Because of this, we would like to define TA as it has been used for more than 40 years at the Frank Porter Graham (FPG) Child Development Institute (The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). TA, FPG style, refers to a specific approach to assist programs in need with an organized type of multidisciplinary support. The key elements of this support are the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217511427511" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Trust—The client seeking assistance must be sure that their sharing of the vulnerabilities of the program will not be used for negative decisions later on.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Self-reflective needs assessment—The client provides an analysis of program strengths and weaknesses and a statement of what they wish to improve.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>TA contract—A written plan, including specific goals (specified by the client) and a time frame, stating what will be done to meet the client’s needs is developed. The TA provider states what will be done and who will be responsible for delivering the services.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Evaluation—The TA provider and client establish clear indicators that will identify whether the TA provider has met the contract goals.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The confidential relationship between the client and the TA provider means that this kind of support cannot be given by anyone who has the power to inflict negative outcomes on the client as a result of vulnerabilities revealed during the process. Because of this, the TA provider cannot be in a supervisory role over the client, and the support provided should lie outside the standard hierarchy of authority. Without this type of protection, the client is unlikely to provide the kind of information needed to make real improvements in their program. This is why the TA provider cannot be in a supervisory role with the client.</p>
<p>Although there are successful models of TA in the area of special education, currently, we have a limited capacity to provide <italic>any kind</italic> of support for gifted education to schools and districts and virtually no capacity to offer TA as we have defined it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427511">CSDPG and NAGC, 2009</xref>). Only 23 of the 46 states self-reported as having at least one full-time person dedicated to gifted education in their state department of public instruction, and only 9 states reported having additional state-funded gifted education professionals who could provide TA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427511">CSDPG and NAGC, 2009</xref>). In spite of the limited personnel available, 26 state directors responding to the <italic>State of the States</italic> survey described one of their major responsibilities as providing TA by telephone, and 17 indicated that they provide TA to local education authorities in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427511">CSDPG and NAGC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the help provided by telephone can be real and meaningful, and we understand the dilemma of limited state personnel who <italic>must</italic> provide support for schools and districts, this response and the questions that prompted it on the survey lead to two concerns. First, if we view TA as we have defined it above, sustained TA that leads to real change cannot be completed over the telephone. And second, to be most successful, the TA provider should not be in direct hierarchical authority to the client. From our view, the information in the <italic>State of the States</italic> report is a misunderstanding of TA and paints a false picture of hope that camouflages the actual lack of available TA needed to support schools and districts.</p>

<title>Research and Evaluation</title>
<p>Research and evaluation are additional components necessary to a quality professional education system. Professional teachers need to be aware of their impact on issues related to their instruction. Although often similar in procedures and operations, the goals of research and evaluation differ. Research is designed to add to our sum of knowledge about gifted students and their instruction. Much of these investigations are done in higher education institutions, which create a gap between schools and research knowledge. This gap needs to be filled through better communication linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427511">Gallagher, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Evaluation studies are designed to provide data that will allow decision makers to support or diminish special program efforts in gifted education. The increased attention paid to educational accountability has involved school staff more directly. The design of studies to demonstrate the value of special programs for education of gifted students has many complexities that range far beyond the standard achievement tests or end-of-grade tests. They may include, for example, rating scales for special student essays or projects.</p>
<p>The miniscule amount of funds that are available to support research and evaluation efforts have come from some interested foundations and from federal funds through the <italic>Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act</italic> of 1988. These funds have included support for a National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, which has focused in part on the syntheses of research in the social sciences and education relevant to education of gifted students. It is uncertain whether even these limited funds will continue, and, if they are terminated, this may thrust gifted education into a prescientific era and reduce the professionalism that is now present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1076217511427511">
<title>Adequate Resources</title>
<p>The infrastructure to support a community of professionals must also include the allocation of adequate resources. The <italic>State of the States in Gifted Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427511">CSDPG and NAGC, 2009</xref>) report on 45 states that self-reported on funding available for gifted education indicates that 23 states provide some level of funding for gifted and talented programming, and the funds provided range from less than 1 million to 50 million or more; 12 states indicate that no state funds are available for gifted and talented programming and an additional 10 states did not respond to this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427511">CSDPG and NAGC, 2009</xref>). This patchwork quilt of funding with such acute discrepancies makes it difficult to generalize on the levels of support available, but given that these funds are primarily available for programming, it seems logical to assume that limited funds are available at the state level for other purposes (e.g., the provision of personnel preparation and TA; program evaluations). This lack of funds reflects our inability to make a strong case for why the education of students with gifts and talents should be a priority. Without a compelling case as to why this is an imperative, public policy will follow public opinion and funds for gifted education will likely remain at minimum levels. Without adequate resources, it is difficult to build the infrastructure needed to support and sustain professional practice.</p>

<title>Bringing Professionalism to Scale</title>
<p>Bringing the existing pockets of excellence that can be found in any field to scale is a time-consuming and complex task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217511427511">Fixsen et al., 2005</xref>). We believe that three activities are central to expanding capacity for professionalism within gifted education: establishing long-term commitment and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427511">Gallagher, 2006</xref>), creating fidelity approaches that honor flexibility of implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511427511">Coleman &amp; Shah-Coltrane, 2011</xref>), and integrating practices within a collaborative framework of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217511427511">Kirk, Gallagher, Coleman, &amp; Anastasiow, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1076217511427511">
<title>Commitment and Long-Range Planning</title>
<p>In his discussion of the future of special education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427511">Gallagher (2006)</xref> said that “Given the unfinished nature of much of the comprehensive planning in many states, establishing comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-range planning is a significant issue” (p. 179). Perhaps even greater difficulties can be anticipated for long-range planning within gifted education. One of the major barriers faced by gifted education is the lack of a federal mandate for the field—placing all of the responsibility at the state and local levels. The resulting fragmentation of services and supports across the states (discussed above) makes advocating for a long-range plan of national scope seem almost impossible, but two things can give us hope. First, federal legislation addressing the needs of students with gifts and talents is being proposed. The proposed Talent Act includes provisions for assessment and accountability, supporting classroom practice through professional development, addressing underrepresentation issues, and strengthening research and dissemination. If passed, the Talent Act would provide a unifying agenda for planning.</p>
<p>The second cause for hope is that our two major professional organizations, CEC/TAG and NAGC are working in collaboration to strengthen the field. This work is reflected in the joint standards discussed earlier, in shared position statements, and in aligned efforts to support federal legislation. We believe that a logical next step would be the crafting of a national agenda—a long-range plan of action for the field that can be supported by both organizations. This task would not be easy, and it would require a substantial commitment, but the time and energy needed would be well spent. If this plan can be developed, it would give states direction for the future and would provide a strong platform for continued advocacy at the state and federal levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1076217511427511">
<title>Fidelity With Flexibility</title>
<p>Initial attempts to increase the professionalism of a field often focus on the consistency and quality of services provided by practicing professionals. Gifted education has begun this process with the programming standards, which describe what we do as a profession. A deeper focus on quality and consistency, however, means looking at the fidelity with which these practices are implemented. Fidelity of implementation is the extent to which an approach or practice is implemented as it was designed or intended to be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217511427511">Detrich, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the major traps of fidelity, however, is that the “practice” becomes rigidly codified into a narrowly prescribed approach limiting its applicability and generalizability. Fidelity of implementation must be reconceived to incorporate flexibility to make practices applicable across multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511427511">Coleman &amp; Shah-Coltrane, 2011</xref>). Establishing fidelity with flexibility is essential to bringing ideas to scale. Fidelity with flexibility hinges on the creation of “flex points” (decision points) built around the anchors that define the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427511">Coleman &amp; Shah-Coltrane, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511427511">Coleman and Shah-Coltrane (2011)</xref> offered these thoughts:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Flexibility is a critical part of fidelity because it prevents implementation from becoming a “no-think” approach with rigid applications that disregard the specific strengths and needs [of the context]. Flexibility respects the professionalism of implementers, honors the specific circumstances and context of the implementation site, and allows the practice to become fully integrated where it must ultimately grow and live. Flexibility also promotes ownership and sustainability of the practice. (p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fidelity without flexibility undermines professionalism by removing teacher judgment, which is critical for adapting a practice so that it will work within a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>An example of a fidelity-of-implementation rubric designed to capture flexibility is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1076217511427511">Figure 1</xref>, looking at high-end differentiation in the classroom. Rather than offer a prescriptive checklist of specifics (e.g., the teacher will use curriculum compacting with at least three students allowing them to bypass math lessons when they show mastery), the sample rubric in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1076217511427511">Figure 1</xref> defines the critical components of differentiation and then describes what these would look like as an emerging, developing, proficient, and optimal practice.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1076217511427511-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This type of rubric forms the base for professional development because a teacher can use it to reflect on where she is and to plan for where she would like to improve. Descriptive rubrics assume that a thinking individual will be making the specific decisions needed to create the outcomes described (i.e., which specific differentiation strategies will work best for her and with her students). A next step for the programming standards would be the development of fidelity of implementation rubrics that describe what these best practices look like as they are implemented in multiple contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1076217511427511">
<title>Creating a Collaborative Infrastructure</title>
<p>Just as professional practice cannot thrive in a vacuum, gifted education cannot flourish in isolation. Gifted education cannot be a fix for poor general instruction, and it cannot be an island of excellence in a sea of mediocrity. To truly succeed, gifted education must exist within a culture that supports excellence for all learners. This means that gifted education must engage in meaningful collaboration with all aspects of the educational community. For example, collaborative partnerships can be built with Title I focused on enrichment and family involvement, with English language learner programs focused on children with high potential, with special education looking at the needs of students who are twice exceptional, and with general education looking at the role of high-end differentiated instruction. Collaboration, however, should go beyond the professional community to include families and community members who have vested interest in the success of students with gifts and talents.</p>
<p>Given today’s economic climate, collaboration is not just the right way to work—it is an imperative. As resources dwindle, isolated services are often the first to be cut. Through collaborative partnerships, however, fragmented and redundant services can be replaced with integrated synergistic services. Becoming part of the conversation and working to establish collaborative partners is key to bringing good practices within gifted education to scale.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1076217511427511">
<title>Final Thoughts</title>
<p>We have tried to make the case for a renewed commitment to professionalism at the individual and institutional levels. To do this, we have called for the creation of a shared vision with a long-range plan of action, the development of fidelity with flexibility tools to describe and clarify best practices, and the creation of a collaborative infrastructure to support professionalism in practice. We believe that without a commitment to renewed professionalism, we risk becoming isolated, fragmented, and irrelevant. Through professionalism, we can forge and strengthen linkages with other stakeholders who are committed to excellence in education for all learners.</p>
