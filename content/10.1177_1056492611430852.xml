<abstract>
<p>This paper shows how ambiguity arises across multiple strategizing activities through the presence of multiple strategic actors within and across different strategizing phases. During the authoring phase, the intentionality of the different management actor voices becomes detached from the meaning expressed in the strategy text, resulting in a decontextualized, monovocal strategy paper. In the translation phase, the study shows how the text still possesses an inherent multivocality making it impossible to talk about strategy text as an atemporal, neutral object. In the phase of interpreting the strategy, three main rhetorical positions are identified among the employees:acceptance, ambiguity and rejection, representing the multivocal interpretations of the employees interviewed. The study contributes to the ongoing discussion about the challenges and potentials of the multivocal, multicontextual nature of strategizing in organizations.</p>

<p>In recent years, the emergent approach to strategy has gained influence, increasingly focusing on contextual aspects of strategy development and thereby to a larger extent taking the dynamics and complexity of strategy creation and implementation into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611430852">Johnson, Langley, Melin, &amp; Whittington, 2007</xref>). One central aspect within this line of research is the notion of ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611430852">Alvesson &amp; Sveningsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611430852">Davenport &amp; Leitch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski, Sillince, &amp; Shaw, 2010</xref>), which is seen as an inherent dimension in all complex organizations. In this article, we investigate further the notion of ambiguity. By taking the discursive aspects of strategy work into greater consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611430852">Vaara, 2010</xref>), the overall aim of the study is to investigate how ambiguity arises through the various phases of strategizing (strategy authoring, translation, and interpretation).</p>
<p>Through the study of a strategy process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611430852">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492611430852">Langley, 2007</xref>) entailing strategy authoring (strategy formulation), strategy translation (dissemination of the strategy), and strategy interpretation (sensemaking of strategy communication), we will use a micro-level analysis of organizational communication. Thus, we seek to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the challenges and potentials of the ambiguous nature of strategizing in organizations, and specifically to the field of organizational communication.</p>
<p>The structure of the article is as follows: after a review of the literature on strategizing and ambiguity and the presentation of the overall research aim and research questions, the theoretical framework of the article is provided. Following this, the data and the methods used are introduced, and an analysis of the different data sets is outlined. Finally, the findings are presented and discussed in terms of their implications for theory and practice.</p>

<title>Strategizing and Ambiguity</title>
<p>Strategy-as-practice is a field of research that takes its point of departure in a social constructivist understanding of strategy. Its main interest lies in the study of strategy from a microanalytic, dynamic, and interactional perspective, thus having “strategizing,” the making of strategy, as its main focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611430852">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Strategy is here defined as “a situated, socially accomplished activity, while strategizing comprises those actions, interactions and negotiations of multiple actors and the situated practices that they draw upon in accomplishing that activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski, Balogun, &amp; Seidl, 2007</xref>, pp. 7-8). This means that strategy is seen as dynamic and of relevance to the whole organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski &amp; Spee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611430852">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). This perspective opens up for a view on strategy as a social accomplishment that takes place at various levels of action and interaction involving various members of an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611430852">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492611430852">Whittington, 2007</xref>). This approach is central to this article, in that it focuses on various micropractices of strategy work.</p>
<p>Researchers recognize the unavoidable existence of multiple viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611430852">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>), and ambiguity is often seen as a key dimension in all complex organizations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492611430852">Weick (2001)</xref>, ambiguity is central to and existent in “all aspects of organizational activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492611430852">Weick, 2001</xref>, p. 44), ranging from formal to informal activities and including all organizational members. In line with this, it has been largely acknowledged in strategy research that ambiguity is a central feature of strategy work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611430852">Alvesson &amp; Sveningsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611430852">Davenport &amp; Leitch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Lately, there has been an increased awareness of the complexity of ambiguity in organizational communication in general and in strategy research in particular. The complexity entails its potential for facilitating multiple understandings and its potential challenge for organizational unity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski et al. (2010)</xref> put it, “On the one hand, ambiguity is a political resource that might help with generating action. However, ambiguity also enables partial and multiple meanings and interests to proliferate, which obscure action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski et al., 2010</xref>, p. 221).</p>
<p>The fact that ambiguity can be used as a resource within organizational communication is represented by the notion of strategic ambiguity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611430852">Eisenberg (1984)</xref> refers to this notion as “those instances where individuals use ambiguity purposefully to accomplish their goals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611430852">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>, p. 230). Hence, by stating that “there are many situations in which ambiguous communication can be more helpful than clear communication, particularly during periods of rapid change and uncertainty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611430852">Fløttum, 2010</xref>, p. 992), Fløttum emphasizes that ambiguity can be used intentionally by management to facilitate multiple understandings of specific activities relevant for the organization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611430852">Davenport and Leitch (2005)</xref> follow the understanding of ambiguity as a discursive strategic resource by showing how strategic ambiguity can be a means to delegate authority in organizational discourse. They focus on the role of strategic ambiguity in change processes and show that strategic ambiguity can open up for the cocreation of meaning between multiple stakeholder groups. Hence, their study gives insight into how ambiguity can be used strategically to enable creative responses from various stakeholders.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski et al. (2010)</xref> also focus on ambiguity as a resource by showing how strategic ambiguity can be used as a discursive resource by different strategic actors to balance between individual interests and collective organizational goals. Based on the development of four rhetorical positions, they develop a conceptual framework to explain how strategic ambiguity can be used as a resource for collective action while facilitating individual interests.</p>
<p>As a response to the prevalent focus on ambiguity as a strategic resource, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611430852">Giroux (2006)</xref> introduces the term <italic>pragmatic ambiguity</italic>. Pragmatic ambiguity seeks to acknowledge that more than one course of action can be the result of a specific initiative. Ambiguity is seen as something that can be exploited intentionally, but this approach also acknowledges that not all ambiguity is the outcome of intentional acts. Instead, ambiguity can emerge by itself, as the author elaborates, “Published texts also acquire a life of their own, sometimes far removed from the intention of their authors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611430852">Giroux, 2006</xref>, p. 1232). Thus, pragmatic ambiguity acknowledges that numerous interpretations are inevitable, while highlighting that numerous interpretations do not necessarily have to challenge collectivity and unity: “the equivocality of concepts allows for <italic>different courses of action</italic> while maintaining a semblance of unity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611430852">Giroux, 2006</xref>, p. 1232).</p>
<p>By applying a communicative and processual perspective on ambiguity, the current study contributes to the above outlined research that highlights the complexity and dynamics of strategic activities.</p>
<p>The study wishes to investigate in detail the role of communication during a process of strategy authoring, translation, and subsequent interpretation with regard to the way in which various organizational members (management and employees) are part of creating, shaping, and responding to ambiguity. By doing so, we hope to contribute new insight on the nature of ambiguity as it occurs over time across multiple strategic contexts and actors.</p>
<p>The study will focus on how ambiguity arise during and in between the various phases of strategizing involving multiple strategic actors?</p>
<p>In particular, the paper will address the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1056492611430852" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What activities and social practices are related to ambiguity?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What is the role of these activities and social practices during the various strategizing phases?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These questions position the current study in a tradition of strategy-as-practice research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611430852">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>) and process-oriented strategy research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611430852">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492611430852">Langley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Before moving on to our research design and analytical section, we will establish our theoretical framework, which forms the basis for our empirical study.</p>

<title>Organizational Communication: Perspectives and Implications for Strategizing</title>
<p>In recent years, organizational communication has become a lens through which we can describe and explain organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611430852">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611430852">Jablin et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611430852">Jablin &amp; Putnam, 2001</xref>). In recent decades, there has been an increased interest not just among communication scholars but also within organization and strategy studies (e.g., Balogun, Jacobs, Jarzabkowski, Mantere, &amp; Vaara, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611430852">Mantere &amp; Vaara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611430852">Hendry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1056492611430852">Vaara, Kleymann, &amp; Seristö, 2004</xref>) in a paradigmatic approach, termed the <italic>linguistic turn</italic>, which focuses on the study of organizations as complex discursive formations where discursive practices are both “in” organizations and productive of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611430852">Alvesson &amp; Kärreman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611430852">Deetz, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611430852">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611430852">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611430852">Spee &amp; Jarzabkowski, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated how individuals engage in communicative interactions to make sense of the environment in which they operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492611430852">Smircich &amp; Calas, 1987</xref>). It is through these interactions that the continual creation and reaffirmation of interpretations emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611430852">Brown, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1056492611430852">Putnam, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611430852">Spee &amp; Jarzabkowski, 2011</xref>). Consequently, communication is understood as a central way of creating and supporting the meaning of strategy development and implementation, and this article, therefore, uses the field of organizational communication as a way to describe and explain the formulation and implementation of strategy instead of conceptualizing communication as simply one phenomenon among others in organizations.</p>
<sec id="section3-1056492611430852">
<title>Multivocality</title>
<p>One way of conceptualizing discursive complexity is by using the phenomenon of multivocality (or polyphony) in discourse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611430852">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611430852">Goffman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492611430852">Klewitz &amp; Couper-Kuhlen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492611430852">Kotthoff, 1998</xref>), manifested by the fact that speakers are forever switching into different voices of their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611430852">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>). Hence, the communication model moves away from the simplistic idea of strategy communication as message exchange between sender and receiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492611430852">Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949</xref>) to an understanding of communication as a complex, multivocal process.</p>
<p>Previously, strategic decisions have in many cases been seen as having a unidirectional, instrumental importance, as they are defined as decisive in the commitment of an organization to a particular course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611430852">Hendry, 2000</xref>) or as a means of mobilizing and facilitating action and distributing responsibilities for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611430852">Brunsson, 1990</xref>). In much business communication literature, communication strategies are often described primarily in instrumental ways, characterized as intentional communicative efforts designed to achieve a particular result (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611430852">Bienvenu &amp; Timm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611430852">Clampitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611430852">Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611430852">Fernandez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492611430852">Hynes, 2008</xref>). However, a deliberate and intentional view of communication strategy does not fully account for how communication operates in organizations, regardless of what it is intended or planned for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611430852">King, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The multivocal setting is a metaphor of the situated context in which the various organizational actors act, communicate, and encompass sender and receiver communication, in that the actors continuously assume both roles and enter into relations with one another as they communicate to, with, against, about, and past each other—resulting in multivocality. Thus, the traditional understanding of strategy communication as a one-way directed event seeing the organizational members as one homogeneous, passive stakeholder group disregards the fact that all members of the organization communicate within their individual, situated context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611430852">Burke (1955)</xref> describes situated context broadly as “the relation between the verbal act and its nonverbal scene,” one that is grounded in “the conditions of sensory experience” (pp. 205-206). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611430852">Burke’s (1945)</xref> pentad—which calls for an analytic focus on act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose—scene is the situated context, or details about when and where a communicative act occurred. Thus, Burke views context as situational, related to a particular communicative event, and grounded in the participants’ perspectives. For the current study, the concept of multivocality is crucial as it helps us uncover the complex, dynamic, and multilayered communicative processes constituting strategizing activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1056492611430852">
<title>Recontextualization</title>
<p>In the course of developing a strategy, managers do not only produce written documents. They also produce a lot of talk. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492611430852">Samra-Fredericks (2003)</xref> in line with others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611430852">Kotter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492611430852">Mintzberg, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1056492611430852">Watson, 1995</xref>) points out, “It is undisputed that when we observe managers/strategists at work, what we see is a lot of talk” (p. 143). Whereas written documents usually represent the fixed strategy product, talk is part of the dynamic, complex negotiation process that takes place while the strategy is developed. Moreover, talk plays a crucial role when the written strategy is translated for numerous members of the organization to achieve a common understanding of the organization’s identity and goals.</p>
<p>The sociodiscursive approach to communication described above raises awareness as to the complex interrelation between strategy text, strategy talk, and organizational contexts, which ties in with Ricoeur’s notion that “‘the text possesses an inherent plurivocity that allows it to be construed in more than one way,’ as it may be interpreted by multiple individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611430852">Spee &amp; Jarzabkowski, 2011</xref>, p. 6). Ricoeur differentiates between text and talk through the notion of distanciation. Distanciation occurs when the meaning of talk, that is, during strategy development meetings, is inscribed in the text, that is, the final strategy document. During this process, the mental intentions of the senders, that is, the individual strategy team members, become detached from the meaning expressed in the text, leading to a decontextualization of the strategy paper. According to Ricoeur, the formulated strategy text is freed from the context-bound and situational talk on which it is based, and appears as an atemporal object, which can be neutrally presented during organization-wide meetings (for instance) with the goal of informing the rest of the organizational members of the strategy that has been decided on. During these meetings, the strategy nevertheless becomes recontextualized and embedded into a situated context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611430852">Burke, 1955</xref>), which is different from the one in which it was authored. Invariably, the various actors (senders [managers] and receivers [managers and/or employees]) will try to relate the strategy text to their current, contextually embedded situation, in which the talk takes place, that is, the organization-wide information meeting, as well as the speaker’s role in the organization. As the strategy text inscribes decontextualized meaning in new contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492611430852">Ricoeur, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611430852">Spee &amp; Jarzabkowski, 2011</xref>), each member of the situated context—driven more by individual priorities than by overall strategic assumptions—has the ability to interpret the strategy text in multiple ways, leading to ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Strategizing in Various Multivocal Settings</title>
<p>On the surface, the formulation and organizational dissemination of a strategy text seems to run through various stages very similar to the simplistic communication model of Shannon and Weaver (sender–message–receiver), in that management acting as a sender communicates the strategy message to the employees acting as passive receivers. However, the idea of various situated contexts adds considerable complexity to the entire process. A framework (called “schema”) for studying how people become organized by interacting has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611430852">Cooren and Fairhurst (2004)</xref>. To achieve strategic change, it is necessary for a change to occur in the actors’ interpretive schemes (the fundamental shared assumptions that determine the way the members of an organization conceive of their organization and their environmental context and how they act in different situations). Thus, some level of shared understanding needs to exist for coordinated activity to occur in that the shared aspects of the individual schemata leads to an enacted reality at group level in the form of routines, rituals, systems, norms, and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492611430852">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>). As a result, the structure of interactional sequences contributes to the enactment of organizational forms—in other words, how interactants collectively initiate, fulfill, and close “organizational schema” to coordinate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611430852">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004</xref>, p. 794). Based on co-orientation, there is a logical, problem-solving sequencing of events in a schema that provides actors with a basis for sensemaking. Thus, sensemaking processes are social and cognitive processes used by organizational members to resolve the uncertainty and ambiguity that follow the initiation of strategic change processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611430852">Balogun &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). This generic form highlights the conditions of action (i.e., necessity, willingness, know-how, and means), the performance, and its consequences. Inspired by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611430852">Cooren and Fairhurst (2004)</xref>, we distinguish between three strategizing events: authoring, translation, and interpretation:</p>
<p>The initial situated context, which we have termed <italic>authoring</italic>, is mainly seen as a management activity, which leads to the authoring or formulation of the strategy. Within the frames of one particular context, that is, the strategy team, strategy is planned, articulated, and decided on by management team members, who act as senders and receivers of oral and written production of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492611430852">Taylor, Cooren, Giroux, &amp; Robichaud, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving to the next phase or situated context—the dissemination of the strategy that has been decided on to the rest of the organization—the strategy text becomes decontextualized from the original setting, and instead recontextualized in a new situated context, such as organization-wide information meetings or articles on the corporate intranet. We term this second phase the <italic>translation</italic> phase, as the purpose of the communicative behavior involved is for management actors to translate their interpretations of the strategy text in a way that makes sense to the rest of the organization by use of certain rhetorical strategies.</p>
<p>The interpretation processes occur in the last phase of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056492611430852">Figure 1</xref>, which we term the <italic>interpretation</italic> phase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski (2005)</xref> has previously proposed a rhetoric-in-context approach to illustrate some of the micropractices through which top managers influence employee commitment, the focus being on the context and on the internal consistency of the rhetorical practices used by top managers. Furthermore, in the case of commitment to multiple strategic goals, it has been demonstrated how top managers must emphasize different goals at different times and persuade organizational members that each of these goals is within their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski, 2005</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>A theoretical linkage between the second and third phase is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492611430852">Weick’s (1995)</xref> notion of sensemaking. According to Weick, an organization should be understood as being constantly enacted by its members. He terms this process <italic>sensemaking</italic>, that is, “a set of recipes for connecting episodes of social interaction in an orderly manner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492611430852">Weick, 1979</xref>, p. 45). Sensegiving is defined as “the process of attempting to influence the sense-making and meaning construction of others toward a preferred redefinition of organizational reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492611430852">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>, p. 442). In the translation phase, managers act as “sensegivers,” trying to influence the employee actors’ processes of interpretation and meaning creation. Hence, in this phase of the strategy communication process, the focus is on management’s translation of the strategy text into a recontextualized setting by use of persuasive or emotional rhetorical strategies with the intention of influencing the interpretation and understanding of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492611430852">Maitlis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492611430852">Weick (1995)</xref> and others have noted, these sensegiving or translation activities are ambiguous because owing to their interpretive, sensemaking processes and due to the process of recontextualization, the organizational members are capable of assigning every text different meanings and explanations as a way of furthering their individual priorities.</p>
<p>As all members in the various situated contexts enact the roles of senders and receivers, sensegivers and sensemakers, authors and translators, the different elements of authoring, translation, and interpretation not only occur as a linear progression within the various communication phases constituted by various contexts but also take place continuously within each situated context when the actors enter into dialogue and discussions. When doing so, the various strategic actors also voice their different positions with regard to the items being discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski et al., 2010</xref>), thus displaying multiple and sometimes contradictory understandings of the strategic context.</p>

<sec id="section6-1056492611430852">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The analysis is based on a single-case study of a medium-sized enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492611430852">Yin, 2009</xref>). The enterprise was founded in 1993 and has specialized since 1997 in the private-label production of pet foods, the primary market being the wild bird market. In 2008, the enterprise was divided into two separate Strategic Business Units (SBUs): the enterprise participating in this study (private label) and a separate enterprise (branded business) with limited synergies and collaborations. The company is organized in a functional structure headed by a CEO supported by an upper management group. Furthermore, the organization is constituted by a limited number of white-collar workers and a large majority of blue-collar and seasonal workers. The corporation is owned by a large capital fund, which has clearly voiced its intention to divest the SBUs if and when the price is right.</p>
<p>In the 12-month period in which the authors were in regular contact with the company at various stages of data collection (from first contact to actually collecting data and conducting research), the financial crisis became the major issue in the public media and in the formal and informal discussions of the management group itself. The degree to which the enterprise was affected by the crisis and hence how its market situation was affected due to the global recession became a recurrent topic within the upper management group in the period of data collection. Gradually, it became evident that the CEO and what we considered to be the “core” of the strategic management group (chief operating officer [COO], sales and marketing director [SMD], and HR director) had different opinions about the situation of the company. The CEO typically defended the market position, whereas the COO was more skeptical and critical of this stance. The primary interest of the CEO was how to prepare the company for sale, whereas the primary interest of the COO in many ways appeared to be more long term.</p>
<p>The organizational dissemination of this topic as dealt with in the development and implementation of the overall strategy, as well as the multiple interests of the strategic actors involved in relation to the strategic situation, is the focus in the current study.</p>
<p>Data collection was centered on the development of a new market strategy over a 6-month period (July-December, 2009). The empirical evidence for the project was collected by the use of a multisited fieldwork methodology, focusing on techniques for doing fieldwork on the move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611430852">Czarniawska, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611430852">Nadai &amp; Maeder, 2005</xref>). Data were collected in the form of participant observations, video recordings, audio recordings, and semistructured interviews. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1056492611430852">Figure 2</xref>, the various data sets have been sorted according to the three situated contexts that were established as crucial for the strategy process. In all, the data consist of observations, audio and video recordings from six management meetings, two organization-wide meetings between staff and upper management, 12 semistructured employee interviews, and finally written strategy documents, computer-mediated strategy documents, and PowerPoint slides.</p>

<p>Overview of strategy contexts and collected data sets</p>
<p>Participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492611430852">Spradley, 1980</xref>) was applied by the researchers to explore the sites of the study during the authoring and translation phases. During a period of 6 months, observations were made and notes were taken from management meetings, conversations, and informal gatherings. Thus, listening to managers’ conversations and discussions or talks in general, and conducting a thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611430852">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>), became an exploratory angle used to identify central themes relevant to strategizing, the focus in this article being on multivocality. Observations of all strategy team meetings during the 6-month period were made. The team consisted of the CEO, COO, HR manager, SMD, and financial director. The data used for exploring the multivocal nature of strategizing and its contribution to ambiguity in the authoring and translation phases consisted of observations, audio recordings, and PowerPoint slides. The exploration of the interpretations and sensemaking processes occurring when the strategy text was recontextualized into an employee setting was based on audio recordings from interviews conducted with 12 employees. The people interviewed were selected by the HR manager on the basis of criteria such as wage-earning and salaried employees, length of service, and area of responsibility (first line managers vs. employees). We did not interview the managers themselves, as the purpose of the study was to create an understanding of the employees’ interpretation of the management’s presentation of the market situation. However, our observations were presented at a 3-hr long meeting organized by the management group. The notes taken at this meeting are not part of the data used for this study.</p>

<title>Finding the Theme</title>
<p>To find the analytic focus, we initially searched for patterned regularities in the data, resulting in a description of the participants and an analysis of the management team meetings by themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492611430852">Klenke, 2008</xref>, p. 204). Thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611430852">Aronson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611430852">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>) was applied for the purpose of identifying specific themes running throughout the process of strategy making. Based on the criteria of time consumption and frequency, we coded central words related to the strategy process appearing in the data set, and categorized them subsequently into seven overall themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492611430852">Langley, Kakabadse, &amp; Swailes, 2007</xref>): market situation, corporate strategy, organizational identity, corporate image, business know-how among employees, communication strategy, and strategy terminology. The most prevalent theme in the data set in terms of time consumption and frequency was the market situation, which ran as a red thread in the organizational interactions throughout all three phases. The market situation category was made up of several subcategories: sales strategy, competitors, and general business climate. To illustrate how ambiguity arises through the multivocal nature of strategizing, this article focuses on the market situation theme across all three phases or situated contexts of the strategy process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056492611430852">Figure 1</xref>). In the following section, we will show how this analytical focus enables us to show how multiple discourses among strategic actors reveal divergent opinions and understandings of strategic goals over time.</p>

<sec id="section8-1056492611430852">
<title>Analytical Approach</title>
<p>Central to the analytical approach of the article are the productive, functional, interactive, and context-dependent qualities characterized by all language use, focusing on the study of social practices consisting of informants’ use of language within varying social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611430852">Van Maanen, 1979</xref>). As such, language is in no way considered a transparent or neutral system for the transfer of information, and therefore the analytical approach chosen is to focus on the words used by members of the organization to describe strategic occurrences and conditions.</p>
<p>As the data set consists of various modalities (naturally occurring talk, formal speeches, interviews, and strategy texts), the article in each case applies the analytical strategy most suitable for revealing the various multivocal discourses leading to goal ambiguity. For the analysis of the interactions between the strategy team members in the authoring phase, a search for patterned regularities in the data was made which produced an analysis of the management team meetings by themes and patterns. From the themes and patterns found, a narrative was constructed in an attempt to make sense of the context. As to the phases of translation and interpretation, a discourse analytical approach is taken as a way of showing the discursive creation of differing rhetorical positions by the organizational actors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1056492611430852">
<title>Situated Context 1: Authoring Strategy</title>
<p>In our study, the authoring phase is characterized by meetings of the upper management, where the members discuss the company’s situation in general, and subsequently more specifically discuss the precise formulation of the company strategy. Central aspects during the authoring phase concern the ways in which participants in the meetings present their understanding of the corporate situation to each other, and in particular the ways in which they make decisions about the precise formulation of the market situation in the strategy text. Although traditionally there has been a focus on how strategies are formulated as written strategy documents, little insight has been generated into the role of argumentation and discussion in the course of formulating the strategy document for the common understanding of the company strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611430852">Jarzabkowski &amp; Spee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611430852">Mantere &amp; Vaara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492611430852">Samra-Fredericks, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611430852">2010</xref>). Consequently, the focus of analysis during the authoring phase lies on the role of argumentation and discussion among the strategic actors involved and how this relates to questions of ambiguity.</p>
<p>In the following analysis, we will focus on how multiple strategic actors position themselves in the course of a strategy meeting in relation to the thematic focus, namely, the market strategy. The analysis will be based on one single incident that has been chosen because it deals with the prominent theme of market situation and price, and thus allows us to follow a red thread in the strategizing process across the various strategic contexts.</p>
<p>The following extract of a dialogue at a strategy meeting shows how the participants in the authoring phase differ on the interpretation of the market situation in the light of the current financial crisis and its impact on the company. The extract also shows how the strategic actors lack a mutual reflection about different understandings of the market situation. This lack of mutual reflection in relation to multiple viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611430852">Fløttum, 2010</xref>) opens up for multivocal versions of the company’s strategy, when the strategy text is recontextualized in the subsequent translation of the strategy to the organization.</p>
<p>In the excerpt below, the CEO’s positive perception of the company and control over the corporate situation becomes clear. This perception is manifested in positive evaluative verbs and verb constructions such as <italic>develop, continue to expand</italic>, and <italic>aim at developing</italic>:</p>
<sec id="section10-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 1</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>CEO: What we can do is to say that we believe that the market for our products will develop and continue to expand, and together with this description, we can say that next year, we aim at developing the market for our products for example in Britain, and here we need to make an effort.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The CEO’s view on the company is not imposed in any categorical way. However, through the use of the pronoun <italic>we</italic>, he in fact transforms his statement into a multivocal mix of what seems to be a mainstream top management voice with the voices of the management team, constructing a discursive consensus. The above “exchange” can be characterized as “creative unclearness.” For example, what is meant by expressions such as <italic>developing</italic> and <italic>an effort</italic>? And what does it mean that it is <italic>we</italic> who <italic>say that next year, we aim at developing the market</italic> and <italic>we</italic> who <italic>need to make an effort</italic>? Whose voices are actually included in this collective expression? Are all the voices of the management team members included? In an organizational context, all parties seek influence, and texts and talks are, therefore, produced through compromises until they are finally “stabilized,” that is, given a form and a content, which everybody can accept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611430852">Fløttum, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The COO’s and the SMD’s perception of the company contrasts in many ways with the CEO’s articulation. The perception of the COO is manifested by the use of rather negative evaluative verbs and verb constructions such as <italic>the figures do not lie, they are not positive</italic>, and <italic>if prices go down further</italic>:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 2</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>COO: The figures do not lie . . . trends are important, and they are not positive . . . if prices go down further (interrupted by CEO: we don’t know) . . . but if you look over the last three years, prices have gone down . . . discount chains will increase in number . . . considerably . . . supermarket chains have been hard hit and are now producing discount labels.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the perception of the SMD is manifested by use of the same type of negative evaluative verbs and verb constructions, for example, <italic>it only goes one way [downwards]</italic>:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 3</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>SMD: It only goes one way on our home market [downwards] . . . we need a breakthrough elsewhere. In this country the market is saturated . . . the market development takes place on the other side of the pond [Britain].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though the SMD aligns in the first part of the statement with the COO’s negative evaluation of the market situation, the SMD here positions himself in between the CEO and the COO, as he—in line with the CEO—also points to the opportunities in expanding in other countries like Britain. However, the COO’s and the SMD’s views on the company’s market situation are imposed in a more categorical way. Through the use of the pronouns <italic>you</italic> and <italic>we</italic>, they transform their statements into a multivocal mix of what seems to be an expert’s or a market analyst’s voice with the voices of the management team. Thus, they construct a discursive consensus between them as well as placing themselves in opposition to the CEO’s prior statement by using opposition markers like <italic>not</italic> (<italic>the figures do not lie</italic>) and <italic>but</italic> (see excerpt by COO) and negatively loaded terms like <italic>downwards</italic> and <italic>saturated</italic> (see excerpt by SMD).</p>
<p>Thus, the analysis of a single interactional event in the authoring phase has shown how this phase is a crucial point in strategy development to detect divergent interpretations of specific aspects of the strategy by different members of the upper management. In detail, the excerpts indicate the presence of different understandings of the market situation and its potentially influential factors (e.g., the financial crisis) by the CEO on one hand and the COO and SMD on the other. These divergent interpretations of the market strategy coincide with a substantial lack of argumentation and reasoning about the interpretation of the market situation. None of the members in the strategy meetings initiated a discussion or reflection about these divergent interpretations of the market strategy, which might have led to reaching consensus about the current market situation within the management group.</p>
<p>Consequently, in the final strategy text, the various standpoints regarding the company’s market situation have to be converged into a single, fixed voice. This convergence results in the following formulation in the sales strategy:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 4</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[The company’s] strategic goal for sales within the wild bird area is to protect our home market by offering tailor-made solutions to B2B customers and to increase the focus on Britain in order to sell part of the surplus capacity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the multiple understandings of the market situation as displayed in the above extracts from the management discussions are compressed into a single strategy text encompassing mainly the positive viewpoints of the CEO, which implies that the market will develop and expand further and that a specific market, namely, Britain, has a great potential.</p>
<p>Hence, a seemingly unambiguous understanding of the external context of the organization by strategic actors as displayed in the strategy text can arise despite prior divergent interpretations of the market situation in the upper management on which the actors have not reflected. Nevertheless, when these ostensibly monovocal texts become decontextualized from the current situation and recontextualized in a new setting like the organization-wide information meeting, multivocality might arise (again) due to the lack of strategic reasoning and reflection about divergent interpretations. Consequently, underlying ambiguous understandings of the company’s market situation in the upper management group are concealed, which might have an impact on aspects of multivocality in the translation phase, as we show in the following section.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1056492611430852">
<title>Situated Context 2: Translating Strategy</title>
<p>In the case study, an annual meeting for the entire organization—called a “kick-off meeting” in the company jargon—between upper management and the other organizational actors (middle management and employees) is used to convey or “translate” the strategic decisions made in relation to sales and marketing, the purpose being to inform employees about the current situation, the development plans and the strategic goals, to establish and encourage a dialogue between management and employees, and to generate common commitment and corporate spirit across different functions. At the kick-off meeting, the strategy team represented by the CEO, the COO, and the SMD present the sales strategy to the rest of the organization, including front and back office employees and middle management, totaling 120 persons. Supplemented by written strategy documents available on the corporate intranet, the meeting is the only organizational encounter in which the strategy that has been agreed on is communicated by the management to the rest of the organization. This way of approaching communication is very much in line with the traditional understanding of strategy communication as being instrumentally designed to achieve a particular result, thus assuming that the management’s discursive translation of the strategic decisions to the rest of the organization is aligned and homogeneous, in the sense that the argumentations and rationales behind strategy decisions are univocally reproduced by all the members of the management team.</p>
<p>However, entering a new multivocal context in which the strategy text is recontextualized into a different organizational setting, the strategic decisions are reinterpreted or challenged by other members of the organization through contrary actions or further discourse. The following analysis will show how the individual managers’ use of differing rhetorical strategies discursively creates an occurrence of strategic goal ambiguity.</p>
<p>Based on our analytical focus on market situation generated by the initial thematic analysis, the following excerpts of the kick-off meeting speeches by the CEO and the COO, respectively, are chosen to illustrate the discursive creation of goal ambiguity (analysis examples 2 and 3).</p>
<p>During his annual presentation of the state of the company, the CEO addresses the company’s market situation by reassuring his audience that the organization is unaffected by the global financial crisis:</p>
<sec id="section15-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 5</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>CEO: What is special about [our company]—we can see it from the financial figures—it’s not the financial crisis and things like that which affect us. It’s something completely different. It’s whether or not it snows during the winter. How many pets are there? Is the pet market developing satisfactorily or not? Because once you’ve got a dog or cat, then you’ll feed them regardless of the financial crisis. In the same way as you feed your children or your grandparents. And if you feed your birds out in the garden, then you continue to do that. Because it doesn’t amount to that much money. It’s only a small item in the account, and in return you get excellent entertainment. But the unique thing about [name of company] is that we are unaffected by the financial crisis, and I believe that our upward revision [of the budget] has shown this to be true. At our [year] Christmas meeting I also pointed out that for once we should be happy to work in a company like [name of company] because the crisis wouldn’t affect us very much. And it didn’t, which is nice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his utterance, the CEO expresses what can be assumed to be the common interest of all the organizational actors involved (not being hit by the financial crisis). Moreover, he discursively constructs a specific action, that is, lack of concern as to the financial crisis, which he believes is in the interests of the wider employee audience, thereby establishing a context in which the collective interest can be temporarily accommodated or prioritized (“I also pointed out that for once we should be happy to work in a company like [name of company] because the crisis wouldn’t affect us very much”). Subsequently, as can be seen from the excerpt below, the COO states the opposing point of view by attributing a narrow or specific meaning [“YES, [name of company] has definitely been hit by the global financial crisis”] to the situated, strategic implications of the financial crisis [a lot has happened to the British Pound], hereby asserting a supported context for his viewpoint [“many of the products we produce are sold in the UK”]:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 6</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>COO: YES, [name of company] has definitely been hit by the global financial crisis—but not as severely as other exporting corporations in [home country]. Many of the products we produce are sold in the UK, and a lot has happened to the British Pound.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, at the same time, he avoids mentioning—and thereby refrains from acknowledging—the CEO’s counter position, while at the same time avoiding a direct, rhetorical confrontation between the two actors. Communicative inconsistency seems to arise when the COO on his part narrowly defines the financial crisis in terms of currency fluctuations and exports, which enables him to assert his situated interests of operations and productivity while excluding other views of the financial crisis that might conflict with these interests, and when the CEO on his part attributes a narrow meaning to the same strategic context in ways that might be accepted as being in the interests of all actors to enable collective, positive actions (“we should be happy to work in a company like [ours]”). By drawing on the cognitive ambiguity of the financial crisis, the rhetoric of the CEO serves as a resource for the organizational actors to present a particular interpretation that enables them to put aside their different interests for the sake of a higher priority, that is, the cohesiveness and empowerment of the organization.</p>
<p>However, comparing the two rhetorical instances, ambiguity arises not only through talk by the use of differing rhetorical strategies and discursive actions but also through texts in the form of PowerPoint slides. In addition, the length of talk and text seems to play a pivotal role in the creation of the differing sensegiving positions of the two actors. The COO implies that currency variations have severely affected sales. Whereas the CEO spends only a few minutes explaining the absent effects and consequences of the financial crisis without mentioning this theme in his PowerPoint slides, the COO has seven slides and spends more than 10 minutes on this subject, explaining that due to severe changes in the strategic context such as fluctuations in the British Pound as a result of the global financial crisis, the company has lost major customers in the United Kingdom, a market on which the company is very dependent. Both actors step into the role as sensegivers, although they use very different rhetorical strategies. By spending very little time on the subject and not including the theme in his PowerPoint slides, the CEO communicatively downplays the importance of the financial crisis with regard to the corporate strategy, thereby creating a rhetorical position of insignificance and triteness. However, by spending a considerable amount of his speaking time on the financial crisis theme and supporting his statements with a considerable amount of text (PowerPoint slides), the COO discursively positions the topic as being of consequential and strategic importance to the organization and its members.</p>
<p>The multivocality seems to disclose the presence of diverging and perhaps even conflicting viewpoints, interests, or personal goals between the two actors, who occupy the highest and second highest positions in the organizational hierarchy. Thus, the ambiguous utterances might be the reflection of a major, inherent conflict between the two actors, which is displayed consciously or unconsciously in the discourses. Adopting an ethos-driven, rhetorical position, the CEO on one hand applies a narrative strategy by use of a family metaphor (pets, grandparents, children) which most of the audience can relate to. In this way, he tries to gain credibility and validity for his voice and thereby avoid organizational turmoil and preserve his privileged position as the organizational patriarch. On the other hand, the COO—the young and ambitious second in command, perhaps driven more by his personal goals and ambitions than by the overall corporate strategy—challenges this privileged position by using the occasion to create a greater voice for himself in the organization. By offering factual and sound argumentations supported by graphs and tables in the PowerPoint slides, he discursively creates a position for himself as being serious, competent, and professional.</p>
<p>In a different perspective, understanding ambiguity as strategic, the multivocality leading to ambiguity can also be interpreted as a way of promoting diversity and facilitating organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611430852">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>), thus viewing ambiguity as an organizational resource facilitating the cocreation of meaning between the various management and employee actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611430852">Davenport &amp; Leitch, 2005</xref>). The lack of a univocal position signaling to the rest of the organization how to make sense of the strategy facilitates a space for individual employee interpretations, which ultimately might lead to an empowerment of the actors.</p>

<title>Situated Context 3: Interpreting Strategy</title>
<p>After the kick-off meeting, the researchers conducted semistructured interviews with 12 employees (a sample of 10% of the total organizational members) to create an understanding of the subsequent interpretations and sensemaking processes occurring when the strategy text is recontextualized into an employee setting. The following interview examples have been chosen based on our thematic analysis to illustrate the employees’ interpretation of the management’s presentation of the market situation (see Situated Context 2).</p>
<p>As will be illustrated in the following, the analysis indicates the continued presence of multivocality as the different rhetorical actions of employees point to various kinds of strategy interpretation. The use of particular rhetorical positions contains strong implications for the causal explanations of these occurrences and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492611430852">Edwards &amp; Potter, 1992</xref>), so discourse analysis was applied for the analysis of the interview data, proposing a focus on the discursive function of language within the social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492611430852">Edwards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492611430852">Fairhurst, Cooren, &amp; Cahill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492611430852">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking its point of departure in the CEO’s rhetorical position of stability and noncrisis, the analysis focuses on the disparate, rhetorical positions such as acceptance, ambiguity, and rejection expressed in employee discourse as a way to expose the multivocality present in this third recontextualized setting. The analysis produced categories of responses from which types of discursive resources accounting for employee interpretations were inferred. In the following section, the article presents these discursive resources and provides illustrative quotations, allowing respondents to speak in their own words. The voices or positions are not claimed to be representative of all organizational actors, but merely exemplify the multiple, rhetorical positions emerging among different employees when they recontextualize the strategy into their own personal setting.</p>
<sec id="section18-1056492611430852">
<title>Rhetorical Position of Acceptance</title>
<p>One voice representing a small group of employees expresses acceptance of the CEO’s translation of the strategic reality, revealing a sense of security and trust in the management and the corporate strategic situation:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 7</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>“What was your impression of the company when you left the kick-off meeting? Something was said about the financial crisis . . . ”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Employee 1:</speaker>
<p>“Oh well . . . the financial crisis is passing. It’s a sound company.”</p>
</speech>
<p>Employee 1, a nonsalaried member of staff working on the production line, attaches little importance to the strategic and financial situation of the company and supports the discursive position of the CEO (the organization is unaffected by the global economic crisis). Several times during the interviews, Employee 1 points to the fact that he is not interested in the corporate strategy and plans, and therefore opts to support the CEO as he finds him “trustworthy and well-articulated.” The rhetoric used by the CEO serves as a discursive resource for this group of employees by allowing them to support a translation of the market situation without forcing them to sacrifice their own personal interests. Thus, this organizational voice ignores the goal ambiguity created in the translation phase, and accepts the ethos-driven sensegiving position of the CEO. One reason for this acceptance could be a discursive attempt to reject any sign of corporate instability or uncertainty, which could potentially lead to organizational changes or restructurings. Another explanation for this position might be the organizational position of the CEO, who the employee utterance describes as “trustworthy and well articulated,” indicating that the voice of the CEO has more validity and credibility and thereby rejecting alternative voices or positions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1056492611430852">
<title>Rhetorical Position of Ambiguity</title>
<p>Unlike the rhetorical position above, another voice represented by Employee 2—a nonsalaried member of staff working in the stockroom—creates a rhetorical position of ambiguity or confusion as he discursively reflects on the strategic initiatives presented by the strategy team members:</p>
<sec id="section21-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 8</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Employee 2: Well, I thought, “so our company division will be sold, and the other division will also be demerged,” and my first thought was “wonder if we will have permanent employment when someone else takes over.” That was my first thought. Afterwards, I talked to the warehouse manager, who has been with the company for 15 years, and he was calm and confident. So I thought, “oh well, it’s going to be all right.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Employee 2 expresses a position of uncertainty or ambiguity as to whether the external threats will result in a potential risk of being downsized. This feeling of uncertainty is not remedied by the management as they do not address this issue during the meeting, thereby failing to translate the consequences of such a demerger strategy from the point of view of the employees. The silence experienced in terms of the consequences of the external, strategic context may be a way for managers to try to avoid the creation of anxiety and uncertainty. However, silence in itself can also constitute an independent “voice” in that it adds to the multivocality and thereby the perceived ambiguity as to the strategic goals. Nevertheless, the multivocality present in the second phase seems to make room for individual interpretation by and empowerment of the employee, which ultimately leads to a self-reassuring strategy (“oh well, it’s going to be all right”).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1056492611430852">
<title>Rhetorical Position of Rejection</title>
<p>The most dominant voice in the interpretation phase is the rhetorical position of rejection. A large number of employees construct negative discursive positions in relation to the consequences of the global financial crisis, using a wavering discourse between a cognitive understanding of the financial situation of the capital fund owners and an emotional insecurity. This position is exemplified in the employee statement below:</p>
<sec id="section23-1056492611430852">
<title>Analysis Example 9</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Employee 3: In times like these, when you hear that venture capital funds are generally facing difficulties, and the capital base is no longer what it used to be, they can be forced into taking certain unexpected and unfavorable steps [such as a demerger]. This means that in reality we can suddenly be facing new owners, who might be a large player in the market. And who might want to gain considerable synergies by moving purchasing to for instance Germany, as their purchasing department is located there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Employee 3, who is employed as an office worker in the purchasing department, gives voice to his interpretations of the consequences of the financial crisis. By relating the consequences of the crisis to the situation of the owners (a venture capital fund) and their difficulties in gaining access to working capital, the employee expresses and interprets the corporate strategic situation in a much more subtle way than the management, and thereby shows that the way the management discursively marginalizes or limits the crisis during the translation phase as being solely of relevance to the British Pound or being as mundane as the weather forecast is overly simplified and of little relevance when recontextualized into and situated within an employee context. On the contrary, among them, the crisis is interpreted in relation to their own personal context: This employee fears that the owners—as a result of the lack of access to financial funds due to the global crisis—will be forced by external partners to quickly and precipitately dispose of the company, and consequently the employee sees a risk of losing his job. This concern is not voiced during the translation phase, and as mentioned above the silence can be seen as increasing the multivocality, allowing for independent employee interpretations, and hence positioning the employee in rhetorical opposition to the management.</p>
<p>The excerpt thus shows how the employee’s understanding of the world, especially the general lack of access to financial funds, influences how he or she perceives the upper management and not the other way around. It is not the information from the top management team that influences the employee’s understanding of the greater world, which was the articulated intention of the kick-off meeting, that is, the translation phase. Hence, the employee activates his interpretive schemes, understood as the fundamental assumptions that determine the way he conceives of the organization and its environmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611430852">Balogun &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611430852">Bartunek, 1984</xref>), which affect how he responds to the management’s strategic messages. As such, schemata can reduce ambiguity if the mental models held by the employee correspond with those held and communicated by the managers. However, schemata can also potentially enhance equivocality if the mental models do not correspond with one another. Without a shared understanding and commonality between the different individuals’ schemata, that is, employee and management, an enacted reality at the organizational level, which leads to a coordinated activity, is hindered.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>On the basis of a single strategic theme (market situation), which has been followed across various strategic actors and situated contexts over time, the article shows how ambiguity can arise due to multivocality and recontextualization through the presence of multiple strategic actors within and across different strategizing activities.</p>
<p>Specifically, it becomes apparent in the authoring phase that strategic decisions are locally occasioned through communicative interactions resulting in multivocality, which turns out to be more decisive in terms of the final strategy formulation than knowledge-based argumentation and cognitive rationality. Thus, distanciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492611430852">Ricoeur, 1981</xref>) in which the multivocal meaning of talk is inscribed into the final monovocal strategy document, that is, strategy team meetings, is subject to a specific situated context in which discursive positions lead up to the final strategy formulation. During the distanciation process, the intentionality of the different actor voices becomes detached from the meaning expressed in the strategy text, resulting in a decontextualized, monovocal, and consensual strategy paper.</p>
<p>However, as can be seen from the study of the translation phase, in which the strategy paper is recontextualized into a new situated context, the text still possesses an inherent multivocality which allows it to be translated or communicated in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611430852">Spee &amp; Jarzabkowski, 2011</xref>), and which makes it impossible to talk about strategy text as an atemporal, neutral object which can be communicated monovocally. Constituted by the communicative actions of the organizational actors, the multivocality of the strategy text invariably reoccurs the minute it is embedded into a new situated context, that is, the organization-wide meeting, where the management group presenting the strategy that has been decided on interprets the text in multiple ways due to each management team members’ current, contextually embedded situation. In the phase of translating the strategy, this article shows how ambiguity arises not only through talk by the use of differing rhetorical strategies and discursive actions but also through texts in the form of PowerPoint slides and through the length of time dedicated to specific topics in the form of talk and text. Thus, as far as strategizing is concerned, the article indicates how a lack of argumentation and failure to create mutual awareness and understanding among the actors in the phase of strategy authoring, thereby disregarding the process of sensemaking and sensegiving, can result in ambiguous management translations of the strategic content during the translation phase. Ambiguity arises when managers recontextualize the strategy text in relation to their own personal setting to make sense of the text. These translation discrepancies are revealed through their use of ambiguous discourse and opposing rhetorical positions, illustrating how communication becomes constitutive of the strategy text.</p>
<p>Moreover, the article shows how the process of recontextualization is repeated when moving from the management’s translation of the text, that is, Situated Context 2, to the interpretation of the strategy paper by the remaining organizational members, that is, Situated Context 3. In the phase of interpreting the strategy, three main rhetorical positions are identified among the employees: acceptance, ambiguity, and rejection. These rhetorical positions represent the multivocal interpretations or sensemakings of the employees interviewed, illustrating once again the ambiguous understandings emerging on the basis of the situated context and priorities of each individual. Grounded in their own personal context, some employees might choose to ignore the threat of the financial crisis, preferring to express their interpretation of the strategy in terms of a positive rhetorical position instead. Others might be less averse to risk due to personal characteristics such as a sense of empowerment, self-confidence, or family situation, so these individuals may be more willing to question the various rhetorical positions of the management by either rejecting their translations or accepting the ambiguity created throughout the communication process. Consequently, the interpretation phase, in which the members of the organization perceive and interpret the management’s strategic discourse, is characterized by discursively articulated positions of acceptance, ambiguity, disorientation, and contradictions—reactions which ultimately might affect the strategy implementation change processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611430852">Lüscher &amp; Lewis, 2008</xref>). Thus, the article illustrates how the communicative behavior of organizational actors through the various phases of strategizing are dependent on and influenced by the specific situated context, resulting in a multivocal interpretation of strategy.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>The article set out to study the ambiguous nature of strategizing by applying the lens of organizational communication. Our main research questions addressed how ambiguity arises during the various phases of strategizing, and in particular <italic>what activities and social practices are related to ambiguity</italic> and <italic>what is the role of these activities and social practices during the various strategizing phases</italic>. The analysis contributes to the understanding of ambiguity as an inherent organizational dimension which emerges through communication. By the use of the communicative concepts of contextualization and multivocality, the article indicates how the process of decontextualization and recontextualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492611430852">Ricoeur, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611430852">Spee &amp; Jarzabkowski, 2011</xref>) on one hand, and mono- and multivocality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611430852">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611430852">Goffman, 1981</xref>) on the other are interrelated. By formulating the strategic goals in a written document or on PowerPoint slides, or by the CEO verbally translating the strategy for the employees in an organization-wide meeting, the goal of decontextualization is continuously underlined as a way of minimizing multivocality and, thus, ambiguity. However, the process of decontextualization goes hand in hand with the initiation of a process of recontextualization in that a decontextualized strategy document cannot be interpreted and made sense of without the process of recontextualization. As such, there seems to be a permanent move between mono- and multivocality in the course of strategizing activities. Accordingly, the inherent elements of contextual embeddedness and interaction prevalent in all communicative encounters inhibit the continued presence of monovocality because the organizational actors possess the ability to interpret the text in multiple ways leading inevitably to the creation of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the article—showing the dynamics and complexity of these ongoing sensegiving and sensemaking and de- and recontextualization processes in strategizing—advocates an understanding of ambiguity as a continuously emerging, inherent part of strategizing activities. Thus, the article supports the view that ambiguity is something that is innate to strategizing. This view takes into account the close relationship between sensegiving and sensemaking processes on one hand and the multiple and varying actors involved in the strategizing process on the other. In addition, it allows a view of ambiguity as evolving and devolving over time within and across various situated contexts. As such, the study implies an understanding of ambiguity as a crucial feature of strategizing rather than something that can be used intentionally or even avoided by upper management to facilitate a strategy process.</p>
<p>Moreover, the study has implications for the notion of a unified, neutral corporate strategy in the form of a fixed paper document. As the study shows, corporate strategies, like any other organizational document, are created through interaction. Corporate documents are not actor-free entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611430852">Cooren et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, they are not even relevant until people relate to them, interpret them, and translate them. As soon as actors (i.e., senders and receivers) become involved, a complex process of encoding and decoding takes place based on the individual frameworks of the actors concerned. In line with the linguistic turn in strategy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611430852">Vaara, 2010</xref>), the article thus advocates an understanding of organizational communication as being constitutive of the strategy itself. The decontextualized strategy text has no attributed meaning until it is introduced in talk. As soon as the text is recontextualized and thus made available to multiple actors and their individual sensemaking processes, multivocality evolves (again). Taking this recurrent process seriously means being critical of the notion of monovocality, as in strategizing activities one voice only seems to exist at the borders of different situated contexts at a specific moment of time in an interaction-free space. However, as strategizing entails a process view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492611430852">Langley, 2007</xref>), this specific moment of time does not last, but is instead transferred into a sensemaking process enabling several voices to arise.</p>
<p>Our article proposes a division of the strategy process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611430852">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492611430852">Langley, 2007</xref>) into three situated contexts: authoring, translation, and interpretation. This division into contextual phases is based on a communicative view of the strategy process by identifying specific actors in relation to specific communicative strategy activities. In the authoring phase, the strategy team members consisting of upper management are engaged in formulating the message in terms of writing the strategy text; in the translation phase, strategy team members engage in the dissemination of the strategy message in terms of communicating the corporate strategy to various internal stakeholders; and finally, in the interpretation phase, employees receive the message and engage in making sense of the strategy communication. Such a division into strategy phases might imply a linear development in terms of strategic ambiguity, where strategic ambiguity arises as a linear outcome of these phases. However, our study indicates that ambiguity or equivocality emerges as a result of contextually embedded, multivocal interactions rather than being a final product of the strategy process. Moreover, ambiguity not only arises within each situated context but also occurs across these boundaries through the interplay of various actors and activities. So even though the division between situated context phases proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056492611430852">Figure 1</xref> is suitable for identifying different communicative stages in the strategizing process, it is worthwhile bearing in mind that such a model inherently contains the risk of oversimplifying the complexities and emergent dynamics of ambiguity in strategizing.</p>
<p>The current study focuses on one specific theme (the market situation) across different phases of strategy work involving a variety of different strategic actors. For future studies of strategy communication processes focusing on the emergence of ambiguity in the interplay of different situated contexts and actors, it might be worthwhile investigating in detail the role of specific strategic actors across different strategizing activities and how their communication contributes to, enhances, or minimizes the emergence of ambiguity.</p>
